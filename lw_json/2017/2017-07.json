    "htmlBody": "<p><strong>This post will not teach you the models here.</strong>&nbsp; This post is a summary of the models that I carry in my head. &nbsp;I have written most of the descriptions without looking them up (See <a href=\"http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/\">Feynman notebook method</a>). &nbsp;If you have read a book on every one of these points they will make sense, <em>as if you were shaking hands with an old acquaintance</em>. &nbsp;If you are seeing them for the first time, they won't make very much sense or they will feel like a surface trivial truth.</p>\n<p>I can't make you read all the books but maybe I can offer you that the answer to social problems is surprisingly simple. &nbsp;After reading enough books you start to see the overlap and realise they often are trying to talk about the same thing. &nbsp;(i.e. NVC + Gottman go together well).</p>\n<p>In fact if you were several independent dragon hunters trying to model an invisible beast and all of various people's homemade sensors kept going \"ping\" at similar events you would probably start to agree you were chasing the same monster. &nbsp;Models should start to agree when they are talking about the same thing. &nbsp;The variety of models should make it easier for different minds to connect to different parts of the answer.</p>\n<p><em>All models are wrong, some models are useful.</em> &nbsp;Try to look at where the models converge. &nbsp;That's where I find the truth.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>1. The book <a href=\"https://booko.info/9780071446525/Crucial-Confrontations\">Crucial Confrontations</a></strong> - Kerry Patterson</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Crucial_Conversations:_Tools_for_Talking_When_Stakes_are_High\">http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Crucial_Conversations:_Tools_for_Talking_When_Stakes_are_High</a><br /> <em>(without explaining how)</em> If you can navigate to a place of safety in a conversation you can say pretty much anything. &nbsp;Which is not to say \"here is how to be a jerk\" but if you know something is going to come across negative you can first make sure to be in a positive/agreeable/supportive conversation before raising the hard thing.</p>\n<p>In the middle of a yelling match is maybe not the best time to bring up something that has bugged you for years. &nbsp;However a few sentences about growth mindset, supporting people being a better person and trying to help (<strong>and getting a feel that the person is ready to hear the thing</strong>) and you could tell anyone they are a lazy bum who needs to shape up or ship out.</p>\n<p><strong>The conversation needs to be safe.</strong>&nbsp; For example - \"I want to help you as a person and I know how hard it can be to get feedback from other people and I want to make you into a better person. &nbsp;I have an idea for how you might like to improve. &nbsp;Before I tell you I want to reassure you that even though this might come across abrasive I want to help you grow and be better in the future...\"</p>\n<p>(some people will be easier than others to navigate a safe conversation and that's where there are no hard and fast rules for how to do this. &nbsp;Go with your gut)</p>\n<p>The crux of this model is \"have a model of the other person\" [15]</p>\n<h2><strong>2. The partner book \"<a href=\"https://booko.info/9780143118442/Difficult-Conversations\">Difficult conversations</a>\"</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.peace.ca/difficultconversations.pdf\">http://www.peace.ca/difficultconversations.pdf</a></p>\n<p>There are 4 types of difficult conversations around communicating a decision:<br /> <strong>a</strong>. <strong>Consultation</strong> (Bob asks Alice for ideas for the decision he is going to make on his own)<br /> <strong>b</strong>. <strong>Collaboration</strong> (Bob and Alice make a decision together)<br /> <strong>c</strong>. <strong>Declaration</strong> (Bob tells alice the decision he has made)<br /> <strong>d</strong>. <strong>Delegation</strong> (Bob tells alice to make the decision)</p>\n<p>As someone's boss you may sometimes have to pass on bad news in the form of a declaration. &nbsp;It's up to you which conversation this is going to be but being clear about <strong>what conversation this is</strong> will be helpful to a person to understand their place in responding or interacting with you. &nbsp;It becomes difficult where there is a misunderstanding about what is going on.</p>\n<p>It's also important when you are on the receiving end to be on the same page about what conversation this is. &nbsp;(you don't want to be negotiating in a collaborative manner when they are trying to give you a declaration of their decision, and the same when you are leading the conversation).</p>\n<p>Among other details in the book.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Getting the 3rd story.</strong></h2>\n<p>linking back to - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error</a><br /> (from one of those books [1] or [2])</p>\n<p>Bob knows what happened from his perspective and Alice knows her version of events. &nbsp;Where there is a disagreement of what follows from different versions of events it is possible to construct a 3rd person story. &nbsp;This may be hard to do when you are involved and an actual 3rd person can help but is not crucial in constructing the story. &nbsp;If you can step outside of your own story and construct a 3rd version together this can resolve misunderstandings.<br /> Something like; \"I thought you said we should meet here, even though I said I wanted ice-cream, you thought that meant we should meet at the ice-cream place next door and we each waited 30mins for the other one to turn up to where we were.\". &nbsp;By constructing a 3rd story it's possible that no one was at fault. &nbsp;It's also possible that it can become clear what went wrong and how to learn from that or what can be done differently.</p>\n<p>(cue business management <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-action_review\">After-Action-Review</a> activities {what did we do well, what could we have done better, what would we do differently}, now <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis\">SWOT</a>)</p>\n<h2><strong>4. The <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/blog/\">Gottman Institute</a> research (and <a href=\"https://booko.info/9780553447712/The-7-Principles-for-Making-Marriage-Work-A-Practical-Guide-from-the-Country-s-Foremost-Relationship-Expert\">book</a>)</strong></h2>\n<p>The 4 horsemen of divorce (but just because that's what the research is about doesn't mean we can't apply it elsewhere) (yes Gottman is limited in value because of bad use of statistics we can't be sure the models are accurate, I still find it's a good model at explaining things).</p>\n<p>Don't do these things. &nbsp;When you see these things, recognise them for what they are and don't engage with them. &nbsp;If necessary acknowledge people are feeling certain angry feelings and let them get them out (not everyone can efficiently drop how they are feeling and get on with talking about it, especially not without practice).</p>\n<p>Each one has an antidote, usually in the form of an attitude or strategy that can leave you thinking about the same thing differently and relating to it differently.</p>\n<p><strong>I. Criticism<br /> </strong>I would rename to \"inherent criticism\". &nbsp;Comes in the form of an inherent descriptor like, \"you are a lazy person\", \"you always run late\". &nbsp;\"you are the type of person who forgets my birthday\"[see 5]. &nbsp;Try to replace inherent criticism with *[6] concrete descriptions of actions.</p>\n<p>To counter this - try descriptions like [6a]: &nbsp;\"I can see you are sitting on the couch right now and I would like you to offer help when you can see me cleaning\". &nbsp;\"yesterday I saw you try to do a few extra tasks and that caused us to run late\", \"you forgot my birthday last year\".</p>\n<p>The important thing about the change here is that an inherent label comes in the form of an unchangeable belief. &nbsp;It's equivalent to saying, \"you are a tall person\". &nbsp;It's fixed in time, space and attitude. &nbsp;You don't want to give someone a fixed negative trait. &nbsp;Not in your head and especially not out of your head either to that person or to anyone else. &nbsp;You set someone up for failure if you do. &nbsp;As soon as someone is \"<em>the lazy on</em>e\" you give them the ticket to \"<em>always be lazy</em>\" and if they are half smart they will probably take it. &nbsp;Besides - you don't change people's actions by using criticism. &nbsp;You maybe relieve some frustration but then you have created some open frustration and the problem still exists.</p>\n<p><strong>II. Defensiveness</strong><br /> Probably easiest to understand by the description of <em>reactive defensiveness</em>. &nbsp;It usually comes as a reaction to an accusation. &nbsp;If two people are yelling, chances are neither is listening. &nbsp;In response to \"you are always making us run late\", a defensive reaction would be, \"I make us run late because you always stress me out\".</p>\n<p>It does two things:<br /> 1. claim to not be responsible<br /> 2. make a second accusation (can be irrelevant to the subject at hand).</p>\n<p>First of all if you are bringing up <a href=\"http://bearlamp.com.au/working-with-multiple-problems-at-once/\">several problems at once</a> you are going to confuse matters. &nbsp;Try to deal with one problem at a time. &nbsp;It doesn't really matter which so long as you are not yelling about being late while they are yelling about you forgetting the laundry. (and so long as you deal with all the problems)</p>\n<p>The second part is that you can't shift blame. &nbsp;Absorbing some blame does not make you a bad person. &nbsp;Nor does it make you inherently terrible. &nbsp;You can have both done a wrong thing and not be a bad person. &nbsp;After all you had your reasons for doing what you did.</p>\n<p>The antidote to defensiveness is to acknowledge [6] what they have said and move forward without reacting.</p>\n<p>III. <strong>Contempt</strong><br /> This is about an internal state as much as an external state. &nbsp;Contempt is about the story we tell ourselves about the other person (see NVC) and is a state of negative intent. &nbsp;I hold you contemptuously. &nbsp;For example, \"a good person would not run late\", \"if you were smarter you would just...\", \"I work so hard on this relationship and you just...\", Some examples of displays of contempt include when a person uses sarcasm, cynicism, name-calling, eye-rolling, sneering, mockery, and hostile humour [see 7 - emotional intelligence about physiological events]. &nbsp;This overlaps with Inherent criticism and makes more sense with [6 NVC].<br /> Contempt has two antidotes, Teacher mindset and curiosity. &nbsp;Teacher mindset can change an attitude of, \"He should know what he did wrong\" to, \"I need to explain to him how to do it right\". &nbsp;Curiosity [See NVC, also [3] the 3rd story] can take you to a place of trying to understand what is going on and take you away from the place of the stories we tell ourselves.[10]</p>\n<p>IV. <strong>Stonewalling</strong><br /> This is a physiological state of going silent. &nbsp;It is used when you are being lectured (for example) and you go silent, possibly start thinking about everything else while you wait for someone to finish. &nbsp;It's like holding your breath when you go underwater, waiting for it to pass. &nbsp;If you are doing this what you need to do is take a break from whatever is going on and do something different, for example go for a walk and calm down.<br /> There was a classic joke, they asked a 110 year old why he lived so long and he said, every time I got into an argument with my wife I used to go for a walk. &nbsp;I went on a lot of walks in my life.<br /> Because this is a physiological state it's so easy to fix so long as you remember to pay attention to your internal state [see NVC what is most alive in you, and 11. what does that look like in practice]</p>\n<h2><strong>5. <a href=\"https://booko.info/9780091906351/How-to-Win-Friends-and-Influence-People\">How to win friends and influence people</a></strong></h2>\n<p>I always recommend this book to people starting the journey because it's a great place to start. &nbsp;These days I have better models but when I didn't know anything this was a place to begin. &nbsp;Most of my models are now more complicated applications of the ideas initially presented. &nbsp;You still need weak models before replacing them with more complicated ones which are more accurate.<br /> The principles and (in brackets) what has superseded them for me:</p>\n<p><em>BECOME A FRIENDLIER PERSON<br /> </em><em>1. Don't criticize, condemn or complain.</em> (There are places and methods to do this. &nbsp;Criticism can be done as [1] from a place of safety or in [4] from a teacher/mentor/growth mindset. &nbsp;Definitely don't do it from a place of criticism. &nbsp;Condemnation is more about [10] and is an inherent trait. &nbsp;Progress doesn't usually happen when we use inherent traits, From Saul Alinsky's <em>rules for radicals</em> - don't complain unless you have the right answer - \"I have a problem and you have to figure out how to fix it for me\" is not a good way to get your problem solved.)<br /> <em>2. Give honest, sincere appreciation.</em> (so long as you are doing this out of the goodness of your heart good. &nbsp;If you are using it for manipulation you can just not bother. &nbsp;NVC supersedes this. &nbsp;By keeping track of what is most alive in you, you can do better than this)<br /> <em>3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.</em> (Work out what people want, work out how to get both your needs met - superceded by NVC.)<br /> <em>4. Become genuinely interested in other people.</em> (depends what for. &nbsp;Don't bother if you don't want to. &nbsp;That would not be genuine. &nbsp;You need to find the genuine interest inside yourself first.)<br /> <em>5. Smile.</em> (um. &nbsp;Hard to disagree with but a default smiling state is a good one to cultivate - from [7] physiological states are linked two ways. &nbsp;Smiling will make you happy just as being happy will make you smile)<br /> <em>6. Remember that a person's name is to that person the most important sound in any language.</em> (I don't know about most important but I would say that anyone can remember names with practice. &nbsp;<a href=\"http://bearlamp.com.au/list-of-techniques-to-help-you-remember-names/\">http://bearlamp.com.au/list-of-techniques-to-help-you-remember-names/</a>)</p>\n<p><em>7. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.</em> (NVC - pay attention to what is most alive in you when you do. Make sure you know about the spectrum of )<br /> 8. <em>Talk in terms of the other person's interest</em>. (Sure why not. &nbsp;Sales are a lot easier when you are selling what people want.<em>&nbsp;</em>See [15] and NVC to supersede how and why this works)<br /> <em>9. Make the other person feel important - and do so sincerely.</em> (I guess? &nbsp;I don't do this actively.)<br /> 10 The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. ([9] if you are in an argument something already went wrong)<br /> <em>WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING</em><br /> <em>11. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, \"You're wrong.\"</em> (NVC, instead of saying no, say what gets in the way. &nbsp;\"here is evidence that says otherwise\" can be better than \"durr WRONGGG\" but I have seen people use \"you are wrong\" perfectly fine.)<br /> <em>12. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.</em> (hard to disagree with, but holding onto grudges and guity things is not useful. &nbsp;[4] gottman talks about defensiveness, avoid defensiveness and acknowledge the fact that someone feels you are at fault first. &nbsp;It will satisfy the psychological need arising in an offended person [14])<br /> <em>13. Begin in a friendly way.</em> (as opposed to what? &nbsp;Sure I guess.)<br /> <em>14. Get the other person saying, \"Yes, yes\" immediately.</em> (Yes ladders are important and valuable. &nbsp;You see bits of this creeping into Gottman [4], NVC [6], The game [13] and other practices but no one as yet explains it as well as I would like. &nbsp;The game probably has the best commentary on it, short of business books that escape my memory right now)<br /> <em>15. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.</em> (not really important who talks so long as you are on the same page and in agreement. &nbsp;If you want someone else to do the emotional labour [15] for you, then you can let them. &nbsp;If you want to do it for them you can. &nbsp;Implications of EL are not yet clear to me in full. &nbsp;Some places it will be good to do EL for people, other places they need to do it for themselves to feel ownership of the problems and solutions)<br /> <em>16. Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.</em> (sure I guess. &nbsp;A good idea is it's own champion. &nbsp;Ideas that are obviously better will win out. &nbsp;You can't make a turd beat a diamond but you can employ tricks to polish certain diamonds over others. &nbsp;This technique is battling over little bits. &nbsp;can be useful but I would not rely on it alone.)<br /> <em>17. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.</em> (NVC [6] and EL [15] should help do that better. &nbsp;Imagining that you are that person in a way that is hard to impart in words because it's about having the experience of being that other person (see http://bearlamp.com.au/zen-koans/) and not \"just thinking about it\". needs a longer description and is an effective technique.)<br /> <em>18. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.</em> (NVC supercedes. &nbsp;Everyone has basic feelings and needs that you can understand, like the need for safety)<br /> <em>19. Appeal to the nobler motives.</em> (giving people a reputation to live up to is a valuable technique that I would say only works for qualified people - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_facilitation but does not work so well if you put pressure on people who are less skilled. &nbsp;Probably relates to the things going through our head at the time - see also book - the inner game of tennis, NVC, judgement model)<br /> <em>20. Dramatize your ideas.</em> (I don't know? &nbsp;Try it. &nbsp;It could work. &nbsp;will not work by virtue of it being a good model of things, might work by luck/breaking people out of their habits)<br /> <em>BE A LEADER</em><br /> <em>21. Throw down a challenge.</em> (can work if people are willing to rise to a challenge can work against you and create cognitive dissonance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance if people are not willing. &nbsp;Need more information to make it work)<br /> <em>22. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.</em> (Don't give people a shit sandwich - slices of compliments surrounding shit. &nbsp;That's not respectful of them. &nbsp;Instead using [1] navigate to a place of safety to talk about things)<br /> <em>23. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.</em> (there are correct and incorrect ways to do this. &nbsp;You can be passive agressive about it. &nbsp;I don't see a problem with being blunt - in private, in safe conversations [1] - about what is going on)<br /> <em>24. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.</em> (don't yammer on, but it can help to connect you and them and the problem. &nbsp;NVC would be better than just this)<br /> <em>25. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.</em> (socratic method, can be a drain, need more advanced skills and [15] EL to know if this is appropriate )<br /> <em>26. Let the other person save face.</em> (better described in http://lesswrong.com/lw/o4/leave_a_line_of_retreat/ I agree with this, but [15] EL might describe it better)<br /> <em>27. Praise the slightest and every improvement. Be \"lavish in your praise.\"</em> (NVC disagrees, praise only what is relevant, true and valid. &nbsp;Be a teacher [4] but deliver praise when praise is due.)<br /> <em>28. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.</em> (This is 19/26 again. &nbsp;I agree with it. &nbsp;I could use it more)<br /> <em>29. Use encouragement.

(expect to find it funnier than you did the first time)<br /> <strong>b.</strong> furrow your brow while reading the first paragraph of this page again (expect to either feel confused or the cognitive dissonance version if you know it very well - \"I know this too well\")<br /> The two way path means that you can feel better about emotional pain by taking a paracetamol, but more specifically, if you take a break from a situation and come back to it the emotions might have improved. &nbsp;This can include getting a glass of water, going for a walk, getting some fresh air. &nbsp;And for more complicated decisions - sleeping on it (among other things).</p>\n<p>Everyone can train emotional intelligence, they need practice. &nbsp;This includes holding an understanding of your own states as well as being able to notice emotional states in other people.</p>\n<p>I had an ex who had particularly visible physiological states, it was a very valuable experience to me to see the state changes and it really trained my guessing mind to be able to notice changes. &nbsp;These days I can usually see when things change but I can't always pick the emotion that has come up. &nbsp;This is where NVC and curiosity become valuable (also circling).</p>\n<p>EI is particularly important when it is particularly deficient. &nbsp;In the book it talks about anger as a state that (to an untrained person) can cause a reaction before someone knows that they were angry. &nbsp;Make sure to fix that first before moving to higher levels of emotional management.</p>\n<h2><strong>8. model of arguments<br /> </strong><a href=\"http://bearlamp.com.au/a-model-of-arguments/\">http://bearlamp.com.au/a-model-of-arguments/</a></h2>\n<p>(see also NVC)</p>\n<p>If you view disagreements or misunderstandings as a venn diagram of what you know and what the other person knows. &nbsp;You have full rights to make comment on anything you know but only have limited rights to make comment on what the other person knows. &nbsp;Instead you can comment on the information they have given you. &nbsp;\"you said 'X', I know Y about what you said 'X'\". &nbsp;To say X is wrong, is not going to yield progress. &nbsp;Instead to acknowledge that they described 'X' and their description does not make sense to me, or leaves me feeling confused [6].</p>\n<h2><strong>9. The argument started earlier</strong></h2>\n<p>From Gavin: \"If I ever find myself in a position of saying - well officer, let me explain what happened...\", Something already went wrong well and truly before now.<br /> When you start the journey you will start getting to \"Aha\" moments about where arguments start. &nbsp;As you get more and more experience you realise the argument started well and truly earlier than you ever first realised. &nbsp;When you get really good at it, you can stop and say [6] \"I am confused\" &nbsp;well and truly before a yelling match.</p>\n<h2><strong>10. The stories we tell ourselves</strong></h2>\n<p>NVC based, Judgement model, There is a lot of people who are thinking in stories. &nbsp;Related - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error</a>.</p>\n<p>Their entire existence is the story and narrative they tell about themselves (see also Jordan Peterson - maps of meaning). &nbsp;The constant narrative about how \"the world hates me\" is going to give you a particular world experience compared to the constant narrative, \"I am a lucky person\". &nbsp;You see this in gamblers who are searching for \"the prevailing wind\" or \"winning streaks\".</p>\n<p>You also see this in social pressure - when people think and get fixated on, \"what will people think of me?\", sometimes the social pressure does not even have to be there to cause the thoughts and the actions that would be \"social pressure\".<br /> Several models of thinking advocate removing the story telling in your head to relieve the psychological pain. &nbsp;See books, \"search inside yourself\", NVC, Gateless gatecrashers, some information in the <a href=\"http://nonsymbolic.org/PNSE-Article.pdf\">Persistent Non Symbolic Experience Article</a>.</p>\n<p>I am not sure what is the best practice, but mindfulness seems to help as well, since these thoughts are all theoretical, grounding yourself in the concrete [6a] and observing those thoughts seems to alleviate the anxieties it can cause. &nbsp;But this can explain a lot of people's actions (they are telling themselves a particular story in their head).</p>\n<h2><strong>11.

Any time you are disconnected to what is going on, try asking yourself an internal question of \"what is going on?\" to connect with what is most alive in you right now. &nbsp;This might be a feeling of boredom. &nbsp;It could be anything, but if it's not a good and strong connection with what is presently happening you have a chance to fix it. &nbsp;(See also the book \"The Charisma myth\")</p>\n<h2>12. <strong>circling</strong> (<a href=\"http://circlinghandbook.com/\">The circling handbook</a>)</h2>\n<p>[6 built on NVC] is a practice of living in the current and present experience. &nbsp;You can focus on another person or focus on yourself. &nbsp;Perpetually answering the question of \"what is most alive in you right now?\" and sharing that with other people.</p>\n<p>Some examples include:I am feeling nervous sharing this experienceI just closed my eyes and put my head back trying to think of a good example.I am distracted by the sound of birds behind me.I can feel air going past my nostrils as I think about this question.</p>\n<p>The creators of cicling find it a very connecting experience to either share what is going on inside you or to guess at what is going on inside someone else and ask if that's an accurate guess. &nbsp;Or to alternate experiences, each sharing one and one. &nbsp;or each guessing of each other - one and one.</p>\n<p>I find it valuable because everyone can understand present experience, and get a glimpse of your current experience in the process of sharing experience with you. &nbsp;This method can also work as a form of [15] and [7].</p>\n<h2>13. <a href=\"https://booko.info/9781782118930/The-Game\">The game</a></h2>\n<p>(From the book The Game) This concept receives equal part condemnation and praise from various parties.</p>\n<p>The basic concept of the game is that life <em>is</em>&nbsp;a game. &nbsp;Specifically social interactions are a game that you can try out. &nbsp;You can iterate on and repeat until success. &nbsp;In the book it follows the journey of a pick up artist as he generally disregards other people's agency and works out how to get what he wants (regularly bed people) through some stages of practicing certain methods of interaction, and iterating until he sees a lot of success.</p>\n<p>I see a lot of this concept at kegan stage 3[18]. &nbsp;Everything is about social, and the only thing that matters is social relationships.</p>\n<p>Most of the condemnations comes from the failure of this model to treat other people as human, worthy of moral weight, thought or anything other than to be used to your own purposes. &nbsp;If you don't like dehumanising people the book can still teach you a lot about social interaction, and practicing towards incremental improvement.</p>\n<p>If you feel uncomfortable with Pick up, you should examine that belief closely, it's probably to do with feeling uncomfortable with people using manipulation to pursue sex. &nbsp;That's fine, there is a lot to learn about social and a lot of social systems before you turn into \"literally the devil\" for knowing about it. &nbsp;There are also other social goals other than sex that you can pursue.</p>\n<p>If you are cautious about turning into a jerk - you are probably not likely to ever even get close to actions that paint you as a jerk because your filters will stop you. &nbsp;It's the people who have no filter on actions that might want to be careful - herein lies dark arts and being a jerk. &nbsp;And as much as no one will stop you, no one will really enjoy your presence either if you are a jerk.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem I have with game and game methodology is that we all play a one-shot version. &nbsp;With high stakes of failure. &nbsp;Which means some of the iteration and having to fail while you learn how to not be terrible - will permanently damage your reputation. &nbsp;There is no perfect \"retry\" - a reputation will follow you basically to the ends of the earth and back. &nbsp;As much as game will teach you some things, the other models in this list have better information for you and are going to go further than game.</p>\n<h2>14. <strong>what an apology must do </strong>from Aaron Lazare, M.D.- <a href=\"https://booko.info/9780195189117/On-Apology\">on apology</a></h2>\n<p>1. A valid acknowledgement of the offence that makes clear who the offender is and who is the offended. The offender must clearly and completely acknowledge the offence.<br /> 2. An effective explanation, which shows an offence was neither intentional nor personal, and is unlikely to recur.<br /> 3. Expressions of remorse, shame, and humility, which show that the offender recognises the suffering of the offended.<br /> 4. A reparation of some kind, in the form of a real or symbolic compensation for the offender&rsquo;s transgression.<br /> An effective apology must also satisfy at least one of seven psychological needs of an offended person.<br /> 1. The restoration of dignity in the offended person.<br /> 2. The affirmation that both parties have shared values and agree that the harm committed was wrong.<br /> 3. Validation that the victim was not responsible for the offense.<br /> 4. The assurance that the offended party is safe from a repeat offense.<br /> 5. Reparative justice, which occurs when the offended sees the offending party suffer through some type of punishment.<br /> 6. Reparation, when the victim receives some form of compensation for his pain.<br /> 7. A dialogue that allows the offended parties to express their feelings toward the offenders and even grieve over their losses.</p>\n<p>These are not my notes from the book but they are particularly valuable when trying to construct an understanding of apologising and making up for misdeeds. &nbsp;I don't have them in memory but I know when I need to make a serious apology I can look them up. &nbsp;They fit quite well with [6], but are more specific to apology and not all interactions.</p>\n<h2><strong>15. Emotional labour</strong></h2>\n<p>A relatively new concept. &nbsp;This is roughly the ability to:<br /> I. Model someone else's emotional state<br /> II. Get it right<br /> III. act on their emotional state</p>\n<p>For example:<br /> I. I notice my partners eyes are droopy and they do not appear to be concentrating very well. &nbsp;Is rubbing eyes and checking their watch a lot.<br /> II. I suspect they are sleepy<br /> III. I make them a coffee, or I offer to make them coffee. &nbsp;(as a downgraded form I mention they look tired and ask if this is the case)</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://erratio.dreamwidth.org/154861.html\">Erratio</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Emotional labour is essentially a name for a managerial role in a relationship. This takes on a few different concrete forms.</p>\n<p>The first is management of the household, appointments, shopping, and other assorted tasks that are generally shared across couples and/or housemates. Sweeping a floor or cooking dinner is not emotional labour, but being the person who makes sure that those things are accomplished is. It doesn't matter whether you get the floor swept by doing it yourself, asking your partner to do it, firing up a Roomba, or hiring a cleaning service; what matters is that you are taking on responsibility for making sure the task is done. This is why people who say that they would be happy to help with the housework if you would just tell them what needs doing are being a lot less helpful than they think. They're taking the physical labour component of the task but explicitly sticking the other person with the emotional labour component.</p>\n<p>The second is taking responsibility for the likes, dislikes, feelings, wants and needs of other people who you are in a relationship with (and to be clear, it doesn't have to be a romantic relationship). Stereotypical scenarios that are covered by this kind of emotional labour include: the hysterical girlfriend who demands that her boyfriend drop everything he's doing to comfort her, the husband who comes home tense and moody after a long day at the office and expects to be asked how his day went and listened to and have validating noises made at him, noticing that the other person in a conversation is uncomfortable and steering the conversation to a more pleasant topic without having to be asked, helping a confused friend talk through their feelings about a potential or former partner, reminding your spouse that it's so-and-so's birthday and that so-and-so would appreciate being contacted, remembering birthdays and anniversaries and holidays and contacting people and saying or doing the right things on each of those dates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This overlaps with [7]. &nbsp;Commentary on this concept suggest that it's a habit that women get into doing more than men. &nbsp;Mothers are good at paying attention to their kids and their needs (as the major caregiver from early on), and stemming from this wives also take care of their husbands. &nbsp;While it would not be fair to suggest that all wives do anything I would be willing to concede that these are habits that people get into and are sometimes socially directed by society.</p>\n<p>I am not sure of the overall value of this model but it's clear that it has some implications about how people organise themselves - for better or worse.</p>\n<h2><strong>16. Vulnerability - Brene brown</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o</a><br /> In order to form close connections with people a certain level of vulnerability is necessary. &nbsp;This means that you need to share about yourself in order to give people something to connect to. &nbsp;In the other direction people need to be a certain level of vulnerable to you in order to connect. &nbsp;If you make sure to be open and encouraging and not judge you will enable people to open up to you and connect with you.<br /> Sometimes being vulnerable will get you hurt and you need to be aware of that and not shut down future experiences (continue to be open with people). &nbsp;I see this particularly in people who \"take time\" to get over relationships. &nbsp;Being vulnerable is a skill that can be practiced. &nbsp;Vulnerability replaced a lot of my ideas about [13 The game]. &nbsp;And would have given me a lot of ideas of how to connect with people, combined with [15] and [12]. (I have not read her books but I expect them to be useful)</p>\n<h2><strong>17. <a href=\"https://booko.info/9780991399703/More-Than-Two-A-Practical-Guide-to-Ethical-Polyamory\">More Than Two</a></strong> (book)</h2>\n<p>This is commonly known as the polyamory bible. &nbsp;It doesn't have to be read as a polyamory book, but in the world of polyamory emotional intelligence and the ability to communicate is the bread and butter of every day interactions. &nbsp;If you are trying to juggle two or three relationships and you don't know how to talk about hard things then you might as well quit now. &nbsp;If you don't know how to handle difficult feelings or experiences you might as well quit polyamory now.</p>\n<p>Reading about these skills and what you might gain from the insight that polyamorous people have learnt is probably valuable to anyone.</p>\n<h2><strong>18.

Previous parts can be found here: <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p8z/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">I</a>,<a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p9d/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\"> II</a>,<a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p9t/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\"> III</a>. To understand the following part I should be read at least. Here I would argue against SSA, argue why double-halving is correct, and touch on the implication of perspective disagreement on related topics such as the Doomsday Argument, the Presumptuous Philosopher and the Simulation Argument.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>ARGUMENTS AGAINST SELF-SAMPLING ASSUMPTION</strong></p>\n<p>I think the most convincing argument against SSA was presented by Elga in 2000 （although he intended it as an counter to halving in general). He purpose the coin toss could happen after the first awakening. Beauty&rsquo;s answer ought to remain the same regardless the timing of the toss. As SSA states, an observer should reason as if she is randomly selected from the set of all actual observers (past, present and <strong>future</strong> ones). If an imaginary selector randomly choose a day among all waking day(s) he is guaranteed to pick Monday if the coin landed on H but only has half the chance if T. From the selector&rsquo;s perspective clearly a bayesian updating should be performed upon learning it is Monday. A simple calculation tells us his credence of H must be 2/3. As SSA dictates this is also beauty&rsquo;s answer once she knows it is Monday. However the coin toss could potential happen after this awakening. Now beauty is predicting a fair coin toss yet to happen would most likely land on H. This supernatural predicting power is a conclusive evidence against SSA.</p>\n<div><br /></div>\n<p>However, if we recognize the importance of perspective disagreement then beauty is not bound to give the same answer as the Selector. In fact I would argue she should not perform a bayesian update base on the new information. This can be explained in two ways.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One way is to put the new information into the frequentist approach mentioned in part <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p8z/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">I</a>. In Duplicating Beauties, when a beauty wakes up and remembering 1000 repetitions she shall reason there are about 500 of H and T each among those 1000 tosses. The same conclusion would be reached by all beauties without knowing if she is physically the original or created somewhere along the way. Now suppose a beauty learns she is indeed the original. She would simply reason as the original beauty who wakes up remembering 1000 tosses. These 1000 tosses would still contain about 500 of H and T each. Meaning her answer shall remain at 1/2.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another way to see why beauty should not perform a bayesian update is to see the agreement/disagreement pattern between her and the selector. It is worth noting that beauty and the selector will be in agreement once knowing she is the original. As stated in part&nbsp;<a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p8z/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">I</a>, one way to understand the disagreement is after T, seeing either beauty is the same observation for the selector while it is different observations for beauties. This in turn causes the selector to enter twice more bets than beauty. However once we distinguish the two beauties by stating which one is the original the selector&rsquo;s observation would also be different depending on which beauty he sees. To put it in a different way, if a bet is only set between the selector and the original beauty then the selector would no longer be twice more likely to enter a bet in case of T. He and the Beauty would enter the bet with equal chances. Meaning their betting odds ought to be the same, aka they must be in agreement regarding the credence of H.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To be specific, the disagreements/agreements pattern can be summarized as follows. If the selector randomly chooses one of the two rooms as described by SIA. Upon seeing a beauty in the room the selector&rsquo;s probability for H will change from 1/2 to 1/3. Beauty&rsquo;s probability remains at 1/2. The two of them would be in disagreement. Once they learns the beauty is the original, the selector&rsquo;s probability of H increases back to 1/2 from 1/3 by simple bayesian updating while beauty&rsquo;s probability still remains at 1/2. This way the two would be in agreement. The selector can also randomly chooses one beauty from all existing beauty(ies) as described by SSA (here the total number of beauties should be shielded from the selector to not reveal the coin toss result). In this case seeing a beauty gives the selector no new information so his probability for H would remain unchanged at 1/2. On the other hand, from beauty&rsquo;s perspective she is twice more likely to be chosen if there exist only one beauty instead of two. Therefore upon seeing the selector her credence of H would increase to 2/3. The two of them would also be in disagreement. Once they learn the beauty is the original the selector&rsquo;s credence for H would increase to 2/3 by bayesian updating. Again beauty would not update her probability and it remains at 2/3. This way the two would agree with each other again.</p>\n<p>As shown above, for the two to reach an agreement beauty must not perform a bayesian update upon the new information. This holds true in both cases regardless how the selection is structured.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beauty&rsquo;s antibayesianism, just like the perspective disagreement, is quite unusual. I think this is due to the fact that there is no random event determining which beauty is the original/clone. While the coin toss may create a new copy of beauty, nothing could ever turn herself into the copy. The original beauty would eventually be the original beauty. It is simply tautology. There is no random soul jumping between the two bodies. Beauty&rsquo;s uncertainty is because of the structure of the experiment which is purely due to lack of information. Compare this to the selector&rsquo;s situation. The event of him choosing a room is random. Therefore learning the beauty in the chosen room is original gives new information about the random event. From his perspective a bayesian update should be performed.Where as from beauty's perspective, learning she is the original does not give new information about a random event, for the simply fact there is no random event to begin with. It only gives information about her own perspective. So she should not performing a bayesian update as the selector did.&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<div><strong>DISCUSSIONS</strong></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>With the above arguments in mind we can clearly see the importance of perspective disagreement in SBP. It does not matter whether the selector follows SSA or SIA, his answer won't always correctly reflect beauty&rsquo;s. Once beauty switch to selector&rsquo;s perspective her answers would change. Therefore it is important for us to consciously track our reasoning process to make sure it contains no change of perspective. As shown above, learning she exists does not confirm scenarios with more observers, just as learning she is the first does not confirm scenarios with less observers. Applying the same logic means we should reject Doomsday Argument while disagree with the Presumptuous Philosopher. Not changing perspective also means an observer should never reason as if she is randomly selected (by an imaginary third party) from certain reference class. This also means Simulation Argument should be rejected. (which I will discuss separately)</div>\n</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Another point worth mentioning is that disagreements among beauties are also reasonable. Imagine a beauty has undergone a duplication coin toss and was told the result was T after waking up. She then takes another 9 iterations and woke up remembering 10 tosses in total. At this point she is told out of the two resulting beauties after the first toss, one experienced all Heads in the next 9 rounds. The other one and her clones experienced all Tails in those 9 rounds. Because there is no new information regarding which beauty she was after the first toss, beauty would conclude with 1/2 confidence she is the one experienced 9 heads, even though they are 512 Tail beauties and only 1 Head beauty. We can put all those beauties in the same room and let them communicate freely, since they have the same information none of them would change her answer. Now we have them disagreeing with each other. This disagreement might seems alarming. However it is also valid. As discussed above, in problems involving duplications people with the same information can have different probabilities. The reason this disagreement seems more suspicious is because the resulting beauties appears to be in symmetrical positions thus should not disagree with each other. However this symmetry is only valid from an selector&rsquo;s perspective. For each beauty's own perspective she is more likely to be the Head beauty than a certain specific Tail beauty. A different problem which is similar to this disagreement was discussed by John Pittard(2013).</div>\n<div><br /></div>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Many people, anyway.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a common mistake in modeling humans, to think that they have actual goals, and that they deduce their actions from those goals. First there is a goal, then there is an action which is born from the goal. This is wrong.</p>\n<p>More accurately, humans have a series of adaptations they execute. A series of behaviors which, under certain circumstances, kinda-sorta-maybe aim at the same-ish thing (like inclusive genetic fitness), but which will be executed regardless of whether or not they actually hit that thing.</p>\n<p>Actions are not deduced from goals. The closest thing we have to \"goals\" are inferred from a messy conglomerate of actions, and are only an approximation of the reality that is there: just a group of behaviors.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>I've come to see beliefs as very much the same way. Maybe some of us have real beliefs, real models. Some of us may in fact choose our statements about the world by deducing them from a foundational set of beliefs.</p>\n<p>The mistake is repeated when we model most humans as having actual beliefs (nerds might be an exception). To suppose that their statements about reality, their propositions about the world, or their answers to questions are deduced from some foundational belief. First there is a belief, then there is a report on that belief, provided if anyone inquires about the belief they're carrying around. This is wrong.</p>\n<p>More accurately, humans have a set of social moves/responses that they execute. Some of those moves APPEAR (to the naive nerd such as I) to be statements about how and what reality is. Each of these \"statements\" was probably vetted and accepted individually, without any consideration for the utterly foreign notion that the moves should be consistent or avoid contradiction. This sounds as tiresome to them as suggesting that their body language, or dance moves should be \"consistent,\" for to them, the body language, dance moves, and \"statements about reality\" all belong to the same group of social moves, and thinking a social move is \"consistent\" is like thinking a certain posture/gesture is consistent or a color is tasty.</p>\n<p>And missing the point like a nerd and taking things \"literally\" is exactly the kind of thing that reveals low social acuity.</p>\n<p>Statements about individual beliefs are not deduced from a model of the world, just like actions are not deduced from goals. You can choose to interpret \"I think we should help poor people\" as a statement about the morality of helping poor people, if you want to miss the whole point, of course. We can suppose that \"XYZ would be a good president\" is a report on their model of someone's ability to fulfill a set of criteria. And if we interpret all their statement as though they were actual, REAL beliefs, we might be able to piece them together into something sort of like a model of the world.</p>\n<p>All of which is pointless, missing the point, and counter-productive. Their statements don't add up to a model like ours might, anymore than our behaviors really add up to a goal. The \"model\" that comes out of aggregating their social learned behaviors will likely be inconsistent, but if you think that'll matter to them, you've fundamentally misunderstood what they're doing. You're trying to find their beliefs, but they don't HAVE any. There IS nothing more. It's just a set of cached responses. (Though you might find, if you interpret their propositions about reality as signals about tribal affiliation and personality traits, that they're quite consistent).</p>\n<p>\"What do you think about X\" is re-interpreted and answered as though you had said \"What do good, high-status groups (that you can plausibly be a part of) think about X?\"</p>\n<p>\"I disagree\" doesn't mean they think your model is wrong; they probably don't realize you have a model. Just as you interpret their social moves as propositional statements and misunderstand, so they interpret your propositional statements as social moves and misunderstand. If you ask how their model differs from yours, it'll be interpreted as a generic challenge to their tribe/status, and they'll respond like they do to such challenges. You might be confused by their hostility, or by how they change the subject. You think you're talking about X and they've switched to Y. While they'll think you've challenged them, and respond with a similar challenge, the \"content\" of the sentences need not be considered; the important thing is to parry the social attack and maybe counter-attack. Both perspectives make internal sense.</p>\n<p>As far as they're concerned, the entire meaning of your statement was basically equivalent to a snarl, so they snarled back. Beliefs As Body Language.</p>\n<p>Despite the obvious exceptions and caveats, this has been extremely useful for me in understanding less nerdy people. I try not to take what to them are just the verbal equivalent of gestures/postures or dance moves, and interpret them as propositional statements about the nature of reality (even though they REALLY sound like they're making propositional statements about the nature of reality), because that misunderstands what they're actually trying to communicate. The content of their sentences is not the point. There is no content. (None about reality, that is. All content is social). They do not HAVE beliefs. There's nothing to report on.</p>",

All our data analysis was completely Bayesian, and that was a direct inheritance from Alan Turing. I&rsquo;m not sure this has ever really been published, but Turing, almost as a sideline during his cryptoanalytic work, reinvented Bayesian statistics for himself. The work against Enigma and other German ciphers was fully Bayesian. &hellip;</span></p>\n<p style=\"border: 0px; font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Bayesian statistics was an&nbsp;<em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">extreme</em>&nbsp;minority discipline in the &rsquo;70s.

Hahaha, I've dissolved the idea of qualia! They are just an illusion!\" No, silly, your opponent's failure to define X doesn't prove you right about X.

But asserting that a word is useless should only be done with caution!

To that end, instead of Rationalist Taboo, I prefer to use good old <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100328161823/http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/steven/?p=155\">steelmanning</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong>&nbsp;Can you explain what you mean by \"surprise\"?</p>\n<p><strong>Bob and Carol in unison:</strong> Observing a low probability event.</p>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> This morning I saw a car whose license plate said 8713, but it didn't surprise me at all!</p>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong>&nbsp;Hmm, it looks like my concept of \"surprise\" was misguided.

These days I try to be more like Carol, and when I hear a seemingly misguided word like \"essence\" or \"emergence\", my first instinct isn't to kick it when it's down, but to steelman it and <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/rescue_utility/\">rescue</a> whatever is worth rescuing.</p>\n<p>What Taboo gets right is that words are mere handles, and meanings are the only part worth discussing; but when you try to capture a word, there will always be leftover meanings, often more complex and interesting than the one you caught.

No game knowledge is needed and the insights transfer to life in general. He is explaining how to think about complexity. The central point is: Complexity is Bad.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8905\"></span></p>\n<p>It is known that Complexity is Bad, but it is important that your model of this is <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ozz/gears_in_understanding/\">made of gears. </a>To help with this, I will summarize his most important points, and add some more of my own.</p>\n<p>People can only have so much attention.</p>\n<p>People can only store so much information at once, typically seven things.</p>\n<p>People can only think about so many things at once, typically three things.</p>\n<p>If people have too many things to remember, do or think about, bad things happen.</p>\n<p>Often <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/choices-are-bad/\">they will have to prioritize</a>, and will often prioritize wrong. They will distill the situation, or your argument, to make it simpler, whether you like it or not, in ways you can&#8217;t predict or control.</p>\n<p>Often they will throw up their hands and give up, doing nothing or doing something at random.</p>\n<p>Other times complexity is a barrier to entry and people won&#8217;t understand or engage with you at all.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Complexity often papers over mistakes, preventing you from finding better, more elegant solutions. You are patching bad outputs rather than fixing your underlying process.</p>\n<p>More complex systems are harder to analyze and understand. They are more fragile and have more points of failure. They are harder to usefully change, especially without adding more complexity.</p>\n<p>Even in the best case, complex things take longer and more concentration to engage with.</p>\n<p>The more complex something is, the higher the standards it is judged by, <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/choices-are-bad/\">since you had more choices and anyone interacting with it likely has more choices</a>.</p>\n<p>In exchange, complexity lets you do more complex things, have whatever you are building or rules you are making achieve more complex outcomes, and to better understand and explain things that are complex, which is most things. Complexity is highly useful.</p>\n<p>Albert Einstein summarized this as &#8220;everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.&#8221; Mark Rosewater summarizes this as &#8220;complexity is a cost.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mark&#8217;s system gives you <em>complexity points </em>to spend. When you increase complexity, you are <em>spending complexity points. </em>Spending too many has a large cost. This works similarly to <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lbn/you_have_a_set_amount_of_weirdness_points_spend/\">weirdness points.</a> These may be the same points.</p>\n<p>Getting the most out of your points is valuable. Mark shares techniques for this when designing a system; there are also lots of ways for the player/user to help with this, but I will consider that beyond scope.</p>\n<p><strong>Resonance</strong> is where your complexity maps onto concepts that are already familiar. Flying creatures cannot be blocked by non-flying creatures. Because, you know, <em>flying. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Chunking</strong> is where you make it easy to combine things into conceptually simple bigger things, so the new thing only counts as one thing to remember and think about. This lets people handle more complexity, so make it easy to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Ramping up</strong> complexity slowly is a classic. You start new players/users off slowly, as many games do, with something simple, then introduce your complexity a little bit at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Hiding</strong> your complexity often works well. You put your complexity where new users/players will not think to look, or care about. When they are ready for it, they will notice. Even better, you hide it where they cannot even see it until they go looking for it. Hidden features are great for this.</p>\n<p><strong>Emergent</strong> complexity is great. The complexity comes not from lots of explicit pieces or rules, but from how the simpler rules of the system interact.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/thezvi.wordpress.com/8905/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/thezvi.wordpress.com/8905/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thezvi.wordpress.com&#038;blog=21007166&#038;post=8905&#038;subd=thezvi&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

A theory is implausible according to the Bayesian School when it possesses a low a priori probability. But we don't thereby scale our beliefs for rationality if we scale beliefs by how much dissonance they cause,. Moreover, to scale them by rationality would require that we have some independent reason for thinking, apart from the comparative cognitive dissonance they arouse, that one theory is more rational than is the other. Scaling our beliefs by the cognitive dissonance they arouse cannot itself be justified on a priori grounds, since dissonance reduction often takes us systematically away from the truth, as in fact is the case in most experimental studies of dissonance. (This helps explain why the identity of dissonance and implausibility hasn't previously been noted.)</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\">Regarding the other negative implication of the dissonance account of implausibility - coherentist theories of knowledge haven't arrived at a clear meaning of \"coherence,\" but coherentist theories emphasize logical and explanatory relations among far-mode ideas (although recent versions have included the role of ideas derived directly from perception). The dissonance theory of implausibility holds that dissonance is aroused by pragmatic incompatibility between near-mode and far-mode cognition. However, we don't seem to be immune to conflicts between our far-mode ideas, although the extent to which we are - the extent of the immunity to far-mode hypocrisy - tends to surprise many of us. The resolution of this problem is that the&nbsp;<a style=\"text-decoration-line: none; color: #800080;\" href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/10/sex-is-near-love-is-far.html\">logical analysis</a>&nbsp;of the relations between far-mode ideas is itself a near-mode activity. (Consider that the practice of mathematics is near-mode, as much as its content is abstract.) We are sensitive to inconsistencies in far-mode ideas only to the extent that we draw upon them in our analytical practices - and to the extent that our own activity involves such practices. Those involved in expounding a doctrine or acting in its terms will be subject to dissonance to the extent that far-mode ideas pragmatically conflict with the performance of their analytical performances.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\">The dissonance theory of plausibility also bears no the mystery of the conjuring up of theoretical terms. We know that scientific theories go beyond the empirical evidence, as in principle there are infinitely many theories consistent with any set of empirical facts. On the dissonance account of plausibility, theory creation and acceptance is driven by dissonance reduction. Far-more theories promote scientific practices by energizing them. They do this by providing the framework in which scientists work. If work is to be systematic, a framework is necessary, but are the declarative propositions the framework expresses true? Do they have a probability of truth?</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\">Scientific Realist philosophers of science have argued convincingly that theoretical propositions in science often purport to be true, but nobody has come close to providing an account of what it means for an abstract theory to be probable, such that we can inquire regarding the epistemic probability that Newtonian physics was true? The notion that we have rational degrees of belief in theories does accord with some intuitions. Plausibility must allow at least ordinal ranking, since dissonance involves choice between different cognitive states according to their plausibility. This in turn means that the laws of probability apply to ordinal relations. For example, the plausibility of Theory A and Theory B will never be greater than the plausibility of Theory A. But let me suggest that even this is a product of dissonance as shaped by theoretical development, as is shown in studies showing that in many situations we empirically find the conjunction fallacy compelling - that is, plausible.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\">Sometimes the search for dissonance reduction leads to truth, and sometimes it leads away from truth. Rationality is a limiting case of dissonance reduction, but it's one impossible to specify except from within a psyche subject to the laws of cognitive dissonance. Then this problem: how do we even express the expectation that scientific theories get closer to the truth and religious theories do not? We can say that scientific theories depend on experimental and observational practices and therefore have at least the possibility of resting on actual evidence. We can say scientific theories have greater plausibility than religious theories, these both being judgments that are a product of the law of dissonance. But, counter-intuitively (at least for me), we can't say that scientific theories are more probable than religious theories. It isn't, it's important to notice, that we don't know which is more probable. Rather, the whole notion of probability as applied to theories is misbegotten. That a theory is implausible or plausible is a far-mode conclusion, and far-mode doesn't deal in the relative frequencies modeled by the probability calculus.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\">A simple example might be clarifying in showing the limits of the concept of probability and its closeness to near-mode experience. During the last presidential election, pollsters arrived at estimates of the probability of winning for each candidate. Pollsters use mainly near-mode reasoning to engineer the best predictive formulas. The pollsters substantially agreed, as you would expect when they each applied similar methodologies, all based on simple extrapolation of the near-mode process of sampling and generalizing to a defined population.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\">The accuracy of these conclusions, however, depended on certain far-mode assumptions, such as that people taking polls respond honestly. What if this assumption didn't hold? Well, it didn't; Trump won and the main reason the polls got it wrong was (or might have been, if you prefer) that voters polled weren't honest about their preferences. We might ask, what should have been the true probability estimate, given that the pollsters didn't take into account the probability that their model was based on false assumptions. How should they have taken this into account? Probability estimates result from the near-mode operation of fitting observation to a relative frequency model. We can complicate the model to take account of more information, but what we can't do is adjust the probability estimate to take account of the model's own fallibility. (At a deeper level, Bayesian estimates can&rsquo;t adjust for the probability that the Bayesian methodology itself is invalid&mdash;as I contend it is in fact.) If it makes sense to assign a probability to a theory being true, how much belief should be accorded in some idealized rational world, then it should be possible to approximate that probability. Someone can adjust it \"intuitively,\" but my point is that there is nothing appropriate for an intuition to be about. Theoretical plausibility is not probability.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><br /></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-indent: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, sans-serif;\">At this point arises a skeptical temptation, for not only is our knowledge not absolute, it isn't even probable. Plausibility can systematically take us away from knowledge. We seem to long for a rationale for doing the rational thing, and such a rationale is supplied when knowledge and rational conduct is represented by Bayesian and decision-theoretic formulas. We see ourselves as free and availed of (mentally) unlimited choice. We are rational because we choose to be, and that entails that the choice itself be rational. But our possibilities aren't unlimited, freely chosen.

This means he is part of Magic&#8217;s R&amp;D department, one of the world&#8217;s few pockets of cooperation, sanity and competence. They are not explicit rationalists as such, but they embody many of the most important virtues we aspire to, and by doing so they manage to create an amazing game and community with a far-too-small team on a shoestring budget.</p>\n<p>One of the game&#8217;s and department&#8217;s best features is its openness. While work on future card sets and future decisions need to be kept secret, a tradition has developed that <em>the thinking process used </em>by R&amp;D is shared freely with the world, as are the stories surrounding past card sets and decisions. Competitive Magic players have also developed the tradition of sharing their methods and ideas with the world whenever possible via articles and free discussion, only working in secret for brief periods before major competitions.</p>\n<p>This is insanely great. Writing down your history, mental models and thought process makes you understand them better, helps others understand and learn from them, and those others respond to help you improve.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8829\"></span></p>\n<p>The secret is that this process is worth doing even if no one reads what you have written; this is the same principle that says that you do not fully understand a concept until you can teach it to someone else. Writing down your conclusions often makes you realize where your conclusions are wrong, or your techniques can be improved. Having to put all of your justifications into precise words, in a place others could read them, makes most bad reasoning obvious if you are paying attention. Often by the time I am finished writing about something, I understand the thing or my thinking about the thing in a whole new and much better way.</p>\n<p>One of the big secrets of my Magic success was that I was constantly writing up what I had done and what I was thinking, in a style that chronicled my working and thinking process rather than sharing only the conclusions. I learned and improved by writing. Others told me they learned from my writing, which is always great to hear, but no one learned more than I did. Often I would start without knowing what I would conclude, and the result was better decks, thoughts and strategies than I would have had if I hadn&#8217;t been writing.</p>\n<p>The more you explain your thought process along the way, the more useful such writing is to your own understanding. I also believe that this is the best for the reader, but I understand that I may be biased there; I <em>know </em>it is best for me as the writer.</p>\n<p>This all applies to Magic, but it applies equally well outside of Magic. When I started writing about non-Magic topics here, the same things happened. I noticed I was teaching myself to &#8216;play better&#8217; and get a better understanding, both of the topic and my own reasoning on it. Even the third or so of posts that never get published, and sometimes even posts that I never start writing at all or die after a paragraph and get erased, have been helpful.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, writing also makes you a better writer, and arguably nothing else does.</p>\n<p>As another bonus, writing in this way is <em>much faster </em>than other methods, because you can write as you think, and because your mistakes are often insightful rather than wasted. That doesn&#8217;t get you out of editing later, but it is a huge help.</p>\n<p>Note that short form sharing of ideas on social media does get you a non-zero amount of this benefit, but is a much weaker, second-best variation. As a reminder, we are very much <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/against-facebook/\">Against Facebook.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most writing, and also most great writing, does not work this way. By all means do not let me stop you from writing in other ways, but let me especially encourage sharing your thought process.

For a brief elaboration: People are only capable of acting upon their own utility function. It is quite possible that this utility function includes others utility function. It is impossible for one to act on another's utility function (without first incorporating it into their own utility function). If the well being of others makes you happy, or you gain pleasure from it, then it grants you positive utility. In order for you to be truly selfless in your altruism, then you must not gain any pleasure from it. Helping others must not make you happy, or uplift you. If helping others doesn't grant you pleasure (in any form whatsoever), then you may be altruistic, but you would be quite alien to our conception of altruism (we don't imagine altruists don't like helping others do we), one might even argue that if you derive n pleasure from helping others, that you are not really altruistic but merely putting on airs.<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />&nbsp;<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />I posit that altruism&mdash;at least as we conceive it&mdash;is inherently selfish. However, this is not a problem. Being selfish is not immoral, and some moral philosophies posit that people are only capable of acting in their own self interest. Altruism as a selfish endeavour, only becomes a problem if we operate under the assumption that \"selfish = bad\"&mdash;a grossly unfounded assumption. As a trivial counter example, if I save a loved one because I would be heavily distressed at their loss (an inherently selfish motive), then does my action become immoral? Perish the thought. Selfishness is not inherently immoral. It is merely that some selfish actions may be conceived of as immoral, which gives the whole position a bad reputation. If we accept that selfish actions can be moral, then the position of altruism as a selfish endeavour brooks no inconsistencies.<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />&nbsp;<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />True selflessness&mdash;and true altruism if you demand that altruism is selfless&mdash;is the sociopath who decides to help someone else despite feeling no empathy for them (maybe out of moral principles or something).<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />&nbsp;<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />Selfishness is not a problem. Selfishness is desirable; it is a virtue to be lauded, not a vice to be vilified. Humans should act in their own self-interest&mdash;it is the rational thing to do&mdash;and if that self interest involves helping others, involves making the world a better place, then go ahead.<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />&nbsp;<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" />What I call \"The first commandment\":</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-top: 0.357143em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.357143em; padding: 0px 8px; color: #4f4f4f; border-left-color: #c5c1ad; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42857em;\">Be ye selfish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.357143em 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em; color: #222222; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Selfishness is amoral. Selfishness is moral blind. It is neither inherently good, nor inherently evil. A virtuous person who acts in their self interest wrought good works. An \"evil\" person who acts in their self interest wrought evil works. The selfishness of the act does not determine the morality thereof&mdash;only the character of the agent does.<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\" />&nbsp;<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />Similarly also, selflessness isn't inherently good; as a counterexample, consider someone who is blackmailed into committing evil act(s) (the act(s) is/are a lesser evil compared to what would be done to the hostages) via holding his family or his city hostage. The evil act(s) he commits are selfless, yet they are immoral (If you disagree with this, you probably subscribe to a form of deontology, and I suggest we agree to disagree).<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />&nbsp;<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />Neither selfishness nor selflessness knows morality. Only the character of the agent, and neither the selfishness nor selflessness of the action determines its morality.<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" />&nbsp;<br style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" />I don't think I redefined \"selfish\".

Upon reflection, I kinda have to agree. </em></span><em style=\"color:#0000ff;\">It&#8217;s not a crucial enough argument for me to bother rewriting the entire thing, and I&#8217;m leaving it up here for the entertainment value and the good discussion in the comments.]</em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s an old saying: <em>&#8220;If you want to hear a dumb opinion, ask someone their thoughts on the minimum wage&#8221;</em>. It&#8217;s the ultimate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\" rel=\"noopener\">Dunning-Kruger topic</a> &#8211; so complex that everyone thinks it&#8217;s simple, so hard that everyone has an easy answer.</p>\n<p>In a series of three posts, I&#8217;m going to describe a few <strong>economic</strong> approaches to analyzing minimum wage laws. Broadly, economics is the study of how people get what they want by interacting with each other in non-violent ways.</p>\n<p>If you want an apple and you pick it off a tree in the wild, that&#8217;s not economics because no one else is involved. If you want my apple and you stab me and take it, that&#8217;s not economics either. If you want me to <em>give</em> <em>you</em> my apple, we have entered the realm of economics.</p>\n<p>Workers want a lot of things from employers. Mostly they want wages, but also a pleasant workplace, stability, good conditions, and respect. Employers want several things from workers too, mostly labor but some of the above as well. How they deal with each other is thus a matter of economics. Even if we&#8217;re interested in the moral and political implications (which I&#8217;ll also touch on), we have to first understand as well as we can the economics of employment and wages.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t keep you in suspense &#8211; I think that minimum wage laws are a huge mistake, both economically and morally. I have 95% confidence that low-skilled workers would be <em>much</em> better off on all accounts if the minimum wage was repealed and replaced with any half-sensible form of redistribution. Redistribution that is even 3/4 sensible, e.g. negative income tax paid for by increased taxes on corporate profits, can make rich and poor Americans alike better off. If the minimum wage is repealed with no additional redistribution there would be a lot of short term pain, but I still think it&#8217;s more likely than not that workers would be better off in the long term.</p>\n<p>With that said, my goal isn&#8217;t to write a polemic against the minimum wage, but an overview of increasingly sophisticated ways to think about it. I <em>personally</em> find that as economic thinking gets more sophisticated, it turns less in favor of the minimum wage, but you may not.</p>\n<p>I think that there&#8217;s progress to be made in replacing stupid opinions with less-stupid ones, even if the policy prescription remains the same for the time being. So if my essay isn&#8217;t convincing, I hope that it&#8217;s at least educational.</p>\n<h2>The Economics Zero Approach</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, our journey of increasing economic understanding has to start from an argument from which this understanding is entirely absent. This argument is so senseless than even debunking it isn&#8217;t going to be very educational. The only reason I have to address it is the frightening popularity this argument has gained recently with many of my friends and with a certain US senator.</p>\n<p>The call is to force <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/03/walmart-can-afford-15-minimum-wage-commentary.html\">WalMart to raise its minimum wage to $15/hr</a>, because some percentage of their employees use government assistance. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/bernie-sanders-walmart-wages-starvation_n_3706877\">Senator Sanders in particular</a> claims that giving Medicaid and food stamps to Walmart employees amounts to welfare for the Walton family, and that the latter should pay their employees out of their own $100 billion in accumulated wealth.</p>\n<p>This line of argument is entirely unconcerned with numbers, but the numbers are all right there on <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/2016/annual/2016-Annual-Report-PDF.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">WalMart&#8217;s annual report</a>.</p>\n<p>WalMart makes $15B of profit on $480B of revenue, for a minuscule 3% profit margin. It has 2.3 million employees. Let&#8217;s assume that 2 million of those earn WalMart&#8217;s current $10/hr minimum or close to it. If their wage was raised to $15, that would mean a $5 per hour raise. With 40 work hours in a week that adds up to $200 per week, or $10,000 per year per employee, or $20 billion total for all of WalMart&#8217;s workers.</p>\n<p><em>[Edit: thanks to some readers that pointed out that WalMart has 1.5 million employees in the US, and that many of them don&#8217;t work 40 hours a week. Still, even a payroll increase of $5B-$10B is not absorbable with such razor thin margins.]</em></p>\n<p>$20B is more than WalMart&#8217;s entire net income. There is simply no way for a company with such tiny margins to increase its costs without transferring the entire increase to prices. Even if the Walton family wanted to pay the higher wage bill without raising prices, the entire $100 billion they accumulated in 55 years would run out in 5.</p>\n<p>The other option is to raise prices for WalMart&#8217;s 230 million weekly customers. Most of those are much poorer than WalMart&#8217;s employees, like the <a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/record-95102000-americans-not-labor-force-number-grew-18-obama-took-office\" rel=\"noopener\">95 million adult Americans</a> who are out of the labor force shop and earn no paycheck at all. Raising the wages of WalMart employees will result in a massive wealth transfer from lots of really poor Americans to the few not-so-poor Americans who are lucky to keep a job at WalMart.</p>\n<p>Even at $10 an hour, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/wal-mart-receives-23000-applications-2013-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>WalMart gets more applications per open position that </strong><strong>does Harvard</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"http://images.gawker.com/18k2qaf0q3rdkjpg/original.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for walmart worker\" /></p>\n<p>There is going to be a lot of economic theory in parts 2 and 3 of my essay, but the simple fact that higher wages at WalMart would cause a lot of pain to a lot of poor people doesn&#8217;t depend on any of it. It&#8217;s a consequence of simple arithmetic that WalMart can&#8217;t pay anyone any wages if it goes out of business, and it can&#8217;t stay in business without raising prices to offset the rising wages.</p>\n<p>Or, WalMart can just shutter all the stores that become unprofitable with low prices and high wages and fire all the associates those stores employed. I doubt that this is going to alleviate poverty either.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that it never crossed the mind of people attacking WalMart&#8217;s wages to do the math on WalMart&#8217;s income statement. I think it&#8217;s because the core of their argument is about ethics, and not about making workers richer. Unfortunately, the ethics of the argument are just as perverse as the numbers.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/\">Copenhagen interpretation of ethics</a> is the view that interacting with a problem makes one culpable for it. This interpretation holds that ignoring an issue completely absolves one of sin, but fixing 90% of a tragedy leaves you guilty of the other 10%. It&#8217;s an ethics that is not concerned with alleviating suffering, it is only concerned with blame and scapegoating. And as the author who coined the phrase notes, it&#8217;s a very popular moral position.</p>\n<p>WalMart is a very convenient scapegoat for American poverty because WalMart does a lot for poor Americans: it pays them tens of billions each year in salaries, and it <a href=\"http://www.ihsglobalinsight.com/publicDownload/genericContent/11-03-05_walmart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saves them tens of billions</a> each year in the prices they must pay for necessities.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a company like Apple doesn&#8217;t employ any poor Americans and doesn&#8217;t make things cheap for poor Americans. It has <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/profit_margin\">net profit margins in excess of 20%</a> (to WalMart&#8217;s 3%), trillions of profits parked abroad, and <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/02/apples-cash-hoard-swells-to-record-256-8-billion.html\">$256 billion</a> in cash.</p>\n<p>There are three reasons why Bernie and some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chris_arnade/status/827161942452101122\">front row kids</a> want to hold WalMart and McDonald&#8217;s accountable for American poverty, but not so much Apple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Apple stays away from poor people, so it can&#8217;t be blamed for their condition.</li>\n<li>The people making this argument usually have iPhones and don&#8217;t eat at McDonald&#8217;s or shop at WalMart. I suspect that many of them look down in disgust on the very act of eating or shopping there, and they want everyone else to agree with them.</li>\n<li>Unlike McDonald&#8217;s and WalMart, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/apple-tax-avoidance-scam-just-start-496420\">Apple is a world class expert at avoiding paying taxes</a>. You couldn&#8217;t get them to help poor people even if you wanted to.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>[Edit: Bernie does have some <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2016/04/05/presidential-candidate-bernie-sanders-calls-on-apple-to-make-products-in-us-pay-fair-share-of-taxes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">harsh words for Apple as well</a>. I think that his suggestion for Apple to move manufacturing to the US is as innumerate as his attacks on WalMart, but he certainly sticks to his principles.]</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>I want to reiterate that &#8220;welfare to WalMart&#8221; is a <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/\">weak man</a>, the stupidest position on an issue that is still held by a significant group of people. Deflating it is not a strong argument against minimum wage laws in general, that&#8217;s all coming up in the next two posts.</p>\n<p>In Part 2 we&#8217;ll see what the much maligned &#8220;Econ 101&#8221; model really teaches. In Part 3 we&#8217;ll examine the role that wages play as a medium of information and societal organization, aside from their function as a mere contract between employer and employee.</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/putanumonit.wordpress.com/25797/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/putanumonit.wordpress.com/25797/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=putanumonit.com&#038;blog=101823629&#038;post=25797&#038;subd=putanumonit&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

    "htmlBody": "<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: I read Mathematics for Computer Science (MCS) and found it excellent. I sampled Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications (Rosen)&mdash;currently recommended in MIRI's <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/research-guide/\">research guide</a>&mdash;as well as Concrete Mathematics and Discrete Mathematics with Applications (Epp), which appear to be MCS's competition. Based on these partial readings, I found MCS to be the best overall text. I therefore recommend MIRI change the recommendation in its research guide.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>MCS is used at MIT for their introductory discrete math course, 6.042, which appears to be taken primarily by second-semester <a href=\"https://www.eecs.mit.edu/docs/ug/freshman_subjects.pdf\">freshman</a> and sophomores. You can find OpenCourseWare archives from <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm\">2010</a> and <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/index.htm\">2015</a>, although the book is self-contained; I never had occasion to use them throughout my reading.&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<div>If you liked <em>Computability and Logic</em> (<a href=\"/lw/j4r/book_review_computability_and_logic/\">review</a>), currently in the MIRI research guide, you'll like MCS:</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>MCS is a wonderful book. It's well written. It's rigorous, but does a nice job of motivating the material. It efficiently proves a number of counterintuitive results and then helps you see them as intuitively obvious. Freed from the constraint of printing cost, it contains many diagrams which are generally useful. You can find the pdf <a href=\"https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf\">here</a>&nbsp;or, if that link breaks, by googling \"Mathematics for Computer Science\". (See section 21.2 for why this works.)</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>MCS is regularly updated during the semester. Based on the dates of revision given to the cover, I suspect that the authors attempt to update it within a week of the last update during the semester. The current version is 87 pages longer than the 2015 version, suggesting ~40 pages of material is added a year. My favorite thing about the constant updates was that I never needed to double check statements about our current state of knowledge to see if anything had changed since publication.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>MCS is licensed under a Creative Commons attribution share-alike license: it is free in the sense of both beer and freedom. I'm a big fan of such copyleft licenses, so I give MIT major props. I've tried to remain unbiased in my review, but halo effect suggests my views on the text might be affected by the text's license: salt accordingly.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n</div>\n<h1>Prerequisites</h1>\n<p>The only prerequisite is single-variable calculus. In particular, I noted integration, differentiation, and convergence/infinite sums coming up. That said, I don't remember seeing them coming up in sections that provided a lot of dependencies: with just a first course in algebra, I feel a smart 14-year-old could get through 80&ndash;90% of the book, albeit with some help, mostly in places where \"do a bunch of algebra\" steps are omitted. An extra 4&ndash;5 years of practice doing algebraic manipulations makes a difference.</p>\n<p>MCS is also an introduction to proofwriting. In my experience, writing mathematical proofs is a skill complex enough to require human feedback to get all the nuances of why something works and why something else doesn't work and why one approach is better than another. If you've never written proofs before and would like a human to give you feedback, please pm me.</p>\n<h1>Comparison to Other Discrete Math Texts</h1>\n<h2>Rosen</h2>\n<p>I randomly sampled section 4.3 of Rosen, on primes and greatest common divisors and was very unimpressed. Rosen states the fundamental theorem of arithmetic without a proof. The next theorem had a proof which was twice as long and half as elegant as it could have been. The writing was correct but unmotivating and wordy. For instance, Rosen writes \"If n is a composite integer\", which is redundant, since all composite numbers are integers, so he could have just said \"If n is composite\".</p>\n<p>In the original <a href=\"/lw/g9l/course_recommendations_for_friendliness/\">Course Recommendations for Friendliness Researchers</a>, Louie <a href=\"/lw/g9l/course_recommendations_for_friendliness/88yl\">responded</a>&nbsp;to Rosen's negative reviews:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>people taking my recommendations would be geniuses by-and-large and that the harder book would be better in the long-run for the brightest people who studied from it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on the sample I read, Rosen is significantly dumbed-down relative to MCS. Rosen does not prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic whereas MCS proves it in section 9.4. For the next theorem, Rosen gives an inelegant proof when a much sleeker&mdash;but reasonably evident!&mdash;proof exists, making it feel like Rosen expected the reader to not be able to follow the sleeker proof. Rosen's use of \"composite integer\" instead of \"composite\" seems like he assumes the reader doesn't understand that the only objects one describes as composite are integers; MCS does not contain the string \"composite integer\".</p>\n<p>In the section I read, Rosen has worked examples for finding gcd(24, 36) and gcd(17, 22), something I remember doing when I was 12. It's almost like Rosen was spoon-feeding how to <a href=\"/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/\">guess the teacher's password</a> for the student to regurgitate on an exam instead of building insight.</p>\n<h2>Concrete Mathematics</h2>\n<p>There are probably individuals who would prefer <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> to MCS. These people are probably into witchcraft.</p>\n<p>I explain by way of example. In section 21.1.1, MCS presents a very sleek, but extremely nonobvious, proof of gambler's ruin using a clever argument courtesy of Pascal. In section 21.1.2, MCS gives a proof that doesn't require the reader to be \"as ingenuious Pascal [sic]\". As an individual who is decidedly not as ingenious as Pascal was, I appreciate this.</p>\n<p>More generally, say we want to prove a theorem that looks something like \"If A, then B has property C.\" You start at A and, appealing to the definition of C, show that B has it. There's probably some cleverness involved in doing so, but you start at the obvious place (A), end in the obvious place (B satisfies the definition of C), and don't rely on any crazy, seemingly-unrelated insights. Let's call this sort of proof <em>mundane</em>.</p>\n<p>(Note that mundane is far from mechanical. Most of the proofs in Baby Rudin are mundane, but require significant cleverness and work to generate independently.)</p>\n<p>There is a virtue in mundane proofs: a smart reader can usually generate them after they read the theorem but before they read its proof. Doing is beneficial, since proof-generating makes the theorem more memorable. It also gives the reader practice building intuition by playing around with the mathematical objects and helps them improve their proofwriting by comparing their output to a maximally refined proof.</p>\n<p>On the end of the spectrum opposing mundane is <em>witchcraft</em>. Proofs that use witchcraft typically have a step where you demonstrate you're as ingenious as Pascal by having a seemingly-unrelated insight that makes everything easier. Notice that, even if you are as ingenious as Pascal, you won't necessarily be able to generate these insights quickly enough to get through the text at any reasonable pace.</p>\n<p>For the reasons listed above, I prefer mundane proofs. This isn't to say MCS is devoid of witchcraft: sometimes it's the best or only way of getting a proof. The difference is that MCS uses mundane proofs whenever possible whereas <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> invokes witchcraft left and right. This is why I don't recommend it.</p>\n<p>Individuals who are readily as ingenious as Pascal, don't want the skill-building benefits of mundane proofs, or prefer the whimsy of witchcraft may prefer <em>Concrete Mathematics</em>.</p>\n<h2>Epp</h2>\n<p>I randomly sampled section 12.2 of Epp and found it somewhat dry but wholly unobjectionable. Unlike Rosen, I felt like Epp was writing for an intelligent human being (though I was reading much further along in the book, so maybe Rosen assumed the reader was still struggling with the idea of proof). Unlike <em>Concrete Mathematics</em>, I detected no witchcraft. However, I felt that Epp had inferior motivation and was written less engagingly. Epp is also not licensed under Creative Commons.</p>\n<h2>Coverage</h2>\n<p>Epp, Rosen, and MCS are all ~1000 pages long, whereas <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> is ~675. To determine what these books covered that might not be in MCS, I looked through their table of contents' for things I didn't recognize. The former three have the same core coverage, although Epp and Rosen go into material you would find in <em>Computability and Logic</em> or Sipser (also part of the research guide), whereas MCS spends more time developing discrete probability. Based on the samples I read, Epp and MCS have about the same density, whereas Rosen spends little time building insight and a lot of time showing how to do really basic, obvious stuff. I would expect Epp and MCS to have roughly the same amount of content covering mostly (but not entirely) the same stuff and Rosen to offer a mere shadow of the insight of the other two.</p>\n<p><em>Concrete Mathematics</em> seems to contain a subset of MCS's topics, but from the sections I read, I expect the presentation to be wildly different.</p>\n<h1>Complaints</h1>\n<p>My only substantial complaint about MCS is that, to my knowledge, the source LaTeX is not available. Contrast this to SICP, which has the HTML available. This resulted in a proliferation of PDFs tailored for different use cases. It'd be nice, for instance, to have a print-friendly version of MCS (perhaps with fewer pages), plus a version that fit nicely onto the small screen of an ereader or mobile device, plus a version with the same aspect ratio as my monitor. This all would be extremely easy to generate given the source. It would also facilitate crowdsourcing proofreading: there are more than a few typos, although they don't preempt comprehension. At the very least, I wish there were somewhere to submit errata.</p>\n<p>Some parts of MCS were notation-heavy. To quote what a professor once wrote on a problem set of mine:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure all the notation actually serves the goal of clarifying the argument for the reader. Of course, such notation is sometimes needed. But when it is not needed, it can function as a tool with which to bludgeon the reader&hellip;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found myself referring to Wikipedia's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms\">glossary of graph theory terms</a> more than a few times when I was making definitions to put into Anki. Not sure if this is measuring a weak section or a really good glossary or something else.</p>\n<h2>A Note on Printing</h2>\n<p>A lot of people like printed copies of their books. One benefit of MCS I've put forward is that it's free (as in beer), so I investigated how much printing would cost.</p>\n<p>I checked the local print shops and Kinko's online was unable to find printing under $60, a typical price around $70, with the option to burn $85 if I wanted nicer paper. This was more than I <a href=\"http://www.mcafee.cc/Introecon/notes.html\">had expected</a> and between ⅓ and &frac12; (ish) the price of Rosen or Epp.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think printing is counterproductive, since the PDF has clickable links.</p>\n<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>\n<p>Despite sharing first names, I am not Richard Stallman. I prefer the license on MCS to the license on its competitors, but I wouldn't recommend it unless I thought the text itself was superior. I would recommend baby Rudin (nonfree) over French's <a href=\"http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/misc/index.shtml\">Introduction to Real Analysis</a>; Hoffman and Kunze's Linear Algebra (nonfree) over Jim Hefferson's <a href=\"http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/\">Linear Algebra</a>; and Epp over 2010!MCS. The freer the better, but that consideration is trumped by the quality of the text. When you're spending &gt;100 hours working out of a book that provides foundational knowledge for the rest of your life, ~$150 and a loss of freedom is a price many would pay for better quality.</p>\n<p>Eliezer <a href=\"http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/post/81447230971/my-april-fools-day-confession\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tell a real educator about how Earth classes are taught in three-month-sized units, and they would&rsquo;ve sputtered and asked how you can iterate fast enough to learn how to teach that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rosen is in its seventh edition. Epp is in its fourth edition and Concrete Mathematics its second. The earliest copy of MCS I've happened across comes from <a href=\"https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos341/handouts/mathcs.pdf\">2004</a>. Near as I can tell, it is improved every time the authors go through the material with their students, which would put it in its 25th edition.</p>\n<p>And you know what? It's just going to keep getting better faster than anything else.</p>\n<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>\n<p>Thank you to Gram Stone for reviewing drafts of this review.</p>",

It would also highlight why such an agreement cannot be reached in the sleeping beauty problem.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Balls In Urns(BIU):</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong></strong> Suppose there is a urn filled with either 2 blue balls and 1 red ball(BBR) or 2 red balls and a blue ball(BRR) with equal chances. Andy randomly picked 2 balls from the urn and finds one ball of each colour. He correctly conclude the probability of BBR is 1/2, same as the probability of BRR. Afterwards Bob asked for a red ball and was given one, he then randomly picked 1 ball from the 2 remaining balls in the urn and saw a blue one. He correctly concluded the probability of BBR is 2/3. It turns out however Andy and Bob actually saw the exact same 2 balls. The two of them are free to communicate and argue. Suppose both of them are rational can they reach to an agreement? Who should change his answer? </em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We can use a frequentist approach to solve this problem. Suppose the experiment is repeated many times with equal number of BBR and BRR. We can count the total number of occurrences when they both see the same 1 red and 1 blue balls. The relative frequency of BBR and BRR among these occurrences would indicate the correct probability. Both Andy and Bob should have no problem agreeing with this method. Here it becomes apparent that the exact procedure of the experiment determines whose initial probability is correct and who need to adjust his answer. More specifically how is the red ball given to Bob determined.</p>\n<p>Scenario 1: The red ball picked by Andy is always given to Bob. In this case Andy is correct, Bob should adjust his answer of BBR from 2/3 to 1/2. This is because for both BBR and BRR Andy has the same chance to pick a red and a blue ball. Given the same red ball Andy has Bob would have equal chance to pick the same blue ball again regardless the colour of the last ball left. The relative frequency of BBR and BRR given the occurrences (that they both have the same 1 red and 1 blue balls), would be about the same.</p>\n<p>Scenario 2: Any red ball in the urn can be given to Bob. In this case Bob&rsquo;s initial judgement is correct and Andy would have to change his probability for BBR to 2/3. Because all else equal, Bob is twice more likely to have the same red ball as Andy if there is only 1 red ball in the urn. The relative frequency of BBR to BRR with the occurrences would be 2:1.</p>\n<p>Since only one out of the two Scenarios can be true Andy and Bob must agree with each other as long as there is no ambiguity about the experiment procedure.</p>\n<p>However, if we duplicate Bob (either by cloning or memory wiping) in the case of BRR and give each Bob a different red ball suddenly both Scenarios become true. To Andy the red ball he picked will always be given to Bob. To Bob the red ball given to him can be any one from the urn. Neither person would have reason to adjust his own probability once knowing they have the same balls while fully knowing the experiment procedure. So Andy would stick his probability of BBR to 1/2 and Bob to 2/3. In this case the the two person having exact same information will remain in disagreement even if they are free to communicate. I believe the parallel between this duplication and sleeping beauty problem is obvious enough to show why the selector and beauty, just as Andy and Bob, can be in disagreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next part of my argument discuss why Elga's counter argument to traditional halfers is valid. Which concludes SSA as incorrect. And why by considering the importance of perspective disagreement I must concluded double-halving as the correct answer.&nbsp;</p>",

It&#8217;s quite fun and is more insightful than you would think. I&#8217;ll assume below that you&#8217;ve watched at least the explanation of the first two laws.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8535\"></span></p>\n<p>Choices Reduce Perceived Value</p>\n<p>If I give you a snickers bar you value at a dollar, you feel like you got a free dollar. It&#8217;s easy, all you&#8217;re thinking is &#8216;free Snickers bar, sweet.&#8217; If I give you a choice between a snickers bar and some M&amp;Ms that you value at sixty cents, you still feel like you got a free snickers bar, which is a lot like getting a free dollar (since in this example you value it at a dollar). The trick is, now you had to start with &#8216;free candy, sweet&#8217; to &#8216;which of these do I want more?&#8217; and then to &#8216;the Snickers bar is forty cents better.&#8217;</p>\n<p>When you finish this sequence, even if you know exactly what you want, you are left with the feeling of making a choice where you did better by forty cents. Most people typically don&#8217;t quantify these effects, but in my model they often still do have the gut feelings involved.</p>\n<p>Even worse, you might be thinking &#8216;I had a choice of candy and I chose the Snickers bar&#8217; and comparing the value of the Snickers bar not to the value of the M&amp;Ms, but to <em>the value of a choice of two candies. </em>Now things get dangerous. You could reasonably value <em>a choice of candies </em>very close to or higher than a dollar! If you are thinking Choices Are Good rather than Choices Are Bad, you could even think of the optionality as being worth <em>more </em>than the choice you eventually make, and now you got a free candy bar and potentially actually feel <em>bad </em>about it, because you <em>lost value. </em>You might even get tricked into thinking about how what you really wanted was a Milky Way, or a banana.</p>\n<p>The more you were forced into choosing mode, the more the choice was a <em>real choice requiring consideration, </em>the more you end up thinking in this way. This is why the two identical Snickers bars is mostly just a funny joke; your brain hopefully does not go into choosing mode, because it notices there is no reason to do so, and stays in &#8216;free candy, sweet.&#8217; Similarly, if you have a well-established rank order and your brain didn&#8217;t register the option to take the M&amp;Ms, you mostly get to avoid the problem and enjoy your Snickers bar. However, if you stopped and thought for a few seconds, you could be in trouble, and if you think for a while, the cost of that thinking starts to factor in as well, making things even worse. Time spent on a choice makes you feel worse about all the wasted time, <em>and </em>you feel worse because you judge the final outcome against a higher standard.</p>\n<p>A movie you would have enjoyed if it was just on makes you feel like a schmuck if you take twenty minutes choosing it from thousands at the video store.</p>\n<p>Search your feelings. You know it to be true.</p>\n<p>Choice Hijacks You into Choosing Mode</p>\n<p>When you have a choice, you must stop what you&#8217;re doing, and choose.</p>\n<p>Choosing is hard. You probably need to figure out what all your choices are, figure out at least vaguely how good they are, and choose one of them.</p>\n<p>That sounds like work, which is bad (citation needed, but writing it seemed like work, and again, work is bad).</p>\n<p>At a minimum, you need to figure out what one of your choices is, and choose that one.</p>\n<p>Making a random slash arbitrary choice might not be hard (although sometimes it is) but first you have to choose to choose at random. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnxkfLe4G74\">If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice</a>. There&#8217;s no escape! You certainly don&#8217;t want to be making <a href=\"http://pickatrandom.com/\"><em>that </em>choice</a> at <a href=\"https://www.random.org/clock-times/\">random times</a>!</p>\n<p>While this sounds petty, it&#8217;s important because making a choice takes you into choosing mode. You reorient, gather information, decide if the choice matters, decide how much it matters, then actually work on making the choice.</p>\n<p>When you finish, you&#8217;ve often lost your old thread entirely.</p>\n<p>If the choice could really matter, this process could get really expensive. It is very easy to not only get taken out of what you are doing, but then to spend quite a bit of time and effort on decisions even when those decisions barely matter. Making a wrong decision is not only risky and bad due to object level consequences, it also risks <em>being wrong </em>and being wrong is <em>just awful. </em></p>\n<p>When you force someone to choose, even a trivial choice, you&#8217;re imposing a real cost <em>even if they do not care. </em>Forcing them to change modes is expensive.</p>\n<p>Avoid this, and staying out of choosing mode, is vital to many tasks. Stop choosing how to do the thing and do the thing!</p>\n<p>An important task in this class is relaxation. This is a lot of why hypnosis is so relaxing. Relaxing requires extended periods without choice. I have a lot of trouble relaxing, and I realized recently that a lot of this is about my being bad at deliberately front loading and then avoiding choices. Choices are bad.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/thezvi.wordpress.com/8535/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/thezvi.wordpress.com/8535/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thezvi.wordpress.com&#038;blog=21007166&#038;post=8535&#038;subd=thezvi&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

I've yet to see any other person argue as well for half so radical a claim.

He also has nine main pieces of evidence for his model:<br /><br />1. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/\" target=\"_blank\">Some early modern maps have inversed latitude and longitude</a><br />2. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/2/\" target=\"_blank\">Modern polyconic maps show more accurate sizes and shapes</a><br />3. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/3/\" target=\"_blank\">19th century balloon observations (that is, without an intervening medium) gave the impression of a concave surface</a><br />4. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/4/\" target=\"_blank\">4,000 foot plumb lines reportedly were farther away from each other at the bottom of a mine shaft</a><br />5. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/5/\" target=\"_blank\">A laser shot between two posts (over water) seems to curve downwards</a><br />6. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/6/\" target=\"_blank\">An old rectilineator experiment indicates a concave surface</a> (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.lhup.edu/%7Edsimanek/hollow/morrow.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the experiment has been criticized here</a>)<br />7. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/7/\" target=\"_blank\">Radar and radio wave horizons cannot be explained on a convex ball</a><br />8. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/8/\" target=\"_blank\">Ships disappearing below the horizon are an optical illusion</a><br />9. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/9/\" target=\"_blank\">Light bends upwards, which allows for the rising/setting illusion of the sun and moon</a><br /><br />I would really like to know what people here have to say about this, since the comments on the site itself are very disappointing.

They notice opportunities for improvement and innovation where someone else only sees stress and pain. Similarly, while a typical person enters a living room and sees the couches and artwork on the walls, a parent of a young child perceives a menagerie of death traps.

These powerful recurring waves of hallucination affect us to the core: how we see and how we experience. The world takes on a different character&nbsp;when we are hungry in contrast to when we are cold and wet.&nbsp;We develop new ways of seeing as we are exposed to more complex patterns: being unemployed or playing a game of chess. At times, we glimpse perspectives of overwhelming curiosity and open-mindedness &mdash; fertile soil for our capacity for reason. Unfortunately, we often overestimate this capacity, causing us to fool ourselves and others, and get stuck in the same old ways of thinking and perceiving.</p>\n<div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">The way we experience and&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">how we look</em>&nbsp;are two sides of the same coin.

The purpose is perhaps not a cause but rather a justification: a way that we understand, or talk about, the behaviors we undertake.

    "htmlBody": "<p class=\"p1\">Recently, James_Miller <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p9e/sam_harris_and_scott_adams_debate_trump_a_model/#comments\">posted</a>&nbsp;a conversation between Sam Harris and Scott Adams about Donald Trump. James_Miller titled it \"a model rationalist disagreement\". While I agree that the tone in which the conversation was conducted was helpful, I think Scott Adams is a top practitioner of the Dark Arts. Indeed, he often prides himself on his persuasion ability. To me, he is very far from a model for a rationalist, and he is the kind of figure we rationalists should know how to fight against.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here are some techniques that Adams uses:</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Changing the subject</strong>: (a) Harris says Trump is unethical and cites the example of Trump gate-crashing a charity event to falsely get credit for himself. Adams responds by saying that others are equally bad&mdash;that all politicians do morally dubious things. When Harris points out that Obama would never do such a thing, Adams says Trump is a very public figure and hence people have lots of dirt on him. (b) When Harris points out that almost all climate scientists agree that climate change is happening and that it is wrong for Trump to have called climate change a hoax, Adams changes the subject to how it is unclear what economic policies one ought to pursue if climate change is true.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Motte-and-bailey</strong>: When Harris points out that the Trump University scandal and Trump's response to it means Trump is unethical, Adams says that Trump was not responsible for the university because it was only a licensing deal. Then Harris points out that Trump is unethical because he shortchanged his contractors. Adams says that that&rsquo;s what happens with big construction projects. Harris tries to argue that it&rsquo;s the entirety of Trump&rsquo;s behavior that makes it clear that he is unethical&mdash;i.e., Trump University, his non-payment to contractors, his charity gate-crashing, and so on. At this points Adams says we ought to stop expecting ethical behavior from our Presidents. This is a classic motte-and-bailey defense. Try to defend an indefensible position (the bailey) for a while, but then once it becomes untenable to defend it, then go to the motte (something much more defensible).</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Euphemisation</strong>: (a) When Harris tells Adams that Trump lies constantly and has a dangerous disregard for the truth, Adams says, I agree that Trump doesn&rsquo;t pass fact checks. Indeed, throughout the conversation Adams never refers to Trump as lying or as making false statements. Instead, Adams always says, Trump &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t pass the fact checks&rdquo;. This move essentially makes it sound as if there&rsquo;s some organization whose arbitrary and biased standards are what Trump doesn&rsquo;t pass and so downplays the much more important fact that Trump lies. (b) When Harris call Trump's actions morally wrong, Adams makes it seem as if he is agreeing with Harris but then rephrases it as: &ldquo;he does things that you or I may not do in the same situation&rdquo;. Indeed, that's Adams's constant euphemism for a morally wrong action. This is a very different statement compared to saying that what Trump did was wrong, and makes it seem as if Trump is just a normal person doing what normal people do.&nbsp;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Rather than debate the substance of Harris&rsquo;s claims, Adams will often embark on a diagnosis of Harris&rsquo;s beliefs or of someone else who has that belief. For example, when Harris says that Trump is not persuasive and does not seem to have any coherent views, Adams says that that's Harris's \"tell\" and that Harris is \"triggered\" by Trump's speeches. Adams constantly diagnoses Trump critics as seeing a different movie, or as being hypnotized by the mainstream media. By doing this, he moves away from the substance of the criticisms.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Excusing</strong>: (a) When Harris says that it is wrong to not condemn, and wrong to support, the intervention of Russia in America&rsquo;s election, Adams says that the US would extract revenge via its intelligence agencies and we would never know about it. He provides no evidence for the claim that Trump is indeed extracting revenge via the CIA. He also says America interferes in other elections too. (b) When Harris says that Trump degraded democratic institutions by promising to lock up his political opponent after the election, Adams says that was just a joke. (c) When Harris says Trump is using the office of the President for personal gain, Adams tries to spin the narrative as Trump trying to give as much as possible late in his life for his country.&nbsp;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Cherry-picking evidence</strong>: (a) When Harris points out that seventeen different intelligence agencies agreed that Russia&rsquo;s government interfered in the US elections, Adams says that the intelligence agencies have been known to be wrong before. (b) When Harris points out that almost all climate scientists agree on climate change, Adams points to some point in the 1970s where (he claims) climate scientists got something wrong, and therefore we should be skeptical about the claims of climate scientists.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p2\">Overall, I think what Adams is doing is wrong. He is an ethical and epistemological relativist: he does not seem to believe in truth or in morality. At the very least, he does not care about what is true and false and what is right and wrong. He exploits his relativism to push his agenda, which is blindingly clear: support Trump.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">(Note: I wanted to work on this essay more carefully, and find out all the different ways in which Adams subverts the truth and sound reasoning. I also wanted to cite more clearly the problematic passages from the conversations. But I don't have the time. So I relied on memory and highlighted the Dark Arts moves that struck me immediately. So please, contribute in the comments with your own observations about the Dark Arts involved here.)</p>\n<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #454545} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #454545; min-height: 14.0px} li.li1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #454545} ol.ol1 {list-style-type: decimal} --></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>(Tldr: If you want a bunch of neighbors like me in Berkeley, this is a good opportunity.)</em></p>\n<p>My own ideal living situation would probably involve a lot of private units containing people who get on well together, around some kind of central place that they could go when they were in the market for seeing other people. And pragmatically, with a lot of shared amenities: someone mowing everyone&#8217;s lawn at once, someone cooking for whoever wants it, one amazing washing machines replacing five shoddy washing machines etc. I liked living in a dorm, though I would amend some things.</p>\n<p>My impression is that <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/or0/i_want_to_live_in_a_baugruppe/\">other</a> people also want this kind of thing often, but that very little of it exists for adults. Possibly for good reasons, but I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n<p>One relatively close institution is the group house. And while I had mixed experiences in these prior to moving to the Bay, I have loved the slightly modified version, the &#8216;rationalist group house&#8217;. This is like the group house, but with members selected from a social scene whose people are especially likely to be interesting and weird in compatible ways to me.</p>\n<p>Two years ago I decided to try to make an extra good (for me) rationalist house, by inviting a list of people I especially wanted to live with to start a new one. This led (via some more complicated algorithmic and experimental shenanigans) to The Bailey, which has indeed been pretty great. It is the sort of place where there is always someone interesting to talk to about something interesting—from gossip to AI to this week&#8217;s ambitious world-bettering plans. And where people are busy, but will often stop and eat together, whether it be a bulk-stocked MealSquare, or some delicious and elaborate home-cooked thing. Where people will talk for an hour about how communication works before they lose their temper with you for messing it up. Where the dog is cute and the internal currency is confusing, and the whiteboards are many.</p>\n<p>Another nearby institution—a step up in scale from the rationalist house—would be the rationalist neighborhood. And that is what we are starting to try now around The Bailey (on Ward St, Berkeley), to my great excitement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/20/classified-thread-2-best-in-classified/\">SSC says more</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>SSC is part of a wider movement of philosophy enthusiasts, transhumanists, effective altruists, etc which has somehow ended up with the simultaneously boring and arrogant moniker of “the rationalist community”. We’ve developed a small intellectual/social scene in the SF Bay Area, with a few hundred interesting people who hang out together and cooperate on various projects. Since rent in the Bay is so high, a lot of the rationalists there are living in group houses, which have become nuclei for social events and cooperation.</p>\n<p>Four of these have ended out clustered on Ward Street in Berkeley, and we’re thinking we might as well try to accelerate this and turn the area into a center of the community. We’ve been trying to snatch up houses in the area, and we just got dibs on four houses immediately adjacent to the existing rationalist cluster that are currently available for rent:</p>\n<p>1. A five bedroom house for ~$5500/month, available now<br />\n2. A four bedroom house for ~$4200/month, available now<br />\n3. A seven-to-eight bedroom house, cost to be determined, available 9/1/17<br />\n4. A three bedroom house for ~$3100/month, available now (not adjacent to existing cluster; a few blocks away)</p>\n<p>All of these are owned by the same landlord, who we’ve previously found pretty reasonable. They’re all kind of old and not going to win any Modern Architectural Design awards or even Especially Well Maintained awards, but we think (investigations still ongoing) that they’re basically solid and in good shape. Pictures and viewings available on request.</p>\n<p>We’re currently looking for people who might be interested, either in renting entire houses, or in taking single rooms in what will probably become group houses. Existing community members are of course welcome to apply, but so is anyone who’s reading this and who thinks the idea sounds interesting. If interested, contact katja.s.grace[at]gmail[dot]com for more information and to arrange viewings, etc.</p>\n<p>(disclaimer: I enjoyed living in the Bay Area, but I can’t deny that the prices are terrible, the local politics absurd, and the density at just the right level to frustrate lovers of big cities and quiet suburbs alike. Experiences with the rationalist community there vary widely, from people who say it was life-changingly good to people who found it disappointing and difficult to get into. The housing situation here might make it easier to get into, but no guarantees)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Readers of <em>this</em> who think the idea sounds interesting are also welcome to apply.</p>\n<p><strong>What you should do</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you might be interested in living in the Ward St neighborhood soon, write to me at katja.s.grace[cat]gmail[dot]com.

    "htmlBody": "<p>Among rationalist thinkers the subagent theory of psyche is popular: <a href=\"http://www.rationality.org/\">CFAR</a> teaches a version of <a href=\"https://www.selfleadership.org/outline-of-the-Internal-family-systems-model.html\">internal family systems (IFS)</a>, Max Harms writes <a href=\"http://crystal.raelifin.com/\">AI fiction from the point of view of a subagent</a>, Brienne <a href=\"http://sovereignsblog.tumblr.com/post/158053798789/what-are-facets-for\">describes herself</a> as <a href=\"http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-people-in-my-head-who-make-me-do.html\">metaphorically made up of multiple people</a>, Alicorn seems to have been the first rationalist to <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/20r/city_of_lights/\">explicitly suggest the idea</a>, the notion goes back to our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind\">intellectual forebearers</a>, and <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/not-yet-gods/\">nearly</a> <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/531/how_you_make_judgments_the_elephant_and_its_rider/\">everyone</a> <a href=\"http://elephantinthebrain.com/\">seems</a> <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2017/02/19/the-monkey-and-the-machine-a-dual-process-theory/\">to use</a> a subagent interpretation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory\">dual process theory</a> at the least. Yet although I&#x2019;ve <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/a-foundation-for-the-multipart-psyche-79a66292a7a\">previously explored</a> multi-part theories of psyche, I don&#x2019;t think of these parts as subagents. Instead, as I&#x2019;ve <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/revealed-and-stated-identity-64c6ec070f4f\">hinted at</a>, I think of the psyche primarily as a unified <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/nothing-is-forbidden-but-some-things-are-good-b57f2aa84f1b\">optimization process with inconsistent preferences</a> that does not decompose into subagents. I didn&#x2019;t always think this way, though, and have at times thought of myself and others as made up of different configurations of subagents, so I want to explore some of how I came to give up subagent theories and see what value they may still hold.</p><p>Stepping back to start, what do rationalists mean by subagents of the psyche? &#x201C;Agent&#x201D; has roughly the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_%28economics%29\">economic sense</a> of a process that makes decisions, but we should understand &#x201C;decision&#x201D; to include any kind of behavior, including thoughts, so in the context of theories of psyche &#x201C;agent&#x201D; is a rough synonym for &#x201C;person&#x201D; or &#x201C;mind&#x201D;. A subagent, then, is an agent operating inside of another agent, forming a system of agents that externally present as a single agent. Explaining how subagents work in IFS should make this clearer.</p><p>IFS is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model\">psychoanalytic model</a> that, to my reading, originates from thinking of the Freudian id, ego, and superego like three homunculi competing to control the mind, but replaces the id, ego, and superego with groups of subagents serving exile, firefighter, and manager roles, respectively. These roles differer in both subtle and obvious ways from their inspirational forms, but the basic idea is that exiled subagents are those that would create undesired thoughts and behaviors, managers are subagents that work to keep undesired thoughts and behaviors from occurring, and firefighters are subagents that work to mitigate suffering when exiled subagents gain enough strength to influence a person&#x2019;s behavior. The psyche can then be thought of like a walled city where managers act as sentries to keep the exiles out and, when exiles inevitably make it inside, the firefighters serve as the garrison that chases the exiles out.</p><p>Rationalist thinkers have mostly dropped the Freudian shape of IFS, but they keep the idea of the psyche as a family of subagents. Rather than specifically exiled, firefighting, and managing subagents, the subagents are more often associated with observed aspects of an individual person&#x2019;s psyche and given attribute names like Lazy, Ambition, Face, and Pride. This internal family is frequently, when first identified, dysfunctional and fighting, corresponding to feelings of cognitive dissonance and conflicting desires. Through the application of various trainable techniques, though, the psychic family can be made functional and happy. Many people I know have expressed finding great value in this model, and they are living more satisfying lives through understanding themselves in this way.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve, however, never much felt like I was made up of many subagents, and when I was introduced to the idea it seemed to me <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/what-value-epicycles-f8358678a23a\">insufficiently parsimonious</a> because it seems to suppose the existence of neurological subprocess different from those that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170818/\">appear to exist</a>. Instead for most of my life I&#x2019;ve felt like my &#x201C;I&#x201D;&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;my psyche&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;was a homunculus trying to control a vast, semi-autonomous machine. This is to say my experience matches the description of <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/of-two-minds-when-making/\">dual process theory</a>, sometimes referred to in this way as the conscious and subconscious, System 1 and System 2, or as the rider and elephant. The rider is an inner process that is the true self (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein\">Dasein</a> if I&#x2019;m generous; the <a href=\"https://meaningness.com/metablog/bad-ideas-from-dead-germans\">authentic self</a> if I&#x2019;m not) and the elephant is an outer process that interacts with the world. The elephant is able to act on its own and has its own ideas about what to do, though, so the rider must make an active effort to direct the elephant. Dual process theory has some <a href=\"http://www.bobspunt.com/papers/pdf/Spunt_2015_DualProcessTheories.pdf\">biological</a> and <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2017/02/19/the-monkey-and-the-machine-a-dual-process-theory/\">evolutionary</a> support, but even in the absence of that it&#x2019;s correlated with <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/developmental-psychology-in-the-age-of-ems-6f159f701354\">construal level theory</a>, so this seems a potentially useful model.</p><p>But thinking of yourself as a rider and elephant can be highly dissociative. I often felt like I wasn&#x2019;t in control of myself and that I <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion\">depleted my ego</a> to do what I wanted. I thought of myself as suffering from <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Akrasia\">akrasia</a> because I could exhaust a lot of willpower trying to direct the elephant to little effect. And I lived like this from circa age 10 until I was 30. But as I transitioned from thinking in terms of <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9\">systems to system relationships</a>, the separation I felt between rider and elephant dissolved. Rather than being made up of two parts, it felt more and more like I was made up of just one. I could still see the shapes of the rider and the elephant, but now I could understand their interactions. This eventually <a href=\"http://gworley3.github.io/\">led me</a> to a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gworley3/holonic-integration-927ba21d774b\">holonic interpretation</a> of the psyche where there are no distinct parts, but, as we&#x2019;ll see, there are many details.</p><p>That&#x2019;s because the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_%28philosophy%29\">holon</a> of my psyche can&#x2019;t have no stuff in it: I know too much about how the brain works to really think of it as a black box. But I can understand it as a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/ozz/gearsness_of_understanding/\">box full of gears</a>, where the <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/revealed-and-stated-identity-64c6ec070f4f\">gears are preferences</a> that interlock, sometimes harmonizing and sometimes grinding, and their combined motions produce my actual behavior. Being a holon, it&#x2019;s hardly clear exactly how the gears interact, but we have <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality:_From_AI_to_Zombies\">enough clues</a> about the arrangement that it&#x2019;s possible to use it to make some predictions, not so strong that they risk <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/what-value-epicycles-f8358678a23a\">cracking the epicycles</a> and not so weak that we can claim anything. Unfortunately this theory makes heavy demands for <a href=\"https://meaningness.com/nebulosity\">ontological complexity</a> when applied, thus it&#x2019;s likely not that useful to most folks seeking <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/the-personal-growth-cycle-34ec1c218615\">personal development</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, it&#x2019;s given me insight into the value others find in many-subagent theories of psyche when viewed through the lens of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego-state_therapy\">ego states</a> or &#x201C;masks&#x201D;. In <em>Impro</em>, Keith Johnstone describes the theatrical tradition of mask work where performers don masks and &#x201C;become&#x201D; the character a mask embodies, sometimes entering a trance where they forget themselves and effectively are the mask&#x2019;s character. When the psyche is viewed as a box of preferences this has a straightforward interpretation: the mask is a filter for expressing a subset of preferences. And if that&#x2019;s the case, then we can see psychic subagents as masks that reify subsets of preferences into agents.</p><p>In this light subagent theories of psyche make a lot of sense. Rather than being made up of many subagents, each subagent is a mask that allows a person to make salient their preferences that are normally lost in the cacophony of competing desires. By switching between masks you can give voice to the parts of yourself that are often ignored and even <a href=\"http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-people-in-my-head-who-make-me-do.html\">let the subagents talk to each other</a>. But because these masks <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/p80/in_praise_of_fake_frameworks/\">apply an ontology on top of a simpler system that can explain itself without them</a>, subagents truly are like epicycles: they produce correct predictions, they are easier to work with than the full calculus of preference mechanics, and do this despite not describing reality parsimoniously.</p><p>So although I never did and no longer need to think of myself as made up of many subagents, I can understand them as an <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/the-developmental-role-of-play-443549cfed3b\">extremely useful form of play</a>. My desire is then that they act as a bridge for people to <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/the-personal-growth-cycle-34ec1c218615\">develop more complete understanding</a> of themselves.</p>",

They do exist within change space.</p>\n<p>Change space, like mind space, is deep and wide. Friendly change space isn&#8217;t quite to change space what friendly mind space is to mind space, but before you apply any filters of common sense, it&#8217;s remarkably close.</p>\n<p>The more optimized things currently are, the less likely any given change is to be good.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8325\"></span></p>\n<p>The more time people have had to optimize other things around the current state of the thing you are trying to change, the less likely any given change is to be good.</p>\n<p>The more effort people have put into optimizing other things, based on the thing you are looking to change, the less likely any given change is to be good. You could break a lot of things.</p>\n<p>When you break those things, you cause harm. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion\">Since people hate losses more than they love gains</a>, even a net improvement can make a person or group feel worse off.</p>\n<p>If you do break things, often they stay broken. It is usually a lot harder to build or repair something than it is to break that thing.</p>\n<p>The faster and bigger you make changes, the more other things you are likely to break, and the more critically you will break them. At a minimum, even when your change is strictly for the better, those things then must change to adapt. In many cases, they are broken entirely, beyond repair, and this goes on to break other things.</p>\n<p>Modern life is highly optimized. It&#8217;s far from perfect. Often it is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">optimizing for the <em>wrong </em>things</a>. Nevertheless, it is highly, <em>highly </em>optimized. We certainly do not lack for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTkuPf7ZPVAhXMaT4KHSe1C-sQFgg4MAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHill_climbing&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXJdRR0XsSFSOfayIIV2oDV0m5PQ\">hill climbers</a>. In some ways it is <em>too </em>optimized!</p>\n<p>If I currently have a highly optimized package of things, such as a house or apartment (which is implicitly a collection of things tied to my location), often I will have put a lot of work and sunk costs into the current package of goods I&#8217;ve assembled, so breaking up that package or adding new things to it is pretty bad if I still need to pay market price. You can easily make everything better, and still mostly make things worse until equilibrium establishes itself again.</p>\n<p>Older people have had more time to optimize and have less time to optimize again, so it makes sense that they hate change even more than others. They should.</p>\n<p>Seriously, though, before you go around talking about how everything is awful and we need to call for revolution and change everything right away because the world is a nightmare, I would like to remind you that things are <em>really, really good right now relative to baseline.</em> We have a lot of nice things, even if we&#8217;re having trouble building new ones. More people than ever, in absolute and in percentage terms, have high technology, connection, information and entertainment. More of us have enough food and water and shelter and peace and prosperity, and we mostly have our freedom and mostly get along pretty well all things considered.</p>\n<p>Respect that. Do not screw with this lightly.</p>\n<p>By all means, get mad about the planetary death rate and the people who are still starving. Get mad about housing costs and lack of employment opportunities and infection rates. Rage at the irrationality of it all. Realize that unless we do something to prevent it, unfriendly artificial general intelligence will probably destroy all value in the universe. We might want to do something about that.</p>\n<p>First, count your blessings.</p>\n<p>Once that&#8217;s done, yes, we need change. The only constant is change, other things are changing and breaking your things, forcing them too to change, and all that. We&#8217;re all slowly dying of old age and forces move to wipe out all value in the universe, plus we&#8217;re getting pretty tired of the same old restaurants and albums and TV shows.</p>\n<p>So what are we to do?</p>\n<p>First of all, we don&#8217;t choose our change at random.

It mainly involves a counter example to SIA and Thirdism.</p>\n<p>Different part of the argument can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p8z/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">I</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p9d/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">II</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p9t/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">III</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/pae/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">IV</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The 81-Day Experiment(81D):</strong></p>\n<p><em>There is a circular corridor connected to 81 rooms with identical doors. At the beginning all rooms have blue walls. A random number R is generated between 1 and 81. Then a painter randomly selects R rooms and paint them red. Beauty would be put into a drug induced sleep lasting 81 day, spending one day in each room. An experimenter would wake her up if the room she currently sleeps in is red and let her sleep through the day if the room is blue. Her memory of each awakening would be wiped at the end of the day. Each time after beauty wakes up she is allowed to exit her room and open some other doors in the corridor to check the colour of those rooms. Now suppose one day after opening 8 random doors she sees 2 red rooms and 6 blue rooms. How should beauty estimate the total number of red rooms(R).</em></p>\n<p>For halfers, waking up in a red room does not give beauty any more information except that R&gt;0. Randomly opening 8 doors means she took a simple random sample of size 8 from a population of 80. In the sample 2 rooms (1/4) are red. Therefore the total number of red rooms(R) can be easily estimated as 1/4 of the 80 rooms plus her own room, 21 in total.</p>\n<p>For thirders, beauty's own room is treated differently.As SIA states, finding herself awake is &nbsp;as if she chose a random room from the 81 rooms and find out it is red. Therefore her room and the other 8 rooms she checked are all in the same sample. This means she has a simple random sample of size 9 from a population of 81. 3 out of 9 rooms in the sample (1/3) are red. The total number of red rooms can be easily estimated as a third of the 81 rooms, 27 in total.</p>\n<p>If a bayesian analysis is performed R=21 and R=27 would also be the case with highest credence according to halfers and thirders respectively. It is worth mentioning if an outside Selector randomly chooses 9 rooms and check them, and it just so happens those 9 are the same 9 rooms beauty saw (her own room plus the 8 randomly chosen rooms), the Selector would estimate R=27 and has the highest credence for R=27. Because he and the beauty has the exact same information about the rooms their answer would not change even if they are allowed to communicate. So again, there will be a perspective disagreement according to halfers but not according to thirders. Same as mentioned in part I.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, thirder's estimation is very problematic. Because beauty believes the 9 rooms she knows is a fair sample of all 81 rooms (since she used it in statistical estimation), it means red rooms (and blue rooms) are not systematically over- or under-represented. Since beauty is always going to wake up in a red room, she has to conclude the other 8 rooms is not a fair sample. Red rooms have to be systematically underrepresent in those 8 rooms. This means even before beauty decides which doors she wants to open we can already predict with certain confidence that those 8 rooms is going to contains less reds than the average of the 80 suggests. This supernatural predicting power is a strong evidence against SIA and thirding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The argument can also be structured this way. Consider the following three statements:</p>\n<p>A: The 9 rooms is an unbiased sample of the 81 rooms.</p>\n<p>B: Beauty is guaranteed to wake up in a red room</p>\n<p>C: The 8 rooms beauty choose is an unbiased sample of the other 80 rooms.</p>\n<p>These statements cannot be all true at the same time. Thirders accept A and B meaning they must reject C. In fact they must conclude the 8 rooms she choose would be biased towards blue. This contradicts the fact that the 8 rooms are randomly chosen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(EDIT Aug 1. I think the best answer thirders shall give is accept C since it is obviously a simple random sample. Adding another red room to this will make the 9 rooms biased from his perspective. However they can argue if a selector saw the same 9 rooms through random selection then it is unbiased from the selector's perspective. Thirders could argue she must answer from the selector's perspective instead of her own. Main reason being she is undergoing potential memory wipes so her perspective is somewhat \"compromised\". However, with this explanation thirder must confirm the perspective disagreement between beauty and the selector about whether or not the 9 rooms are biased. It also utilize perspective reasoning followed. In another word perspective disagreement is not unique to halfers and shall not be treated as a weakness.)</p>\n<p>It is also easy to see why beauty should not estimate R the same way as the selector does. There are about 260 billion distinct combinations to pick 9 rooms out of 81. The selector has a equal chance to see any one of those 260 billion combinations. Beauty on the other hand could only possibility see a subset of the combinations. If a combination does not contains a red room, beauty would never see it. Furthermore, the more red rooms a combination contains the more awakening it has leading to a greater chance for a beauty to select the said combination. Therefore while the same 9 rooms is a unbiased sample for the selector it is a sample biased towards red for beauty.</p>\n<p>(EDIT Aug 1. We can show this another way. Let the selector, halfer beauty and thirder beauty do a large number repeated estimation on the same set of rooms. The selector and halfer's estimations would be concentrated around the true value of R, where as thirders answer would be concentrated on some value larger.)</p>\n<p>One might want to argue after the selector learns a beauty has the knowledge of the same 9 rooms he should lower his estimation of R to the same as beauty&rsquo;s. After all beauty could only know combinations in a subset biased towards red. The selector should also reason his sample is biased towards red. This argument is especially tempting for SSA supporters since if true it means their answer also yields no disagreements. Sadly this notion is wrong, the selector ought to remain his initial estimation. To the selector a beauty knowing the same 9 rooms simply means after waking up in one of the red rooms in his sample, beauty made a particular set of random choices coinciding said sample. It offers him no new information about the other rooms. This point can be made clearer if we look at how people reach to an agreement in an ordinary problem. Which would be shown by another thought experiment in the next part. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Part III can be found at <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p9t/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>EDIT: It seems this is not getting much attention except for part II with the counter example to SIA. Let me try to intrigue you in to reading this. It provides a systematic argument for double halving in the sleeping beauty problem, if my reasoning is correct and perspective disagreement is indeed the key, we can rejects Doomsday Argument, and disagree with the Presumptuous Philosopher also reject the Simulation Argument.My argument is quite long but the concept is not hard to understand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Different part of the argument can be found here: <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p8z/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">I</a>, <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p9d/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">II</a>, <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p9t/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">III</a>, <a href=\"/r/discussion/lw/pae/sleeping_beauty_problem_can_be_explained_by/\">IV</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First thing I want to say is that I do not have a mathematics or philosophy degree. I come from an engineering background. So please forgive me when I inevitably messed up some concept. Another thing I want to mention is that English is not my first language. If you think there is any part that is poorly described please point them out. I would try my best to explain what I meant. That being said, I believe I found a good explanation for the SBP. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>My main argument is that in case of the sleeping beauty problem, agents free to communicate thus having identical information can still rightfully have different credence to the same proposition. This disagreement is purely caused by the difference in their perspective. And due to this perspective disagreement, SIA and SSA are both wrong because they are answering the question from an outsider's perspective which provides different answer from beauty's. I concluded that the correct answer should be double-halving.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My argument involves three thought experiments. Here I am breaking it into several parts to facilitate easier discussion. The complete argument can also be found at <a href=\"http://www.sleepingbeautyproblem.com\">www.sleepingbeautyproblem.com</a>. However do note it is quite lengthy and not very well written due to my language skills.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First experiment:<strong>Duplicating Beauty (DB)</strong></p>\n<p><em>Beauty falls asleep as usual. The experimenter tosses a fair coin before she wakes up. If the coin landed on T then a perfect copy of beauty will be produced. The copy is precise enough that she cannot tell if herself is old or new. If the coin landed on H then no copy will be made . The beauty(ies) will then be randomly put into two identical rooms. At this point another person, let's call him the Selector, randomly chooses one of the two rooms and enters. Suppose he saw a beauty in the chosen room. What should the credence for H be for the two of them?&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>For the Selector this is easy to calculate. Because he is twice more likely to see a beauty in the room if T, simple bayesian updating gives us his probability for H as 1/3.</p>\n<p>For Beauty, her room has the same chance of being chosen (1/2) regardless if the coin landed on H or T. Therefore seeing the Selector gives her no new information about the coin toss. So her answer should be the same as in the original SBP. If she is a halfer 1/2, if she is a thirder 1/3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This means the two of them would give different answers according to halfers and would give the same answer according to thirders. Notice here the Selector and Beauty can freely communicate however they want, they have the same information regarding the coin toss. So&nbsp;halving would give rise to a perspective disagreement even when both parties share the same information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This perspective disagreement is something unusual (and against Aumann's Agreement Theorem), so it could be used as an evidence against halving thus supporting Thirdrism and SIA. I would show the problems of SIA in the second thought experiment. For now I want to argue that this disagreement has a logical reason.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let's take a frequentist's approach and see what happens if the experiment is repeated, say 1000 times. For the Selector, this simply means someone else go through the potential cloning 1000 times and each time let him chooses a random room. On average there would be 500 H and T. He would see a beauty for all 500 times after T and see a beauty 250 times after H. Meaning out of the 750 times 1/3 of which would be H. Therefore he is correct in giving 1/3 as his answer.</p>\n<p>For beauty a repetition simply means she goes through the experiment and wake up in a random room awaiting the Selector's choice again. &nbsp;So by her count, taking part in 1000 repetitions means she would recall 1000 coin tosses after waking up. &nbsp;In those 1000 coin tosses there should be about 500 of H and T each. She would see the Selector about 500 times with equal numbers after T or H. Therefore her answer of 1/2 is also correct from her perspective.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Edit Aug 1. I think this is the easiest way to see the relative frequency from beauty's perspective: Ignore the clones first, if someone experienced 1000 coin toss she would expect to see 500 Heads. Now consider how the cloning would affect her conclusion. If there is a T somewhere along the tosses thus a clone is created, both the original and the clone would have remembered exactly the same tosses happened earlier. They would also have the same expectation about coin tosses after they split. So the cloning &nbsp;does not changes her answer. Therefore after beauty wakes up remembering a large number of tosses she shall expect about half of those landed in Heads. She does not have to consider when she is physically cloned or if she is the original to reach this conclusion.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a more complicated way would be to think about all the coin tosses happened and her own position. For example a beauty is experiencing two coin tosses there are several ways this can happen from a third party's perspective:</p>\n<p>1. H-H: Both coin tossing landed on H. There is a 1/4 chance for this happening. Beauty experience 2 Hs.</p>\n<p>2. H-T: H and then T. There is a 1/4 chance for this happening. Doesn't matter if the beauty is any one of the two at the end she experienced 1H and 1T.</p>\n<p>3. T-(H,H): First toss landed on T and both resulting beauties experience H at the second toss. There is 1/8 chance, doesn't matter if beauty is any one of the two, she experienced 1 H and 1T.</p>\n<p>4. T-(H,T): First coin landed on T and a H and T happened at the second round of tosses respectively. There is 1/4 chance. Half the time (1/8) beauty experienced 1H and 1T, while the other half (1/8) she experienced 2 Ts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. T-(T,T): All tosses landed on T. There is 1/8 chance, doesn't matter which second toss is hers beauty experienced 2Ts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The expected number of H from beauty's perspective: (1/4)x2+(1/4)x1+(1/8)x1+(1/8)x1=1: half the number of tosses. Obviously this calculation can be generalized to a greater number of tosses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both the above methods correctly gives the relative frequency from beauty's perspective. The most common mistake is for a beauty to think she is equally likely to be any one of the beauties at the end of multiple coin tosses. This seemingly intuitive conclusion is valid from a third party's (the selector's) perspective, aka if he randomly chooses one from all the ending beauties then all beauties are in symmetrical position. However from beauty's first person perspective the ending beauties are not in symmetrical position especially since they have experienced different coin toss results. edit finish)</p>\n<p>If we call the creation of a new beauty a \"branch off\", here we see that from Selector's perspective experiments from all branches are considered a repetition. Where as from Beauty's perspective only experiment from her own branch is counted as a repetition. This difference leads to the disagreement.</p>\n<p>This disagreement can also be demonstrated by betting odds. In case of T, choosing any of the two rooms leads to the same observation for the Selector: he always sees a beauty and enters another bet. However, for the two beauties the Selector's choice leads to different observations: whether or not she can see him and enters another bet. So the Selector is twice more likely to enter a bet than any Beauty in case of T, giving them different betting odds respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(EDIT Aug 1. I am aware there are lots of discussions about bets with beauty. Eg. When is the bet settled, base on whose record is it settled, when does beauty pays for the bets and when can she cancels the bet etc. If we consider the importance of perspective disagreement and both party must agree on the bet then these is only one simple way to setup the bet. The bet is settled after each coin toss, it is payed and received at the same time. Beauty's money clones with her. This way cumulatively both selector's and beauties's money would be in accordance with their win/loss record. If this bet is entered whenever the selector sees a beauty in the chosen room then the different betting odds mentioned above would observed. edit ends)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The above reasoning can be easily applied to original SBP. Conceptually it is just an experiment where its duration is divided into two parts by a memory wipe in case of T. The exact duration of the experiment, whether it is two days or a week or five hours, is irrelevant. Therefore from beauty&rsquo;s perspective to repeat the experiment means her subsequent awakenings need to be shorter to fit into her current awakening. For example, if in the first experiment the two possible awakenings happen on different days, then the in the next repetition the two possible awakening can happen on morning and afternoon of the current day. Further repetitions will keep dividing the available time. Theoretically it can be repeated indefinitely in the form of a supertask. By her count half of those repetitions would be H. Comparing this with an outsider who never experiences a memory wipe: all repetitions from those two days are equally valid repetitions. The disagreement pattern remains the same as in the DB case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PS: Due to the length of it I'm breaking this thing into several parts.

    "htmlBody": "<p>Notes :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Epistemy\" refers to the second meaning of <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epistemology\">epistemology</a>&nbsp;: \"A particular theory of knowledge\".</li>\n<li>I'm more interested in ideas to further the thoughts exposed here than exposing them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Good Experiments</span></h2>\n<p>The point of \"<a href=\"/lw/p5z/priors_are_useless/\">Priors are useless</a>\" is that if you update after enough experiments, you tend to the truth distribution regardless of your initial prior distribution (assuming its codomain doesn't include 0 and 1, or at least that it doesn't assign 1 to a non-truth and 0 to a truth). However, \"enough experiments\" is magic :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The pure quantitative aspect : you might not have time to do these experiments in your lifetime.</li>\n<li>Having independent experiments is not defined. Knowing which experiments are pairwise independent embeds higher-level knowledge that could easily be used to derive truths directly. If we try to prove a mathematical theorem, comparing the pairwise success probability correlations of different approaches would give much more insights and results than trying to prove it as usual.</li>\n<li>We don't need pairwise independence. For instance, assuming we assume P=/=NP because we couldn't prove it, we assume so because we expect all used techniques not to be all correlated together. However, this expectation is ether wrong (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disproved_mathematical_ideas\">Small list of fairly accepted conjectures that were later disproved</a>), or stems from higher-order knowledge (knowledge about knowledge). Infinite regress.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Good Priors</h2>\n<p>However, conversely, having a good prior distribution is magic too. You can have a prior distribution affecting 1 to truths, and 0 to non-truths. So you might want the additional requirement that the prior distribution has to be computable. But there are two problems :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There aren't many known computable prior distribution. Occam's razor (in term of Kolmogorov complexity in a given language) is one. But fails miserably in most interesting situations. Think of poker, or a simplified version thereof : <a href=\"https://ibmathsresources.com/2014/02/08/the-mathematics-of-bluffing/\">A+K+Q</a>. If someone bets, the simplest explanation is that he has good cards. Most interesting situations where we want to apply bayesianism are from human interactions (we managed to do hard sciences before bayesianism, and we still have troubles with social sciences). As such, failing to take into account bluff is a big epistemic fault for a prior distribution.</li>\n<li>Evaluating the efficiency of a given prior distribution will be done over the course of several experiments, and hence requires a higher order prior distribution (a prior distribution over prior distributions). Infinite regress.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Epistemies</h2>\n<p>In real-life, we don't encounter these infinite regresses. We use epistemies. An epistemy is usually a set of axioms, and a methodology to derive truths with these axioms. They form a trusted core, that we can use if we understood the limits of the underlying meta-assumptions and methodology.</p>\n<p>Epistemies are good, because instead of thinking about the infinite chain of higher priors every time we want to prove a simple statement, we can rely on an epistemy. But they are regularly not defined, not properly followed or not even understood. Leading to epistemic faults.</p>\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n<p>As such, I'm interested in the following :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When and how do we define new epistemies ? Eg, \"Should we define an epistemy for evaluating the Utility of actions for EA ?\", &nbsp;\"How should we define an epistemy to build new models of human psychology ?\", etc.</li>\n<li>How to account for epistemic changes in Bayesianism ? (This requires self-reference, which Bayesianism lacks.)</li>\n<li>How to make sense of of Scott Alexander's yearly predictions ? Is it only a blackbox telling us to bet more on future predictions, or do we have a better analysis ?</li>\n<li>What prior distributions are interesting to study human behavior ? (For a given restricted class of situations, of course.)</li>\n<li>Are answers to the previous questions useful ? Are the previous questions meaningful ?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm looking for ideas and pointers/links.</p>\n<p>Even if your thought seems obvious, if I didn't explicitly mention it, it's worth commenting it. I'll add it to this post.</p>\n<p>Even if you only have idea for one of the question, or a particular criticism of a point made in the post, go on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this far.</p>",

Putting it up here as a reminder, a point to bear in mind, and in case someone else wants to pick it up.</em></p>\n<p>Forecasting using gamblers (a.k.a. logical induction generalized outside of logic, a.k.a. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04630\">dominant forecasting</a>)* can be regarded as a generalization of Bayesian inference, however it seem qualitatively less computationally tractable than Bayesian inference. Bayesian inference for a modest number of efficiently computable hypotheses (i.e. hypotheses that allow computing the conditional probability distribution of the next observation efficiently; this is a stronger requirement than efficient samplability) is efficiently computable. On the other hand, computing a dominant forecaster seems intractable even for a modest number of efficiently computable gamblers, since it amounts to finding a fixed point which is a problem that is often <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathrm{PPAD}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">P</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">P</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">A</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">D</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>-equivalent.</p>\n<p>However, it occurred to me that there is a fairly large class of gamblers for which the problem is tractable, in particular it probably includes gamblers for incomplete models.

This should be possible to remedy either by \"smoothing\" the KR distance or by considering subgradients and multivalued gamblers**.</p>\n<p>*We need a better name for this. \"Logical induction\" sounds specific to formal logic, and \"dominant forecasting\" is too generic. My ideas so far are \"mercantile forecasting\" and \"Dutch forecasting\". Also, we might want a special name for the incomplete models version as opposed to the fully general gamblers version.</p>\n<p>**More generally, it seems possible to incorporate multivalued gamblers into the formalism e.g. using Lassonde's fixed point <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022247X9090092T\">theorem</a>.</p>\n</body></html>",

AI alignment research will tend to look at the higher levels of what the system of humans and computers is doing.  Thus, it is strategy for doing good things with humans and computers.</p>\n<p>\"Doing good things with humans and computers\" is a broad class.  Computing machines have been around a long time, and systems of humans involving rules computed by humans have been around much longer.  Looking at AI alignment as strategy will bring in intuitions from domains like history, law, economics, and political philosophy.  I think these intuitions are useful for bringing AI strategy into near mode.</p>\n<h2>Paul Christiano's agenda as strategy</h2>\n<p>Paul Christiano's agenda \"goes for the throat\" in ways that the other agendas, such as the agent foundations agenda, do not.  Thus, it yields an actual strategy, rather than a list of research questions about strategy.  I will now analyze Paul Christiano's research agenda as strategy.  Here I caricature Paul Christiano's strategic assumptions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There are 2 phases to agentic activity: an influence-maximizing phase, and a value-fulfillment phase.</li>\n<li>Any strategy can be decomposed into (a) the expansion strategy (the strategy for the influence-maximizing phase) and (b) the payload (the strategy for the value-fulfillment phase), which can vary independently in principle.</li>\n<li>The power of an agent after the influence-maximizing phase is a function of its starting power and the effectiveness of its expansion strategy.</li>\n<li>An outcome is good if the vast majority of power after the influence-maximizing phase is owned by agents whose payload is good.</li>\n<li>Almost  all powerful actors start with good values, i.e. they intend to select a good payload.</li>\n<li>Selecting a good payload is not hard (e.g. specifying a social arrangement that would reflect and arrive at good moral conclusions)</li>\n<li>Powerful actors can't coordinate with each other; they must expand independently.</li>\n<li>Powerful actors with bad values exist.</li>\n<li>Good powerful actors can anticipate and copy bad powerful actors' expansion strategies while retaining the same payload.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These assumptions are a caricature of Paul's assumptions in that, though they aren't completely reflective of Paul's actual views, they strongly state the background philosophy implied by Paul's research agenda.</p>\n<p>From these assumptions, it is possible to derive that a decent strategy for good actors is to anticipate bad actors' expansion strategies and copy them while retaining the same payload.  This corresponds to Paul's general approach: look at a proposed system that would do a bad thing, then create an equally powerful system that would instead do a good thing.</p>\n<p>Here are some thoughts on these assumptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think the \"expansion/value-fulfillment\" split is broadly correct for highly-programmable, fully-automated systems and broadly incorrect for systems involving humans.  E.g. humans can be corrupted by power.</li>\n<li>I think powerful actors can coordinate with each other.  In some sense, altruism derives from coordination strategies, so altruists ought to be more able to cooperate than non-altruists.</li>\n<li>I think that thinking of power as unidimensional is highly misleading.  For example, it is possible to distinguish \"amount of resources\" from \"knowledge about the world\".  Those with more knowledge can be influential even without resources, and even without gaining many resources along the way.  (Gaining resources can worsen epistemics by increasing the incentives to deceive the person with resources)</li>\n<li>I think most powerful interests today are not \"good\" in the sense of \"would probably select a good payload\", mostly because most powerful interests do not have good epistemics about such abstract ideas.  Thus, good actors will need to use asymmetric strategies, not just symmetric ones.  (Due to our current state of philosophical confusion, it seems somewhat likely that <em>no one</em> is currently a good actor in this sense)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ALBA competes with adversaries who use only learning</h2>\n<p>Paul Christiano has <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/not-just-learning-e3bfb5a1f96e\">acknowledged</a> that ALBA only works for aligning systems that work through learning, and does not work for aligning systems that use hard-to-learn forms of cognition (e.g. search, logic).  Roughly, ALBA will copy the <em>part</em> of a system's strategy that is explainable by the system's learning, i.e. that is explaining by the system modelling the world as a set of nested feedback loops.  Object recognition is fine, because there's feedback for that; philosophy is not fine, because there isn't feedback for that.  (Humans can provide feedback about philosophy, but human philosophy is not fully explained by this feedback, e.g. the human giving the feedback needs their own strategy).</p>\n<p>The world isn't a set of nested feedback loops.  Agents don't just learn, they reason.  The philosophy of empiricism is more appropriate for an investor, who tries to pick up on signs of a successful project based on limited information and reasoning, than for an entrepreneur, who engages in object-level reasoning in order to actually run a successful project.</p>\n<p>To be more concrete, there are multiple ways humans could believe that some AI system would be quite powerful without this belief being justified solely on the basis that the AI system does learning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps the AI system is organized very similarly to a human brain, and humans have reason to believe that it will behave similarly, even though they haven't fully explained the brain's intelligence as a form of learning.</li>\n<li>Perhaps the AI system is produced through natural selection in a single large world that is difficult to split into smaller worlds without losing efficiency.  (If the world can be split, then the different worlds could possibly be treated as \"different hypotheses\" productively)</li>\n<li>Perhaps humans understand reasoning better and can create a system that reasons according to humans' understanding of reasoning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of these are the kind of \"ML technology\" that ALBA uses, so they could not be analyzed effectively enough that ALBA could produce an equivalent.</p>\n<p>The last time I talked with Paul, he was aware of these problems.  My recollection of his thoughts on these problems are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He thinks that solving alignment for learning systems is more urgent and the correct first step for solving alignment in general.</li>\n<li>He thinks that it might be possible to see processes such as evolution as a combination of selection and deliberation, and that this analysis might yield enough analysis for producing aligned versions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ALBA is not amenable to formal analysis</h2>\n<p>Some parts of ALBA can't be formally analyzed very well with our current level of philosophical sophistication.  For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyzing <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34\">capability amplification</a> requires modeling humans as computationally-bounded agents.  There is not currently a model of agents under which a scheme like <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/strong-hch-bedb0dc08d4e\">HCH</a> would work, and even if there were, showing that humans are such an agent would be quite a challenge.</li>\n<li>Analyzing <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/the-informed-oversight-problem-1b51b4f66b35\">informed oversight</a> similarly requires modeling humans as computationally-bounded agents.</li>\n<li>Analyzing <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/red-teams-b5b6de33dc76\">red teams</a> likewise requires modeling the capabilities of the red team versus the learning system.</li>\n<li>In general, formally analyzing \"power\" would require formally analyzing decision theory and logical uncertainty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notably, the kind of agents for which analyzing capability amplification makes sense are <em>not</em> the kind of agents that ALBA aligns.  ALBA aligns learning systems, and humans' reasoning over time is deliberation rather than learning.  I think this is the root of a lot of the difficulty of formally analyzing ALBA.</p>\n<h2>Plausibility arguments are hard to act on</h2>\n<p>ALBA is based on plausibility arguments: it's plausible that capability amplification works, it's plausible that informed oversight works, and it's plausible that red teams work.  These questions are actually pretty hard to research.</p>\n<p>Recently I have updated towards a generalization of this: plausibility arguments are very often hard to act on, since the belief that \"X is plausible\" does not usually come attached to a strong model implying X is probably true, and these strong models are necessary for generating proofs.  (Sometimes, plausibility arguments are sufficient to act on, especially in \"easy\" domains such as mathematics and puzzle games where there exist search procedures for proving or disproving X.  But AI alignment doesn't seem like one of these domains to me.)</p>\n<h2>Agreement with many of Paul's intuitions</h2>\n<p>This post so far gives the impression that I strongly disagree with Paul.  I do disagree with Paul, but I also strongly agree with many of his intuitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think that \"going for the throat\" by trying to solve the whole alignment problem is quite useful, though other approaches should also be used (since \"going for the throat\" will tend to produce intractable research problems).</li>\n<li>I think that <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">corrigibility</a> as Paul understands it will turn out to be an important tool for analyzing human-computer systems.</li>\n<li>I think that splitting an AI system into an expansion strategy and a payload is sometimes useful, and in particular is usually more illuminating than splitting it into beliefs and values.</li>\n<li>I think that thinking about the big strategic picture and the limiting behavior of a system, as Paul does, is useful.</li>\n<li>I think that Paul Christiano's research is quite helpful for reasoning about learning and control systems; for example, counterfactual oversight seems very useful for handling epistemic problems discussed in <a href=\"http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/expert.pdf\">He Who Pays The Piper Must Know The Tune</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I have presented my thoughts on ALBA.  ALBA has significantly improved my conceptual understanding of AI alignment, but is seriously incomplete and difficult to make further theoretical progress on.  I don't know how to make much additional theoretical progress on the alignment problem at this point, but perhaps taking some steps back from specific approaches and doing original seeing on alignment would yield new directions.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>[epistemic status: I was going to do a lot of research for this post, but I decided not to as there are no sources on the internet so I'd have to interview people directly and I'd rather have this post be imperfect than never exist.]<br /><br />Many words have been written about how LessWrong is now shit. Opinions vary about how shit exactly it is. I refer you to http://lesswrong.com/lw/n0l/lesswrong_20/ and http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5z/on_the_importance_of_less_wrong_or_another_single/ for more comments about LessWrong being shit and the LessWrong diaspora being suboptimal.<br /><br />However, how to make LessWrong stop being shit seems remarkably simple to me. Here are the steps to resurrect it:<br /><br />1. Get Eliezer: The lifeblood of LessWrong is Eliezer Yudkowsky's writing. If you don't have that, what's the point of being on this website? Currently Eliezer is posting his writings on Facebook, (https://www.facebook.com/groups/674486385982694/) which I consider foolish, for the same reasons I would consider it foolish to house the Mona Lisa in a run-down motel.<br /><br />2. Get Scott: Once you have Eliezer back, and you sound the alarm that LW is coming back, I'm fairly certain that Scott \"Yvain\" Alexander will begin posting on LessWrong again. As far as I can tell he's never wanted to have to moderate a comment section, and the growing pains are stressing his website at the seams. He's even mused publicly about arbitrarily splitting the Slate Star Codex comment section in two (http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/09/ot73-i-lik-the-thred/) which is a crazy idea on its own but completely reasonable in the context of (cross)posting to LW. Once you have Yudkowsky and Yvain, you have about 80% of what made LessWrong not shit.<br /><br />3. Get Gwern: I don't read many of Gwern's posts; I just like having him around. Luckily for us, he never left!<br /><br />After this is done, everyone else should wander back in, more or less.<br /><br />Possible objections, with replies:<br /><br />Objection: Most SSC articles and Yudkowsky essays are not on the subject of rationality and thus for your plan to work LessWrong's focus would have to subtly shift.<br /><br />Reply: Shift away, then! It's LessWrong 2! We no longer have to be a community dedicated to reading Rationality: From AI to Zombies as it's written in real time; we can now be a community that takes Rationality: From AI to Zombies as a starting point and discusses whatever we find interesting! Thus the demarcation between 1.0 and 2.0!<br /><br />Objection: People on LessWrong are mean and I do not like them.<br /><br />Reply: The influx of new readers from the Yudkowsky-Yvain in-migration should make the tone on this website more upbeat and positive. Failing that, I don't know, ban the problem children, I guess. I don't know if it's poor form to declare this but I'd rather have a LessWrong Principate than a LessWrong Ruins. See also: http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/against_online_pacifism/<br /><br />Objection: I'd prefer, for various reasons, to just let LessWrong die.<br /><br />Reply: Then kill it with your own hands! Don't let it lie here on the ground, bleeding out! Make a post called \"The discussion thread at the end of the universe\" that reads \"LessWrong is over, piss off to r/SlateStarCodex\", disallow new submissions, and be done with it! Let it end with dignity and bring a close to its history for good.</p>",

In DIRL, the agent can, at any point of time, delegate the choice of action to an \"advisor\". The agent knows neither the environment nor the reward function, whereas the advisor knows both. Thus, DIRL can be regarded as a special case of CIRL. A similar setting was studied in <a href=\"https://web.cs.umass.edu/publication/docs/1997/UM-CS-1997-026.pdf\">Clouse 1997</a>, but as far as we can tell, the relevant literature offers few theoretical results and virtually all researchers focus on the MDP case (<em>please correct me if I'm wrong</em>). On the other hand, we consider general environments (not necessarily MDP or even POMDP) and prove a natural performance guarantee.</p>\n<p>The use of an advisor allows us to kill two birds with one stone: learning the reward function and safe exploration (i.e. avoiding both the Scylla of \"<a href=\"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Leike15.pdf\">Bayesian paranoia</a>\" and the Charybdis of falling into traps). We prove that, given certain assumption about the advisor, a Bayesian DIRL agent (whose prior is supported on some countable set of hypotheses) is guaranteed to attain most of the value in the slow falling time discount (long-term planning) limit (assuming one of the hypotheses in the prior is true). The assumption about the advisor is quite strong, but the advisor is not required to be fully optimal: a \"soft maximizer\" satisfies the conditions. Moreover, we allow for the existence of \"corrupt states\" in which the advisor stops being a relevant signal, thus demonstrating that this approach can deal with wireheading and avoid manipulating the advisor, at least in principle (the assumption about the advisor is still unrealistically strong). Finally we consider advisors that don't know the environment but have some <em>beliefs</em> about the environment, and show that in this case the agent converges to Bayes-optimality w.r.t. the advisor's beliefs, which is arguably the best we can expect.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All the proofs are in the Appendix.</p>\n<h1>Notation</h1>\n<p>The set of natural numbers <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\Nats\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

In general, this seems much too strong: by the time corruption occurs, the agent might have already converged into accurate beliefs about the universe that allow it to detect the corruption and keep operating without the advisor. Even better, the agent can usually outperform <em>the worst possible policy</em> using the prior alone. Moreover, we can allow for corruption to depend on unobservable random events and differentiate between different degrees of corruption and treat them accordingly.

It is thus \"more rational\" than the required minimum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is easy to see that the Theorem can be generalized by introducing an external penalty (negative reward) for each time the agent delegates to the advisor: as it is, using the advisor already carries a penalty due to its suboptimal choice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The conditions of the Theorem imply that, in some sense, the advisor \"knows\" the true environment. This is unrealistic: obviously, we expect the human operator to have some (!) uncertainty about the world. However, we clearly cannot do away with this assumption: if the same action triggers a trap in some universes and is necessary for approaching maximal utility in other universes, and there is no observable difference between the universes before the action is taken, then there is no way to guarantee optimality. The prior knowledge you have about the universe caps the utility you can guarantee to obtain. On the other hand, as an AI designer, one can reasonably expect the AI to do at least as well as possible using the <em>designer's</em> own knowledge. If running the AI is the designer's best strategy, the AI should be close to Bayes optimal (in some sense that includes computational bounds et cetera: complications that we currently ignore) with respect to the designer's posterior rather than with respect to some simple prior. In other words, we need a way to transmit the designer's knowledge to the AI, without hand-crafting an elaborate prior.</p>\n<p>The following shows that the DIRL achieves this goal (theoretically, given the considerable simplifying assumptions).</p>\n<p>Given an environment <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mu\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">μ</span></span></span></span></span></span>, we define <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\hat{\\mu}: \\FH \\rightarrow [0,1]\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-munderover\"><span class=\"mjx-stack\"><span class=\"mjx-over\" style=\"height: 0.213em; padding-bottom: 0.06em; padding-left: 0.079em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\" style=\"vertical-align: top;\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">^</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-op\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">μ</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">:</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.021em;\">A</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">×</span></span><span class=\"mjx-texatom MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">O</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">∗</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">→</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">[</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">0</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">,</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space1\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">]</span></span></span></span></span></span> as follows.

Indeed, the optimality we get from the Theorem + Proposition 1 holds for any prior. However, the speed of convergence to optimality certainly depends on the prior.  It is therefore desirable to analyze this dependency and bound the damage an adversary can do by controlling a certain portion of the prior.

    "htmlBody": "<p>Want to improve your memory? Start a business? Fix your dating life?</p>\n<p>The chances are that out of the thousands upon thousands of books and blogs out there on each of these topics there are already several that will tell you all that you need. I'm not saying that this will immediately solve your problem - you will still need to put in the hard yards of experiment and practise - just that lack of knowledge will no longer be the limiting factor.</p>\n<p>This suggests if we want to be winning at life (as any good rationalist should), what is most important isn't creating brilliant and completely unprecedented approaches to solve these problems, but rather taking ideas that already exist.</p>\n<p>The first problem is recommendation - finding which out of all of the thousands of books out there are the most helpful for a particular problem. Unfortunately, recommendation is not an easy problem at all. Two people may both be dealing with procrastination problems, but what works for one person may not work for another person. Further, even for the same idea, it is incredibly subjective what counts as a clear explanation - some people may want more detail, others less, some people may find some examples really compelling, others won't. Recommendations are generally either one person's individual recommendations or those which recieved the highest vote, but there probably are other methods of producing a recommendation that should be looked into, such as asking people survey questions and matching on that, or asking people to rate a book on different factors.</p>\n<p>The second problem is adaption. Although you shouldn't need to create any new ideas, it is likely that certain elements will need more explanation and certain elements less. For example, when writing for the rationalist community, you may need to be more precise and be clearer when you are talking figuratively, rather than literally. Alternatively, you can probably just link people to certain common ideas such as the map and territory without having to explain it.</p>\n<p>I'll finish with a rhetorical question - what percent of solutions here are new ideas and what percentage are existing solutions? Are these in the right ratio?</p>\n<p>UPDATE: (Please note: This article is <em>not </em>about time spent learning vs. time spent practising, but about existing ideas vs. new ideas. The reason why this is the focus is because LW can potentially recommend resources or adapt resources, but it can't practise for you!).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

a day to contemplate the profound weirdness on display on that last chart, what conclusions can we draw?</p>\n<p>The basic study design and conclusion tell a story. The minimum wage goes up. In response, some jobs are eliminated, and other jobs have their wages increased to compensate, in order to keep relative wages in line. This cascading effect levels off at around $19/hour: At that point, the number of workers getting a raise to $19, and the number getting a raise from $19 to something higher (combined with the number that are fired, although that seems like it should be quite small), are equally sized, so the number of workers earning about $19 an hour should be the same as it would have been without the minimum wage increase, unless that increase has a big enough impact to throw off the entire local economy.</p>\n<p>If the average wage in the 13-19 range is not going up (if anything it is going slightly down) then that story doesn&#8217;t work. The distribution in the $13-$19 range remains about equal. If the upper end of the range isn&#8217;t going up, then neither is the lower end of the range.</p>\n<p>One of these claims is wrong, but which? Let&#8217;s do another calculation. I neglected to have a column for the % of workers earning $13-$19 an hour, but here it is:</p>\n<table width=\"128\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"64\">Quarters</td>\n<td width=\"64\">13-19%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>18.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>18.0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>17.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>18.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 4/1</td>\n<td>18.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 5/2</td>\n<td>18.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 6/3</td>\n<td>17.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 7/4</td>\n<td>19.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 8/5</td>\n<td>19.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 9/6</td>\n<td>18.9%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So here we see the number going up a little, as you would expect &#8211; the lower paid workers are being pushed up the wage scale, which should be bigger in this still-legal range than any negative effects.</p>\n<p>But now we have the fact that the lower end of the range is getting bigger, and the higher end is claimed to not be getting much bigger (at least, it should be getting bigger slower), but the average value inside the range isn&#8217;t going down. That&#8217;s not possible. Since we have verified that the share of all workers in this range is increasing, and that wages overall went up a lot (for those above $19/hour, they went up from $46/hour to $52/hour in two years, <em>much </em>more than the national average or inflation! Boom town USA!) I only see one conclusion.</p>\n<p>The increase in the minimum wage increased wages across the board. At a minimum, it did so far above $19/hour. The paper notes that this is unlikely, and I agree that this seems like it should be unlikely from the basic cascading raise mechanism. So this strongly suggests there is something else at work. Hold that thought.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as noted above, Seattle was booming. Seattle employment increased 13%, hours increased 15%, pay was up across the board, and the city had basically full employment the whole time.</p>\n<p>Employment under $19/hour declined from 28.8% to 23.4% of hours worked, but this was at a time of rising wages. Pay for those not at all constrained by the minimum wage increased from $46 to $52, and since the later group includes some &#8216;promotions&#8217; from the lesser group, if anything this is low-balling the increase at 13.3% if workforce composition stayed similar. If we simply assume that wages went up that much, and we already know we have a level distribution of wages between $13 and $19, then <em>fully 36% of those workers should now be over $19/hour </em>because the barrier is $16.81 previous wage! If we include the previously under $13 workers, we still get 22.6% of these jobs graduating to Over $19/hour due to rising overall wages!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s 6.5% of the hours worked. Previously, 28.8% of hours worked were under $13/hour. Now, 23.4% are, and if we add 6.5% to that we get&#8230; 29.9%! So now those old jobs have become a <em>greater </em>percentage of the workforce, <em>and </em>they&#8217;re earning more money per hour, <em>and </em>the overall workforce is expanding.</p>\n<p>This would reverse the results of the study completely. We now have a picture of Seattle as a boom town where everyone is doing well and the little guy is doing best of all.</p>\n<p>The only problems are that this is very, very difficult to reconcile with the data on what individual employers were actually doing, and is almost certainly being warped by a change in the composition of the population of Seattle, plus the paper does statistical analysis that needs to be explained.</p>\n<p>Also, priors.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Though it would be premature to make causal inferences on the basis of this single-differenced data, both headcount and hours data suggest that reduced low-wage employment can be apportioned primarily, but less than entirely, to wage<br />\nincreases.</p>\n<p>Over this same period, overall employment in Seattle expanded dramatically, by over 13% in headcount and 15% in hours. Table 3 makes clear that the entirety of this employment growth occurred in jobs paying over $19 per hour. The impression of skewed growth – driven in part by rapid growth in the technology sector – extends to wage data. Average hourly wages at jobs paying less than $19 rose from $14.14 to $15.01 (a 6.1% increase), while average hourly wages at all jobs surged from $36.93 to $44.04 (a 19.2% increase).</p></blockquote>\n<p>As we&#8217;ve already seen, I looked at the same numbers and agree that the difference is due to <em>wage increases </em>but that it can be entirely explained by <em>general wage increases across the board </em>rather than by a shift in the minimum wage.</p>\n<p>It seems simply incorrect to compare jobs &#8220;Under $19&#8221; in two periods where wage levels are clearly going up across the board (e.g. average job paying Over $19 going from $46/hour to $52/hour) and then claim that a reduction in jobs under $19/hour is a real reduction.</p>\n<p>I do find their arguments around the restaurant industry convincing, but only interesting insofar as they explain results from previous studies, so not worrying about that right now.  They then discard methods that don&#8217;t hold up to a placebo test, but select some methods they say hold up well. I am going to take them at their word that they executed these tests correctly, and that they did pass the placebo test.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Table 5 presents our first estimates of the causal impact of the Ordinance for workers earning less than $19 per hour. Looking at results using both the synthetic control and interactive fixed effects methods, we associate the first minimum wage increase, to $11, with wage effects of 1.4% to 1.9% (averaging 1.7%). The second increase, to $13, associates with a larger 2.8% to 3.6% wage effect (averaging 3.1%). A 3.1% increase in the wage of these workers corresponds to a $0.44 per hour relative to the base average wage of $14.14.34. We do not find strong evidence that wages rose in anticipation of enforcement during the three quarters following passage of the law. The small coefficients range from 0.3% to 0.7% and most are statistically insignificant.</p></blockquote>\n<p>During a period in which wages in Seattle overall rose 13.3%, they estimate a combined 4.8% increase for lower-paid workers due to the minimum wage increase. That magnitude of effect seems very easy to confuse with the overall rise in wages due to Seattle&#8217;s booming economy, which may or may not have otherwise evenly distributed gains. Given that the controls are what we can safely call Not Seattle, no matter how well we choose those controls from the Washington State area, it seems like there&#8217;s a lot of noise here.</p>\n<p>They note that their result here is smaller than other findings. My guess is that this can be at least somewhat explained by wages naturally rising quickly anyway, which should logically reduce the amount above that the law can boost low-wage wages.</p>\n<p>All their other findings similarly seem to fall apart if you assume that a large percentage of the Under $19 wages naturally rose into the Over $19 category and thus &#8216;low-wage employment&#8217; in an important sense did not decrease in Seattle even as a share of overall employment. If you buy that, then unless there were similarly booming other areas to use to construct the control, the control should fail. The fact that the control worked when tested on the past data, when Seattle was not booming in this way, doesn&#8217;t change that.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not worried too much about reconciling my observations with their methodology; I think I see how we came to disagree, and why the exact cutoff of $19 doesn&#8217;t matter. Jobs will be pushed up over any threshold you choose, and the mistake is making the threshold a constant over time. Their other worries and caveats are things to worry about, but not if you&#8217;ve already explained the result in another way, plus their answers to them seem strong.</p>\n<p>That leaves composition changes, survey results and priors.</p>\n<p>The survey problem comes from this footnote, which I quoted in part one, was a large part of my motivation to look at the data, and also seems rather important:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Seattle Minimum Wage Study surveyed over 500 Seattle business owners immediately before and a year after the Ordinance went into effect. In April 2015, multi-site employers were more likely to report intentions to reduce hours of their minimum wage employees (34% versus 24%) and more likely to report intentions to reduce employment (33% versus 26%). A one-year follow-up survey revealed that multi-location employers were more likely to report an actual reduction in full-time and part-time employees, with over half of multi-site respondents reporting a reduction in full-time employment (52%, against 45% for single-sit firms).</p></blockquote>\n<p>How do you respond to that? Even if the rest of the study can be explained away what the hell do you do with this? Half of all firms are cutting their full time minimum-wage workers, even more than were expecting to! If that&#8217;s true then how in the world could low-wage work not be devastated?</p>\n<p>The result might be wrong, but let&#8217;s assume it isn&#8217;t. If we also knew that low-wage employment didn&#8217;t go down, what happened?</p>\n<p>My answer is that some businesses cut low-wage jobs that no longer made sense, doing a combination of hiring higher-wage workers, extending hours for other workers, automation and simply doing less business. Meanwhile, other businesses are starting up and hiring those workers to do other things, because Seattle is booming and there are profitable things to do. I don&#8217;t even know that this is an unusual amount of churn. It seems like it is, but given that new firms by definition are always net hiring, and some old firms are also net hiring, it does not seem that crazy that you could see half of existing firms cutting low-wage jobs, and yet not lose net jobs when you count replacements in the $13-$19 range and other hiring.</p>\n<p>Doing additional surveys, and knowing more about the breakdown of how employment changes work, would be crucial in seeing if that story makes any sense or not. The numbers working out does seem rather implausible, and I wouldn&#8217;t expect a normal booming economy to result in half of firms eliminating minimum wage jobs within a few years, but perhaps I am wrong about that. It would make sense that minimum wage jobs tend to be more transitory than higher paying jobs.</p>\n<p>That would also tie into the changing composition of Seattle. A boom, and a general rise in wages and wealth, changes the demand for goods and services. Minimum wage jobs are likely to disproportionately be engaged in providing services to lower income customers, since higher income customers would prefer to pay more for higher quality goods and services, which means higher wages. So that effect might cause a lot of lower-end businesses to cut back or go out of business, reducing low-wage work, or to upgrade to higher-paid employees. Out with fast food, in with casual dining.</p>\n<p>The demographic shift could also explain the results if higher-skilled workers are coming to Seattle to enjoy the higher wages and booming economy, which lower-skilled workers are being driven out of the city because the minimum wage means they cannot find jobs and presumably also issues with rising housing costs. Thus, when it <em>looks </em>like the whole wage scale is moving up by 13.3%, that might not be what is happening.</p>\n<p>Instead, a lot of workers that get paid $50+ per hour are moving in (I have a friend who in fact took a great job in Seattle this past year, and falls into this category) and this drives averages up but doesn&#8217;t change the lived experience of any given person or the pay of any given job, since new high-end jobs are being created that don&#8217;t change what the currently average worker gets paid. That means that we can&#8217;t push a given person&#8217;s wage up 13.3% just because wages went up that much, which means we in turn do see a sharp decrease in low-wage work, which means that low-wage workers must be leaving since Seattle is remaining at full employment.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, Seattle is doing something that is in fact bad for workers previously earning minimum wage, because a lot of them are losing their jobs and even being driven out of the city (although some would be driven out anyway by increasing costs; you can also tell the story that the minimum wage isn&#8217;t that binding since no one could have survived on the old minimum in the new Seattle either way). Here, the decrease in jobs and hours is real, and low-wage workers are becoming unemployed and being forcibly relocated &#8211; and under a more universal minimum wage increase, they might become permanently unemployable, which would be very bad.</p>\n<p>Those stories then get reinforced by priors. The prior says that raising the minimum wage means you increase cost of low-wage labor, so demand goes down, and quantity declines. It&#8217;s hard to avoid that result, and simply saying &#8216;the data says that is not what happened&#8217; is not really good enough. Until you can explain <em>why </em>that is not what happened, you need to remain deeply suspicious.</p>\n<p>I do not think, even if my calculations are correct, that we can tell whether Seattle&#8217;s increase in the minimum wage helped or hurt low-wage workers. The paper&#8217;s result seems to be explained by overall rising wages, but those rising wages might be due to changes in the composition of the workforce, and in general the changes going on in Seattle seem too big, and too different from the surrounding areas, for us to be confident in what changed here as the result of the minimum wage increase compared to a counterfactual Seattle, or what effect that had on the rest of the state or country. If the things I am seeing do not have the effects I think they do (and there are several steps where I could be wrong or missing something), and using a constant threshold for low-wage workers still makes sense, then it is quite likely that the paper&#8217;s original conclusion is correct. If that is true, then even a $13 minimum wage is backfiring on low-wage workers in Seattle, and we need to avoid minimum wages that come anywhere near that high relative to an area&#8217;s overall price level (but could likely tolerate something that is the local equivalent of the $11 level). Anything more would be devastating.</p>\n<p>But what if the confounding effects I have considered are small, and my main line of exploration is right that you need to move the threshold up by 13.3%? In that case, Seattle low-wage workers benefited or at least didn&#8217;t suffer from the increased minimum wage (with the price level moving up so quickly, it&#8217;s not clear how binding the new minimum really is), and given how the city is otherwise doing, it does not seem to be doing any great harms to Seattle&#8217;s overall economy. A booming Seattle would then clearly be able to tolerate a $13 minimum wage, and might tolerate a higher one. That does not imply strongly what would happen in a poorer area, or one that was not booming, if such a minimum was introduced, but it does suggest that there is more slack in the system than one would, on priors, consider there to be.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/thezvi.wordpress.com/7830/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/thezvi.wordpress.com/7830/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thezvi.wordpress.com&#038;blog=21007166&#038;post=7830&#038;subd=thezvi&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

And we strongly feel that <em>more is possible</em>, both in our private lives, and for the society in general.</p>\n<p><em>Less Wrong</em> is the website and the community that brought us together. Rationalist meetups are a great place to find smart, interesting, and nice people; awesome people to spend your time with. But feeling good was not enough for us; we also wanted to <em>become stronger</em>. We wanted to live awesome lives, not just to have an awesome afternoon once in a while. But many participants seemed to be there only to enjoy the debate. Or perhaps they were too busy doing important things in their lives. We wanted to achieve something together; not just as individual aspiring rationalists, but as a rationalist group. To make peer pressure a positive force in our lives; to overcome akrasia and become more productive, to provide each other feedback and to hold each other accountable, to support each other. To <em>win</em>, both individually and together.</p>\n<h2>The Group</h2>\n<p>We are not <em>super</em> secret really; some people may recognize us by reading this article. (If you are one of them, please <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/14/the-virtue-of-silence/\">keep it to yourself</a>.) We just do not want to be unnecessarily public. We know who we are and what we do, and we are doing it to win at life; trying to impress random people online could easily become a distraction, a lost purpose. (This article, of course, is an exception.) This is not supposed to be about specific individuals, but an inspiration for <em>you</em>.</p>\n<p>We started as a group of about ten members, but for various reasons some people soon stopped participating; seven members remained. We feel that the current number is probably optimal for our group dynamic (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law#Related_efficiency\">Parkinson's law</a>), and we are <em>not</em> recruiting new members. We have a rule &ldquo;what happens in the group, stays in the group&rdquo;, which allows us to be more open to each other. We seem to fit together quite well, personality-wise. We desire to protect the status quo, because it seems to work for us.</p>\n<p>But we would be happy to see other groups like ours, and to cooperate with them. If you want to have a similar kind of experience, we suggest starting your own group. Being in contact with other rationalists, and holding each other accountable, seems to benefit people a lot. <em>CFAR</em> also tries to keep their alumni in regular contact after the rationality workshops, and some have reported this as a huge added value.</p>\n<p>To paint a bit more specific picture of us, here is some summary data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our ages are between 20 and 40, mostly in the middle of the interval.</li>\n<li>Most of us, but not all, are men.</li>\n<li>Most of us, but not all, are childless.</li>\n<li>All of us are of majority ethnicity.</li>\n<li>Most of us speak the majority language as our first language.</li>\n<li>All of us are atheists; most of us come from atheist families.</li>\n<li>Most of us have middle-class family background.</li>\n<li>Most of us are, or were at some moment, software developers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess this is more or less what you could have expected, if you are already familiar with the rationalist community.</p>\n<p>We share many core values, but have some different perspectives, which adds value and confronts groupthink. We have entrepreneurs, employees, students, and unemployed bums; the ratio changes quite often. It is probably the combination of all of us having a good sense of epistemology, but different upbringing, education and professions, that makes supporting each other and giving advice more effective (i.e. beyond the usual benefits of the outside view); there have been plenty of situations which were trivial for one, but not for the other.</p>\n<p>Some of us knew each other for years before starting the group, even before the local <em>Less Wrong</em> meetups. Some of us met the others at the meetups. And finally, some of us talked to some other members for the first time after joining the group. It is surprising how well we fit, considering that we didn&rsquo;t apply any membership filter (although we were prepared to); people probably filtered themselves by their own interest, or a lack thereof, to join this kind of a group, specifically with the productivity and accountability requirements.</p>\n<p>We live in different cities. About once in a month we meet in person; typically before or after the local <em>Less Wrong</em> meetup. We spend a weekend together. We walk around the city and debate random stuff in the evening. In the morning, we have a &ldquo;round table&rdquo; where each of us provides a summary of what they did during the previous month, and what they are planning to do during the following month; about 20 minutes per person. That takes a lot of time, and you have to be careful not to go off-topic too often.</p>\n<p>In between meetups, we have a <em>Slack</em> team that we use daily. Various channels for different topics; the most important one is a &ldquo;daily log&rdquo;, where members can write briefly what they did during the day, and optionally what they are planning to do. In addition to providing extra visibility and accountability, it helps us feel like we are together, despite the geographical distances.</p>\n<p>Besides mutual accountability, we are also fans of various forms of self-tracking. We share tips about tools and techniques, and show each other our data. Journaling, time tracking, exercise logging, step counting, finance tracking...</p>\n<p>Even before starting the group, most of us were interested in various productivity systems: <em><a href=\"http://gettingthingsdone.com/\">Getting Things Done</a></em>, <a href=\"http://dirtsimple.org/\">PJ Eby</a>; one of us even wrote and sold their own productivity software.</p>\n<p>We do not share a specific plan or goal, besides &ldquo;winning&rdquo; in general. Everyone follows their own plan. Everything is voluntary; there are no obligations nor punishments. Still, some convergent goals have emerged.</p>\n<p>Also, good habits seem to be contagious, at least in our group. If a single person was doing some useful thing consistently, eventually the majority of the group seems to pick it up, whether it is related to productivity, exercise, diet, or finance.</p>\n<h2>Exercise</h2>\n<p><em>All</em> of us exercise regularly. Now it seems like obviously the right thing to do. Exercise improves your health and stamina, including mental stamina. For example, the best chess players exercise a lot, because it helps them stay focused and keep thinking for a long time. Exercise increases your expected lifespan, which should be especially important for transhumanists, because it increases your chances to survive until the Singularity. Exercise also makes you more attractive, creating a halo effect that brings many other benefits.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t consider these benefits worth at least 2 hours of your time a week, we find it difficult to consider you a rational person who takes their ideas seriously. Yes, even if you are busy doing important things; the physical and mental stamina gained from exercising is a multiplier to whatever you are doing in the rest of your time.</p>\n<p>Most of us lift weights (see e.g. <em><a href=\"https://stronglifts.com/5x5/\">StrongLifts 5&times;5</a></em>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFZWM-_JNhQ\">Alan Thrall</a>); some of us even have a power rack and/or treadmill desk at home. Others exercise using their body weight (see <em><a href=\"http://convict-conditioning.com/\">Convict Conditioning</a></em>). Exercising at home saves time, and in long term also money. Muscle mass correlates with longevity, <em>in addition</em> to the effect of exercise itself; and having more muscle allows you to eat more food. Speaking of which...</p>\n<h2>Diet</h2>\n<p>Most of us are, mostly or completely, vegetarian or vegan. Ignoring the ethical aspects and focusing only on health benefits, there is a lot of nutrition research summarized in a book <em><a href=\"https://nutritionfacts.org/book/\">How Not to Die</a></em> and a website <em><a href=\"https://nutritionfacts.org/\">NutritionFacts.org</a></em>. The short version is that whole-food vegan diet seems to work best, but you really should look into details. (Not all vegan food is automatically healthy; there is also vegan junk food. It is important to eat a lot of unprocessed vegetables, fruit, nuts, flax seeds, broccoli, beans. Read the book, seriously. Or download the <em><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nutritionfacts.dailydozen\">Daily Dozen</a></em> app.) We often share tasty recipes when we meet.</p>\n<p>We also helped each other research food supplements, and actually find the best and cheapest sources. Most of us take extra B12 to supplement the vegan diet, creatine monohydrate, vitamin D3, and some of us also use Omega3, broccoli sprouts, and a couple of other things that are generally aimed at health and longevity.</p>\n<h2>Finance</h2>\n<p>We strategize and brainstorm career decisions or just debug office politics. Most of us are software developers. This year, one member spent nine months learning how to program (using <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\"><em>Codecademy</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/\"><em>Codewars</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"><em>freeCodeCamp</em></a> at the beginning; reading tutorials and documentation later); as a result their income <em>more than doubled</em>, and they got a job they can do fully remotely.</p>\n<p>Recently we started researching cryptocurrencies and investing in them. Some of us started doing P2P lending.</p>\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\n<p>Many of us are polyamorous. We openly discuss sex and body image issues in the group. We generally feel comfortable sharing this information with each other; women say they do not feel the typical chilling effects.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Different members report different benefits from their membership in the group. Some quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;During the first half of the year, my life was more or less the same. I was already very productive before the group, so I kept the same habits, but benefited from sharing research. Recently, my life changed more noticeably. I started training myself to think of more high-leverage moves (inspired by a talk on self-hypnosis). This changed my asset allocation, and my short-term career plans. I realize more and more that I am very much monkey see, monkey do.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Before stumbling over the local <em>Less Wrong</em> meetup, I had been longing (and looking) for people who shared, or even just understood, my interest and enthusiasm for global, long-term, and meta thinking (what I now know to be epistemic rationality). After the initial thrill of the discovery had worn off however, I soon felt another type of dissonance creeping up on me: \"Wait, didn't we agree that this was ultimately about winning? Where is the second, instrumental half of rationality, that was supposedly part of the package?\" Well, it turned out that the solution to erasing this lingering dissatisfaction was to be found in yet a smaller subgroup.</p>\n<p>So, like receiving a signal free of interference for the first time, I finally feel like I'm in a \"place\" where I can truly belong, i.e. a tribe, or at least a precursor to one, because I believe that things hold the potential to be way more awesome still, and that just time alone may already be enough to take us there.</p>\n<p>On a practical level, the speed of adoption of healthy habits is truly remarkable. I've always been able to generally stick to any goals and commitments I've settled on, however the process of convergence is just so much faster and easier when you can rely on the judgment of other epistemically trustworthy people. Going at full speed is orders of magnitudes easier when multiple people illuminate the path (i.e. figure out what is truly worth it), while simultaneously sharing the burdens (of research, efficient implementation, trial-and-error, etc.)&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Now I'm on a whole-food vegan diet and I exercise 2 times a week, and I also improved in introspection and solving my life problems. But most importantly, the group provides me companionship and emotional support; for example, starting a new career is a lot easier in the presence of a group where reinventing yourself is the norm.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It usually takes grit and willpower to change if you do it alone; on the other hand, I think it's fairly effortless if you're simply aligning your behavior with a preexisting strong group norm. I used to eat garbage, smoke weed, and have no direction in life. Now I lift weights, eat ~healthy, and I learned programming well enough to land a great job.</p>\n<p>The group provides existential mooring; it is a homebase out of which I can explore life. I don't think I'm completely un-lost, but instead of being alone in the middle of a jungle, I'm at a friendly village in the middle of a jungle.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I was already weightlifting and eating vegan, but got motivated to get more into raw and whole foods. I get confronted more with math, programming and finance, and can broaden my horizon. Sharing daily tasks in Slack helps me to reflect about my priorities. I already could discuss many current career and personal challenges with the whole group or individuals.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I started exercising regularly, and despite remaining an omnivore I eat much more fresh vegetables now than before. People keep telling me that my body shape improved a lot during this year. Other habits did not stick (yet).&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Finding a tribe of sane people in an insane world was a big deal for me, now I feel more self-assured and less alone. Our tribe has helped me to improve my habits&mdash;some more than others (for example, it has inspired me to buy a power-rack for my living room and start weightlifting daily, instead of going to the gym). The friendly bragging we do among our group is our way of celebrating success and inspires me to keep going and growing.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Random</h2>\n<p>Despite having met each other thanks to <em>Less Wrong</em>, most of us do not read it anymore, because our impression is that &ldquo;<em>Less Wrong</em> is dead&rdquo;. We do read <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/\"><em>Slate Star Codex</em></a>.</p>\n<p>From other rationalist blogs, we really liked the article about <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2016/10/20/ra/\"><em>Ra</em></a>, and we discussed it a lot.</p>\n<p>The proposal of a <a href=\"/lw/p23/dragon_army_theory_charter_30min_read/\"><em>Dragon Army</em></a> evoked mixed reactions. On one hand, we approve of rationalists living closer to each other, and we want to encourage fellow rationalists to try it. On the other hand, we don&rsquo;t like the idea of living in a command hierarchy; we are adults, and we all have our own projects. Our preferred model would be living close to each other; optimally in the same apartment building with some shared communal space, but also with a completely self-contained unit for each of us. So far our shared living happened mostly by chance, but it always worked out very well.</p>\n<p>Jordan Peterson and his <a href=\"https://www.selfauthoring.com/\"><em>Self-Authoring Suite</em></a> is very popular with about half of the group.</p>\n<h2>What next?</h2>\n<p>Well, we are obviously going to continue doing what we are doing now, hopefully even better than before, because it works for us.</p>\n<p>You, dear reader, if you feel serious about becoming stronger and winning at life, but are not yet a member of a productive rationalist group, are encouraged to join one or start one. Geographical distances are annoying, but <em>Slack</em> helps you overcome the intervals between meetups. Talking to other rationalists can be a lot of fun, but <em>accountability</em> can make the difference between productivity and mere talking. Remember: &ldquo;If this is your first night at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club\">fight club</a>, you have to fight!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even if it&rsquo;s seemingly small things, such as doing an exercise or adding some fiber to your diet; these things, accumulated over time, can increase your quality of life a lot. The most important habit is the meta-habit of creating and maintaining good habits. And it is always easier when your tribe is doing the same thing.</p>\n<p>Any questions? It may take some time for our hive mind to generate an answer, and in case of too many or too complex questions we may have to prioritize. Don&rsquo;t feel shy, though. We care about helping others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>(This account was created for the purpose of making this post, and after a week or two it will stop being used.

There are <u><a href=\"/lw/nx/categorizing_has_consequences/\">obvious pitfalls</a></u>, but I think the advantages are more than worth it. In fact, I think the &quot;pitfalls&quot; can even sometimes be <em>epistemically useful</em>.</p><p>Here I want to share why. This is for two reasons:</p><ul><li> I think fake framework use is a wonderful skill. I want it represented more in rationality in practice. <em>Or</em>, I want to know where I&#x27;m missing something, and Less Wrong is a great place for that.</li><li>I&#x27;m building toward something. This is actually a continuation of <u><a href=\"/lw/ozz/gears_in_understanding/\">Gears in Understanding</a></u>, although I imagine it won&#x27;t be at all clear here how. I need a suite of tools in order to describe something. Talking about fake frameworks is a good way to demo tool #2.<br/></li></ul><p>With that, let&#x27;s get started.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><u><a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreTwoKindsOfPeopleInTheWorld\">There are two kinds of people</a></u>: extroverts and introverts.</p><p>…sort of.</p><p>I mean, as I look around, it certainly <em>looks</em> like there&#x27;s a difference between outgoing social butterflies and quiet types who mostly stay at home. Maybe it&#x27;s more like a continuum rather than a binary thing. But if so, I find myself wondering if it&#x27;s bimodal with rough &quot;extrovert&quot; and &quot;introvert&quot; <u><a href=\"/lw/nl/the_cluster_structure_of_thingspace/\">clusters</a></u> anyway.</p><p>But then I look at <u><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/difference-between-introverts-extroverts-chart_us_57f794c2e4b0b6a430316b3a\">long lists of differences</a></u> between extroverts and introverts, and I worry. What exactly do these terms <em>mean</em>? Is it just about how talkative and loud people are? If so, are the labels <u><a href=\"/lw/ny/sneaking_in_connotations/\">sneaking in connotations</a></u> about where people &quot;get energy&quot; from and how action-oriented they are?</p><p>Well, it turns out that <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Extraversion\">a bunch of those traits are correlated</a></u>. The intuition is, in fact, picking up on something true in the world.</p><p>But.</p><p>That doesn&#x27;t mean the intuition is correct.</p><p>It looks like <u><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-the-distribution-of-introverts-and-extraverts-bimodal\">maybe extraversion isn&#x27;t bimodal</a></u>. I can justify that after the fact: the Big Five verified extraversion as a correlational cluster of traits and defines introversion as &quot;low extraversion&quot;, and a Gaussian distribution seems like a more sensible prior than a bimodal one. But I didn&#x27;t think of that ahead of time. If I hadn&#x27;t thought to look, I might have thought the Big Five had verified the bimodal intuition because &quot;these traits are correlated&quot; and &quot;the correlation has two separable empirical clusters&quot; were <u><a href=\"/lw/nw/fallacies_of_compression/\">compressed</a></u> into one &quot;<u><a href=\"/lw/o2k/flinching_away_from_truth_is_often_about/\">bucket</a></u>&quot; in my mind.</p><p>What other parts of the intuition are suspect? What else wants to sneak in under the banner of &quot;verified&quot;?</p><p>That&#x27;s hard to know. The <u><a href=\"/lw/nr/the_argument_from_common_usage/\">usual use</a></u> of the term &quot;extrovert&quot; isn&#x27;t a sharp reference to clear traits. It&#x27;s more like a fuzzy cluster of impressions that loosely splat over things like <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory\">Type A personality</a></u> and being the &quot;life of the party&quot;.</p><p>So we&#x27;re left with a choice.</p><p>We can ignore the fuzzy intuition and just use the concepts that come from the research. <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits\">OCEAN</a></u> tells us what extraversion is as it exists in the world. If we want to know what other traits correlate with extraversion, we can measure that trait and a bunch of others and look. We can feed massive amounts of data to machine learning systems and let them <u><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Magic\">magically</a></u> tell us correlations. No guesswork required.</p><p>That seems safe.</p><p>But.</p><p>If we&#x27;d done that as a species, <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#History\">there would be no OCEAN</a></u>. Researchers thought to develop the Big Five because of folk intuitions about personality traits.</p><p>Also, not everything has been researched, and it’s tricky to <u><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Scholarship\">find</a></u> everything that <em>has</em> been researched. </p><p>The whole approach is <u><a href=\"/lw/qi/faster_than_science/\">too slow</a></u>. It doesn’t work as a general epistemic solution.</p><p>But we clearly can&#x27;t just trust the intuition. It&#x27;s predictably wrong somewhere. It makes some false things <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">seem</a></u> obviously true. And we don&#x27;t get to know which seemingly true ideas are wrong ahead of time.\\</p><p>So instead I <u><a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/\">suggest</a></u> this:</p><p>Assume the intuition is wrong. It&#x27;s <em>fake</em>. And then <u><a href=\"http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/26277.html\">use it anyway</a></u>. Let yourself wonder about and <u><a href=\"/lw/k4/do_we_believe_everything_were_told/\">kind of believe</a></u> in what makes sense to you about introverts and extroverts. Just do it in a mental <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)\">sandbox</a></u> of &quot;This is all fake and made up.&quot;</p><p>You know more about people than you&#x27;re conscious of. Doing this sandboxing lets you flesh out <u><a href=\"/lw/ozz/gears_in_understanding/\">Gears</a></u> for extroversion and introversion with more of your mind.</p><p>It also keeps you honest. You&#x27;re already <u><a href=\"/lw/19m/privileging_the_hypothesis/\">privileging hypotheses</a></u>. This lets you own up to it and notice where you’re making implicit assumptions.</p><p>And maybe some of those &quot;privileged&quot; hypotheses are just correct. That&#x27;s worth noticing when it&#x27;s true. Maybe more extraverted people really <em>do</em> <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Behavior\">wear more decorative clothing</a></u>. If that&#x27;s right, then maybe <u><a href=\"/lw/7i/rationality_is_systematized_winning/\">you should have let your intuition influence your guesses from the start</a></u>.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>So in practice, while using a roadmap it&#x27;s sensible to think of roads as basic somehow. Or rather, when using these maps, <u><a href=\"/lw/uh/trying_to_try/\">roads <em>are</em> basic</a></u>.</p><p>Yes, you can reflect on it and remember that roads are made of atoms. But two points:</p><ul><li>That&#x27;s pretty useless. That doesn&#x27;t help you get from point A to point B in a new city.</li><li>The roadmap would work even if the roads weren&#x27;t made of atoms. Like roads in a video game world. </li></ul><p><br/>This means it&#x27;s pretty silly to try to give an <u><a href=\"/lw/nh/extensions_and_intensions/\">intensional definition</a></u> of &quot;road&quot; in this context. If you met someone who&#x27;d never used a roadmap before, you&#x27;d <u><a href=\"/lw/nh/extensions_and_intensions/\">point at a road near you</a></u> and point at the matching part of the map and say &quot;That thing is this line.&quot;</p><p>I think this suggests a natural way to define &quot;ontology&quot;. I say an ontology is a set of &quot;basic&quot; things that you use to build a map (together with rules for how you can combine them into a map). Something is &quot;ontologically basic&quot; if it&#x27;s an element of the ontology you&#x27;re using.</p><p>Some other examples:</p><ul><li>In Euclidean geometry, the undefined terms &quot;point&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, and &quot;plane&quot; are the ontologically basic things, and the postulates are the rules for how to combine them. We create territories this ontology can map when extrinsically defining the undefined terms: we pretend a blackboard is a &quot;plane&quot;, a bar of chalk dust dragged across it is a &quot;line&quot;, and a fat dot of chalk on it is a &quot;point&quot;. I think a lot of people talk about this backwards, like the drawings are maps helping them explore the territory of Euclidean geometry. I think they&#x27;re confused about what &quot;real&quot; means. The drawings help us notice what territories that ontology can make maps of. </li><li>I think classical mechanics has mass, position, and time as ontologically basic. Newton&#x27;s Laws of Motion give the rest of the ontology. That&#x27;s a rich enough map-building set that it can describe most movement we encounter pretty well. It falls short when modeling near-light speeds though. </li><li>OCEAN&#x27;s ontology has five &quot;personality spectra&quot; as basic: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. These five emerged from data. This contrasts with <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Four_dichotomies\">Myers-Briggs</a></u>&#x27; four (Introversion/Extraversion, Sensing/iNtuiting, Thinking/Feeling, and Perceiving/Judging), which came from thinking about Carl Jung&#x27;s theories. They both have the same ontological structure though: personality type is defined by some small number of intervals with some set of behavioral traits clustered at each end of each interval. </li></ul><p>Ontologies <u><a href=\"/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/\">make</a></u> things <u><a href=\"/lw/uh/trying_to_try/\">seem real</a></u>. Roads are real, right? But if <u><a href=\"/lw/qp/timeless_physics/\">time itself isn&#x27;t real</a></u>, or if <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe\">there&#x27;s only one electron in the whole universe</a></u>, then what does it mean to say that a road is real?</p><p>I think people get confused like this when they switch ontologies without noticing. First roads are basic. Then we&#x27;re talking about ontologies for physics, and none of those take roads as basic. One of them even challenges the idea of a <em>thing</em> at a higher order than an electron. Each time we switch ontologies that we connect to our experience, &quot;real&quot; takes on a new meaning for us.</p><p>But aren&#x27;t roads really real? I mean, I walk down one every day to get to work…</p><p>…which shows how pervasive this illusion is.</p><p>If I can&#x27;t switch to an ontology that doesn&#x27;t have roads as basic <em>while looking at what I was calling a &quot;road&quot;</em>, then I&#x27;m pretty stuck. I can&#x27;t understand <u><a href=\"/lw/on/reductionism/\">reductionism</a></u>. I can&#x27;t <u><a href=\"/lw/k7/original_seeing/\">see with fresh eyes</a></u>. I&#x27;m just rehearsing what I &quot;know&quot;.</p><p>Likewise with people who are really into (say) Myers-Briggs. If the types in Myers-Briggs look real to you, and you can&#x27;t shake that sense, then you’re stuck. It’ll seem meaningful to figure out how each person fits in that framework as though the framework is objectively true. That will make it hard for you to notice things about personality that that ontology doesn’t capture well.</p><p>…and it will <em>highlight</em> things that that ontology <em>does</em> capture well.</p><p>I learned a lot about <u><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy\">just how different other minds can be</a></u> by studying <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality\">the Enneagram</a></u>. It suggested <a href=\"/lw/ozz/gears_in_understanding/\">Gears</a> for people I hadn’t considered before. It helped me see my dad’s sternness as <em>affection</em>. I mostly don’t use that system anymore; it’s unclear whether its nine types map at all to <u><a href=\"/lw/nl/the_cluster_structure_of_thingspace/\">natural clusters</a></u> of people. But I still see Dad more clearly because I used the system for a while.</p><p>Switching which ontology is active feels like changing what I believe is real about what I’m experiencing. This means if I want ontological flexibility, I have to take my experience of “real” lightly. I can’t clutch too tightly to the sense that what’s “obviously real” to me right now is objectively true. And I have to be able to see <em>something new</em> as “obviously real”.</p><p>Like with the road. Roads are real. But I can set that aside and see it as molecules in mechanical and chemical interactions. Or as quarks in a timeless wiggling quantum soup. Or as a dreamlike projection of my pattern-matching mind.</p><p>This is easier to do if I think of these “real” roads as fake. And molecules as fake. And quarks as fake. If I remember that I’m talking about map-generators, which feels on the inside like talking about the territory.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p> Numbers are ontologically basic in elementary arithmetic.</p><p><br/></p><p>But it turns out that if you take sets as basic instead, <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers\">you can derive elementary numbers</a></u>. Set theory is a richer ontology than that of elementary arithmetic: everything you can map with numbers, you can map at the same resolution with sets. But you can do more with sets.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reductionism\">Reductionism</a></u> promises that all ontologies can become one. More formally: Given any finite set of ontologies that fit experience, there’s some super-ontology that fits experience and is at least as rich as every ontology in your initial set.</p><p>That’s different from saying that <em>you know how to find it</em>.</p><p>Quarks are real, right? Really really real? And everything real comes from quarks and how they interact. We just use labels like “evolution” and “desire” for things that are a pain to derive from the quark level.</p><p>But it would feel this way if you were <em>wrong</em>, too. That’s what it feels like to wear an ontology.</p><p>I suspect it’s a type error to think of an ontology as <em>correct</em> or <em>wrong</em>. Ontologies are toolkits for building maps. It makes sense to ask whether it <u><a href=\"/lw/o0/where_to_draw_the_boundary/\">carves reality at its joints</a></u>, but that’s different. That’s looking at <em>fit</em>. Something weird happens to your epistemology when you start asking whether quarks are real <em>independent of ontology</em>.</p><p>Maybe in the secret <u><a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/noumenal\">noumenal</a></u> universe, there are truly basic things. I don’t know how I can ever know about them without maps though.</p><p>Which makes me want to <u><a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/truth-carl-sagan-quote/\">whack my ontologies with a sledgehammer</a></u>.</p><p>If I’m only ever willing to try on ontologies that <em>I can tell</em> fall within a <em>known</em> richer super-ontology (e.g., physics), then anything that super-ontology doesn’t easily map becomes hard for me to notice.</p><p>This isn’t a challenge to reductionism.

Ki was part of my teachers’ ontology. That didn’t make sense to my physics brain, but I went with it anyway. This gave me access to strange powers that took me over a decade to understand within my physics ontology.</p><p>I think it twists the <u><a href=\"/lw/7i/rationality_is_systematized_winning/\">definition of “rational”</a></u> to say that I should have rejected their teachings as wrongheaded.</p><p>But it <em>would</em> have been bad if I had <em>believed</em> in ki <em>and</em> physics <em>and</em> reductionism without <u><a href=\"/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/\">being confused</a></u>.

    "htmlBody": "<p>Epistemic Status (written before I looked at the paper): This new paper confirms all of my priors.</p>\n<p>(Which is no longer the epistemic status because things started looking weird, but one step at a time). I&#8217;m publishing part 1 now because I don&#8217;t want things to drag on forever, and the calculation I just did looks weird enough that it&#8217;s a decent stopping point.</p>\n<p>Motivation</p>\n<p>Seattle has raised its minimum wage to $13 an hour ($12 for small employers) and will soon raise it to $15. Armed with a unique data set, a new working paper claims that even the increase so far has had a big enough effect on low-wage employment that it has backfired on low-wage employees, costing them more in hours than they have gained in pay. Many of the details I read about made the paper and its conclusions appear highly credible, but some of the numbers involved seemed to naively imply crazy things, so I decided it would be worthwhile to read the actual paper.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7611\"></span></p>\n<p>The paper is worth reading (technically it is a working paper, but no one seems to care about that distinction). It includes details like this one, which appears as a footnote when discussing the fact that a number of big employers are missing from the data set the study uses, to answer the anticipated objection that big employers &#8216;have more bargaining power when negotiating wages, and can more easily absorb the additional labor costs&#8217;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Seattle Minimum Wage Study surveyed over 500 Seattle business owners immediately before and a year after the Ordinance went into effect. In April 2015, multi-site employers were more likely to report intentions to reduce hours of their minimum wage employees (34% versus 24%) and more likely to report intentions to reduce employment (33% versus 26%). A one-year follow-up survey revealed that multi-location employers were more likely to report an actual reduction in full-time and part-time employees, with over half of multi-site respondents reporting a reduction in full-time employment (52%, against 45% for single-site firms).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Take a step back for a moment, and look only at those numbers, ignoring the main study. What conclusions can you draw?</p>\n<p>In terms of large versus small businesses, this likely indicates that single-site employers cut a higher percentage of jobs and hours than multi-site employers. This is because they are measuring whether magnitude is greater than zero, rather than the average reduction. A multi-site employer will have plans to reduce employment, or actually reduce employment, if this is true of <em>at least one </em>of those sites. If 45% of single-site firms reduce employment, then even with some amount of correlation between sites of the same firm, having only a 52% rate of reduced employment would imply that the base rate almost has to be lower, especially since their individual sites also likely employ more people per site.</p>\n<p>Minimum wage discussions are full of competing claims, and counter-intuitive theories and results like this. A result is presented as showing one effect, but seems to show its opposite. So we have to be careful to look at all details before drawing any conclusions&#8230;</p>\n<p>Wait, did that say that <em>45% of single-site firms reduced employment? And a majority of multi-site firms (even if this might be a relatively small percentage of all their sites or jobs)? </em>How big is the average single-site firm? How could this not imply a huge disaster, if true?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about the results here. They are freaking huge. The reason I read the paper in its entirety is that even with priors that raising the minimum wage will reduce employment, I had to see the numbers to wrap my head around the numbers involved because they seemed absurdly big.</p>\n<p>Priors</p>\n<p>Before getting into detailed analysis of the central findings, I think it&#8217;s important for me to state my priors, and for you to think about yours.</p>\n<p>My priors are:</p>\n<p>In favor of minimum wage raising being bad:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you raise the price of something above its market rate, you almost always get less of it.</li>\n<li>When you raise the price <em>far </em>above the market rate, you usually get <em>far </em>less of it.</li>\n<li>It is costly along many dimensions to fire people. It is costly along many dimensions to eliminate positions. Most employers hate firing people. Short term effects will be smaller than medium term effects, which will be smaller than long term effects.</li>\n<li>Proportionally more damage will be done to potential future jobs, than will be done to existing jobs. Proportionally more firms will never open, or fail to expand, than existing firms will go out of business and existing sites will close down.</li>\n<li>As the effect persists and expands, and is expected to persist and expand, there will be substitution of capital for labor that will shift efficiency, defaults and norms towards.</li>\n<li>Losses will be concentrated among those who are no longer employable, who were already the worst off.</li>\n<li>The broader economic effects of increasing costs must be presumed to be negative.</li>\n<li>There is huge incentive in most of academia to find that raising the minimum wage is good. All previous studies finding no effect seemed to rely on sketchy/incomplete data and methods, and seemed not to understand the power of the priors they were fighting against.</li>\n<li>Unemployment is a no good, very bad thing, as is underemployment, and the cost of such things is <em>very high </em>so decreases in available jobs are much worse than they appear.</li>\n<li>If you raise wages above their equilibrium price, you have too many workers chasing too few jobs. This gives employers tremendous power over employees. They can now fire them and threaten to fire them freely, knowing there are many new applicants waiting for those jobs. They can treat the workers like dirt, give them terrible working conditions and benefits, not listen to their complaints, scramble their schedules, give them 29-hour work weeks, demand extra work off the books, and so forth, much more so than before, so we expect a lot of the wage increase to be inefficiently reclaimed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In favor of the minimum wage raising being not so bad:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Efficiency wages are a thing. Many employees are underpaid in the sense that the employer would be better served to be paying them better.</li>\n<li>There is incentive in <em>other </em>parts of academia, and from other places, to find large negative effects from minimum wage increases.</li>\n<li>The amount of evidence against the minimum wage having negative effects has been surprising, so we should update at least somewhat on it even if it&#8217;s not perfect, unless we can explain where it is coming from (as the authors here claim they can).</li>\n<li>Seattle is in a boom and already well-off, so a $13 minimum wage in Seattle doesn&#8217;t seem obviously outrageous. Maybe it is fine, especially near term.</li>\n<li>There can be positive spill-over effects on wages for those not making the minimum (although this also means there can also be negative spill-over effects for all the same reasons).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I want to stop here and emphasize how <em>profoundly weird </em>it is to propose that low-skill labor, <em>the thing we most want to raise the price of beyond its market value, </em>would happen to be <em>the one important exception to where raising the price gives you less of it. </em>I mean, anything&#8217;s possible and there are a lot of factors, but think about just how <em>profoundly weird </em>it would be for that to be true. It would be <em>freaking bizarre. </em>People who try to act like this would not be freaking bizarre are either engaging in wishful thinking, have so little grounding in economics and the real world as to not understand this basic point, or are lying.</p>\n<p>Methodology and Data Sources</p>\n<p>Isolating the effect of the minimum wage increase is hard, and assumptions matter a lot, so it&#8217;s important to look at the details of what the study is up to here.</p>\n<p>The big win that makes this study possible is the use of a uniquely rich data set:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We study the impact of the 2015 and 2016 minimum wage hikes in Seattle using<br />\nadministrative employment data from Washington State covering the period 2005 through the third quarter of 2016. Washington’s Employment Security Department collects quarterly payroll records for all workers who received wages in Washington and are covered by Unemployment Insurance (UI). Washington is one of four states in the US that collects not only data on earnings, but also on hours worked during the quarter. Employers are required to report actual hours worked for employees whose hours are tracked (i.e. hourly workers), and report either actual hours worked or total number of hours assuming a 40 hour work week for employees whose hours are not tracked (i.e. salaried workers).</p></blockquote>\n<p>The government&#8217;s invasion of your privacy and recording of the details of your lives in order to engage in redistribution is our gain! Sweet. The paper emphasizes multiple times that reductions in hours are an important negative effect that other studies have not been able to study. This makes sense, especially given other recent changes in law regarding health care and other benefits, along with employers&#8217; reluctance to fully fire workers. The cost of employing workers goes up, so maybe they are instead used less (demand goes down) and also used in a more efficient way for the employer (not have to pay for health care), as a way of reclaiming part of the wage increase.</p>\n<p>This also allows the study to avoid using industries or other subsets of the economy to approximate low wage employment, and instead look directly at who is being paid how much money. Seems big.</p>\n<p>The assumption that salaried workers put in 40 hours seems like it should get further examination. I would be surprised if the average salaried worker puts in a number that close to 40 hours of work, and my guess would be on average that they put in more than 40 rather than less, which means their effective wage rates are being overestimated here and also that they have more variance. There&#8217;s also the possibility that previously minimum wage employees are being put on salary <em>in order to avoid the new minimum wage </em>since they would now be able to work more than 40 hours while only being paid for 40. This could mean that hours worked are not going down as much as the data would naively suggest, and there is more low-wage employment than the data would naively suggest, but does mean that workers would be getting a worse deal rather than a better one; it&#8217;s hard to see how this effect could work in their favor.</p>\n<p>The next problem is how to identify which workers are effected by the minimum wage increase. It is known that minimum wage increases push up wages of those that were already above the new minimum, because of the need to maintain the right <em>relative </em>wages between different employees and jobs &#8211; the assistant manager has to earn more than the retail clerk, so the two wages need to move together.</p>\n<p>Their solution is to look for the cutoff where employment stops increasing during the time period being studied. They found an increase in paid work for wages up to $18/hour, so they put the cutoff at $19/hour, which seems safe at first glance. The other question is whether employers are substituting high-skill labor for low-skill labor. It seems plausible that some employers would hire a $50/hour worker to do a job that serves the same purpose as multiple previous low-wage employees, since the relative costs have changed. Robots can take your job, but so can other people, and one could in theory even tell a story where Seattle&#8217;s recent boom is being encouraged by the forced substitution of high-wage labor for low-wage labor, which combines with high rents in forcing low-skilled workers to move away. That would locally <em>look like </em>a boom, including in the data.</p>\n<p>Since the cutoff at $19/hour, which is roughly double the previous minimum wage, is designed to catch the entire effect of the wage increases (no false negatives) it also means that a lot of the workers considered &#8216;low wage&#8217; will see no effect (inevitable false positives), which will make the effects of the new minimum wage look much smaller than they are.</p>\n<p>The first method they try is difference-in-differences, which has been used by many previous papers. They use two different control regions, either the nearest unaffected areas (which gets you some good similarities, but risks spillover effects) or a group of areas chosen to be farther away and as similar to Seattle as possible, neither of which are great. There are no good choices, since Seattle is unique in Washington and they only have their data set inside the state, so this is certainly a source of error although it is not obvious which direction the effect goes.</p>\n<p>The paper notes that these samples fail a falsification test for these reasons, which certainly sounds bad. In their words:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To overcome this concern, we estimate the impact of the minimum wage using two<br />\nmethods which allow for flexible pre-policy trends in control and treated regions: the synthetic  control estimator (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003) and the interactive fixed effects estimator (Bai, 2009). Both methods have been used in the regional policy evaluation literature and applied to the minimum wage as well&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Synthetic control works by choosing a set of regions that minimizes the observed error in the time periods before Seattle raised its minimum wage.</p>\n<p>These methods assume the effects on the minimum wage are a linear combination of factors. This is probably wrong, but over small periods of time and relatively small changes, it should be fine. The interactive fixed effects simulator they say is done following Gobillion and Magnac (2016) who &#8216;have developed a publicly-available program to estimate the treatment effects in the regional policy evaluation context.&#8217;</p>\n<p>There are any number of ways these methods might be flawed. They might have implemented it incorrectly. The original methods might have serious flaws. I don&#8217;t know, and I am choosing not to investigate this further unless someone tells me these threads are worth pulling at.</p>\n<p>The most obvious flaw (assuming the methods are fundamentally sound and correctly executed) is that they are comparing all of Seattle&#8217;s policies in the pre-raise world to all of Seattle&#8217;s policies in the post-raise world, since they choose a control that matches Seattle&#8217;s previous experiences. Any number of other policies could also have changed, which I find unlikely to be too bad, but the biggest worry is that Seattle effectively had a <em>lower </em>minimum wage than its controls before it enacted its new policy, because Seattle&#8217;s price level is higher. This shouldn&#8217;t be an issue because we are still measuring the effect of the shift from one minimum to another minimum, but it still seems worth worrying about a little.</p>\n<p>Raw Data</p>\n<p>On January 1, 2016, the minimum wage in Seattle was raised from $11 to $13 an hour for most places.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to easily and nicely reproduce the entire chart, so I retyped key sections of table 3, starting with the number of jobs Under $13, Under $19 and Overall:</p>\n<table width=\"320\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"64\">Quarters</td>\n<td width=\"64\">Under $13</td>\n<td width=\"64\">Under $19</td>\n<td width=\"64\">All</td>\n<td width=\"64\"> % Under $19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>39807</td>\n<td>92959</td>\n<td>292640</td>\n<td>31.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>40706</td>\n<td>94913</td>\n<td>300892</td>\n<td>31.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>35421</td>\n<td>89598</td>\n<td>303089</td>\n<td>29.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>35085</td>\n<td>90813</td>\n<td>305229</td>\n<td>29.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 4/1 ($11 min)</td>\n<td>35087</td>\n<td>92668</td>\n<td>311886</td>\n<td>29.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 5/2</td>\n<td>33959</td>\n<td>93382</td>\n<td>320807</td>\n<td>29.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 6/3</td>\n<td>30002</td>\n<td>87067</td>\n<td>320195</td>\n<td>27.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 7/4</td>\n<td>24662</td>\n<td>87112</td>\n<td>321360</td>\n<td>27.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 8/5 ($13 min)</td>\n<td>24420</td>\n<td>88431</td>\n<td>331927</td>\n<td>26.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 9/6</td>\n<td>23232</td>\n<td>86842</td>\n<td>336517</td>\n<td>25.8%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The $11/hour level doesn&#8217;t have a naked-eye-visible effect. The $13/hour level does have one on the Under $13 category, for obvious reasons (the number does not go to zero, I&#8217;m assuming due to the small places that only have a $12/hour minimum, which seem to have had the majority of all $13/hour and under jobs given this data. It has a less obvious effect on the Under $19 category. The dip instead seems to be in quarter six, which is odd since an anticipatory effect seems unlikely to be that coordinated, and if the effect was seasonal we would see it in the all category</p>\n<p>Basic heuristics say that natural wage growth and inflation over two years should add something like 5% to wages given Seattle was doing well, which should move some of the jobs under $19 to over $19, but less than 10% since one must assume that each dollar interval is smaller than the previous one. So about 9.8% of all jobs under $19 an hour seem to have vanished. Given a large majority of those jobs were already above the new minimum, that seems like a huge number, and we haven&#8217;t considered hours yet.</p>\n<p>The issue with looking at it that way is that overall employment in Seattle is clearly doing just fine. If there are enough jobs for everyone, isn&#8217;t it a <em>good </em>thing that now 5% more of them pay over $19/hour? We seem to be putting a lot of faith in the idea that jobs over $19/hour are on net unaffected by the change, which is even more odd if Seattle is at full employment. This seems worth revisiting later, but for now we need to look at more of the data.</p>\n<table width=\"448\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"64\">Quarters</td>\n<td width=\"64\">Hours U13</td>\n<td width=\"64\">Hours U19</td>\n<td width=\"64\">Hours All</td>\n<td width=\"64\">U19 H%</td>\n<td width=\"64\">Avg U19</td>\n<td width=\"64\">Avg All</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>14117</td>\n<td>37408</td>\n<td>130007</td>\n<td>28.8%</td>\n<td>402</td>\n<td>444</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>14527</td>\n<td>38565</td>\n<td>132604</td>\n<td>29.1%</td>\n<td>406</td>\n<td>441</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>11999</td>\n<td>35589</td>\n<td>136012</td>\n<td>26.2%</td>\n<td>397</td>\n<td>449</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>11335</td>\n<td>34269</td>\n<td>132275</td>\n<td>25.9%</td>\n<td>377</td>\n<td>433</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 4/1</td>\n<td>12174</td>\n<td>37270</td>\n<td>139197</td>\n<td>26.8%</td>\n<td>402</td>\n<td>446</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 5/2</td>\n<td>11589</td>\n<td>37472</td>\n<td>142638</td>\n<td>26.3%</td>\n<td>401</td>\n<td>445</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 6/3</td>\n<td>9924</td>\n<td>34943</td>\n<td>146960</td>\n<td>23.8%</td>\n<td>401</td>\n<td>459</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 7/4</td>\n<td>7645</td>\n<td>33031</td>\n<td>140429</td>\n<td>23.5%</td>\n<td>379</td>\n<td>437</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 8/5</td>\n<td>8315</td>\n<td>35681</td>\n<td>149514</td>\n<td>23.9%</td>\n<td>403</td>\n<td>450</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 9/6</td>\n<td>8046</td>\n<td>35867</td>\n<td>153603</td>\n<td>23.4%</td>\n<td>413</td>\n<td>456</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Hours worked in Under $19/hour jobs seems to decline less relative to all jobs, than the number of jobs alone, and generally seems to maintain the pattern of about 90% of baseline hours (hours counts are in thousands of hours per quarter in the second through fourth columns, in hours per quarter per worker in the last two columns).</p>\n<p>When looking at hours worked rather than jobs worked, we seem to see a phase shift but one that is over by quarter six; after that, we see the situation stabilizing.

If you look at the Average 13-19 column, which I calculated, that number doesn&#8217;t change at all, stuck smack in the middle at $16/hour. Interesting! That means that even before the minimum wage, we didn&#8217;t see (more than a marginal amount) more people earning $13-$16 than $16-$19, and the ratio did not change when we pushed a lot of people out of the Under $13 bracket. That would not have been my prior; I would have expected this number of to start off lower (something like 15.50-15.75), and more importantly I would have expected it to decline as people from the Under $13 bracket got pushed into the $13-$19 range, whereas we have postulated that the law isn&#8217;t pushing that many net people from under $19 to over $19, which is why $19 was chosen.</p>\n<p>But if all of that is true, why isn&#8217;t this ratio moving? I&#8217;m pausing here to think about that for a while, and suggest you do the same. I can see how this might be <em>wonderfully good </em>news, and I can see how this might be <em>horribly terrible </em>news. I&#8217;ll resume in part two.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/thezvi.wordpress.com/7611/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/thezvi.wordpress.com/7611/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thezvi.wordpress.com&#038;blog=21007166&#038;post=7611&#038;subd=thezvi&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

    "htmlBody": "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">Some call it The Honeymoon Phase or puppy love. Others mix it in with infatuation or limerence. Views on new relationship energy (NRE) vary, from seeing it as immature to completely normal to a little unhealthy. Regardless, NRE distorts your perception of the person you've just started dating. This can be thrilling, though at times a little scary. It feels like living in an illusion that you know is going to be shattered sooner or later.<br /><br />The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon (also called the Frequency Illusion) is what happens when you learn about something new, then start to see it everywhere. There is a lot of similarity between what happens here and in NRE, to the extent where NRE can effect your emotions in the same way that Baader-Meinhof effects your mind. It is the feeling of every love song reminding you of your new beau, or every book, movie, and band you like seeming like something to recommend to them. This is also partly because NRE is often when you learn the most about a person. You find out that they like sushi, and suddenly every sushi restaurant seems like a good date location. Often, you associate the person with happiness, and feel compelled to share other things you associate with happiness with them.<br /><br />The new feelings that come up during NRE function much like the new idea in Baader-Meinhof. When you notice things your new partner likes or would like everywhere, you don't often think of it as \"wow, the things this person likes are everywhere\", but instead it feels like you can't stop thinking about them. And of course, if you can't stop thinking about a person, this is evidence that you must like them a lot.<br /><br />The things you learn about a person's traits play into this effect as well. If your paramour is particularly smart, a lot of the things they say or write might draw attention to this. Especially if you were friends with the person for a while before the relationship started, you may feel like you didn't realize how funny, intelligent, or attractive the person was. The emotions are so new that it feels like the person is much more amazing than you ever gave them credit for, and you are only now starting to notice. Part of this is also due to fundamental attribution error, which is what's happening when we assume a person is helping their friend move because they are kind, without considering that their friend may have bullied them into it, or they may owe their friend a favor.<br /><br />Personally, I feel like viewing the emotions that come up as part of NRE as similar to cognitive biases helps normalize it. It works in similar ways, and although people work on reducing the negative effects, everyone has biases, cognitive and emotional. As such, your awareness of your emotions is as much a tool for growth as your awareness of your thoughts.</div>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>LW has a problem. Openly or covertly, many posts here promote the idea that a rational person ought to be able to self-improve on their own. Some of it comes from Eliezer's refusal to attend college (and Luke dropping out of his bachelors, etc). Some of it comes from our concept of rationality, that all agents can be approximated as perfect utility maximizers with a bunch of nonessential bugs. Some of it is due to our psychological makeup and introversion.&nbsp;Some of it comes from trying to tackle hard problems that aren't well understood anywhere else. And some of it is just the plain old meme of heroism and forging your own way.</p>\n<div>I'm not saying all these things are 100% harmful. But the end result is a mindset of&nbsp;<em>lone wolf self-improvement</em>, which I believe has harmed LWers more than any other part of our belief system.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Any time you force yourself to do X alone in your room, or blame yourself for not doing X, or feel isolated while doing X, or surf the web to feel some human contact instead of doing X, or wonder if X might improve your life but can't bring yourself to start... your problem comes from believing that lone wolf self-improvement is fundamentally the right approach. That belief is comforting in many ways, but noticing it is enough to break the spell. The fault wasn't with the operator all along. <em>Lone wolf self-improvement doesn't work</em>.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Doesn't work compared to what? <em>Joining a class</em>. With a fixed schedule, a group of students, a teacher, and an exam at the end. Compared to any \"anti-akrasia technique\" ever proposed on LW or adjacent self-help blogs, joining a class works ridiculously well. You don't need constant willpower: just show up on time and you'll be carried along. You don't get lonely: other students are there and you can't help but interact. You don't wonder if you're doing it right: just ask the teacher.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Can't find a class? Find a club, a meetup, a group of people sharing your interest, any environment where social momentum will work in your favor. Even an online community for X that will reward your progress with upvotes is much better than going X completely alone. But any regular meeting you can attend in person, which doesn't depend on your enthusiasm to keep going, is exponentially more powerful.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Avoiding lone wolf self-improvement seems like embarrassingly obvious advice. But somehow I see people trying to learn X alone in their rooms all the time, swimming against the current for years, blaming themselves when their willpower isn't enough. My message to such people: give up. Your brain is right and what you're forcing it to do is wrong. Put down your X, open your laptop, find a class near you, send them a quick email, and spend the rest of the day surfing the web. It will be your most productive day in months.</div>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I have a new paper that strengthens the case for strong Bayesianism, a.k.a.&nbsp;<a title=\"One Magisterium Bayes\" href=\"/r/discussion/lw/p71/onemagisterium_bayes/\" target=\"_blank\">One Magisterium Bayes</a>.&nbsp;The paper is entitled&nbsp;\"<a href=\"http://authors.elsevier.com/a/1VIqc,KD6ZCKMf\">From propositional logic to plausible reasoning: a uniqueness theorem</a>.\" (The preceding link will be good for a few weeks, after which only the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05261\">preprint version</a> will be available for free. I couldn't come up with the $2500 that Elsevier makes you pay to make your paper open-access.)</p>\n<p>Some background: E. T. Jaynes took the position that (Bayesian) probability theory is an extension of propositional logic to handle degrees of certainty -- and appealed to Cox's Theorem to argue that probability theory is the <strong>only</strong>&nbsp;viable such extension, \"the unique consistent rules for conducting inference (i.e. plausible reasoning) of any kind.\" This position is sometimes called <em>strong Bayesianism</em>.&nbsp;In a nutshell, frequentist statistics is fine for reasoning about frequencies of repeated events, but that's a very narrow class of questions; most of the time when researchers appeal to statistics, they want to know what they can conclude with what degree of certainty, and that is an <em>epistemic</em> question for which Bayesian statistics is the right tool, according to Cox's Theorem.</p>\n<p>You can find a \"guided tour\" of Cox's Theorem <a href=\"http://ksvanhorn.com/bayes/papers.html\">here</a>&nbsp;(see \"Constructing a logic of plausible inference\"). Here's a very brief summary. We write <em>A | X</em> for \"the reasonable credibility\" (plausibility) of proposition <em>A</em> when <em>X</em> is known to be true. Here <em>X</em>&nbsp;represents whatever information we have available. We are <strong>not</strong>&nbsp;at this point assuming that <em>A | X</em>&nbsp;is any sort of probability.&nbsp;A system of plausible reasoning is a set of rules for evaluating <em>A | X</em>. Cox proposed a handful of intuitively-appealing, qualitative requirements for any system of plausible reasoning, and showed that these requirements imply that any such system is just probability theory in disguise. That is, there necessarily exists an order-preserving isomorphism between plausibilities and probabilities such that <em>A | X</em>, after mapping from plausibilities to probabilities, respects the laws of probability.</p>\n<p>Here is one (simplified and not 100% accurate) version of the assumptions required to obtain Cox's result:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>A | X</em>&nbsp;is a real number.</li>\n<li><em>(A | X) = (B | X)</em>&nbsp;whenever <em>A</em>&nbsp;and <em>B</em>&nbsp;are logically equivalent; furthermore, (<em>A | X) &le; (B | X)</em>&nbsp;if <em>B</em>&nbsp;is a tautology (an expression that is logically true, such as (<em>a or not a)</em>).</li>\n<li>We can obtain (<em>not A | X)</em>&nbsp;from <em>A | X</em> via some non-increasing function <em>S</em>. That is, <em>(not A | X) = S(A | X)</em>.</li>\n<li>We can obtain (<em>A and B | X)</em>&nbsp;from <em>(B | X)</em>&nbsp;and <em>(A | B and X)</em>&nbsp;via some continuous function <em>F</em>&nbsp;that is strictly increasing in both arguments: <em>(A and B | X) = F((A | B and X), B | X)</em>.</li>\n<li>The set of triples <em>(x,y,z)</em>&nbsp;such that <em>x = A|X</em>, <em>y = (B | A and X)</em>, and <em>z = (C | A and B and X)</em>&nbsp;for some proposition <em>A</em>, proposition <em>B</em>, proposition <em>C</em>, and state of information <em>X</em>, is dense. Loosely speaking, this means that if you give me any <em>(x',y',z')</em> in the appropriate range, I can find an <em>(x,y,z)</em> of the above form that is arbitrarily close to <em>(x',y',z')</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>The \"guided tour\" mentioned above gives detailed rationales for all of these requirements.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Not everyone agrees that these assumptions are reasonable. My paper proposes an alternative set of assumptions that are intended to be less disputable, as every one of them is simply a requirement that some property <em>already true of propositional logic</em> continue to be true in our extended logic for plausible reasoning. Here are the alternative requirements:</div>\n<div><ol>\n<li>If <em>X</em>&nbsp;and <em>Y</em>&nbsp;are logically equivalent, and <em>A</em>&nbsp;and <em>B</em>&nbsp;are logically equivalent assuming <em>X</em>, then <em>(A | X) = (B | Y)</em>.</li>\n<li>We may define a new propositional symbol <em>s</em> without affecting the plausibility of any proposition that does not mention that symbol. Specifically, if <em>s</em> is a propositional symbol not appearing in <em>A</em>, <em>X</em>, or <em>E</em>, then (<em>A | X) = (A | (s &harr; E) and X)</em>.</li>\n<li>Adding irrelevant background information does not alter plausibilities. Specifically, if <em>Y</em> is a satisfiable propositional formula that uses no propositional symbol occurring in <em>A</em> or <em>X</em>, then (<em>A | X) = (A | Y and X)</em>.</li>\n<li>The implication ordering is preserved: if &nbsp;<em>A &rarr; B</em>&nbsp;is a logical consequence of <em>X</em>, but <em>B &rarr; A</em>&nbsp;is not, then then <em>A | X</em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<em>B | X</em>; that is,&nbsp;<em>A</em>&nbsp;is strictly less plausible than <em>B</em>, assuming <em>X</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>Note that I&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;assume that&nbsp;<em>A | X</em>&nbsp;is a real number. Item 4 above assumes only that there is some&nbsp;<em>partial</em>&nbsp;ordering on plausibility values: in&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;cases we can say that one plausibility is greater than another.</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>I also explicitly take the state of information <em>X</em>&nbsp;to be a propositional formula: all the background knowledge to which we have access is expressed in the form of logical statements. So, for example, if your background information is that you are tossing a six-sided die, you could express this by letting <em>s1</em>&nbsp;mean \"the die comes up 1,\" <em>s2</em>&nbsp;mean \"the die comes up 2,\" and so on, and your background information <em>X</em>&nbsp;would be a logical formula stating that exactly one of <em>s1</em>, ..., <em>s6</em>&nbsp;is true, that is,</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><em>(s1 or s2 or s3 or s5 or s6) and</em></div>\n<div><em>not (s1 and s2) and not (s1 and s3) and not (s1 and s4) and</em></div>\n<div><em> not (s1 and s5) and not (s1 and s6) and not (s2 and s3) and</em></div>\n<div><em>not (s2 and s4) and not (s2 and s5) and not (s2 and s6) and</em></div>\n<div><em>not (s3 and s4) and not (s3 and s5) and not (s3 and s6) and</em></div>\n<div><em>not (s4 and s5) and not (s4 and s6) and not (s5 and s6).</em></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Just like Cox, I then show that there is an order-preserving isomorphism between plausibilities and probabilities that respects the laws of probability.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>My result goes further, however, in that it gives actual numeric values for the probabilities. Imagine creating a truth table containing one row for each possible combination of truth values assigned to each atomic proposition appearing in either <em>A</em>&nbsp;or <em>X</em>. Let <em>n</em>&nbsp;be the number of rows in this table for which <em>X</em>&nbsp;evaluates true. Let <em>m</em>&nbsp;be the number of rows in this table for which both <em>A</em>&nbsp;and <em>X</em>&nbsp;evaluate true. If&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;is the function that maps plausibilities to probabilities, then <em>P(A | X) = m / n</em>.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>For example, suppose that <em>a</em>&nbsp;and <em>b</em>&nbsp;are atomic propositions (not decomposable in terms of more primitive propositions), and suppose that we only know that at least one of them is true; what then is the probability that <em>a</em>&nbsp;is true? Start by enumerating all possible combinations of truth values for&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;and <em>b</em>:</div>\n<div><ol>\n<li><em>a</em> false, <em>b</em>&nbsp;false: <em>(a or b)</em>&nbsp;is false, <em>a</em>&nbsp;is false.</li>\n<li><em>a</em>&nbsp;false, <em>b</em>&nbsp;true : <em>(a or b)</em>&nbsp;is true, &nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;is false.</li>\n<li><em>a</em>&nbsp;true, &nbsp;<em>b</em>&nbsp;false: <em>(a or b)</em>&nbsp;is true, &nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;is true.</li>\n<li><em>a</em>&nbsp;true, &nbsp;<em>b</em>&nbsp;true : <em>(a or b)</em>&nbsp;is true, &nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;is true.</li>\n</ol></div>\n<div>There are 3 cases (2, 3, and 4) in which <em>(a or b)</em>&nbsp;is true, and in 2 of these cases (3 and 4) <em>a</em>&nbsp;is also true. Therefore,</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>P(a | a or b) = 2/3.</em></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>This concords with the classical definition of probability, which Laplace expressed as</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<div>The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to it, to the number of possible cases, when there is nothing to make us believe that one case should occur rather than any other, so that these cases are, for us, equally possible.</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>This definition fell out of favor, in part because of its apparent circularity. My result validates the classical definition and sharpens it. We can now say that a &ldquo;possible case&rdquo; is simply a truth assignment satisfying the premise <em>X</em>. We can simply drop the problematic phrase &ldquo;these cases are, for us, equally possible.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;there is nothing to make us believe that one case should occur rather than any other&rdquo; means that we possess no additional information that, if added to&nbsp;<em>X</em>, would expand by differing multiplicities the rows of the truth table for which <em>X</em>&nbsp;evaluates true.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>For more details, see the paper linked above.</div>",

After a few hours of spinning in circles, I experienced a sudden shift. My mind conjured up the question: &ldquo;Is this a&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">thing out in the world</em>&nbsp;or just a projection?&rdquo; (<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #005695; text-decoration-line: none; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_map_is_not_the_territory\">Map vs Territory</a>). Immediately, a part of my mind replied with &ldquo;Well, this may not be anything other than a story we tell about the behavior of people we dislike&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s ignore the truth value for today and notice the process. I&rsquo;m interested in this mechanism of how a simple query &mdash; checking if I&rsquo;m looking at a confusion of map with the territory &mdash; was able to instantly reframe a problem in a way that allowed me to effortlessly make a mental leap. What&rsquo;s fascinating is that you don&rsquo;t even need someone else&rsquo;s brain to come up with these questions (although that often helps) &mdash; you can try to explain your problem to a&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #005695; text-decoration-line: none; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\">rubber duck</a>&nbsp;which creates a conversation with yourself and generates queries, or just go through a list of things to ask yourself when stuck.</p>\n<div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">There are a few different categories of these types of queries and many examples of each. For instance, when thinking about plans we can ask ourselves to perform&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #005695; text-decoration-line: none; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://wavelength.asana.com/use-techniques-rationality-soundproof-decisions/\">prehindsight/inner simulator</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #005695; text-decoration-line: none; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting\">reference class forecasting/outside view</a>.

In some sense, parts of our brain are not speaking to each other (do they even share the same ontologies?) except through our language processor, and only then if the sentences are constructed in specific ways. This may make you feel relieved if you think you can rely on your subconscious processing &mdash; which may have access to this knowledge &mdash; to guide you to effective action, or terrified if you need to use conscious reasoning to think through a chain of consequences.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">My thoughts on Evil have continued to evolve since that initial revelation, partially driven by trying new queries on the concept (and partially from finally reading Nietzsche). Once you have a set of tools to throw at problems, the bottleneck to clearer thinking becomes remembering to apply them and actually having the time to do so. This makes me wonder about people that have formed habits to automatically apply a litany of these mental moves whenever approaching a problem &mdash; how much of their effectiveness and intelligence can this explain?</p>\n</div>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>There are at least two types of confirmation bias.</p><p>The first is <strong><em>selective attention: </em></strong>a tendency to pay attention to, or recall, that which confirms the hypothesis you are thinking about rather than that which speaks against it.</p><p>The second is <strong><em>selective experimentation: </em></strong>a tendency to do experiments which will confirm, rather than falsify, the hypothesis.</p><p>The standard advice for both cases seems to be &quot;explicitly look for things which would falsify the hypothesis&quot;. I think this advice is helpful, but it is subtly wrong, especially for the selective-experimentation type of confirmation bias. Selective attention is relatively straightforward, but selective experimentation is much more complex than it initially sounds.</p><h2>Looking for Falsification</h2><p>What the standard (Popperian) advice tells you to do is try as hard as you can to falsify your hypothesis. You should think up experiments where your beloved hypothesis really could fail.</p><p>What this advice definitely does do is guard against the mistake of making experiments which could not falsify your hypothesis. Such a test is either violating <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ii/conservation_of_expected_evidence/\">conservation of expected evidence</a> (by claiming to provide evidence one way without having any possibility of providing evidence the other way), or providing only very weak evidence for your claim (by looking much the same whether your claim is true or false). Looking for tests which can falsify your result steers you towards tests which would provide strong evidence, and helps you avoid violating the law of expected evidence.</p><p>However, there are more subtle ways in which confirmation bias can act. </p><h2>Predicting Results in Advance</h2><p>You can propose a test which would indeed fit your hypothesis if it came out one way, and which would disconfirm your hypothesis if it came out the other way -- but where you can predict the outcome in advance. It&#x27;s easy to not realize you are doing this. You&#x27;ll appear to provide significant evidence for your hypothesis, but actually you&#x27;ve cherry-picked your evidence before even looking at it; you knew enough about the world to know where to look to see what you wanted to see.</p><p>Suppose Dr. Y studies a rare disease, Swernish syndrome. Many scientists have formed an intuition that Swernish syndrome has something to do with a chemical G-complex. Dr. Y is thinking on this one night, when the intuition crystallizes into G-complex theory, which would provide a complete explanation of how Swernish syndrome develops. G-complex theory makes the novel prediction that G-complex in the bloodstream will spike during early onset of the disease; if this were false, G-complex theory would have to be false. Dr. Y does the experiment, and finds that the spike does occur. No one has measured this before, nor has anyone else put forward a model which makes that prediction. However, it happens that anyone familiar with the details of Dr. Y&#x27;s experimental results over the past decade would have strongly suspected the same spike to occur, <em>whether or not</em> they endorsed G-complex theory. Does the experimental result constitute significant evidence?</p><p>This is a subtle kind of double-counting of evidence. You have enough evidence to know the result of the experiment; also, your evidence has caused you to generate a hypothesis. You cannot then claim the success of the experiment as more evidence for your hypothesis: you already know what would happen, so it can&#x27;t alter the certainty of your hypothesis.</p><p>If we&#x27;re dealing only with personal rationality, we could invoke conservation of expected evidence again: if you already predict the outcome with high probability, you cannot simultaneously derive much evidence from it. However, in group rationality, there are plenty of cases where you want to predict an experiment in advance and then claim it as evidence. <em>You</em> may already be convinced, but you need to convince skeptics. So, we can&#x27;t criticize someone <em>just</em> for being able to predict their experimental results in advance. That would be absurd. The problem is, <em>the hypothesis isn&#x27;t what did the work of predicting the outcome. </em>Dr. Y had general world-knowledge which allowed him to select an experiment whose results would be in line with his theory. </p><p>To Dr. Y, it just feels like &quot;if I am right, we will see the spike. If I am wrong, we won&#x27;t see it.&quot; From the outside, we might be tempted to say that Dr. Y is not &quot;trying hard enough to falsify G-complex theory&quot;. But how can Dr. Y use this advice to avoid the mistake? A hypothesis is an explicit model of the world, which guides your predictions. When asked to <em>try to falsify</em>, though, what&#x27;s your guide? If you find your hypothesis very compelling, you may have difficulty imagining how it could be false. A hypothesis is solid, definite. The negation of a hypothesis includes <em>anything else</em>. As a result, &quot;try to falsify your hypothesis&quot; is very vague advice. It doesn&#x27;t help that the usual practice is to test against a null hypothesis. Dr. Y tests against the spike not being there, and thinks this sufficient.</p><h2>Implicit Knowledge</h2><p>Part of the problem here is that it should be very clear what could and could not have been predicted. There&#x27;s an interaction between your general world knowledge, which is not explicitly articulated, and your scientific knowledge, which is. </p><p>If all of your knowledge was explicit scientific knowledge, many biases would disappear. You couldn&#x27;t possibly have hindsight bias; each hypothesis would predict the observation with a precise probability, which you can calculate. </p><p>Similarly, the failure mode I&#x27;m describing would become impossible. You could easily notice that it&#x27;s not really your new hypothesis doing the work of telling you which experimental result to expect; you would know exactly what other world-knowledge you&#x27;re using to design your experiment.</p><p>I think this is part of why it is useful to orient toward <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ozz/gearsness_of_understanding/\">gear-like models</a>. If our understanding of a subject is explicit rather than implicit, we can do a lot more to correct our reasoning. However, we&#x27;ll always have large amounts of implicit, fuzzy knowledge coming in to our reasoning process; so, we have to be able to deal with that.</p><h2>Is &quot;Sufficient Novelty&quot; The Answer?</h2><p>In some sense, the problem is that Dr. Y&#x27;s experimental result isn&#x27;t novel enough. It might be a &quot;novel prediction&quot; in the sense that it hasn&#x27;t been explicitly predicted by anyone, but it is a prediction that <em>could</em> have been made without Dr. Y&#x27;s new hypothesis. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, right? It isn&#x27;t enough that a hypothesis makes a prediction which is new. The hypothesis should make a prediction which is <em>really surprising.</em> </p><p>But, this rule wouldn&#x27;t be any good for practical science. How surprising something is is too subjective, and it is too easy for hindsight bias to make it feel as if the result of the experiment could have been predicted. Besides: if you want science to be able to provide compelling evidence to skeptics, you can&#x27;t throw out experiments as unscientific just because most people can predict their outcome.</p><h2>Method of Multiple Hypotheses</h2><p>So, how could Dr. Y have avoided the mistake?</p><p>It is meaningless to confirm or falsify a hypothesis in isolation; all you can really do is provide evidence which helps distinguish <em>between</em> hypotheses. This will guide you away from &quot;mundane&quot; tests where you actually could have predicted the outcome without your hypothesis, because there will likely be many other hypotheses which would be able to predict the outcome of that test. It guides you toward corner cases, where otherwise similar hypotheses make very different predictions.</p><p>We can unpack &quot;try to falsify&quot; as &quot;come up with as many plausible alternative hypotheses as you can, and look for experiments which would rule out the others.&quot; But actually, &quot;come up with alternative hypotheses&quot; is more than an unpacking of &quot;try to falsify&quot;; it shifts you to trying to distinguish between many hypotheses, rather than focusing on &quot;your&quot; hypothesis as central.</p><p>The <em>actual, exactly correct</em> criteria for an experiment is its value-of-information. &quot;Try to falsify your hypothesis&quot; is a lousy approximation of this, which judges experiments by how likely they are to provide evidence against your hypothesis, or the likelihood ratio against your hypothesis in the case where the experiment doesn&#x27;t go as your hypothesis predicts, or something. Don&#x27;t optimize for the wrong metric; things&#x27;ll tend to go poorly for you.</p><p>Some might object that trying-to-falsify is a good heuristic, since value of information is too difficult to compute. I&#x27;d say that a much better heuristic is to pretend distinguishing the right hypothesis is equally valuable in all cases, and look for experiments that allow you to maximally differentiate between them. Come up with as many possibilities as you can, and try to differentiate between the most plausible ones.</p><p>Given that the data was already very suggestive of a G-complex spike, Dr. Y would most likely generate other hypotheses which also involve a G-complex spike. This would make the experiment which tests for the spike uninteresting, and suggest other more illuminating experiments.</p><p>I think &quot;coming up with alternatives&quot; is a somewhat underrated debiasing technique. It is discussed more in Heuer&#x27;s <em>Psychology of Intelligence Analysis</em> and Chamberlin&#x27;s <em>Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses</em>.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Back in December <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/f2c4b64307cc\">Robin Hanson</a> asked people if they would <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2016/12/trade-engagement.html\">trade engagement</a> with him on neglected topics. I couldn&#x2019;t trade with him because I had to make <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9\">my ideas clearer</a> first, and I still have a ways to go before I can reasonably ask many others to engage much with my ideas. But he&#x2019;s written an <a href=\"http://ageofem.com/\">entire book on the implications of brain emulations</a>, or ems, so it seems reasonable that I may try to engage his neglected topic of ems through my neglected topic of phenomenological complexity, and in doing so may make clearer my own ideas while more widely spreading his. If I&#x2019;m lucky, I may even get some engagement back. Let&#x2019;s see what happens.</p><p>Robin focuses on a possible future where brain emulation&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;the ability to run a human brain on artificially constructed hardware like computers&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;develops before other similarly disruptive technologies like <a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html\">superintelligence</a>. Based on the application of the strongest results in physics, engineering, economics, psychology, and sociology, he works out the implications of such an em scenario. You can read his book, <em><a href=\"http://ageofem.com/\">The Age of Em</a></em>, for all the details, but he gives a short overview in this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9qcIsjrHENU\">TED talk</a>.</p><p>To summarize, we can imagine em cities coexisting with human cities, only em cities are much denser than human cities in order to balance communication, cooling, and energy needs. Rather than experiencing life directly in these cities, ems will live in a virtual reality running orders of magnitude faster than human subjective time so that years in em subjective time might pass in weeks or days. Although there may be millions or billions of unique ems, most ems will be copies of the few hundred most successful ems, and further still most of those copies will be spurs that are deleted after completing a specific task. Ems will live near subsistence levels and need to constantly work to support the resources they run on or retire to slower speeds.</p><p>Importantly, since ems are emulations of human brains with little modification, <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/02/on-homo-deus.html\">ems can be understood psychologically as humans living in a very different environment</a>, comparable in difference from our modern world to the difference between humans living in <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/02/ian-morris-on-foragers-farmers-industry-ems.html\">forager and farmer environments</a>. Thus much of the analysis of em behavior comes down to taking humans who evolved for forager life, spent several millennia adapting to farmer life, then spent a few hundred years adapting to industrial life (a process which is still ongoing), and asking them to adapt to em life. Most of that change is likely to be cultural, but since the em age will last for subjective millennia for the fastest running ems, some amount of &#x201C;biological&#x201D; adaptation can be considered, similar in level to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_10,000_Year_Explosion\">the kinds of adaptations populations living in farmer societies for millennia have picked up</a>.</p><p>One of the biggest changes Robin expects from ems is <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/05/forager-vs-farmer-morality.html\">a return to more farmer-like values</a>, such as more respecting social hierarchy and more carefully planning for the future. Modern humans have moved away from farmer values during the <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/this-is-the-dream-time.html\">industrial era dreamtime</a> for <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/10/two-types-of-people.html\">more forager-like values</a>, I suspect largely due to changing amounts of relative economic excess per capita. As a result ems are likely to be more calculating, fearful, judgmental, nepotistic, self-controlled, conservative, loyal, honest, self-sacrificing, polite, hard-working, and religious than industrial era humans with far reaching effects given their technological advantages.</p><p>We see this in Robin&#x2019;s expectations for child-rearing, education, training, and work habits especially. Young ems and humans who may be uploaded are likely to be educated in more varied ways to increase the probability of big winners, with the best performers moving on to join the workforce. Early adulthood is likely to be filled with much high variance apprentice and journeyman work to prepare ems/humans for later work in a variety of roles, and the most productive adult ems (native and uploaded) will later take on master-level work around a subjective age of 40, assuming industrial era individual productivity trends hold. Without biological deterioration, adult ems will likely work for subjective decades to centuries before becoming insufficiently flexible in their thinking to remain productive, at which point they will likely be forced to retire to slower speeds to make way for younger adult ems to replace them, including possibly by younger versions of themselves.</p><p>This presents an environment in which we can analyze the <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9\">phenomenological complexity</a> of ems through the lens of developmental psychology, a topic Robin has thus far ignored presumably because there is not yet strong consensus on how developmental psychology works or if it&#x2019;s even a thing at all. I, however, think there are some robust results we can draw from the field, and I&#x2019;ll explore their implications in order of my confidence that the underlying theory is correct.</p><h3>Caveats</h3><p>But before we continue I want to note a couple things about what Robin has done and what I&#x2019;m planning to do in response to his work. <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/11/01/robin-hanson/\">Robin is not a normal futurist</a>. Most futurists present futures that are <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/08/regulating-infinity.html\">meant to reaffirm values they hold dear</a>. For them futurism is less about predicting the future and more about <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/02/beware-far-values.html\">expressing what they would like the future to be like</a>. That&#x2019;s fine, but Robin is <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2016/06/caplan-audits-age-of-em.html\">explicitly trying to give an accurate assessment</a> of how he thinks an em scenario would play out without expressing an opinion on what he would like the future to be like. In fact, the things you may find repugnant about an em scenario are possibly similarly dissatisfying to Robin, but that doesn&#x2019;t change the nature of what we can reasonably predict. If we find the theorized em era in contradiction of our values, then so much the worse for our values.</p><p>The other thing to note is that what I&#x2019;m attempting here is similar in tone to what Robin has done, so I&#x2019;m going to describe possibilities rather than give you a specific narrative of the future. I don&#x2019;t know what the future will look like, so at best I can point in the direction of outcomes that are likely given what we can extrapolate about the em scenario now. Thus this is less futurism and more predicting the future, and so my claims are all tentative and couched in possibility and do not necessarily promote my values. Please keep that in mind when considering these ideas.</p><h3>Growing up&#xA0;Em</h3><p>The most robust result in developmental psychology is that people mature over time, where I take &#x201C;maturation&#x201D; to be a proxy for phenomenological complexity. This is said without explicit reference to notions of developmental stages, just a correlation of complexity with time, or if we&#x2019;re willing to take a small gamble to get a more precise statement, <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/the-personal-growth-cycle-34ec1c218615\">with variety of life experience</a>. How does this suggest em society will differ from industrial society?</p><p>Since most ems will be subjectively middle-aged, the population of ems will skew much older than <a href=\"http://world.bymap.org/MedianAge.html\">populations in most industrial societies</a>. This implies that the average em will be more mature and phenomenologically complex than the average industrial human, so as a baseline we can look at how human preferences change with age to predict what most ems will prefer. <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167215594189\">As humans enter middle-age</a> they remain concerned with personal values of pleasure, sex, power, prestige, and success that they hold when they are younger, but grow more concerned with abstract and social values like beauty, knowledge, health, stability, affection, belonging, support, obedience, religiosity, and tradition. This differs from a weaker abstract and social values focus when people are younger and a weaker personal values focus when people are older. From this we can expect em populations to share more balanced, conservative, and moderate views than industrial era human populations. This agrees with Robin&#x2019;s idea that ems will hold more farmer-like values.</p><p>Middle-aged maturity can be viewed not just as change with time but as a growth in understanding due to compounding complexity of thought. Until the full onset of senescence, older humans become increasingly likely to exhibit more complex behaviors as measured by <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/unstaging-developmental-psychology-fcdc5f9ba894\">Michael Commons&#x2019; model of hierarchical complexity</a>. I believe this is equivalent to saying they more think with greater phenomenological complexity as measured by <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/in-defense-of-kegan-2ed7ab51b4c8\">Kegan</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development\">Kohlberg</a>, and <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9\">myself</a> along the post-formal stages of thought from the traditional/pre-conventional/subject-level stage to the modern/conventional/subject-relationship stage to the post-modern/post-conventional/<a href=\"https://medium.com/@gworley3/holonic-integration-927ba21d774b\">holonic</a> stage. Further, although most humans in industrial societies still <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674445888\">struggle to move beyond the subject-level stage</a>, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/product/an-everyone-culture-becoming-a-deliberately-developmental-organization/14259-HBK-ENG\">the people most successful in complex organizations</a> are generally middle-aged and show signs of more often thinking at the subject-relationship and holonic stages. This suggests more ems will express thoughts and behaviors requiring subject-relationship and holonic complexity than humans do.</p><p>This may not be uniformly true of ems, though, because there are sometimes competitive advantages to less complex thought. An em who must do many repetitive, boring tasks will likely be happier if they less often experience complex thoughts because <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/fluid-decision-making-d8e4e41a51c0\">the level of task difficulty necessary for them to experience flow state will be lower</a>. Additionally, greater phenomenological complexity appears to be mostly helpful in management and executive tasks and give little marginal advantage for performing tasks specified by others, so there may not be much selection pressure to encourage greater complexity among ems who function primarily as individual contributors within organizations. However it may still prove useful for individual contributors in em organizations if they more tightly coordinate than humans organizations do because phenomenological complexity enables more <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DrSepah/your-company-culture-is-who-you-hire-fire-promote-part-2-anatomy-of-an-asshole-dba4f801b9f5\">cognitive empathy</a> and better communications skills.</p><p>So on the whole we should expect a smaller proportion of the em population to think primarily at the subject-level stage than among the human population and a larger proportion of ems to think primarily at the subject-relationship and holonic stages. In addition to further supporting the conclusion that ems will hold more balanced, moderate, and conservative views than humans do, this also suggests they will be better at self-control, more pro-social, and better at coordination than humans are on average. This slightly disagrees with the ems-are-farmer-like notion because it suggests ems will exceed industrial era humans in terms of social technology who themselves exceed farmer era humans in social technology, and unsurprisingly Robin draws a similar conclusion in <em>The Age of Em.</em></p><h3>Effects on Em&#xA0;Culture</h3><p>After so much agreeing with Robin, you might wonder if there are any places where my expectations of higher average phenomenological complexity among ems predicts anything different. In fact, there are, and they come when we look closer at culture and social structures. For brevity, I will look at those topics on which I disagree with Robin. Note, though, that this section is far more speculative and based largely on my own observations and interpretations of <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20011031?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">capta</a> rather than data. I think it&#x2019;s well reasoned for what it is, but new information could also easily surprise me and cause me to change my mind. I look forward to your comments.</p><p>Because most ems will hold post-conventional moral views, I expect em law to less depend on efficient enforcement of written rules and more depend on ambiguous social enforcement of conventions based on the judgements of respected ems. What written rules there are will be fewer and more strongly enforced when the consensus is that they are useful, but most of what is today &#x201C;law&#x201D; will instead become the unwritten rules of polite society. Ems will be free to defect when they so choose, with the main consequence being (temporary?) ostracism or exile, and most ems will choose not to defect because already living at subsistence levels they will not be able to afford to maintain themselves for long in such a situation. However this mostly applies to the &#x201C;aristocracy&#x201D; of the few hundred em copy clans that make up most of the population, and more efficient law enforcement may prove necessary for em clans with few or only one copy since among these ems society will likely be even more impersonal than it is in the industrial era.</p><p>For similar reasons I suspect em religions will be less farmer-like and continue the industrial era trend towards being less moralizing, more accepting, more encouraging positive behaviors, and more tolerating negative behaviors. Em religions will be more like Unitarian Universalism and modern Chan/Zen Buddhism and less like Abrahamic and Vedic religions because they will need religions that are more amenable to taking a <a href=\"https://meaningness.com/meaningness\">complete stance</a>. Thus em religions will mostly focus on ritual, social cohesion through positive feedback, and advice and less on metaphysics, social cohesion through negative feedback, and ethics.</p><p>I can be less certain of this, but I also predict ems will have much weaker notions of personal identity than even Robin suspects. Phenomenological complexity beyond the subject-level, corresponding to post-formal stages of developmental psychology, creates a more integrated understanding of an individual&#x2019;s place in the universe because the defining feature of the nominal holons of the holonic stage is that they have fluid boundaries that only come into focus by subjects taking particular perspectives. With many physical markers of individual identity made optional for ems, they will likely develop <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality\">eusocial</a> societies with ems playing roles similar to those of individual ants in a nest or bees in a hive. By late in the em era it seems possible that em society will look little like human society and much like an insect colony, at least among the few hundred copy clans that compose most of the population.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>On the whole my analysis of the em scenario via phenomenological complexity agrees with Robin, and in those places where it disagrees the evidence for those disagreements is largely capta rather than data and so amenable only to phenomenological rather than scientific methods and thus outside the scope of what <em>The Age of Em</em> attempts. Taken together this seems to support the strength of Robin&#x2019;s predictions and partially verify phenomenological complexity theory by seeing it generate results that agree with other theories so long as we restrict ourselves to evidence both may consider. Phenomenological complexity theory has a possible advantage of incorporating evidence unavailable to strictly scientific theories, but this relies on a willingness to employ phenomenological methods and evidence. Additionally, the em scenario is a rather strange theory to verify it against, but that&#x2019;s what I get for engaging in neglected topics.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>It seems plausible to me that any example I've seen so far which seems to require causal/counterfactual reasoning is more properly solved by taking the right updateless perspective, and taking the action or policy which achieves maximum expected utility from that perspective. If this were the right view, then the aim would be to construct something like updateless EDT.</p>\n<p>I give a variant of the smoking lesion problem which overcomes an objection to the classic smoking lesion, and which is solved correctly by CDT, but which is not solved by updateless EDT.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>UDT as originally described involved a \"mathematical intuition module\" which would take some sort of logical counterfactual. However, I'll be using the term \"updateless\" purely to describe the decision theory you get by asking another decision theory to choose a policy as soon as it is born, rather than using that decision theory all along. Hence, updateless CDT is what you get when you ask a CDT agent to choose a policy; updateless EDT is what you get when you ask an EDT agent to choose a policy.</p>\n<p>I'll also be treating \"counterfactual\" as synonymous with \"causal\". There are cases where physical causal reasoning seem to give the wrong counterfactual structure, like Newcomb's problem. I won't be trying to solve that problem here; I'm more trying to ask whether there are any cases where causal/counterfactual reasoning looks like what we really want at all.</p>\n<p>The \"common wisdom\", as I have observed it, is that we should be aiming to construct something like an updateless CDT which works well with logical uncertainty. I'm not sure whether that would be the dominant opinion right now, but certainly TDT set things in this direction early on. From my perspective, I don't think it's been adequately established that we should prefer updateless CDT to updateless EDT; providing some evidence on that is the implicit aim of this post. Explicitly, I'll mostly be contrasting updateful CDT with updateful EDT.</p>\n<p>It might be impossible to construct an <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1399\">appropriate logically-updateless perspective</a>, in which case we need logical counterfactuals to compute the effects of actions/policies; but, in some sense this would only be because we couldn't make a <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1206\">sufficiently ignorant prior</a>. (I think of my own <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1472\">attempt at logically updateless decisions</a> this way.) However, that would be unfortunate; it should be easier to construct good counterfactuals if we have a stronger justification for counterfactual reasoning being what we really want. Hence, another aim of this post is to help provide constraints on what good counterfactual reasoning should look like, by digging into reasons to want counterfactuals.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks go to Alex Mennen, Evan Lloyd, and Daniel Demski for conversations sharpening these ideas.</em></p>\n<h2>Why did anyone think CDT was a good idea?</h2>\n<p>The original reasons for preferring CDT to EDT are largely suspect, falling to the <a href=\"http://www.andrewmbailey.com/dkl/Why_Aincha_Rich.pdf\">\"Why Ain'cha Rich?\"</a> objection. From the LessWrong/MIRI perspective, it's quite surprising that Newcomb's Problem was the original motivation <em>for</em> CDT, when we now use it as a point against. This is not the only example. The <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/\">SEP article on CDT</a> gives Prisoner's Dilemma as the first example of CDT's importance, pointing out that EDT cooperates with a copy of itself in PD because unlike CDT it fails to take into account that cooperating is \"auspicious but not efficacious\".</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Smoking_lesion\">Smoking Lesion</a> problem isn't vulnerable to \"Why Ain'cha Rich?\", and so has been a more popular justification for CDT in the LessWrong-sphere. However, I don't think it provides a good justification for CDT at all. The problem is ill-posed: it is assumed that those with a smoking lesion are more likely to smoke, but this is inconsistent with their being EDT agents (who are not inclined to smoke given the problem setup). (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2017/03/18/new-paper-cheating-death-in-damascus/\">Cheating Death in Damascus</a>) points out than Murder Lesion is ill-posed due to similar problems.)</p>\n<p>So, for some time, I have thought that the main effective argument against EDT and for CDT was <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=32\">XOR blackmail</a>. However, XOR blackmail is also solved by updateless EDT. We want to go updateless either way, so this doesn't give us reason to favor CDT over EDT.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I'm quite sympathetic to the <em>intuition</em> behind CDT, namely that it's important to consider the counterfactual consequences of your actions rather than just the conditional expected utilities. Furthermore, the following idea (which I think I got from an academic paper on CDT, but haven't been able to track down which one) seems at least plausible to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If we were dealing with ideal decision agents, who could condition on all the inputs to their decision process, CDT would equal EDT. However, imperfect agents often cannot condition on all their inputs. In this situation, EDT will get things wrong. CDT corrects this error by cutting the relationships which would be screened off if only we could condition on those inputs.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This intuition might seem odd given all the cases where CDT doesn't do so well. If CDT fails Newcomb's problem and EDT doesn't, it seems CDT is at best a hack which repairs some cases fitting the above description at the expense of damaging performance in other cases. Perhaps this is the right perspective. But, we could also think of Newcomblike decision problems as cases where the classical causal structure is just wrong. With the right causal structure, we might postulate, CDT would always be as good as or better than EDT. This is part of what TDT/FDT is.</p>\n<p>I'll charitably assume that we can find appropriate causal structures. The question is, even given that, can we make any sense of the argument for CDT? Smoking Lesion was supposed to be an example of this, but the problem was ill-posed. So, can we repair it?</p>\n<h2>A Smoking Lesion Steelman</h2>\n<h1>Agents who Don't Know their Utility Function</h1>\n<p>I'll be assuming a very particular form of utility function ignorance. Suppose that agents do not have access to their own source code. Furthermore, whether CDT or EDT, the agents have an \"epistemic module\" which holds the world-model: either just the probability distribution (for EDT) or the probability distribution plus causal beliefs. This epistemic module is ignorant of the utility function. However, a \"decision module\" uses what the epistemic module knows, together with the utility function, to calculate the value of each possible action (in the CDT or EDT sense).</p>\n<p>These agents also lack introspective capabilities of any kind. The epistemic module cannot watch the decision module calculate a utility and get information about the utility function that way. (This blocks things like the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/#Obje\">tickle defense</a>).</p>\n<p>These agents therefore have full access to their own utility functions for the sake of doing the usual decision-theoretic calculations. Nonetheless, they lack knowledge of their own utility function in the epistemic sense. They can only infer what their utility function might be from their actions. This may be difficult, because, as we shall see, EDT agents are sometimes motivated to act in a way which avoids giving information about the utility function.</p>\n<p>While I admit this is simply a bad agent design, I don't think it's unrealistic as an extrapolation of current AI systems, <em>or</em> particularly bad as a model of (one aspect of) human ignorance about our own values.</p>\n<p>More importantly, this is just supposed to be a toy example to illustrate what happens when an agent is epistemically ignorant of an important input to its decision process. It would be nice to have an example which doesn't arise from an obviously bad agent design, but I don't have one.</p>\n<h1>Smoking Robots</h1>\n<p>Now suppose that there are two types of robots which have been produced in equal quantities: robots who like smoking, and robots who are indifferent toward smoking. I'll call these \"smoke-lovers\" and \"non-smoke-lovers\". Smoke-lovers ascribe smoking +10 utility. Non-smoke-lovers assign smoking -1 due to the expense of obtaining something to smoke. Also, no robot wants to be destroyed; all robots ascribe this -100 utility.</p>\n<p>There is a hunter who systematically destroys all smoke-loving robots, whether they choose to smoke or not. We can imagine that the robots have serial numbers, which they cannot remove or obscure. The hunter has a list of smoke-lover serial numbers, and so, can destroy all and only the smoke-lovers. The robots don't have access to the list, so their own serial numbers tell them nothing.</p>\n<p>So, the payoffs look like this:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Smoke-lover:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smokes:\n<ul>\n<li>Killed: -90</li>\n<li>Not killed: +10</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Doesn't smoke:\n<ul>\n<li>Killed: -100</li>\n<li>Not killed: 0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Non-smoke-lover:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smokes\n<ul>\n<li>Killed: -101</li>\n<li>Not killed: -1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Doesn't smoke:\n<ul>\n<li>Killed: -100</li>\n<li>Not killed: 0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All robots know all of this. They just don't know their own utility function (epistemically).</p>\n<p>If we suppose that the robots are EDT agents with epsilon-exploration, what happens?</p>\n<p>Non-smoke-lovers have no reason to ever smoke, so they'll only smoke with probability epsilon. The smoke lovers are more complicated.</p>\n<p>The expected utility for different actions depends on the frequency of those actions in the population of smoke-lovers and non-smoke-lovers, so there's a Nash-equilibrium type solution. It couldn't be that all agents choose not to smoke except epsilon often; then, smoking would provide no evidence, so the smoke-lovers would happily decide to smoke. However, it also can't be that smoke-lovers smoke and non-smoke-lovers don't, because then the conditional probability of being killed given that you smoke would be too high.</p>\n<p>The equilibrium will be for smoke-lovers to smoke just a little more frequently than epsilon, in such a way as to equalize the EDT smoke-lover's expected utility for smoking and not smoking. (We can imagine a very small amount of noise in agent's utility calculations to explain how this mixed-strategy equilibrium is actually achieved.)</p>\n<p>As with the original smoking lesion problem, this looks like a mistake on the part of EDT. Smoking does not increase a robot's odds of being hunted down and killed. CDT smoke-lovers would choose to smoke.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this isn't changed at all by trying updateless reasoning. There's not really any more-ignorant position for an updateless agent to back off to, at least not one which would be helpful. So, it seems we really need CDT for this one.</p>\n<h2>What should we think of this?</h2>\n<p>I think the main question here is how this generalizes to other types of lack of self-knowledge. It's quite plausible that any conclusions from this example depend on the details of my utility-ignorance model, which would mean we can fix things by avoiding utility-ignorance (rather than adopting CDT).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, maybe there are less easily avoidable forms of self-ignorance which lead to similar conclusions. Perhaps the argument that CDT outperforms EDT in cases where EDT isn't able to condition on all its inputs can be formalized. If so, it might even provide an argument which is persuasive <em>to an EDT agent</em>, which would be really interesting.</p>\n</body></html>",

A <em>Guide To Better Movement</em> provides both specific exercises for treating those issues and general principles that can be applied to any movement art or therapy.</p><p>The first chapter of this book failed spot checking pretty hard.  If I hadn’t had a very strong recommendation from a friend (“I didn’t take pain medication after two shoulder surgeries” strong), I would have tossed it aside.  But I’m glad I kept going, because it turned out to be quite valuable (this is what triggered that <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2017/06/18/epistemic-spot-check-update/\">meta post</a> on epistemic spot checking).  In accordance with the <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2017/06/18/epistemic-spot-check-update/\">previous announcement</a> on epistemic spot checking, I’m presenting the checks of chapter one (which failed, badly), and chapter six (which contains the best explanation of pain psychology I’ve ever seen), and a review of model quality.  I’m very eager for feedback on how this works for people.</p><h2>Chapter 1: Intro (of the book)</h2><p><em>Claim: “Although we might imagine we are lengthening muscle by stretching, it is more likely that increased range of motion is caused by changes in the nervous system’s tolerance to stretch, rather than actual length changes in muscles. ” (p. 5). </em></p><p><strong>Overstated, weak.  </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.reequilibrio.com.br/home/destino/14c637b69c50d2b5391f8bc1ae53a998.pdf\">PDF</a>).  The paper’s claims to apply this up to 8 weeks, no further.  Additionally, the paper draws most (all?) of its data from two studies and it doesn’t give the sample size of either.</p><p><em>Claim:  “Research shows the forces required to deform mature connective tissue are probably impossible to create with hands, elbows or foam rollers.” (p. 5). </em></p><p><strong>Misleading</strong>. (<a href=\"http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2093620\">Abstract</a>).  Where by “research” the Hargrove means “mathematical model extrapolated from a single subject”.</p><p><em>Claim:  “in hockey players, strong adductors are far more protective against groin strain than flexible adductors, which offer no benefit” (p. 14).</em></p><p><strong>Misleading</strong>. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11292035\">Abstract</a>) Sample size is small, and the study was of the relative strength of adductor to abductor, not absolute strength.</p><p>Claim:

inaccessible to me]</p><p><em>Claim:  “…most studies looking at measurable differences in posture between individuals find that such differences do not predict differences in chronic pain levels.”  (p. 31). </em></p><p><strong>Accurate citation.</strong>  (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19028253\">Abstract</a>).  It’s a metastudy and I didn’t track down any of the 54 studies included, but the results are definitely quoted accurately.</p><p></p><h2>Chapter 6: Pain</h2><p><em>Claim: “Neuromatrix” approach to pain means the pattern of brain activity that create pain, and that pain is an output of brain activity, not an input (p93).</em></p><p><strong>True</strong>, although the ability to correctly use <a

establish causality.</p><p><em>Claim</em>: <em>Many pain-free people have the kinds of injuries doctors blame pain on (p95).</em></p><p><strong>True</strong>, many sources, all with small sample

stimulus because you can have arm pain without an arm (p102).</em></p><p><strong>True</strong>, phantom limb pain is well established.</p><p><em>Claim: some people feel a heart attack as arm pain because the nerves are very close to each other and the heart basically never hurts, so the brain “corrects” the signal to originating in the arm (p102).</em></p><p><strong>First part: True.

 This paper, which is cited by the book’s citation, contains six experiments with sample sizes of fifteen or less.  I am torn between dismissing this because cool results with tiny sample sizes are usually bullshit, and accepting it because it is super cool.</p><p><em>Claim: “a hand that has been disowned through use of the rubber hand illusion will suffer more inflammation in response to a physical insult than a normal hand.” </em>(p. 109).</p><p><strong>Almost accurate citation </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211012000\">source</a>).  The

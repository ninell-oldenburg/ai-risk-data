    "htmlBody": "<p>One concept that people often miss when structuring groups, organizations, or social spaces is <em>the importance of those who aren&#x27;t here. </em>People who aren&#x27;t actively present can be just as important for the medium- and long-term future of your project as those who happen to be around right now (sometimes more so!) -- and if you overfit your planning to the people who happen to be around right now, you may end up damaging your long-term prospects.</p><p>Here are some examples of what this can look like:</p><p><em>1) A king falls into decadence and surrounds himself with flattering courtiers. Whenever he wonders whether things are going in the right direction, the courtiers assure him everything is grand and maneuver to prevent him from learning about any negative developments.</em></p><p><em>2) An online community is meant to represent a wide range of viewpoints and perspectives, but biases in moderation begin to creep in that drive some away. Since the people who don&#x27;t agree with the current approach have mostly left, polling active users no longer accurately samples the broader community that the space was meant to draw on, but rather the people who happen to agree with the current approach.</em></p><p><em>3) An employer begins to remove people who don&#x27;t agree with his strategy and hire those who do. Now, everyone in the organization is on the same page with respect to the strategy -- but when that strategy has flaws there are few internal voices that are able to point that out. </em></p><p><em>4) A person who recently moved is having some social difficulties fitting in to a new community she&#x27;s joined and asks her old friends for advice; because they are already her friends and enjoy her current manner, their advice is not very useful for helping her adapt to a new context!</em></p><p><em>5) A company developing new technology overfixates on their current market and falls prey to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_syndrome\">Galápagos syndrome</a>; their products become overspecialized with features for their existing group and are no longer competitive in the broader market.</em></p><p>Focusing too much on those who are currently present can be insidious because it can be self-reinforcing; once one is focused on an inappropriately small group of users, confidants, or advisers, it can grow increasingly difficult to bring in information from outside this perspective. Further, one who relies too heavily on a certain perspective can ultimately alter their plans in a direction that further reinforces that small group&#x27;s desires, driving more of those who don&#x27;t agree out, and so on.</p><p>In order to avoid this cycle, it&#x27;s important to &quot;look to the river but think of the sea&quot;; in other words, consider not just those that are currently in front of you but also the broader group you hope to reach in the longer term. Solicit outside perspectives or alternate takes and seriously engage with them when making your own plans. In some cases, doing this can be hard -- but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t important.</p><p>After all, if you want to make a difference for more than just those you&#x27;re currently interacting with, it&#x27;s important to make sure you don&#x27;t forget yourself in the current milieu!</p>",

If people aren&#x27;t doing that, or are doing that less than they should, that could potentially be solved as a problem that&#x27;s separate from &quot;should more people be doing FP or traditional research?&quot;</blockquote><blockquote>Also, it&#x27;s not clear to me that traditional research produces more clear distillations of how disagreements get resolved. It seems like most such discussions don&#x27;t make for publishable papers and therefore most disagreements between &quot;traditional researchers&quot; just don&#x27;t get resolved in a way that leaves a public record (or at all).</blockquote><p>The LessWrong team has discussed this on and off for about 9 months. While we haven&#x27;t done any development work on it yet (mostly working on Open Questions instead), habryka and I at least had some sense that this might be one of the most important things LessWrong is missing.</p><p>I have some vague thoughts on what would be needed here, but am interested in others opinions.</p><p>The rough thing that seems missing to me is a pipeline that goes something like:</p><p>1. Somebody notices that there was either a post that was way longer than it needed to be (or a bit confusing, or something). <em>Or</em> a meandering comment conversation that was could use to be distilled down into a post. They flag that collection of posts and comments into a databse object that says &quot;hey, this cluster of posts and/or comments could use distillation&quot;</p><p>2. Someone (sometimes that same person, sometimes a totally different person), writes up a distillation of that cluster of posts and/or comments</p><p>3. It might be that different people write up <em>different</em> distillations of the same content, because they had different takeaways. Or maybe two people both agreed that a post was long, but they both found different central metaphors useful. </p><p>4. The people who wrote the original post or comments can mark distillations as &quot;good representation of my views&quot; or not.</p><p>In theory there&#x27;s nothing preventing this from happening with the current site technology. But, a year ago, there was nothing stopping people from making question posts (and getting answers). And yet introducing the question feature made it much more salient that &quot;ask questions&quot; is a thing you&#x27;re encouraged to do, and then people did it more. </p><p>I think having some kind of official distillation pipeline could be useful in a similar way.</p><p>Interested in people&#x27;s thoughts on this.</p>",

Good questions are those that are safe and useful: that allows us to get information out of the Oracle without increasing risk.</p>\n<p>To enter, put your suggestion in the comments below. The contest ends at the end<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Y6R9nAPXFr9reoTBt-1\" id=\"fnref-Y6R9nAPXFr9reoTBt-1\">[1]</a></sup> of the <strong>31st of August, 2019</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Oracles</h2>\n<p>A perennial suggestion for a safe AI design is the Oracle AI: an AI confined to a sandbox of some sort, that interacts with the world only by answering questions.</p>\n<p>This is, of course, not safe in general; an Oracle AI can <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nAwTGhgrdxE85Bjmg/tools-versus-agents\">influence the world through the contents of its answers</a>, allowing it to <a href=\"http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox/\">potentially escape the sandbox</a>.</p>\n<p>Two of the safest designs seem to be the counterfactual Oracle, and the low bandwidth Oracle. These are detailed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05541.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i2dNFgbjnqZBfeitT/oracles-sequence-predictors-and-self-confirming-predictions\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wJ3AqNPM7W4nfY5Bk/self-confirming-prophecies-and-simplified-oracle-designs\">here</a>, but in short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A counterfactual Oracle is one whose objective function (or reward, or loss function) is only non-trivial in worlds where its answer is not seen by humans. Hence it has no motivation to manipulate humans through its answer.</li>\n<li>A low bandwidth Oracle is one that must select its answers off a relatively small list. Though this answer is a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KoEY9CjrKe93ErYhd/self-confirming-predictions-can-be-arbitrarily-bad\">self-confirming prediction</a>, the negative effects and potential for manipulation is restricted because there are only a few possible answers available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that both of these Oracles are designed to be episodic (they are run for single episodes, get their rewards by the end of that episode, aren't asked further questions before the episode ends, and are only motivated to best perform on that one episode), to avoid incentives to longer term manipulation.</p>\n<h2>Getting useful answers</h2>\n<p>The counterfactual and low bandwidth Oracles are safer than unrestricted Oracles, but this safety comes at a price. The price is that we can no longer \"ask\" the Oracle any question we feel like, and we certainly can't have long discussions to clarify terms and so on. For the counterfactual Oracle, the answer might not even mean anything real to us - it's about another world, that we don't inhabit.</p>\n<p>Despite this, its possible to get a surprising amount of good work out of these designs. To give one example, suppose we want to fund various one of a million projects on AI safety, but are unsure which one would perform better. We can't directly ask either Oracle, but there are indirect ways of getting advice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We could ask the low bandwidth Oracle which team A we should fund; we then choose a team B at random, and reward the Oracle if, at the end of a year, we judge A to have performed better than B.</li>\n<li>The counterfactual Oracle can answer a similar question, indirectly. We commit that, if we don't see its answer, we will select team A and team B at random and fund them for year, and compare their performance at the end of the year. We then ask for which team A<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Y6R9nAPXFr9reoTBt-2\" id=\"fnref-Y6R9nAPXFr9reoTBt-2\">[2]</a></sup> it expects to most consistently outperform any team B.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both these answers get around some of the restrictions by deferring to the judgement of our future or counterfactual selves, averaged across many randomised universes.</p>\n<p>But can we do better? Can we do more?</p>\n<h2>Your better questions</h2>\n<p>This is the purpose of this contest: for you to propose ways of using either Oracle design to get the most safe-but-useful work.</p>\n<p>So I'm offering $1,000 for interesting new questions we can ask of these Oracles. Of this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$350 for the best question to ask a counterfactual Oracle.</li>\n<li>$350 for the best question to ask a low bandwidth Oracle.</li>\n<li>$300 to be distributed as I see fit among the non-winning entries; I'll be mainly looking for innovative and interesting ideas that don't quite work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exceptional rewards go to those who open up a whole new category of useful questions.</p>\n<h2>Questions and criteria</h2>\n<p>Put your suggested questions in the comment below. Because of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency\">illusion of transparency</a>, it is better to explain more rather than less (within reason).</p>\n<p>Comments that are submissions must be on their separate comment threads, start with \"Submission\", and <strong>you must specify which Oracle design you are submitting for</strong>. You may submit as many as you want; I will still delete them if I judge them to be spam. Anyone can comment on any submission. I may choose to ask for clarifications on your design; you may also choose to edit the submission to add clarifications (label these as edits).</p>\n<p>It may be useful for you to include details of the physical setup, what the Oracle is trying to maximise/minimise/predict and what the counterfactual behaviour of the Oracle users humans are assumed to be (in the counterfactual Oracle setup). Explanations as to how your design is safe or useful could be helpful, unless it's obvious. Some short examples <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cSzaxcmeYW6z7cgtc/contest-usd1-000-for-good-questions-to-ask-to-an-oracle-ai#gyyXHioXarf7c6LXx\">can be found here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> after seeing some of the answers: decide on the length of each episode, and how the outcome is calculated. The Oracle is run once an episode only (and other Oracles can't generally be used on the same problem; if you want to run multiple Oracles, you have to justify why this would work), and has to get objective/loss/reward by the end of that episode, which therefore has to be estimated in some way at that point.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-Y6R9nAPXFr9reoTBt-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>A note on timezones: as long as it's still the 31 of August, anywhere in the world, your submission will be counted. <a href=\"#fnref-Y6R9nAPXFr9reoTBt-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-Y6R9nAPXFr9reoTBt-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>These kind of conditional questions can be answered by a counterfactual Oracle, see the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05541.pdf\">paper here</a> for more details. <a href=\"#fnref-Y6R9nAPXFr9reoTBt-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>If you are already sort of familiar with the Transformer, this post can serve as a standalone technical explanation of the architecture. Otherwise, I recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qscAeYE67GoSffDDA/walkthrough-the-transformer-architecture-part-1-2\">part one</a> to get the gist of what the network is doing. </p><p>Yesterday, I left us with two images of the Transformer architecture. These images show us the general flow of data through the network. The first image shows the stack of encoders and decoders in their bubbles, which is the basic outline of the Transformer. The second image shows us the sublayers of the encoder and decoder.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kPPcGSs.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:72%\"></figure></span><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WCYXQqN.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:61%\"></figure></span><br><p>Now, with the picture of how the data moves through the architecture, I will fully explain a forward pass with an example. Keep the general structure in mind as we go through the details, which can be a bit mind-numbing at parts.</p><h2>The task</h2><p>The Transformer is well suited for translating sentences between languages. Since I don't speak any language other than English, I have decided to translate between sarcastic sentences and their intended meaning. In the example, I am translating the phrase \"Yeah right\" to \"That's not true.\" This way all those robots who only understand the literal interpretation of English can simply incorporate a Transformer into their brain and be good to go. </p><h2>The embedding </h2><p>Before the sentence \"Yeah right\" can be fed into the architecture, it needs to take a form that is understood by the network. In order to have the architecture read words, we therefore need embed each word into a vector. </p><p>We <em>could</em> just take the size of the vocabulary of the document we are working with, and then one-hot encode each word into a fantastically sparse and long vector. But this approach has two problems:</p><p>1. The high dimension that these vectors are in makes them harder to work with.</p><p>2. There's no natural interpretation of proximity in this vector space.</p><p>Ideally, we want words that are similar to be related in some way when they are embedded into a vector format. For instance, we might want all the fruits {apple, orange, pear} to be close to each other in some cluster, and far enough away from the vehicle cluster {car, motorcycle, truck} to form distinct groups.</p><p>To be brief, the way that we do this is to use some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding\">word embedding</a> neural network that has already been trained on English sentences.</p><h2>Positional encoding</h2><p>After we have obtained a set of word-embedded vectors for each word in our sentence, we still must do some further pre-processing before our neural network is fully able to grasp English sentences. The Transformer doesn't include a default method for analyzing the order of words in a sentence that it is fed. That means that we must somehow add the relative order of words into our embedding. </p><p>Order is of course necessary because we don't want the model to mistake \"Yeah right\" with \"Right yeah.\" A mistake like that could be so catastrophic that we would get the <em>opposite</em> result of what we want from the network. </p><p>Before I just show you how positions are encoded, let me first show you the naive way that someone might do it, and how I first thought about it. I thought the picture would somehow look like this.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Iyqt7xI.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:66%\"></figure></span><p>Here I have displayed the word embedding as the left four entries in the vector, and concatenated it with the position of the word in the sentence. I want to be very clear: this is <em>not</em> the way that it works. I just wanted to show you first the bad first pass approach before telling you the correct one, just to save you the trouble of being confused about why it doesn't work the way you imagined it in your head.</p><p>The correct way that the positional encoding works is like this.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Kzzcki2.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:87%\"></figure></span><p>Rather than just being a number, the positional encoding is another vector whose dimension is equal to the word embedding vector length. Then, instead of concatenating, we perform an element wise vector addition with the word embedding.</p><p>The way that we compute the positional encoding vector is a bit tricky, so bear with me as I describe the formula. In a moment, I will shed light on how this formula will allow the model to understand word order in a justified manner.

Now we have a way of transforming the vector in a linear fashion in order to obtain the position of the another word in the sentence. This means that we have a sort of language where a linear function translates to \"the last word\" or \"the word 10 words ago.\" If we add these two encodings, the hope is that the model should be able to incorporate <em>both</em> the relative meaning of the words, and the relative positions, all in a single compact vector. And empirically, the model seems to be able to do just that.</p><p>Now that these two ways of representing the vector are combined, the words are ready to interact by being fed into the self-attention module. </p><h2>Self-attention</h2><p>Recall that the whole point of the Transformer architecture is that it is built on attention modules. So far we have only focused on processing the word vectors in a way that will be understood by the model. Now, we must understand what is done to these embedded vectors.</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IFht4Of.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:80%\"></figure></span><br><p>As we can see in the image above, each vector in the sentence is fed through the self attention module.

This new sequence can be seen as a modified version of the original sequence, with some new information baked into each word. These new vectors contain information about how the words relate to each other.</p><p>In the last post, I described how self attention allowed the Transformer to construct links between words, which are intended to represent the relationship between words. However, it still isn't clear exactly how we find the strength of these links. </p><p>In order to create the links, we first must understand the idea of <strong>keys</strong>, <strong>queries </strong>and<strong> values</strong>. I will borrow the analogy that nostalgebraist uses in <a href=\"https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/185326092369/the-transformer-explained\">their explanation</a> of the Transformer. You can imagine keys as vectors which represent a dating profile for a word, which includes information that might be useful for connecting them to other words. Queries, by contrast, are vectors which include information about what each word is looking for in each other word. Values are vectors which contain some more information about the word that isn't already represented. Our job is to use these keys and queries, which are learned for each word, in order to construct a table of matches. Each link in the table represents the relationship status between the words. Once we have these links, the strength of these links allow us to weight the words by their values. By doing this, each word sort of becomes an infusion of all the words they are dating, which could include themselves. </p><p>That is quite a lot to take in. Luckily, I will go through the process of constructing keys, queries and values, and the appropriate weighting, step by step. </p><p>The first thing to understand is that the keys and queries are not explicitly represented in the Transformer. Instead keys, queries, and values are constructed by multiplying the embedded vectors by a matrix of weights, which <em>is</em> directly learned. This is how I visualize the process.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vqez6Ai.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:75%\"></figure></span><p>Here, I have repeated the input vector for the first word three times, once for each computation.

Then we take a softmax over the scores for each word, so that they are all positive and add up to one. Then, for each word, we sum over the values of every other word, weighted by the softmax scores. Then we are done. Here is what that looks like for the first word in our sentence. </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BwgHdgy.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:71%\"></figure></span><p>The intuitive justifications for each of these steps may not first be apparent.

But not so fast! I temporarily skipped over a key component to the Transformer, and what allows it to be so powerful.</p><p>The step I missed was that I didn't tell you that that there's actually <em>multiple</em> keys, queries, and values for each word. This allows the model to have a whole bunch of different ways to represent the connections between words. Let me show you how it works.</p><p>Instead of thinking about finding the sum over values for each word, we should instead think about multiple, parallel processes each computing different sums over values. Each <em>attention head</em> computes a value (the weighted sum), using weight matrices which were all initialized differently. Then when all of the attention heads have calculated their values, we combine these into a single value which summarizes all the contextual information that each attention head was able to find.</p><p>In order to combine the values found by the attention heads, we concatenate each of the values, and multiply the concatenated matrix by another learned matrix.

The way that this works is by implementing a layer normalization step to the sum of the outputs and inputs. If you don't know what layer normalization is, don't worry. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450\">Layer normalization</a> is an operation based on batch normalization, intended to reduce some of batch normalization's side effects.

But first, a note on notation. </p><h2>Notation</h2><p>This will likely come as no surprise, but the way that the above operations are performed are above the level of vectors. In order to speed up computation and simplify the way we write the algorithm, we really have to put all the steps into higher order arrays.

The <em>rows</em> in the matrices are the vectors of queries, keys and values, which we have already discussed above. It should be understood that any step which allows for some form of parallelization and simplification, a matrix representation is preferred to vectors. </p><h2>The feed forward neural network</h2><p>We are almost done with one slice of an encoder. Even though most of the time was spent on the previous step (the attention and norm sublayer), this next one is still quite important. It is merely simpler to understand. Once we have the words generated by the self attention module, and it is handed to the layer-norm step, we must now put each word through a feed forward neural network.</p><p>This is an important point, so it's important not to miss: the same neural network is applied independently to each of the words produced by the previous step. There are many neural networks at this slice of the encoder, but they all share weights. On the other hand, neural networks <em>between</em> layers do not share weights. This allows the words to solidify their meaning from some non-linearity in the neural network before being shipped off to the next step, which is an identical slice of the encoder.</p><h2>The stack</h2><p>As mentioned before, the encoder and decoder are made up of a stack of attention mechanism/neural network modules. Words are passed through the bottom of a single slice of this stack, and words appear out the top. The <em>same</em> number of words are outputted from the encoder stack as inputted from the encoder stack. In other words, the vectors pass through the layers in the same shape that they started. In this sense, you can trace a single word through the stack, going up from the encoder.</p><h2>Encoder-decoder crossover</h2><p>At this point, the encoder is pretty much fully explained. And with that, the decoder is <em>nearly</em> explained, since the two share most properties. If you have been following this far, you should be able to trace how an embedded sentence is able to go through an encoder, by passing through many layers, each of which have a self attention component followed by a feed-forward neural network. The way that data travels through a decoder is similar, but we still must discuss how the encoder and decoder interact, and how the output is produced. </p><p>I said in the previous post that when the encoder produces its output, it somehow is able to give information to each of the layers of the decoder. This information is incorporated into the encoder-decoder attention module, which is the main difference between the encoder and decoder. The exact mechanism for how this happens is relatively simple. Take a look at the decoder structure one more time. </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5k0OtjD.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:76%\"></figure></span><p>I have added the box on the left to clarify how the decoder takes in the input from the encoder. In the encoder-decoder attention sublayer, the keys and values are inherited from the output of the last encoder layer. These keys and values are computed the same way that we computed keys and values above: via a matrix of weights which act on the words. In this case, just as in the last, there is a <em>different</em> matrix acting on each layer, even as these matrices act on the <em>same</em> set of words: the final output of the encoder. This extra module allows the decoder to attend to all of the words in the input sequence. </p><p>In line with the previous description, the <em>values</em> in the encoder-decoder attention sublayer are derived from the outputs of the self-attention layer below it, which works exactly the same as self-attention worked in the encoder. </p><p>In the first pass through the network, the words \"Yeah right\" are passed through the encoder, and two words appear at the top. Then we use the decoder to successively work from there, iteratively applying self attention to an input (which input? this will be elaborated in just a moment) and plugging its output into the encoder-decoder attention. The encoder then attends to the output from the encoder, along with the output from self-attention. This is then fed into a neural network step, before being handed off to the <em>next</em> decoder in the stack. At the top of the decoder, we feed the output one last time through a linear layer and a softmax layer, in order to produce a single word, the output of the network on a single step.</p><p>Then, after a single word is produced, we put that back into the input of the decoder and run the decoder again, now with its ouput being parsed as input. We stop whenever the decoder outputs a special symbol indicating that it has reached the end of its translation, the <em>end</em> token. This process would look end like this.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4Ds3n1b.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>Before the decoder has produced an output, we don't want it to be able to attend to tokens which have not been seen yet. Therefore, in our <em>first</em> pass through the decoder, we set all the softmax inputs in self-attention to <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"-\\infty\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">−</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">∞</span></span></span></span></span></span> . Recall that when the softmax is applied, we use the resulting output to weight the values in the self-attention module. If we set these inputs to the softmax to <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"-\\infty\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">−</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">∞</span></span></span></span></span></span> , the result is that the softmax outputs a zero, which correspondingly gives those values no weight. In <em>future</em> passes, we ensure that every input that corresponds to a future word is treated similarly, so that there cannot be connections between words that we have not outputted yet.<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"^1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char\"></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </p><p>Now, with the mechanism for producing outputs fully elucidated, we are ready to stare at the full network, with all of its tiny details. I do not want to compete with the original paper for illustrations on this one. Therefore, I have incorporated figure 1 from the paper and placed it here. </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tfSEBYY.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:70%\"></figure></span><p>As you might have noticed, I neglected to tell you about some extra residual connections. Regardless, they work the same way that I described above, so there should be no confusion there! Other than that, I have covered pretty much part of the Transformer design. You can now gaze your eyes upon the above image and feel the full satisfaction of being able to understand every part (if you've been paying <em>attention</em>). </p><p>Of course, we haven't actually gone into how it is trained, or how we generate the single words from the final softmax layer and output probabilities. But this post is long enough, and such details are not specific to the Transformer anyway. Perhaps one day I shall return. </p><p>For now, I will  be leaving the transformer architecture. In tomorrow's post I will cover batch normalization, another one of those relatively new ML concepts that you should know about. See you then. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p> <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"^1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char\"></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> If this discussion of exactly how the decoder incorporates its own output, and masks illegal connections confuses you, you're not alone.

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>(cross posted from my <a href=\"http://www.jhazard.com/posts/ignoring_emotions.html\">personal blog</a>)</em></p><p>Since middle school I&#x27;ve generally thought that I&#x27;m pretty good at dealing with my emotions, and a handful of close friends and family have made similar comments. Now I can see that though I was particularly good at never flipping out, I was decidedly <em>not</em> good &quot;healthy emotional processing&quot;. I&#x27;ll explain later what I think &quot;healthy emotional processing&quot; is, right now I&#x27;m using quotes to indicate &quot;the thing that&#x27;s good to do with emotions&quot;. Here it goes...</p><h2><strong>Relevant context</strong></h2><p>When I was a kid I adopted a strong, &quot;Fix it or stop complaining about it&quot; mentality. This applied to stress and worry as well. &quot;Either address the problem you&#x27;re worried about or quit worrying about it!&quot; Also being a kid, I had a limited capacity to actually fix anything, and as such I was often exercising the &quot;stop worrying about it&quot; option.</p><p>Another thing about me, I was a massive book worm and loved to collect &quot;obvious mistakes&quot; that heroes and villains would make. My theory was, &quot;Know all the traps, and then just <em>don&#x27;t</em> fall for them&quot;. That plus the sort of books I read meant that I &quot;knew&quot; it was a big no-no to ignore or repress your emotions. Luckily, since I knew you shouldn&#x27;t repress your emotions, I &quot;just didn&#x27;t&quot; and have lived happily ever after</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>yeah nopes.</p><h2><strong>Wiggling ears</strong></h2><p>It can be really hard to teach someone to move in a way that is completely new to them. I teach parkour, and sometimes I want to say, </p><p>Me: &quot;Do the shock absorbing thing with your legs!&quot;  Student: &quot;What&#x27;s the shock absorbing thing?&quot;  Me: &quot;... uh, you know... the thing were your legs... absorb shock?&quot; </p><p>It&#x27;s hard to know how to give cues that will lead to someone making the right mental/muscle connection. Learning new motor movements is somewhat of a process of flailing around in the dark, until some feedback mechanism tells you you did it right (a coach, it&#x27;s visually obvious, the jump doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore, etc). Wiggling your ears is a nice concrete version of a) movement most people&#x27;s bodies are capable of and b) one that most people feel like is impossible.</p><p>Claim: learning mental and emotional skills has a similar &quot;flailing around in the dark&quot; aspect. There are the mental and emotional controls you&#x27;ve practiced, and those just feel like moving your arm. Natural, effortless, atomic. But there are other moves, which you are <em>totally capable of</em> which seem impossible because you don&#x27;t know how your &quot;control panel&quot; connects to that output. This feels like trying to wiggle your ears.</p><h2><strong>Why &quot;ignore&quot; and &quot;deal with&quot; looked the same</strong></h2><p>So young me is upset that the grub master for our camping trip forgot half the food on the menu, and all we have for breakfast is milk. I couldn&#x27;t &quot;fix it&quot; given that we were in the woods, so my next option was &quot;stop feeling upset about it.&quot; So I reached around in the dark of my mind, and Oops, the &quot;healthily process feelings&quot; lever is <em>right next to</em> the &quot;stop listening to my emotions&quot; lever.</p><p>The end result? &quot;Wow, I decided to stop feeling upset, and then I stopped feeling upset. I&#x27;m so fucking good at emotional regulation!!!!!&quot;</p><p>My model now is that I <a href=\"http://www.jhazard.com/posts/question_substitution.html\">substituted</a> &quot;is there a monologue of upsetness in my conscious mental loop?&quot; for &quot;am I feeling upset?&quot;. So from my perspective, it just felt like I was very in control of my feelings. Whenever I wanted to stop feeling something, I could. When I thought of ignoring/repressing emotions, I imagined trying to cover up something that was there, maybe with a story. Or I thought if you poked around ignored emotions there would be a response of anger or annoyance. I at least expected that if I was ignoring my emotions, that if I got very calm and then asked myself, &quot;Is there anything that you&#x27;re feeling?&quot; I would get an answer.</p><p>Again, the assumption was, &quot;If it&#x27;s in my mind, I should be able to notice if I look.&quot; This ignored what was actually happening, which was that I was cutting the phone lines so my emotions couldn&#x27;t talk to me in the first place. Actually, the phone lines metaphor is a bit off, here&#x27;s a better one.</p><h2><strong>Parent-child model</strong></h2><p>My self-concept and conscious mind are the parent. Emotions are young children that run up to the parent to tell them something. Sometimes the child runs up to complain, &quot;Heeeeeeeeeey I&#x27;m huuuuuuungry!&quot; My emotional management was akin to the parenting style of slapping the child and saying, &quot;Being hungry would suck, so <em>you aren&#x27;t hungry</em>.&quot;</p><p>Yikes.</p><p>I know full well that you can&#x27;t slap someone into having a full stomach, but you can slap someone into not bringing their complaints to you. </p><p>I&#x27;ve experienced this <em>directly extend</em> to my internal world. My emotions / <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/M4w2rdYgCKctbADMn/sequence-introduction-non-agent-and-multiagent-models-of\">sub-agents</a> aren&#x27;t stupid. They learned that telling me, &quot;Hey, you&#x27;re concerned about your relationship with your friend!&quot;, &quot;Hey, we really don&#x27;t like getting laughed at&quot;, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re concerned that this bad thing is going to happen indefinitely&quot; would result in getting slapped. So they learned to stay quiet. </p><p>This got to the point where I&#x27;d feel awesome and great during my busy week, and then &quot;mysteriously&quot; and &quot;for no reason&quot; feel an amorphous blob of gray badness on the weekends. I had various social and emotional needs that weren&#x27;t being met, but I didn&#x27;t realize that. I quite intensely tried to introspect to see if this gray blob was &quot;about anything&quot;, but only heard quiet static. This was me being the angry parent with their kids having a dinner of half a slice of bread each, shouting, &quot;Is anyone hungry?! Huh??! No? GREAT.&quot;</p><p>Owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww</p><h2><strong>... and now?</strong></h2><p>When I was a kid, my desire to &quot;not worry if it was useless&quot; was mostly one of &quot;people who worry seem to be in pain, I&#x27;d prefer to not be in pain.&quot; Overtime, it turned into a judgmental world view. How <em>wasteful</em> and <em>useless</em> to be embarrassed/worried/scared/etc. This was the transition from a naive parent telling their kid, &quot;Hmmmm, have you tried not being hungry?&quot; to the angry parent shouting, &quot;You won&#x27;t be hungry in <em>my</em> house!!&quot; (one might wonder how exactly that transition from naive to judgmental happened. That&#x27;s a whole other story for a different post)</p><p>Over the past year I&#x27;ve haphazardly free styled towards opening up emotional communication with myself, and I&#x27;ve made progress. I&#x27;m still not sure what &quot;healthy emotional processing&quot; looks like, but I&#x27;ve gotten HUGE gains from just being able to sit with the fact that I&#x27;m feeling something, and hug the child that brought that emotion instead of slapping them.</p><p>I guess the biggest thing I wanted to impart with this piece was 1. the parent child model, but also 2. that ignoring your emotions can start as a simple innocent mistake. </p><p>Related. A sentiment in a LW thread I heard in the past few months was that the biggest barrier to rational discourse is creating environments where everyone feels safe thinking (not the same thing as a safe space). Extend that to the mind. The biggest barrier to rational thinking is organizing your mind such that it&#x27;s safe to think. I still promote and admire &quot;look towards the truth, even if it hurts&quot;, but I know see that if you don&#x27;t spend enough resources on addressing that hurt, the hurt parts of yourself can and <em>will</em> take measures to protect themselves. Treat yourself well.</p><br/>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I&#x27;d like to point out a phenomenon that has predictable consequences, that people are seemingly unaware of:</p><p>The <strong>Drive-By Low-Effort Criticism</strong><em>.</em></p><p>To illustrate, we&#x27;ll use:</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yGycR8tFA3JJbvApp/the-relationship-between-the-village-and-the-mission\">The Relationship Between the Village and the Mission</a></em></p><p>That was a recent post by Raemon on here that, as far as I can tell,  (1) took an incredible amount of work to make, (2) was incredibly pro-social, (3) was incredibly well-intentioned, and (4) is the class of thing that has massively high-upside if it works. It might not work, but it&#x27;s the type of thing that should be encouraged.</p><p>To further break this down, the post was:</p><p>-&gt; 5,444 words (!)</p><p>-&gt; Deep-linked/cited 26 other posts (!)</p><p>-&gt; Had analysis, context, tradeoffs, anticipation of likely questions or objections, actionable ideas, etc</p><p>-&gt; Was nicely formatted for readability with headlines, appropriate bold and italics, etc etc.</p><p>-&gt; Offered to do real-world things at author&#x27;s time and expense to improve the real-world rationality community (!!!)</p><p>-&gt; It even contained a motherfuckin&#x27; Venn diagram (!!!)</p><p>In any event, I think we can clearly say it was a <strong>high effort post.</strong> How many hours did it take? Jeez. More than 2 hours, for sure. More than 5 hours, very likely. More than 10 hours, probably. More than 20 hours? 30? Probably under a hundred hours, but heck, maybe not if you consider all the time thinking about the concepts.</p><p>Regardless — <em>hours</em>. Not minutes. High effort.</p><p>And this is clearly someone who cares immensely about what he&#x27;s doing. And it&#x27;s clearly well-intentioned. And it&#x27;s humble. And it&#x27;s... it&#x27;s just great. Hats off to Raemon.</p><p>Now, it might not work. It might be unfeasible. But he&#x27;s certainly putting in a big effort to see if something good is possible.</p><p>What is his top comment? Here&#x27;s how the first one starts —</p><blockquote><em>[ comment copied from Facebook / I didn&#x27;t read the full article before making this comment ]</em></blockquote><blockquote>i am somewhat anti-&quot;Mission-centered Village.&quot;</blockquote><p>Wait, <strong><em>you didn&#x27;t read the full article</em></strong> before <strong><em>making a drive-by low-effort criticism</em></strong> of the concept?</p><p>Okay. Deep breath. What&#x27;s the second top-level comment?</p><blockquote>Here is my brain dump: I have mostly given up on the Berkeley rationality community as a possible village. I think the people who showed up here were mostly selected for being bad at villaging, and that the awful shit that&#x27;s been happening around here lately is downstream of that.</blockquote><p><strong>*facepalm*</strong></p><p>Raemon spent <em>hours and hours</em> making that post. He&#x27;s working hard to do it.</p><p>The top two ranked replies are... well, that&#x27;s what they are.</p><p>They elaborate a bit more — but <em>even if both comments are correct</em>, you know that has a huge adverse effect on people&#x27;s willingness to post and contribute ideas, right? Right? You <em>already know that</em>, don&#x27;t you? Don&#x27;t you?</p><p>I mean, at the risk of overstating the case, I think this sort of behavior borders on criminal. </p><p>I know it doesn&#x27;t <em>feel malevolent, </em>but the predictable end result is getting less contributions like that.</p><p>When a person takes a huge amount of time to attempt to make a contribution to a community, I think criticism should spend at least <em>some</em> time getting <em>fully oriented </em>around the idea, understanding and respecting the author&#x27;s perspective, and looking to <em>engage in dialog that&#x27;d be appreciated by the author</em>. </p><p>That is, if you care about high-effort thoughtful pro-social contributions.</p><p>The Drive-By Low-Effort Criticism is easy to do.</p><p>It&#x27;s easy to spot a potential hole in someone&#x27;s argument. </p><p>It&#x27;s easy to raise an objection.</p><p>It&#x27;s easy to spout off whatever first comes to mind.</p><p>It&#x27;s much harder to fully understand the author&#x27;s point of view, their end goals, the amount of time they put in to do the work, to respect and acknowledge that effort, and to look to post something that rewards, encourages, and promotes that sort of behavior.</p><p>In fairness, both of those commentors had more to say, and are no doubt smart people. But, like, some basics of empathy, politeness, constructiveness, acknowledgement, and such is <em>essential</em> — if you care about getting high-effort contributions in the future.</p><p>It straight-up sucks for people to make a ton of work and the first thing they see in reply is negative and fast. Not fully edited. Not acknowledging the whole picture. <strong>Not a single word of respect or acknowledgement of all the work.</strong> Heck, not even written with proper punctuation. Worse yet, <em>not even having read the full piece ! </em></p><p>I know the counterarguments. Having weighed all of them, I still think is essentially stupid and short-sighted behavior, and will result in a worse world.</p><p>Drive-By Low-Effort Criticism does damage. Think about it.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>There&#x27;s reason to think they would be. When people get into a shared public transit vehicle, usually, they&#x27;re not all going to the same place. The vehicle has to take an indirect route, it has to start and stop many times along the way to let people on and off. A person will often have to transfer between multiple lines along the way and that will often involve a bit of waiting. There are usually many routes that have very low utilisation rates- carriages will be mostly empty most of the time, in part due to the fact that you can&#x27;t deploy half of a bus for low-use routes, in part due to the rigidity of the route scheduling.</p><p>Small self-driving vehicles, instead, can take a person straight where they need to go. The vehicle can then pick up someone else nearby and take them straight where they need to go, and so on, all day. They&#x27;ll also benefit from economy of scale of production, if more units are produced, the cheaper they individually become, smaller units, then, can be cheaper.</p><p>That&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XMLsSZLXgTfNcsJYJ/the-end-of-public-transportation-the-future-of-public\">the vision I have in my head</a>, anyway.</p><p>The main potential issue that I can see is commuting patterns. If a lot of people are going in the same direction at the same time, batching their trips together with larger densely packed shared vehicles might make sense.</p><p>But I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a legitimate way for cities to be. With affordable inner-city housing, mixed-use planning, this commuting pattern wouldn&#x27;t pop up - people would be taking short trips in all different directions even during peak commuting times.</p><p>(Although I cannot personally understand why) A lot of people seem to like living in suburbs, and conventionally planned cities have land pricing issues that make living in them prohibitively expensive for most ordinary people who work in them (I will discuss a potential solution to this in a later post). These ideal mixed use cities that I am mentally situated in, might not exist, and might not come to exist before autonomous vehicles start to compete with existing public transit.</p><p>So I&#x27;d like to know what relationship suburb size has to the commuting pattern problem - how large can the suburbs get before fixed-route busses become more efficient? (and also, <em>are</em> they really better, even with large suburbs? Is there that much route agreement in any city?)</p><p>Visions of self-driving cars currently look like variants of the cars we have, improved for not needing to have a driver&#x27;s seat and forward visibility, often you&#x27;ll see 8-seaters that&#x27;re expected to be shared to some extent. I think that might be unrealistic, if it is, we need to see more analysis of single-occupant cars <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/motors/toyota-s-three-wheeler-aims-to-bring-city-bike-rental-schemes-to-next-level-1.1931271\">like the toyota i-road</a>. Aside from using fewer materials and using less energy during acceleration (they&#x27;re lighter)[1], they&#x27;d also have the advantage of being able to to drive two to a lane, reducing congestion.</p><p>If we can answer these questions well, I think we will be much better informed about the future of urban transit than we are now.</p><p>[1]: although, regenerative braking is a thing. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s really an upper limit on how efficient that can be made, so maybe weight isn&#x27;t so much of an issue.</p>",

I guess that's because I imagine it doesn't fit most people's image of what a researcher's work consists of.</p>\n<p>Once I noticed this, the tension is easy to resolve - in this post I'm going to proclaim/endorse forum participation (aka commenting) as a productive research strategy that I've managed to stumble upon, and recommend it to others (at least to try). Note that this is different from saying that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a3aGosA987cZ4aRAB/online-discussion-is-better-than-pre-publication-peer-review\">forum/blog posts are a good way for a research community to communicate</a>. It's about individually doing better as researchers.</p>\n<h1>Benefits of Forum Participation (FP)</h1>\n<h2>FP takes little effort / will power</h2>\n<p>In other words it <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mHNsymmPTRsiJDo9Q/why-do-some-kinds-of-work-not-feel-like-work\">feels more like play than work</a>, which means I rarely have issues with not wanting to do something that I think is important to do (i.e., akrasia), the only exception being that writing posts seems to take more effort so occasionally I spend my time writing comments when I perhaps should write posts instead. (This is the part of this post that I think may be least likely to generalize to other people. It could be that I'm an extreme outlier in finding FP so low-effort. However it might also be the case that it becomes low effort for most people to write comments once they've had enough practice in it.)</p>\n<h2>FP is a good way to notice missing background knowledge and provides incentives to learn missing knowledge</h2>\n<p>If you read a post with an intention to question or comment on it, it's pretty easy to notice that it assumes some background knowledge that you lack. The desire to not ask a \"stupid\" question or make a \"stupid\" comment provides powerful incentive to learn the miss knowledge.</p>\n<h2>FP is a good way to stay up to date on everyone else's latest research</h2>\n<p>It's often a good idea to stay up to date on other people's research, but sometimes one isn't highly motivated to do so. FP seems to make that easier. For example, I wasn't following Stuart's research on counterfactual oracles, until the recent contest drew my attention and desire to participate, and I ended up reading the latest posts on CO in order to understand the current state of the art on that topic, which turned out to be pretty interesting.</p>\n<h2>Arguments that are generated in reaction to some specific post or discussion can be of general value</h2>\n<p>It's not infrequent that I come up with an argument in response to some post or discussion thread, and later expand or follow up that argument into a post because it seems to apply more generally than to just that post/discussion. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4K52SS7fm9mp5rMdX/three-ways-that-sufficiently-optimized-agents-appear\">Here</a> is one such example.</p>\n<h2>FP generates new ideas via cross-fertilization</h2>\n<p>FP incentivizes one to think deeply about many threads of research, and often (at least for me) an idea pops into my head that seems to combine various partial ideas floating in the ether into a coherent or semi-coherent whole (e.g., UDT), or is the result of applying or analogizing someone else's latest idea to a different topic (e.g., \"human safety problem\", \"philosophy as high complexity class\").</p>\n<h2>FP helps prepare for efficiently communicating new ideas</h2>\n<p>FP is a good way to build models of other people's epistemic states, and also a good way to practice communicating with fellow researchers, both of which are good preparation for efficiently communicating one's own new ideas.</p>\n<h1>My Recommendations</h1>\n<h2>Comment more</h2>\n<p>To obtain the above benefits, one just has to write more comments. It may be necessary to first overcome <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xYav5gMSuQvhQHNHG/disincentives-for-participating-on-lw-af\">disincentives to participate</a>. If you can't, please speak up and maybe the forum admins will do something to help address whatever obstacle you're having trouble with.</p>\n<h2>Practice makes better</h2>\n<p>If it seems hard to write good comments, practice might make it easier eventually.</p>\n<h2>Think of FP as something to do for yourself</h2>\n<p>Some people might think of commenting as primarily providing a service to other researchers or to the research community. I suggest also thinking of it as providing a benefit to yourself (for the above reasons).</p>\n<h2>Encourage and support researchers who adopt FP as their primary research strategy</h2>\n<p>I'm not aware of any organizations that explicitly encourage and support researchers to spend most or much of their time commenting on forum posts. But perhaps they should, if it actually is (or has the potential to be) a productive research strategy? For example this could be done by providing financial support and/or status rewards for effective forum participation.</p>\n</body></html>",

This sequence is therefore a culmination of what I have learned or reviewed very recently, put into a learning format.</p><p>My thoughts on various topics are <em>not</em> polished. I predict there will be mistakes, omissions, and general misunderstandings. I also believe that there are better places to learn the concepts which I walk through. I am not trying to compete with anyone for the best explanations. The audience I have in mind is a version of myself from a few weeks or days ago, and therefore some things which I take for granted may not be common knowledge to many readers. That said, I think this sequence may be useful for anyone who wants a deeper look at the topics which I present. </p><p>If you find something wrong, leave a comment. Just try to be respectful. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>If you&#x27;ve been following machine learning or natural language processing recently, you will likely already know that the Transformer is currently all the rage. Systems which are based on the Transformer have struck new records in natural language processing benchmarks. The <a href=\"https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard\">GLUE benchmark</a> is currently filled by models which, as far as I can tell, are all based on the Transformer.</p><p>With the Transformer, we now have neural networks which can <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/\">write </a>coherent stories about unicorns in South America, and an essay about why recycling is bad for the world. </p><p>The paper describing the Transformer, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">Attention Is All You Need</a>, is now the <a href=\"http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/top?timefilter=alltime&vfilter=all\">top paper</a> on Arxiv Sanity Preserver, surpassing the popularity of GANs and residual nets. And according to Google scholar, the paper <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=2960712678066186980&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en\">has attracted</a> 2588 citations (and counting). </p><p>So what makes the Transformer so powerful, and why is it such a break from previous approaches? Is it all just hype? Clearly not. But it is worth looking into the history behind the architecture first, in order to see where these ideas first came from. In this post, I give a rough sketch for what the transformer architecture looks like. In the following post, I will provide a detailed description of each step in the forward pass of the architecture. First, however, we have to know what we are looking at.</p><p>The central heart of the Transformer is the attention mechanism, hence the name of the original paper. As I understand, attention is a mechanism first designed in order to improve the way that recurrent neural networks understood text. I found <a href=\"https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/\">this post</a> helpful for providing an intuitive breakdown of how the attention mechanism works in pre-Transformer architectures. </p><p>The way I view attention in my head, and the way that many people illustrate it, is to imagine a table linking every word in a sentence to every other word in another sentence. If the two sentences are the same, then this is called self-attention. Attention allows us to see which parts of the sentence are relevant to the other parts. If there&#x27;s a strong link between &quot;it&quot; and &quot;car&quot; then it&#x27;s possible that this link is a way for the model to say that <strong>it</strong> <em>is</em> the <strong>car</strong>. </p><p>Consider the sentence &quot;I am a human.&quot; Attention might look at this sentence and construct the following links:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OPt4oLY.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:61%\" /></figure></span><p>The brighter the cell in the table, the more connected the two words are. Here, the exact meaning of the shades of grey aren&#x27;t really important. All you need to notice is that there&#x27;s some sort of relationship between words, and this relationship isn&#x27;t identical between every word. It&#x27;s not a symmetric relationship either. The exact way that attention is calculated will come later, which should shed light on why attention works the way it does.</p><p>If we were using a Transformer on the previous sentence, it might figure out that &quot;I&quot; was referring to &quot;human.&quot; And in a sense, that&#x27;s exactly what we want it to do. &quot;I&quot; and &quot;human&quot; are quite related, since they both point in the same direction. We will later see how we can use these linkages in a clever way to incorporate them into the Transformer architecture. </p><p>As a brief digression, I will note that the idea of coming up with a vague abstraction for how we want to interpret our neural networks is a concept that comes up repeatedly in deep learning. In the case of convolutional neural networks, for instance, we frequently describe neural networks as having some sort of structured model for the images we are classifying. This is why authors will sometimes talk about the model recognizing smaller pieces of the picture, like wheels, and then combining these smaller features into a coherent whole, such as a car.</p><p>The way that I think about attention is similar. The hope is that the neural network will be able to capture those parts of the text that are related to each other in some way. Perhaps the words that are strongly linked together are synonyms, or stand for each other in some way, such as because one of them is a pronoun of another word. No part of the links are hard-coded, of course. Finding out which words are related is where most of the learning happens.</p><p>Unlike previous approaches that use attention, the Transformer is unique because of how it uses attention for virtually everything. Before, attention was something that was used in conjunction with another neural network, allowing some form of computation by the neural network on a a pre-processed structured representation. The Transformer takes this concept further by repeatedly applying attention to an input, and relying very little on traditional feed forward neural networks to turn that input into something useful. Transformers still <em>use</em> regular neural networks, their importance is just diminished. And no RNNs or CNNs need be involved. </p><p>Other than attention, the other main thing to understand about the Transformer is its general structure, the encoder-decoder architecture. This architecture is not unique to the Transformer, and from what I understand, has been the dominant method of performing sequence to sequence modeling a few years before the Transformer was ever published. Still, it is necessary to see how the encoder-decoder architecture works in order to get any idea how the Transformer does its magic.</p><p>Below, I have illustrated the basic idea.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/T2mOpIz.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:57%\" /></figure></span><p>Simple enough, but how does it work? That middle arrow is conveying something useful. This isn&#x27;t just a deep architecture with a strange standard representation. </p><p>By thinking first about traditional neural networks, the justification for having this representation will become clear.  In an RNN, we have the same neural network performing a computation several times on each part of a sequence, returning an output for each step. It is this sequential nature of the computation which limits the output of an RNN. If we want an RNN to translate a sentence in English with 5 words in it, to a sentence in French with 7 words in it, there seems to be no natural way to do it. This is because, intuitively, as we go along the input sequence, we can only translate each element in the input to one element in the output.</p><p>By contrast, the encoder-decoder mechanism gets around this by constructing two different networks which work together in a special way. The first network, the encoder, takes in an input and places that input into a very high dimensional space, the <em>context</em>. After the input has been translated into this high dimensional space, it is then put into a much lower dimension using the decoder. By having an initial ramp up to a high dimension, and then back down, we are free to translate between sequences of different lengths.</p><p>The exact way that it works is like this: in the decoder network, we first take in the context and an initial hidden state as inputs. We then repeatedly apply an RNN to these inputs, creating an output and passing along the hidden state information to the next step. We repeat this until the network has produced an end token, which indicates that it has reached the end of the translated text. </p><p>In the Transformer, we drop the RNN part, but keep the benefit of being able to map arbitrarily long sequences to other arbitrarily long sequences. Under the hood, the Transformer is really more of a stack of encoders and decoders, which are themselves composed of self-attention components and a feedforward neural network. The size of this stack is the main design choice involved in creating a Transformer, and contributes to the simplicity of tuning it. </p><p>Since there are so many small details in the Transformer, it&#x27;s important to get a rough visual of how data is flowing through the network before you start to think about the exact computations that are being performed. We can look at the whole model like this.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5U9j18I.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:63%\" /></figure></span><p>The little stacked boxes I have put in encoder and decoder represent the layers in the network. The input is first fed up through the encoder, and then at the top step, we somehow provide some information to each layer of the decoder. Then, we start going through the decoder, at each step using the information we just got from the encoder. </p><p>Unlike an RNN, we do not share weights in each of these layers. The little boxes represent individual parts of the architecture that we are training separately. If we look under the hood at these little blocks, we find that encoder and decoder blocks are pretty similar.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/epvLOiH.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:70%\" /></figure></span><p>These things are stacked inside the encoder and decoder, and feed upwards. </p><p>On the left, we have an encoder layer. This layer has two sublayers. The first layer is the aforementioned self-attention. Although I have not given the details yet as to how attention works, we can visualize this block as calculating the values of the table I have above, followed by some computation which uses the numbers in the table to weight each of the words in the sequence. This weighting then <em>bakes</em> in some information into each word, before it is used by the feed forward network. If this currently doesn&#x27;t make sense, it should hopefully become more apparent once we get into the actual vector and matrix operations.</p><p>On the right, we have a decoder layer. The decoder layer is almost identical to the encoder layer except that it adds one middle step. The middle step is the encoder-decoder attention. This sublayer is the one that&#x27;s going to use the information carried over from the last step of the encoder layer.</p><p>Both the encoder and decoder layers feed into a neural network before shipping the values onto the next step. </p><p>If you&#x27;re anything like me, looking at this very conceptual picture has probably left you eager to dive into a more concrete analysis in order to truly understand what&#x27;s going on. For that, we&#x27;ll need to go into each step, and look at the architecture like an algorithm, rather than a picture. Part 2 of this post will do just that. </p><p>Just keep in mind that as long as we have a rough idea of what&#x27;s going on, it will make all the little matrix computations and notation a little less painful. In my opinion, learning benefits immensely from an abstract first pass through the material followed by a more detailed second pass. So with that, join me tomorrow as I unravel the deeper mysteries of the Transformer. </p>",

The transcript was transcribed using <u><a href=\"https://www.rev.com/\">a professional service</a></u>. </p><p>We decided to record, transcribe, edit and post it as:</p><ul><li>Despite an increase in <u><a href=\"https://sf.eaglobal.org/2019/agenda\">interest</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CJJDwgyqT4gXktq6g/long-term-future-fund-april-2019-grant-recommendations\">funding</a></u> for forecasting work in recent years, there seems to be a disconnect between the mental models of the people working on it and the people who aren’t. I want to move the community’s frontier of insight closer to that of the forecasting subcommunity</li><li>I think this is true for many more topics than forecasting. It’s incredibly difficult to be exposed to the frontier of insight unless you happen to be in the right conversations, for no better reason than that people are busy, preparing transcripts takes time and effort, and there are no standards and unclear expected rewards for doing so. This is an inefficiency in the economic sense. So it seems good to experiment with ways of alleviating it </li><li>This was a high-effort activity where two people dedicated several hours to collaborative, truth-seeking dialogue. Such conversations usually look quite different from comment sections (even good ones!) or most ordinary conversations. Yet there are very few records of actual, mind-changing conversations online, despite their importance in the rationality community. </li><li>Posting things publicly online increases the surface area of ideas to the people who might use them, and can have very positive, hard-to-predict effects.</li></ul><br><h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p>Facilitator:  One way to start would be to get a bit of both of your senses of the importance of forecasting, maybe Ozzie starting first. Why are you excited about it and what caused you to get involved?</p><p>Ozzie:  Actually, would it be possible that you start first? Because there are just so many ...</p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah. My sense is that predicting the future is great. Forecasting is one way to do this. The question for “will this connect to things being better” is the difficult part. In particular, Ozzie had this picture before of, on the one hand, data science-y repeated things that happen a lot, and then on the other hand judgement-style forecasting, a one off thing where people are relying on whatever models because they can't do the “predict the weather”-style things.</p><p>Vaniver:  My sense is that most of the things that we care about are going to be closer to the right hand side and also most of the things that we can do now to try and build out forecasting infrastructures aren't addressing the core limitations in getting to these places.</p><h4><strong>Is infrastructure really what forecasting needs? (And clarifying the term “forecasting”)</strong></h4><p>Vaniver:  My main example here is something like prediction markets are pretty easy to run but they aren't being adopted in many of the places that we'd like to have them for reasons that are not ... “we didn't get a software engineer to build them.” That feels like my core reason to be pessimistic about forecasting as intellectual infrastructure.</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah. I wanted to ask you about this. Forecasting is such a big type of thing. One thing we have about maybe five to ten people doing timelines, direct forecasting, at OpenAI, OpenPhil and AI Impacts. My impression is that you're not talking about that kind of forecasting. You're talking about infrastructural forecasting where we have a formal platform and people making formalised things. </p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah. When I think about infrastructure, I'm thinking about building tooling for people to do work in a shared space as opposed to individual people doing individual work. If we think about dentistry or something, like what dentists' infrastructure would look like is very different from people actually modifying mouths. It feels to me like that OpenAI and similar people are doing more of the direct style work than infrastructure.</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah okay. Another question I have is something like a lot of trend extrapolations stuff, e.g. for particular organizations, “how much money do you think they will have in the future?” Or for LessWrong, “how many posts are going to be there in the future?” and things like that. There's a lot of that happening. Would you call that formal forecasting? Or would you say that's not really tied to existing infrastructure and they don't really need infrastructure support? </p><p>Vaniver:  That's interesting. I noticed earlier I hadn't been including Guesstimate or similar things in this category because that felt to me more like model building tools or something. What do I think now ...</p><p>Vaniver:  I'm thinking about two different things. One of them is the “does my view change if I count model building tooling as part of this category, or does that seem like an unnatural categorization?” The other thing that I'm thinking about is if we have stuff like the LessWrong team trying to forecast how many posts there will be… If we built tools to make that more effective, does that make good things happen?</p><p>Vaniver:  I think on that second question the answer is mostly no because it's not clear that it gets them better counterfactual analysis or means they work on better projects or something. It feels closer to ... The thing that feels like it's missing there is something like how them being able to forecast how many posts there will be on LessWrong connects to whether LessWrong is any good.</p><h4><strong>Fragility of value and difficulty of capturing important uncertainties in forecasts</strong></h4><p>Vaniver:  There was this big discussion that happened recently about what metric is the team should be trying to optimize for the quarter. My impression is this operationalization step connected people pretty deeply to the fact that the things that we care about are actually just extremely hard to put numbers on. This difficulty will also be there for any forecasts we might make.</p><p>Ozzie:  Do you think that there could be value in people in the EA community figuring out how do put numbers on such things? For instance, like groups evaluate these things in the future in formal ways. Maybe not for LessWrong but for other kinds of projects.</p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah. Here I'm noticing <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile\">this old LessWrong post</a></u>…. Actually I don't know if this was one specific post, but this claim of the “fragility of value” where it's like “oh yeah, in fact the thing that you care about is this giant mess. If you drill it down to one consideration, you probably screwed it up somehow”. But it feels like even though I don't expect you to drill it down to one consideration, I do think having 12 is an improvement over having 50. That would be evidence of moral progress.</p><p>Ozzie:  That’s interesting. Even so, the agenda that I've been talking about it quite broad. It's very much a lot of interesting things. A combination of forecasting and better evaluations. For forecasting itself, there are a lot of different ways to do it. That does probably mean that there is more work for us to do back and forth with specific types and their likelihood, which make this a bit challenging. It'll give you a wide conversation.</p><p>Ben G:  Is it worth going over the double cruxing steps, the general format? I'm sorry. I'm not the facilitator.</p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah. What does our facilitator think?</p><p>Facilitator:  I think you're doing pretty good and exploring each other's stuff. Pretty cool... I'm also sharing a sense that forecasting has been replaced with a vague “technology” or something.</p><p>Ozzie:  I think in a more ideal world we'd have something like a list of every single application and for each one say what are the likelihoods that I think it's going to be interesting, what you think is going to be interesting, etc.</p><p>Ozzie:  We don't have a super great list like that right now.</p><p>Vaniver:  I'm tickled because this feels like a very forecasting way to approach the thing where it's like “we have all these questions, let's put numbers on all of them”.</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah of course. What I'd like to see, what I'm going for, is a way that you could formally ask forecasters these things.</p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah.</p><p>Ozzie:  That is a long shot. I'd say that's more on the experimental side. But if you could get that to work, that'd be amazing. More likely, that is something that is kind of infrequent.</p><h4><strong>Vaniver’s conceptual model of why forecasting works</strong></h4><p>Vaniver:  When I think about these sorts of things, I try to have some sort of conceptual model of what's doing the work. It seems to me the story behind forecasting is there's a lot of, I'm going to say, intelligence for hire out there and that the thing that we need to build is this marketplace that connects the intelligence for hire and the people who need cognitive work done. The easiest sorts of work for us to use for are these predictions about the future because it's easy to verify later and ....</p><p>Vaniver:  I mean the credit allocation problem is easy because of everyone who moved the prediction in a good direction gets money and everyone who moved it in the wrong direction loses money. Whereas if we're trying to develop a cancer drug and we do scientific prizes, it may be very difficult to do the credit allocation for “here's a billion dollars for this drug”. Now all the scientists who made some sort of progress along the way figure out who gets what of that money.</p><p>Vaniver:  I'm curious how that connects with your conception of the thing. Does that seem basically right or you're like there's this part that you're missing or you would characterize differently or something?</p><p>Ozzie:  Different aspects about it. One is I think that's one of the possible benefits. Hypothetically, it may be one of the main benefits. But even if it's not an actual benefit, even if it doesn't come out to be true, I think that there are other ways that this type of stuff would be quite useful.</p><h4><strong>Background on prediction markets and the Good Judgement Project</strong></h4><p>Ozzie:  Also to stand back a little bit, I'm not that excited about prediction markets in a formal way. My impression is that A) they're not very legal in the US, and B), it's very hard to incentivize people to forecast the right questions. Then C), there are issues around a lot of these forecasting systems you have people that want private information and stuff. There's a lot of nasty things with those kinds of systems. They could be used for some portion of this.</p><p>Ozzie:  The primary area that I'm more interested in forecasting applications similar to Metaculus and PredictionBook and one that I'm working on right now. More, they're working differently. Basically, people build up good reputations by having good track records. Then there's basically a variety of ways to pay people. The Good Judgement Project does it by basically paying people a stipend. There are around 125 super forecasters who work on specific questions for specific companies. I think you pay like $100,000 to get a group of them.</p><p>Ozzie:  Just a quick question, are you guys familiar with how they do things in specific? Not many people are.</p><p>Ozzie:  Maybe one of the most interesting examples of paid forecasters which was similar to this. For them, they basically have the GJP Open where they find the really good forecasters. Then those become the super forecasters. There's about 200 of these, 125, are the ones that they're charging other companies for.</p><p>Vaniver:  Can you paint me more of a picture of who is buying the forecasting service and what they're doing it for?</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah. For one thing, I'll say that this area is pretty new. This is still on the cutting edge and small. OpenPhil bought some of their questions ... I think they basically bought one batch. The questions I know about them asking were things like “what are the chances of nuclear between the US and Russia?” “What are the chances of nuclear war between different countries?” where one of the main ones was Pakistan and India. Also specific questions about outcomes of interventions that they were sponsoring. OpenPhil already internally does forecasting on most of its grant applications. When a grant is made internally they would have forecasts about how well it's going to do and they track that. That is a type of forecasting.</p><p>Ozzie:  The other groups that use them are often businesses. There are two buckets in how that's useful. One of them is to drive actual answers. A second one is to get the reasoning behind those answers. A lot of times what happens -- although it may be less useful for EAs -- is that these are companies maybe do not have optimal epistemologies, but instead have systematic biases. They basically purchase this team of people who do provably well at some of these types of questions. Those people would have discussions about their kinds of reasoning. Then they find their reasoning interesting.</p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah. Should I be imagining an oil company deciding whether to build a bunch of wells in Ghana and has decided that they just want to outsource the question of what's the political environment in Ghana going to be for the next 10 years?</p><p>Ozzie:  That may be a good interpretation. Or there'd be the specific question of what's the possibility that there'll be a violent outbreak.</p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah. This is distinct from Coca Cola trying to figure out which of their new ad campaigns would work best.</p><p>Ozzie:  This is typically different. They've been focused on political outcomes mostly. That comes in assuming that they were working with businesses. A lot of GJP stuff is covered by NDA so we can't actually talk about it. We don't have that much information.</p><p>Ozzie:  My impression is that some groups have found it useful and a lot of businesses don't know what to do with those numbers. They get a number like 87% and they don't have ways to directly make that interact with the rest of their system.</p><p>Ozzie:  That said, there are a lot of nice things about that hypothetically. Of course some of it does come down to the users. A lot of businesses do have pretty large biases. That is a known thing. It's hard to know if you have a bias or not. Having a team of people who has a track record of accuracy is quite nice if you want to get a third party check. Of course another thing for them is that it is just another way to outsource intellectual effort.</p><h4><strong>Positive cultural externalities of forecasting AI</strong></h4><p>Facilitator:  Vaniver, is this changing your mind on anything essentially important?</p><p>Vaniver:  The thing that I'm circling around now is a question closer to “in what contexts does this definitely work?” and then trying to build out from that to “in what ways would I expect it to work in the future?”. For example here, Ozzie didn't mention this, but a similar thing that you might do is have pundits just track their predictions or somehow encourage them to make predictions that then feed into some reputation score where it may matter in the future. The people who consistently get economic forecasts right actually get more mindshare or whatever. There's versions of this that rely on the users caring about it and then there are other versions that rely less on this.</p><p>Vaniver:  The AI related thing that might seem interesting is something like 2.5 years ago <u><a href=\"https://youtu.be/V0aXMTpZTfc?t=3231\">Eliezer asked this question at the Asilomar AI conference</a></u> which was “What's the least impressive thing that you're sure won't happen in two years?” Somebody came back with the response of “We're not going to hit 90% on the Winograd Schema.” [<em>Editor’s note: the speaker was Oren Etzioni] </em>This is relevant because a month ago somebody hit 90% on the Winograd Schema. This turned out to have been 2.5 years after the thing. This person did successfully predict the thing that would happen right after the deadline.</p><p>Vaniver:  I think many people in the AI space would like there to be this sort of sense of “people are actually trying to forecast near progress”. Or sorry. Maybe I should say medium term progress. Predicting a few years of progress is actually hard. But it's categorically different from three months. You can imagine something where people who are building up the infrastructure to be good at this sort of forecasting does actually make the discourse healthier in various ways and gives us better predictions of the future.</p><h4><strong>Importance of software engineering vs. other kinds of infrastructure </strong></h4><p>Vaniver:  Also I'm having some question of how much of this is infrastructure and how much of this is other things. For example when we look at the Good Judgement Project I feel like the software engineering is a pretty small part of what they did as compared to the selection effects. It may still be the sort of thing where we're talking about infrastructure, though we're not talking about software engineering.</p><p>Vaniver:  The fact that they ran this tournament at all is the infrastructure, not the code underneath the tournaments. Similarly, even if we think about a Good Judgment Project for research forecasting in general, this might be the sort of cool thing that we could do. I'm curious how that landed for you.</p><p>Ozzie:  There's a lot of stuff in there. One thing is that on the question of “can we just ask pundits or experts”, I think my prior is that that would be a difficult thing, specifically in that in “<u><a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11152.html\">Expert Political Judgment</a></u>” Tetlock tried to get a lot of pundits to make falsifiable predictions and none of them wanted to ...</p><p>Vaniver:  Oh yeah. It's bad for them.</p><p>Facilitator:  Sorry. Can you tell me what you thought were the main points of what Vaniver was just saying then?</p><p>Ozzie:  Totally. Some of them ...</p><p>Facilitator:  Yeah. I had a sense you might go \"I have a point about everything he might have said so I'll say all of them\" as opposed the key ones.</p><p>Ozzie:  I also have to figure out what he said in that last bit as opposed to the previous bit. It's one of them. There's a question. Most recent when it comes to the Good Judgment Project, how much of it was technology versus other things that we did?</p><p>Ozzie:  I have an impression that you're focused on the AI space. You do talk about the AI space a lot. It's funny because I think we're both talking a bit on points that help the other side, which is kind of nice. You mentioned one piece where prediction was useful in the AI space. My impression is that you're skeptical about whether we could get a lot more wins like that, especially if we tried to do it with a more systematic effort.</p><p>Vaniver:  I think I actually might be excited about that instead of skeptical. We run into similar problems as we did with getting pundits to predict things. However, the things that're going on with professors and graduates and research scientists is very different from the thing that's going on with pundits and newspaper editors and newspaper readers.</p><p>Vaniver:  Also it ties into the ongoing question of “is science real?” that the psychology replication stuff is connected to. Many people in computer science research in particular are worried about bits of how machine learning research is too close to engineering or too finicky in various ways. So I could a imagine a \"Hey, will this paper replicate?\"-market catching on in computer science. I imagine getting from that to a “What State-of-the-Arts will fall when?”-thing. That also seems quite plausible that we could make that happen.</p><p>Ozzie:  I have a few points now that connect to that. On pundits and experts, I think we probably agree that pundits often can be bad. Also experts often are pretty bad at forecasting it seems. That's something that's repeatable.</p><p>Ozzie:  For instance in the<u><a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/2016-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/\"> AI expert surveys</a></u>, a lot of the distributions don't really make sense with each other. But the people who do seem to be pretty good are the specific class of forecasters, specifically ones that we have evidence for, that's really nice. We only have so many of them right now but it is possible that we can get more of them.</p><p>Ozzie:  It would be nice for more pundits to be more vocal about this stuff. I think Kelsey at Vox with their Future Perfect group is talking about making predictions. <u><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/15/18182069/2019-predictions-forecast-democratic-nominee-brexit\">They've done some.</a></u> I don't know how much we'll end up doing.</p><h4><strong>Privacy</strong></h4><p>Ozzie:  When it comes to the AI space, there are questions about “what would interesting projects look like right now?” I've actually been dancing around AI in part because I could imagine a bad world or possibly a bad world where we really help make it obvious what research directions are exciting and then we help speed up AI progress by five years and that could be quite bad. Though, managing to do that in an interesting way could be important. </p><p>Ozzie:  There are other questions about privacy. There's the question of “is this interesting?”, and the question of \"conditional on it being kind of interesting. Should we be private about it?\" We're right now playing for that first question.</p><h4><strong>Orgs using internal prediction tools, and the action-guidingness of quantitative forecasts</strong></h4><p>Ozzie:  Some other things I'd like to bring into this discussion is that a lot of it right now is already being systemized. They say when you are an entrepreneur or something and try to build a tool it's nice to find that there are already internal tools. A lot of these groups are making internal systematic predictions at this point. They're just not doing it using very formal methods.</p><p>Ozzie:  Some example, OpenPhil formally specifies a few predictions for grants. Open AI also has a setup for internal forecasting. These are people at Open AI who are ML experts basically. That's a decent sized thing. </p><p>Ozzie:  There are several other organizations that are using internal forecasting for calibration. It's just a fun game that forces them to get a sense of what calibration is like. Then for that there are questions of “How useful is calibration?”, “Does it give you better calibration over time?”</p><p>Ozzie:  Right now none of them seem to be using PredictionBook. We could also talk a bit about ... I think that thing is nice and shows a bit of promise. It may be that there are some decent wins to be done by making better tools for those people which right now aren’t using any specific tools because they looked at them and found them to be inadequate. It's also possible that even if they did use those tools it'd be a small win and not a huge win. That's one area where there could be some nice value. But it's not super exciting so I don't know if you want to push back against that and say \"there'll be <em>no </em>value in that.\"</p><p>Vaniver:  There I'm sort of confused. What are the advantages to making software as a startup where you make companies' internal prediction tools better? This feels similar to Atlassian of something where it's like \"yeah, we made their internal bug reporting or other things better\". It's like yeah, sure, I can see how this is valuable. I can see how I’d make them pay for it. But I don't see how this is ...</p><p>Vaniver:  ...a leap towards the utopian goals if we take something like Futarchy or ... in your initial talk you painted some pictures of this is how in the future if you had much more intelligence or much more sophisticated systems you could do lots of cool things. [<em>Editor’s note: see Ozzie’s sequence “<u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/YX6dCo6NSNQJDEwXR\">Prediction-Driven Collaborative Reasoning Systems</a></u>” for background on this</em>] The software as a service vision doesn't seem like it gets us all that much closer and also feels like it's not pushing at the hardest bit which is something like “getting companies to adopt it”-thing. Or maybe what I think there is something like that the organizations themselves have to be structured very differently. It feels like there's some social tech.</p><p>Ozzie:  When you say very differently, do you mean <em>very</em> differently? Right now they're already doing some predictions. Do you mean very differently for like predictions would be a very important aspect of the company? Because right now it is kind of small.</p><p>Vaniver:  My impression is something like going back to your point earlier about looking back at answers like 87% and they won't really know what to do with it. Similarly, I was in a conversation with Oli earlier about whether or not organizations had beliefs or world models. There's some extent to which the organization has a world model that doesn't live in a person's head. It's going to be something like its beliefs are these forecasts on all these different questions and also the actions that the organization takes is just driven by those forecasts without having a human in the loop, where it feels to me right now often the thing that will happen is some executive will be unsure about a decision. Maybe they'll go out to the forecasters. The forecasters will come back with 87%. Now the executive is still making the decision using their own mind. Whether or not that “87%” lands as “the actual real number 0.87” or something else is unclear, or not sensibly checked, or something. Does that make sense?</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah. Everything's there. Let's say that ... 87% example is something that A) comes up if you're a bit naïve about what you want and B), comes up depending on how systematic your organization is with using number for things. If you happen to have a model what the 87% is, that could be quite valuable. With see different organizations are on different parts of the spectrum. Probably the one that's most intense about this is GiveWell. GiveWell has their multiple gigantic sheets of lots of forecasts essentially. It's possible that it'll be hard to make tooling that'll be super useful to them. I've been talking with them. There's experiments to be tried there. They're definitely in the case that as specific things change they may change decisions and they'll definitely change recommendations.</p><p>Ozzie:  Basically they have this huge model where people estimate a bunch of parameters about moral decision making and a lot of other parameters about how well the different interventions are going to do. Out of all of that comes recommendations for what the highest expected values are.</p><p>Ozzie:  That said, they are also in the domain that's probably the most certain of all the EA groups in some ways. They're able to do that more. I think the Open AI is probably a little bit... I haven't seen their internal models but my guess is that they do care a lot about the specifics of the numbers and also are more reasonable about what to do with them.</p><p>Ozzie:  I think the 87% example is a case of most CEOs don't seem to know what a probability distribution is but I think the EA groups are quite a bit better.</p><p>Vaniver:  When I think about civilization as a whole, there’s a disconnect between groups that think numbers are real and groups that don't think numbers are real. There's some amount of \"ah, if we want our society to be based on numbers are real, somehow we need the numbers-are-real-orgs to eat everyone else. Or successfully infect everyone else.”</p><h4><strong>Vaniver’s steelman of Ozzie</strong></h4><p>Vaniver:  What's up?</p><p>Facilitator:  Vaniver, given what you can see from all the things you discussed and touched on in the forecasting space, I wonder if you had some sense of the thing Ozzie is working on. If you imagine yourself actually being Ozzie and doing the things that he's doing, I'm curious what are the main things that feel like you don't actually buy about what he's doing.</p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah. One of the things ... maybe this is fair. Maybe this isn't. I've rounded it up to something like personality difference where I'm imagining someone who is excited about thinking about this sort of tool and so ends up with “here's this wide range of possibilities and it was fun to think about all of them, but of the wide range, here's the few that I think are actually good”.</p><p>Vaniver:  When I imagine dropping myself into your shoes, there's much more of the ... for me, the “actually good” is the bit that's interesting (though I want to consider much of the possibility space for due diligence). I don't know if that's actually true. Maybe you're like, \"No. I hated this thing but I came into it because it felt like the value is here.\"</p><p>Ozzie:  I'm not certain. You're saying I wasn't focused on ... this was a creative ... it was enjoyable to do and then I was trying to rationalize it?</p><p>Vaniver:  Not necessarily rationalize but I think closer to the exploration step was fun and creative. Then the exploitation step of now we're actually going to build a project for these two things was guided by the question of which of these will be useful or not useful.</p><h4><strong>How to explore the forecasting space</strong></h4><p>Vaniver:  When I imagine trying to do that thing, my exploration step looks very different. But this seems connected to this because there's still some amount of everyone having different exploration steps that are driven by their interests. Then also you should expect many people to not have many well-developed possibilities outside of their interests.</p><p>Vaniver:  This may end up being good to the extent that people do specialize in various ways. If we just randomly reassigned jobs to everyone, productivity would go way down. But this thing where the interests matter. You should actually only explore things that you find interesting makes sense. There's a different thing where I don't think I see the details of Ozzie's strategic map for something in the sense of “Here's the long term north star type things that are guiding us.” The one bit that I've seen that was medium term was the “yep, we could do the AI part testing stuff but it is actually unclear whether this is speeding up capabilities more than it's useful”. How many years is a “fire alarm for general intelligence” worth? [<em>Editor’s note: Vaniver is referring to <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BEtzRE2M5m9YEAQpX/there-s-no-fire-alarm-for-artificial-general-intelligence\">this post</a></u> by Eliezer Yudkowsky]</em> Maybe the answer to that is “0” because we won't do anything useful with the fire alarm even if we had it.</p><p>Facilitator:  To make sure I followed, the first step was: you have a sense of Ozzie exploring a lot of the space initially and now it's exploiting some of the things you think may be more useful. But you wouldn't have explored it that way yourself potentially because you wouldn't really have felt differently that there would have been something especially useful to find if you continued exploring?</p><p>Facilitator:  Secondly, you're also not yet sufficiently sold on the actual medium term things to think that the exploiting strategies are worth taking?</p><p>Vaniver:  “Not yet sold” feels too strong. I think it's more that I don't see it. Not being sold implies something like ... I would normally say I'm not sold on x when I can see it but I don't see the justification for it yet where here I don't actually have a crisp picture of what seven year success looks like.</p><p>Facilitator:  Ozzie which one of those feels more like \"Argh, I just want to tell Vaniver what I'm thinking now\"?</p><p>Ozzie:  So on exploration and exploitation. One the one hand, not that much time or resource is going into this yet. Maybe a few full-time months like to think about it and then several for making webapps. Maybe that was too much. I think it wasn't.</p><p>Ozzie:  The amount of variety of types of proposals that are on the table right now compared to when I started I'm pretty happy with for like a few months of thinking. Especially since for me to get involved in AI would have taken quite a bit more time of education and stuff. It did seem like a few cheap wins at this point. I still kind of feel like that.</p><h4><strong>Importance and neglectedness of forecasting work</strong></h4><p>Ozzie:  I also do get the sense that this area is still pretty neglected. </p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah. I guess in my mind neglecting is both people aren't working on it and people should be working on it. Is that true for you also?</p><p>Ozzie:  There are three aspects. Importance, tractable, and neglected. It could be neglected but not important. I'm just saying here that it's neglected.</p><p>Vaniver:  Okay. You are just saying that people aren't working on it.</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah. You can talk about then the questions of importance and tractability.</p><p>Facilitator:  I feel like there are a lot of things that one can do. One can Like try to start a group house in Cambridge, one can try and teach rationality at the FHI. Forecasting ... something about \"neglected\" doesn't feel like it quite gets at the thing because the space is sufficiently vast.</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah. The next part would be importance. I obviously think that it's higher in importance than a lot of the other things that seem similarly neglected. Let's say basically the ratio of importance in importance, neglected and tractable was pretty good for forecasting. I'm happy to spend a while getting into that.</p><h4><strong>Tractability of forecasting work</strong></h4><p>Vaniver:  I guess I actually don't care all that much about the importance because I buy if we could ... in my earlier framing, we move everyone to a \"numbers-are-real\" organization. That would be excellent. The thing that I feel most doomy about is something like the tractability where it feels like most of the wins that people were trying to get before turned out to be extremely difficult and not really worth it. I'm interested in seeing the avenues that you think are promising in this regard.</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah. It's an interesting question. I think a lot of people have the notion that we've had tons and tons of attempts at forecasting systems since Robin Hanson started talking about Prediction markets. All of those have failed therefore Prediction markets have failed and it's not worth spending another person and it's like a heap of dead bodies.</p><p>Ozzie:  The viewpoint that I have where it definitely doesn't look that way, for one thing, the tooling. If you actually look at a lot of the tooling that's been done, a lot of it is still pretty basic. One piece of evidence for that is the fact that almost no EA organizations are using it themselves.</p><p>Ozzie:  That could also be that it's really hard to make good tooling. If you look at it, basically if you look at non-prediction market systems, in terms of prediction markets there were also a few attempts. But the area is kind of illegal. Like I said, there are issues with prediction markets.</p><p>Ozzie:  If you look at non prediction market tournament applications. Basically you have a few. The GJP doesn't make their own. They've used Cultivate Labs. Now they're starting to try and make their own systems as well. But the GJP people are mostly political scientists and stuff, not developers.</p><p>Ozzie:  A lot of experiments they've done are political. It's not like engineering questions about how there'd be an awesome engineering infrastructure. My take on that is if you put some really smart engineer/entrepreneur in that type of area, I'd expect them to generally have a very different approach.</p><p>Vaniver:  There's a saying from Nintendo: \"if your game is not fun with programmer art, it won't be fun in the final product\" or something. Similarly, I can buy that there's some minimum level of tooling that we need for these sorts of forecasts that would be sensible it all. But it feels to me that if I expected forecasting to be easy in the relevant ways, the shitty early versions would have succeeded without us having to build later good versions.</p><p>Ozzie:  There's a question of what \"enough\" is. They definitely have succeeded to some extent. PredictionBook has been used by Gwern and a lot of other people. Some also use their own setups and Metaculus and stuff... So. you can actually see a decent amount of activity. I don't see many other areas that have nearly that level of experimentation. There are very few other areas that are being used to the extent that predictions are used that we could imagine as future EA web apps.</p><p>Vaniver:  The claim that I'm hearing there is something like “I should be comparing PredictionBook and Metaculus and similar things to reciprocity.io or something, as this is just a web app made in their spare time and if it actually sees use that's relevant”.</p><p>Ozzie:  I think that there's a lot of truth to that, though maybe not exactly be the case. Maybe we're past a bit of reciprocity.</p><p>Vaniver:  Beeminder also feels like it's in this camp to me to me although less like EA specific.</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah. Or like Anki.</p><p>Ozzie:  Right.</p><h4><strong>Technical tooling for Effective Altruism</strong></h4><p>Ozzie:  There's one question which is A), do we think that there's room for technical tooling around Effective Altruism? B) if there is, what are the areas that seems exciting? I don't see many other exciting areas. Of course, that is another question. If you think ... that's not exactly depending forecasting... but more like, if you don't like forecasting, what <em>do</em> you like? Because there's a conclusion that we just don't like EA tools and there's almost nothing in the space. Because there's not much more that seems obviously more exciting. But there's a very different side to the argument.</p><p>Vaniver:  Yeah. It's interesting because on the one hand I do buy the frame of it might make sense to just try to make EA tools and then to figure out what the most promising EA tool is. Then also I can see the thing going in the reverse direction which is something like if none of the opportunities for EA tools are good then people shouldn't try it. Also if we do in fact come up with 12 great opportunities for EA tools this should be a wave of EA grants or whatever.</p><p>Vaniver:  I would be excited about something double crux-shaped. But I worry this runs into the problem that argument mapping and mind mapping have all run into before. There's something that's nice about doing a double crux which makes it grounded out in the trace that one particular conversation takes as opposed to actually trying to represent minds. I feel like most of the other EA tools would be ... in my head it starts as silly one-offs. I'm thinking of things like for the 2016 election there was a vote-swapping thing to try to get third party voters in swing states to vote for whatever party in exchange for third party votes in safe states. I think <u><a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2953\">Scott Aaronsson promoted it</a></u> but I don't think he made it. But. It feels to me like that sort of thing. We may end up seeing lots of things like that where it's like “if we had software engineers ready to go, we would make these projects happen”. Currently I expect it's sufficient that people do that just for the glory of having done it. But the Beeminder style things are more like, “oh yeah, actually this is the sort of thing where if it's providing value then we should have people working for it and the people will be paid by the value they're providing”. Though that move is a bit weird because that doesn't quite capture how LessWrong is being paid for...</p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah. Multiple questions on that. This could be a long winding conversation. One would be “should things like this be funded by the users or by other groups?”</p><p>Ozzie:  One thing I'd say that ... I joined 80000 Hours about four years ago. I worked with them to help them with their application and decided at that point that it should be much less of an application and more of like a blog. I helped them scale it down.</p><p>Ozzie:  I was looking for other opportunities to make big EA apps. At that point there was not much money. I kind of took a detour and I'm coming back to it in some ways. In a way I've experienced this with Guesstimate, which has been used a bit. Apps from Effective Altruism has advantages and disadvantages. One disadvantage is that writing software is an expensive thing. An advantage is that it's very tractable. By tractable I mean you could say “if I spent $200,000 and three engineer years I could expect to get this thing out”. Right now we are in a situation where we do have hypothetically a decent amount of money if it could beat a specific bar. The programmers don't even have to be these intense EAs (although it is definitely helpful).</p><p><strong>5-MIN BREAK</strong></p><h4><strong>Tractability of forecasting within vs outside EA</strong></h4><p>Ozzie:  I feel like we both kind of agree, that, hypothetically, if a forecasting system was used and people decided it was quite useful, and we could get to the point that EA orgs were making decisions in big ways with it, that could be a nice thing to have. But there’s disagreement about whether that’s an existing possibility, and whether existing evidence shows us that won’t happen.</p><p>Vaniver:  I’m now also more excited about the prospects of this for the EA space. Where I imagine a software engineer coming out of college saying “My startup idea is prediction markets”, and my response is “let’s do some market research!” But in the EA space the market research is quite different, because people are more interested in using the thing, and there’s more money for crazy long-shots… or not crazy long-shots, but rather, “if we can make this handful of people slightly more effective, there are many dollars on the line”.</p><p>Ozzie:     Yeah. </p><p>Vaniver:  It’s similar to a case where you have this obscure tool for Wall Street traders, and even if you only sell to one firm you may just pay for yourself. </p><p>Ozzie:  I’m skeptical whenever I hear an entrepreneur saying “I’m doing a prediction market thing”. It’s usually crypto related. Interestingly most prediction platforms don’t predict their own success, and that kind of tells you something…</p><p>(Audience laughter)</p><p>Vaniver:  Well this is just like the prediction market on “will the universe still exist”. It turns out it’s just asymmetric who gets paid out.</p><h4><strong>Medium-term goals and lean startup methodology</strong></h4><p>Facilitator:  Vaniver, your earlier impression was you didn’t have a sense what medium term progress would look like? </p><p>Vaniver:  It’s important to flag that I changed my mind. When I think about forecasting as a service for the EA space, I’m now more optimistic, compared to when I think of it as a service on the general market. It’s not surprising OpenPhil bought a bunch of Good Judgement forecasters. Whereas it would be a surprise if Exxon bought GJP questions. </p><p>Vaniver:  Ozzie do you have detailed visions of what success looks like in several years?</p><p>Ozzie:  I have multiple options. The way I see is that… when lots of YC startups come out they have a sense that “this is an area that seems kind of exciting”. We kind of have evidence that it may be interesting, and also that it may not be interesting. We don’t know what success looks like for an organisation in this space, though hopefully we’re competent and we could work quickly to figure it out. And it seems things are exciting enough for it to be worth that effort.</p><p>Ozzie:  So AirBnB and the vast majority of companies didn’t have a super clear idea of how they were going to be useful when they started. But they do have good inputs, and a vague sense of what kind of cool outputs would be. </p><p>Ozzie:  There’s evidence that statistically this seems to be what works in startup land. </p><p>Ozzie:  Some of the evidence against. There was a question of “if you have a few small things that are working but are not super exciting, does that make it pretty unlikely you’ll see something in this space?”</p><p>Ozzie:  It would be hard to make a strong argument that YC wouldn’t find any companies in such cases. They do fund things without <em>any</em> evidence of success.  </p><p>Vaniver:  But also if you’re looking for moonshots, mild success the first few times is evidence against “the first time it just works and everything goes great”. </p><h4><strong>Limitations of current forecasting tooling</strong></h4><p>Ozzie:  Of course in that case you’re question is of exactly what is <em>this</em> that’s been tried. I think there are arguments that there are more exciting things on the horizon which haven’t been tried. </p><p>Ozzie:  Now we have PredictionBook, Metaculus, and hypothetically Cultivate Labs and another similar site. Cultivate Labs does enterprise gigs, and are used by big companies like Exxon for ideation and similar things. They’re a YC company and have around 6 people. But they haven’t done amazingly well. They’re pretty expensive to use. At this point you’d have to spend around $400 for one instance per month. And even then you get a specific enterprise-y app that’s kind of messy.  </p><p>Ozzie:  Then if you actually look at the amount of work done on PredictionBook and Metaculus, it’s not that much. PredictionBook might have had 1-2 years of engineering effort, around 7 years ago. People think it’s cool, but not a serious site really. As for Metaculus, I have a lot of respect for their team. That project was probably around 3-5 engineering years.</p><p>Ozzie:  They have a specific set of assumptions I kind of disagree with. For example, everyone has to post their questions in one main thread, and separate communities only exist by having subdomains. They’re mostly excited about setting up those subdomains for big projects.</p><p>Ozzie:  So if a few of us wanted to experiment with “oh, let’s make a small community, have some privacy, and start messing around with questions” it’s hard to do that...  </p><p>Vaniver:  So what would this be for? Who wants their own instances? MMO guilds?</p><p>Audience:  Here’s one example of the simplest thing you currently cannot do. (Or <em>could</em> not do around January 1st 2019.) Four guys are hanging out, and they wonder “When will people next climb mount everest?” They then just want to note down their distributions for this and get some feedback, without having to specify everything in a Google doc or a spreadsheet which doesn’t have distributions. </p><p>Facilitator:  Which bit breaks? </p><p>Audience:  You cannot small private channels for multiple people which take 5 minutes to set up where everyone records custom distributions. </p><p>Vaniver:  So I see what you can’t do. What I want is the group that <em>wants</em> to do it. For example, one of my housemates loves these sites, but also is the sort of nerd that loves these kinds of sites in general. So should I just imagine there’s some MIT fraternity where everyone is really into forecasting so they want a private domain? </p><p>Ozzie:  I’d say there's a lot of uncertainty. A bunch of groups may be interested, and if a few are pretty good and happen to be excited, that would be nice. We don’t know who those are yet, but we have ideas. There are EA groups now. A lot of them are kind of already doing this; and we could enable them to do it without having to pay $400-$1000 per month; or in a way that could make stuff public knowledge between groups… For other smaller EA groups that just wanted to experiment the current tooling would create some awkwardness. </p><p>Ozzie:  If we want to run experiments on interesting things to forecast, e.g “how valuable is this thing?” or stuff around evaluation or LessWrong posts. We’d have to set up a new instance for each. Or maybe we could have one instance and use it for all experiments, but that would force a single privacy setting for all those experiments. </p><p>Ozzie:  Besides that, at this point, I raised some money and spent like $11,000 to get someone to program. So a lot of this tooling work is already done and these things are starting to be experimented with.  </p><h4><strong>Knowledge graphs and moving beyond questions-as-strings </strong></h4><p>Ozzie:  In the medium-term there’s a lot of other interesting things. With the systems right now, a lot of them assume all questions are strings. So if you’re going to have a 1000 questions, it’s impossible to understand and for other people to get value from. So if you wanted to organise something like, “every EA org, how much money and personnel would they have each year for the coming 10 years” it would be impossible with current methods.  </p><p>Vaniver:  Instead we’d want like a string prefix combined with a list of string postfixes? </p><p>Ozzie:  There are many ways to do it. I’m experimenting with using a formal knowledge graph where you have formal entities. </p><p>Vaniver:  So there would be a pointer to the MIRI object instead of a string? </p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah, and that would include information about how to find information about it from Wikipedia, etc. So if someone wanted to set up an automated system to do some of this they could. Combining this with bot support would enable experiments with data scientists and ML people to basically augment human forecasts with AI bots.  </p><p>Vaniver:  So, bot support here is like participants in the market (I’ll just always call a “forecast-aggregator” a market)? Somehow we have an API where they can just ingest question and respond with distributions? </p><p>Ozzie:  Even without bots, just organising structured questions in this way makes it easier for both participants and observers to get value. </p><h4><strong>Summary of cruxes</strong> </h4><p>Facilitator:  Yeah, I don’t know… You chatted for a while, I’m curious what feels like some of the things you’ll likely think a bit more about, or things that seem especially surprising? </p><p>Ozzie:  I got the sense that we agreed on more things than I was kind of expecting to. It seems lots of it now may be fleshing out what the mid-term would be, and seeing if there’s parts of it you agree are surprisingly useful, or if it does seem like all of them are long-shots? </p><p>Vaniver:  When I try to summarise your cruxes, what would change your mind about forecasting, it feels like 1) if you thought there was a different app/EA tool to build, you would bet on that instead of this. </p><p>Ozzie:  I’d agree with that.</p><p>Vaniver:  And 2) if the track-record of attempts were more like… I don’t know what word to use, but maybe like “sophisticated” or “effortful”? If there were more people who were more competent than you and failed, then you’d decide to give up on it. </p><p>Ozzie:  I agree.</p><p>Vaniver:  I didn’t get the sense that there were conceptual things about forecasting that you expected to be surprised by. In my mind, getting data scientists to give useful forecasts, even if the questions are in some complicated knowledge graph or something, seems moderately implausible. Maybe I could transfer that intuition, but maybe the response is “they’ll just attempt to do base-rate forecasting, and it’s just an NLP problem to identify the right baserates”  </p><p>Vaniver:  Does it feel like it’s missing some of your cruxes?</p><p>Facilitator:  Ozzie, can you repeat the ones he did say? </p><p>Audience:   Good question.</p><p>Ozzie:  I’m bad at this part. Now I’m a bit panicked because I feel like I’m getting cornered or something. </p><p>Vaniver:  My sense was… 1) if there are better EA tools to build, you’d build them instead. 2) if better tries had failed, it would feel less tractable. And 3) Absence of conceptual uncertainties that we could resolve now. It feels it’s not like “Previous systems are bad because they got the questions wrong” or “Question/answer is not the right format”. It’s closer to “Previous systems are bad because their question data structure doesn’t give us the full flexibility that we want”. </p><p>Vaniver:  Maybe that’s a bad characterization of the automation and knowledge graph stuff. </p><p>Ozzie:  I’d definitely agree with the first two, although the first one is a bit more expansive than tools. If there was e.g. a programming tool I’d be better for and had higher EV, I’d do that instead. Number two, on tries, I agree if there were one or two other top programming teams who tried a few of these ideas and were very creative about it, and failed, and especially if they had software we could use now! (I’d feel much better about not having to make software) Then for three, The absence of conceptual uncertainties. I don’t know exactly how to pin this down. </p><p>Facilitator:   I don’t know if we should follow this track. </p><p>Vaniver:  I’m excited about hearing what Ozzie’s conceptual uncertainties are.  </p><p>Facilitator:   Yeah, I agree actually.</p><h4><strong>Ozzie’s conceptual uncertainties</strong></h4><p>Ozzie:  I think the way I’m looking at this problem is one where there are many different types of approaches that could be useful. There are many kinds of people who could be doing the predicting. There are many kinds of privacy. Maybe there would be more EAs using it, or maybe we want non-EAs of specific types. And within EA vs non-EA, there are many different kinds of things we might want to forecast. There are many creative ways of organising question such that forecasting leads to an improved amount of accuracy. And I have a lot of uncertainty about this entire space, and what areas will be useful and what won’t.  </p><p>Ozzie:  I think I find it unlikely that absolutely nothing will be useful. But I do find it very possible that it’ll just be too expensive to find out useful things.  </p><p>Vaniver:  If it turned out nothing was useful, would it be the same reason for different applications, or would it be “we just got tails on every different application?” </p><p>Ozzie:  If it came out people just hate using the tooling, then no matter what application you use it for it will kind of suck. </p><p>Ozzie:  For me a lot of this is a question of economics. Basically, it requires some cost to both build the system and then get people to do forecasts; and then to make the question and do the resolution. In some areas the cost will be higher than value, and in some the value will be higher than the cost. It kind of comes down to a question of efficiency. Though, it’s hard to know, because there’s always the question of maybe if I would have implemented this feature things would have been different?</p><p>Vaniver:  That made me think of something specific. When we look at the success stories, they are things like weather and sports, whereas for sports you had to do some amount of difficult operationalisation, but you sort of only had to do it once. The step I expect to be hard across most application domains is the “I have a question, and now I need to turn it into a thing-that-can-be-quantitatively-forecasted” and then I became kind of curious if we could get relatively simple NLP systems that could figure out the probability that a question is well-operationalised or not. And have some sort of automatic suggestions of like “ah, consider these cases” or whatever, or “write the question this way rather than that way”. </p><p>Ozzie:  From my angle, you could kind of call those “unique question”, where the marginal cost per question is pretty high. I think that if we were in any ecosystem where things were tremendously useful, the majority of questions would not be like this.  </p><p>Vaniver:  Right so if I ask about the odds I will still be together with my partner a while from now, I’d be cloning the standard “will this relationship last?” question and substituting new pointers?  </p><p>Ozzie:  Yeah. And a lot of questions would be like “GDP for every country for every year” so there could be a large set of question templates in the ecosystem. So you don’t need any fancy NLP; you could get pretty far with trend analysis and stuff. </p><p>Ozzie:  On the question of whether data scientists would be likely to use it, that comes down to funding and incentive structures. </p><p>Ozzie:  If you go on upwork and pay $10k to a data scientist they could give you a decent extrapolation system, and you could then just build that into a bot and hypothetically just keep pumping out these forecasts as new data come in. Pipelines like that already exist. What this would be doing is to provide infrastructure to help support them basically.  </p><p>END OF TRANSCRIPT</p><p>At this point the conversation opened up to questions from the audience. </p><p>While this conversation was inspired by the double-crux technique, there is a large variation in how such sessions might look. Even when both participants retain the spirit of seeking the truth and changing their minds in that direction, some disagreements dissipate after less than an hour, others take 10+ hours to resolve and some remain unsolved for years. It seems good to have more public examples of genuine truth-seeking dialogue, but at the same time should be noted that such conversations might look very different from this one.</p>",

This allows you to figure out at a very granular level why you&#x27;re not reaching your goals, and then intervene to change those reasons. </p><p>For example:</p><blockquote>At one point I found myself procrastinating on ordering the catering for an event. Noticing the disconnect between my high-level goals (&quot;make a good event&quot;) and my concrete actions (&quot;spend time on FB&quot;), triggered me to try to notice what was up in my mind (this is a particular trigger-response pattern I&#x27;ve trained myself to use). I found that I didn&#x27;t want to make the call since last time I called them, they couldn&#x27;t hear what I was saying and were kind of rude about it. I didn&#x27;t want my phone to be bad or my accent to be inaudible, an so I didn&#x27;t want to call them again. I then proceeded to borrow a friend&#x27;s phone, and called them without problem. </blockquote><p>Another example, this time with a concrete cognitive rather than practical intervention: </p><blockquote>I noticed myself being unhappier than I wanted to be. So when the unhappiness clashed with the higher-level desire for happiness, it triggered a noticing process, and I realised my mind was running an algorithm like: &quot;notice happy thought --&gt; remember Hamming problem or that timelines might be short --&gt; feel bad&quot;. This sounds ridicolously unhelpful when written out, but is in fact what was going on. So I started training myself to hold on to the happiness in the first part of the chain without automatically falling into the second. </blockquote><br/><p>Here&#x27;s a worry with this: if part of my congition is consciously accessible and interpretable, and part of it is not, will extensive noticing-and-intervening cause motivated cognition to become less noticable? </p><p>It will by selection effects, since the more noticeable parts I&#x27;ll change. But this feels more definitionally true than actually worrying. </p><p>It also might by negative reinforcement, if my mind learns that when subagents make their desires known they&#x27;ll tend to be overruled/modified. (To prevent this, and as a safer policy in my current epistemic state, I make sure to sometimes deliberately not intervene on things I&#x27;ve noticed.) But this shouldn&#x27;t be the case if I genuinely listen to subagents and take their preferences into account; as well as if the subagent theory doesn&#x27;t fit (which seems more plausible in the second example above).</p><br/><p>Is there some other reason to believe that improved ability to notice your cognition will cause rationalisation, motivated cognition, thought patterns highly valued by certain subagents, etc. to become <em>less </em>noticeable?</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>The following will be elementary to many of you, and for that I must explain that this idea popped into my head fully formed and I need to improve my writing habit, so here goes. Hopefully this will be insightful for someone!</p><p>Political opinions can be framed as a set of three components: Cause, Means, and Ends (consequences).</p><p>Example: Poor people can’t afford rent in this town on minimum wage, so you should vote for a Democrat to enact higher minimum wage laws.</p><p>Let’s unpack this as follows: </p><p>Cause: Poor people can’t afford rent in this town on minimum wage</p><p>Means: vote for a Democrat to enact higher minimum wage laws</p><p>Ends: Unstated! But we can infer that the claim is that higher minimum wage laws create a world in which poor people can afford rent in this town.</p><p>I used this example specifically because it’s a common argument, and the ends are unclear. I have noticed that the majority of political movements and ideologies have very vague Ends. This is in part due to how difficult it is to predict the future and the outcomes of different government policies. But part of it is to prevent disagreements from occurring regarding the Ends.</p><p>So you may be in an argument with someone who agrees with you about the Cause, agrees about the Ends, but disagrees about the Means, and any other combination.</p><p>I’ve been in political movements where everyone allied with a Cause, but then it fell apart from infighting about Means, and we barely even touched Ends! It’s very rare that we meet people who match our beliefs on all three components.</p><p>Another element of this is that our minds create meaning by finding patterns and matching those patterns to categories which we then label. We use those labels often without realizing how fuzzy the borders of our categories are, and then sometimes we argue about labels instead of realizing that we’re arguing about where the boundaries of the categories are, or whether a Thing belongs in the category or not.</p><p>Here are some examples to illustrate what I mean. When I was part of Occupy Wall Street, we surveyed the attendees to determine what causes people agreed with. We found a huge array of different causes brought us together, but a few stood out as central issues. Then we attempted to discuss solutions and quickly realized how many different worldviews were held by our group members. Eventually, the fundamental disagreements were insurmountable, and the movement fizzled.</p><p>I advocate for being as clear as possible in your arguments both for good rhetorical reasons, but also for signaling reasons. If you’re trying to change the world, you want to attract like-minded people who agree with you on as many portions of the three components as possible. This isn’t usually possible, and getting work done is ultimately more important than agreeing on what work needs to be done. And I don’t think people usually talk about Ends in anything other than vagueries like “making the world a better place.” However, successful movements have centered around visionary leaders. So to attract the right people to your cause you should be expressing your vision of the future (Ends) and advocating the actions (Means) most likely to get us there while being open to disagreement about the prioritization of Causes. </p>",

That is, at some point in the future, when some number of teams will have the technical ability to build and deploy and AGI, but they all agree to voluntarily delay (perhaps on penalty of sanctions) until they’re confident that humanity knows how to align such a system.</p><p>Currently, this kind of coordination seems like a pretty implausible state of affairs. But I want to know if it seems like it becomes more or less plausible as time passes.</p><p>The following is my initial thinking in this area. I don’t know the relative importance of the factors that I listed, and there’s lots that I don’t understand about each of them. I would be glad for… </p><ul><li>Additional relevant factors.</li><li>Arguments that some factor is much more important than the others.</li><li>Corrections, clarifications, or counterarguments to any of this.</li><li>Other answers to the question, that ignore my thoughts entirely.</li></ul><h2>If coordination gets harder overtime, that’s probably because...</h2><ul><li><strong>Compute increases make developing and/or running an AGI cheaper</strong>. The most obvious consideration is that the cost of computing falls each year. If one of the bottlenecks for an AGI project is having large amounts of compute, then “having access to sufficient compute” is a gatekeeper criterion on who can build AGI. As the cost of computing continues to fall, more groups will be able to run AGI projects. The more people who can build an AGI, the harder it becomes to coordinate all of them into not deploying it. </li><ul><li>Note that It is unclear to what degree there is currently, or will be, a hardware overhang. If someone in 2019 could already run an AGI, on only $10,000 worth of AWS, if only they knew how, then the cost of compute is not relevant to the question of coordination.</li></ul><li><strong>The number of relevant actors increases</strong>. If someone builds an AGI in the next year, I am reasonably confident that that someone will be Deep Mind. I expect that in 15 years, if I knew that AGI would be developed one year from then, it will be much less overdetermined which group is going to build it, because there will be many more well funded AI teams with top talent, and, most likely, none of them will have as strong a lead as Deep Mind currently appears to have.</li><ul><li>This consideration suggests that coordination gets harder over time. However, this depends heavily on other factors (like how accepted AI safety memes are) that determine how easily Deep Mind could coordinate internally.</li></ul></ul><h2>If coordination gets easier over time, that’s probably because…</h2><ul><li><strong>AI safety memes become more and more pervasive and generally accepted. </strong>It seems that coordination is easier in worlds where it is uncontroversial and common knowledge that an unaligned AGI poses and existential risk, because everyone agrees that they will lose big if anyone builds an AGI.</li><ul><li>Over the past 15 years, the key arguments of AI safety have gone from being extremely fringe, to a reasonably regarded (if somewhat controversial) position, well inside the overton window. Will this process continue? Will it be commonly accepted by ML researches in 2030, that advanced AI poses and existential threat? Will it be commonly accepted by the leaders of nation-states?</li><li>What will the perception of safety be in a world where there is another AGI winter? Suppose that narrow ML proves to be extremely useful in a large number of fields, but there’s lots of hype about AGI being right around the corner, then that bubble bursts, and there is broad disinterest in AGI again. What happens to the perception of AI safety? Is there a sense of “It looks like AI Alignment wasn’t important after all”? How cautious will researchers be in developing new AI technologies.</li></ul><li>[Partial subpoint to the above consideration] <strong>Individual AI teams develop more serious info security conscious processes. </strong>If some team in Deep Mind discovered AGI today, and the Deep Mind leadership opted to wait to insure safety before deploying it, I don’t know how long it would be until some relevant employees left to build AGI on their own, or some other group (such as a state actor) stole their technology and deployed it. </li><ul><li>I don’t know if this is getting better or worse, overtime.</li></ul><li><strong>The technologies for maintaining surveillance of would-be AGI developers improve</strong>. Coordination is made easier by technologies that aid in enforcement. If surveillance technology improves that seems like it would make coordination easier. As a special case, highly reliable lie detection or mind reading technologies would be a game-changer for making coordination easier.</li><ul><li>Is there a reason to think that offense will beat defense in this area? Surveillance could get harder over time if the technology for detecting and defeating surveillance outpaces the technology for surveilling.</li></ul><li><strong>Security technology improves</strong>. Similarly, improvements in computer security (and traditional info security), would make it easier for actors to voluntarily delay deploying advanced AI technologies, because they could trust that their competitors (other companies and other nations), wouldn’t be able to steal their work. </li><ul><li>I don’t know if this is plausible at all. My impression is that the weak point of all security systems is the people involved. What sort of advancements would make the human part of a security system more reliable?</li></ul></ul>",

The research agenda calls for <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into\">aggregating</a> similar preferences before making them into full preferences, but we still need some way of doing this in the cases where we have a single partial preference. The rest of this section will show one way of doing this.</p>\n<h2>The sensible case</h2>\n<p>In the simplest case, we'd have a partial preference such as \"these ten worlds are good, in this order\", and we'd map them to a utility function with equal spaces between each world. And we wouldn't say these ten worlds were all better or all worse than the other worlds not mentioned.</p>\n<p>And we can do that, in the most likely and sensible case.

    "htmlBody": "<p>One trap that we must be wary of is adopting beliefs because they are popular among people who strive to think critically or scientifically, as opposed to being the result of critical or scientific thinking. One good example of this is RationalWiki which purports to report the political beliefs which all Rational(TM) people should hold. Similarly, I believe that most people who believe in materialism do so on the basis of extremely poor reasons and without knowledge of some of the stronger arguments for qualia existing. Maybe we should ultimately support materialism, but I get the impression that many people jump to this conclusion too quickly. Here are some points I believe people should consider first</p><p>(I know someone else in the rationality community wrote a post arguing for consciousness recently and I was meaning to read it, but I lost the link before I had a chance)</p><p><strong>Failure to bite the bullet argument</strong></p><p>If qualia don&#x27;t exist, why is anything that you experience good or bad? In this case, things like pleasure, pain and meaning are nothing more than ways that particles can combine. But if this is the case, why are these combinations special or more important than other combinations? Why should we try to make certain combinations happen and certain combinations not?</p><p>It&#x27;s fairly common to deny the existence of the objectively good or bad, but denying the existence of the subjectively good or bad is a much stronger claim. But everyone acts like this matters and so it appears somewhat hypocritical. And there is an argument that we should continue to act normally on the basis of meta-theoretic uncertainty, but no-one makes that argument.</p><p><strong>Pascal&#x27;s Wager Argument</strong></p><p>This last point is actually a pretty strong argument for believing in qualia. If they don&#x27;t exist, nothing matters, but if they do exist then we benefit from acting as though they do exist. Therefore, we should assume the later.</p><p><strong>Expected Evidence Argument</strong></p><p>Claiming the existence of qualia is often seen as anti-scientific, some people would even go as far to say that they don&#x27;t see much difference between claiming the existence of ghosts or qualia. One key difference is that if ghosts existed we would expect objective evidence of them, even if the experiments would be hard to run. For example, we would expect a greater rate of howling in houses where someone was murdered. Even if they could only interact with us psychically, we would expect a higher rate of mental illness in these houses, even if the person living there had no idea of the past. Since if ghosts existed we would expect the existence of objective evidence, the lack of any such evidence counts against them.</p><p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s not so clear that we should expect any objective evidence of subjective experience. Arguably, the only evidence we should expect of subjective experience is direct, subjective evidence. So the absence of objective evidence provides no Bayesian evidence against the existence of qualia.</p><p><strong>Initial Foundations Argument</strong></p><p>How should we come to understand the world? It seems like we might want to first pick a class of phenomena to be the foundation and that this should be whatever we are most certain of existing. We will then need to decide on the best way of knowing about that phenomenon and then choose a way of figuring out what other kinds of things might exist in the universe.</p><p>So what should our initial foundations be? One option is the external physical world, while the other is subjective experience. The later makes more sense to me as it describes why we believe in an external world. It isn&#x27;t that we just assume it a priori, but instead that we notice patterns in our subjective experience and then theorise that there might be some object that exists independently of our experience causing these regularities. On the other hand, subjective experience makes much more sense to assume a priori and hence more sense as an initial foundation. Indeed, we could even say that this approach is truer to the scientific method since we even subject our belief in the existence of the external world to an empirical test. In other words, objective experience needs to be justified in terms of subjective experience and not the other way round.</p><p><strong>Transcendence Argument</strong></p><p>Arguably the nature of an atom (or whatever elementary particle we choose) transcends its mere mathematical description. Firstly, the claim that &quot;THIS IS ALL THAT THERE IS TO IT&quot; seems like a strong claim and one which we can never know for certain. Surely, it is much more reasonable to maintain that there is at least the possibility of there being something in its nature beyond this. Indeed, if there were not, this would seem to imply that a perfect simulation of an atom is an atom and this seems absurd.</p><p>Following this reason, why can&#x27;t there be an element of consciousness that transcends its mere mathematical description? And if a simulation of an atom is not automatically an atom, then perhaps a simulation of consciousness isn&#x27;t automatically conscious?</p><p><strong>Relabeling Argument</strong></p><p>Let&#x27;s suppose I have a system with a variable x which takes values between 0 and 10. Suppose we define a second variable y which is also between 0 and 10 which satisfies x+y=10.</p><p>Is this a different system than the original? It seems this comes down to whether y is a new entity or just a relabelling of x. The one thing that I would expect to be uncontroversial here is that it is possible for this new system to just be a relabelling. Whether or not it is necessarily just a relabelling would be much more contentious.</p><p>If we were to say that sometimes introducing a variable that like that could be more than just a relabelling, then that would be to accept that objects can have a nature that is not fully encapsulated by their mathematical definition as I previously argued.</p><p>On the other hand, if circumstances like this are always just a relabelling, then there is no difference between the system with y in it and the system without y in it. This becomes important when y is a much more complicated property, such as the amount of &quot;pain&quot; an organism is experiencing. If the system is the same with the entity representing pain or without this entity, then it seems like it can&#x27;t have been important. This implies that someone insisting it was just a relabelling must then bite the bullet of qualia being unimportant.</p><p><strong>Relational Argument</strong></p><p>I&#x27;ll quote <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/201907/what-if-consciousness-comes-first?\">Consciousness Comes First</a>:</p><blockquote>The issue is that physical properties are by their nature relational, dispositional properties. That is, they describe the way that something is related to other things and/or has the disposition to affect or be affected by those other things.</blockquote><blockquote>... However, if all we ever have is relational/dispositional properties—that is, if everything is only defined in terms of other things—then, ultimately, we have defined nothing at all.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s as though someone created a very elaborate spreadsheet and carefully defined how the values in every cell would be related to the values in all of the other cells. However, if no one enters a definite value for at least one of these cells, then none of the cells will have values.</blockquote><blockquote>In the same way, if the universe is to actually exist, its properties can’t be exclusively relational/dispositional. Something in the universe has to have some kind of quality in and of itself to give all the other relational/dispositional properties any meaning. Something has to get the ball rolling.</blockquote><p>This argument is very similar to the transcendence argument and the relabelling argument in that it asserts things can be more than their mathematical descriptions, but still different enough that I felt it was worthwhile including separately. Interestingly the article argues the consciousness and conscious observations are what actually get the ball rolling, although I haven&#x27;t thought this through enough to have a strong position yet.</p><p><strong>Against the Illusion Argument</strong></p><p>Some people say consciousness or qualia are just illusions. At best, this seems like a really bad analogy. For example, if I think I see an oasis, but it is actually an illusion, then it is the oasis that is illusionary and not my experience of seeing. In other words, if an experience is an illusion, then we still have the experience of seeing that illusion. And any discussion of illusions where the illusion isn&#x27;t experienced seems to be a very misleading way of using that term.</p><p><strong>Arguments against consciousness</strong></p><p>I&#x27;ll finish by noting that there are some very strong arguments against consciousness too. For quite a while I felt that the epiphenomenal theory was the most plausible, but there are two devastating critiques. The first is the evolutionary argument, it seems absurd that positive qualia would line up with events that are evolutionary advantageous and negative qualia would line up with events that are evolutionary disadvantageous if qualia has no causal mechanism to impact evolution. And the <a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FW4kdfpvRafKys4nua%2Fdissolving-the-zombie-argument%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR18T2arjihDFnJxwURzWUzmn7hfjAcsmdxso2lpSk33314yGs3t0C9jeDw&h=AT323bERDFG6KckIGv8NBKxIOYx0IhFETO-nOLEmRmMJj5yYDskJZDEETmq4eKvliswJP6KQ_0CvxQ6lazDjPUBkJ-xVE85fhP68-KMkhSCzKuA2OhpyzuiECMgZ88WpyFvTa_ZOciB23ZUCelBWAA\">second</a> is that it sure looks like qualia has a causal impact, since we are discussing them right now. So to believe in the epiphenomenal theory is to believe qualia for a reason completely independent from us actually having qualia.</p><p>These are very strong arguments, but I nonetheless worry about closing the door on this debate too quickly as there are quite possibly theories that we haven&#x27;t considered yet, especially when there appear to be very strong arguments for qualia as well.</p>",

(Note: Adversarial Goodhart isn&#x27;t explored, because we want to keep the setting sufficiently simple.) This sets up the next post, which will discuss Mesa-Optimizers.</p><h2>Revisting Selection vs. Control Systems</h2><p>Basically everything in the earlier post that used the example process of rocket design and launching is susceptible to some form of overoptimization, in different ways. Interestingly, there seem to be clear places where different types of overoptimization is important. Before looking at this, I want to revisit the selection-control dichotomy from a new angle.</p><p>In a (pure) control system, we cannot sample datapoints without navigating to them. If the agent is an embedded agent, and has sufficient span of control to cause changes in the environment, we cannot necessarily reset and try over. In a selection system, we only sample points in ways that do not affect the larger system. Even when designing a rocket, our very expensive testing has approximately no longer term effects. (We&#x27;ll leave space debris from failures aside, but get back to it below.)</p><p>This explains why we potentially care about control systems more than selection systems. It also points to why Oracles are supposed to be safer than other AIs - they can&#x27;t directly impact anything, so their output is done in a pure selection framework. Of course, if they are sufficiently powerful, and are relied on, the changes made become irreversible, which is why Oracles are not a clear solution to AI safety.</p><h2>Goodhart in Selection vs. Control Systems</h2><p>Regressional and Extremal Goodhart are particularly pernicious for selection, and potentially less worrying for control. Regressional Goodhart is always present if we are insufficiently aware of our goals, but in general Causal Goodhart failures seems more critical in control, because it is often narrower. To keep this concrete, I&#x27;ll go through the classes of failure, and note how they could occur at each stage of rocket design. To do so, we need to clarify goals at each stage. Our goal in stage 1 is to find a class of designs and paths to optimize. In stage 2, we build, test, and refine a system. In many ways, this stage is intended to circumvent goodhart-failures, but testing does not always address extremal cases, so our design may still fail. </p><p><strong>Regressional Goodhar</strong>t hits us if we have any divergence between our metric and our actual goal. For example, in stages 1 and 2, finding an ideal complex or chaotic path that is dependent on exact positions of planets in a multibody system would be bad, or a path involving excessive G-forces or other dangerous things might be more fuel efficient than a simpler path. For example, a gravitational slingshot around the sun might be cheap, but fry or crush the astronauts. Alternatively, a design with a shape that does not allow people to fit inside might be found when optimizing. Each of these impact goals potentially not included in the model.  Regressional goodhart is  less common in control for this case, since we kept the mesa-optimizer limited to optimizing a very narrow goal already chosen by the design-optimization.</p><p><strong>Extremal Goodhart</strong> is always a model failure. It can be because the model is insufficiently accurate, (Model Insufficiency) or because there is a regime change. Regime changes seem particularly challenging in systems that design mesa-optimizers, since I think the mesa-optimization is narrower in some way than the global optimizer (if not, it&#x27;s more efficient to have an executing system rather than a mesa-optimizer.) </p><p><strong>Causal Goodhart</strong> is by default about an irreversible change. In selection systems, it means that our sampling accidentally broke the distribution. For example, we test many rockets, creating enough space debris to make further tests vulnerable to collisions. We wanted the tests to sample from the space, but we accidentally changed the regime while sampling.</p><p>In the current discussion, we care about metric-goal divergence because the cost of the divergence is high - typically, once we get there, some irreversible consequence happens, as explained above. This isn&#x27;t exclusively true of control systems, as the causal Goodhart example shows, but it&#x27;s clearly more common in such systems. Once we&#x27;re actually navigating and controlling the system, we don&#x27;t have any way to reset to base conditions, and causal changes create regime changes - and if these are unexpected, the control system is suddenly in a position of opitimizing using an irrelevant model.</p><p>And this is a critical fact, because as I&#x27;ll argue in the next post, mesa-optimizers are control systems of a specific type, and have some new overoptimization failure modes because of that.</p>",

So I want to start by revisiting <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q4hLMDrFd8fbteeZ8/measuring-optimization-power\">a post Eliezer wrote in 2008</a>, where he suggested that optimization power was ability to select states from a preference ordering over different states, and could be measured with entropy. He notes that this is not computable, but gives us insight. I agree, except that I think that the notion of the state space is difficult, for some of the reasons Scott discussed when he <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pcomQ4Fwi7FnfBZBR/how-does-gradient-descent-interact-with-goodhart\">mentioned that he was confused about the relationship between gradient descent and Goodhart&#x27;s law</a>.

I think this is not a very good proxy for what most forms of optimization look like.&quot; </blockquote><p>I want to start by noting that this is absolutely and completely a &quot;selection&quot; type of optimization, in Abram&#x27;s terms. As Scott noted, however, it&#x27;s not a good model for what most optimization looks like, and that&#x27;s part of why I think Eliezer&#x27;s model is less helpful than I did when I originally read it.</p><p>There&#x27;s a much better model for gradient descent optimization, which is... gradient descent. It is a bit closer to control than direct optimization, since in some sense we&#x27;re navigating through the space, but for almost all actual applications, it is still selection, not control. To review how it works, points are chosen iteratively, and the gradient is assessed at each point. The gradient is used to <em>select</em> a new point at some (perhaps very clever, dynamically chosen next point.) Some stopping criteria is checked, and it iterates at that new point. This is almost always tons more efficient than generating random points and examining them. </p><p><em>(Addded)</em> It&#x27;s far better than a grid search, usually, for most landscapes, but also makes it clear why I think it&#x27;s hard to discuss optimization power in Eliezer&#x27;s terms on a practical level, at least when dealing with a continuous system. The problem I&#x27;m alluding to is that any list of preferences over states depends on number of states. Gradient descent type optimization is really good at focusing on specific sections of the state space, especially compared to grid search. We might find a state where grid search would require a tremendously high resolution, but we don&#x27;t ever compute a preference ordering over <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"2^n\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.591em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> states. With gradient descent, we instead compute preferences for a local area and (hopefully) zoom-in, potentially ignoring other parts of the space. An optimizer that focuses very narrowly can have high-resolution but miss the non-adjacent region with far better outcomes, or can have fairly low resolution but perform far better - and the second optimizer is clearly more powerful, but I don&#x27;t know how to capture this.</p><p>But to return to the main discussion, the process of gradient descent is also somewhere between selection and control - and that&#x27;s what I want to explain.</p><p>In theory, the evaluation of each point in the test space could involve an actual check of the system. I build each rocket, watch to see whether it fails or succeeds according to my metric. For search, I&#x27;d just pick the best performers, and for more clever approaches, I can do something like find a gradient by judging performance of parameters to see if increasing or decreasing those that are amenable to improvement would help. (I can be even more inefficient, but find something more like a gradient, by building many similar rockets, each an epsilon away in several dimensions, and estimating a gradient that way. Shudder.)</p><p>In practice, we use a proxy model - and this is one place that allows for the types of overoptimization misalignment we are discussing. (But it&#x27;s not the only one.) The reason this occurs is laid out clearly in the Categorizing Goodhart paper as one of the two classes of extremal failure - either model insufficiency, or regime change. This also allows for (during simulation undetectable) causal failures, if the proxy model gets a causal effect wrong.Even without using a proxy model, we can be led astray by the results if we are not careful. Rockets might look great, even in practice, and only fail in untested scenarios because we optimized something too hard - extremal model insufficiency. (Lower weight is cheaper, and we didn&#x27;t notice a specific structural weakness induced by ruthlessly eliminating weight on the structure.) For our purposes, we want to talk about things like &quot;how much optimization pressure is being applied.&quot; This is difficult, and I think we&#x27;re trying to fit incompatible conceptual models together rather than finding a good synthesis, but I have a few ideas on what selection pressure leading to extremal regions means here.</p><ul><li>Extreme proxy values (in comparison to most of the space) seems similar to having lots of selection pressure. If we have a insanely tall and narrow peak, we may be finding something strange rather than simply improving.</li><li>Extreme input values (unboundedly large or small values) may indicate a worrying area vis-a-vis overoptimization failures.</li><li>Lots of search time alone does NOT indicate extremal results - it indicates lots of things about your domain, and perhaps the inefficiency of your search, but not overoptimization. (This is in contrast to the naive grid-search model, where lots of points visited means more optimizing.)</li></ul><p>As an aside, Causal Goodhart is different. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to rely on extremes, but rather on manipulating new variables, ones that could have an impact on our goal. This can happen because we change the value to a point where it changes the system, similar to extremal Goodhart, but does not need to. For instance, we might optimize filling a cup by getting the water level near the top. Extremal regime change failure might be overfilling the cup and having water spill everywhere. Causal failure might be moving the cup to a different point, say right next to a wall, in order to capture more water, but accidentally break the cup against the wall.Notice that this doesn&#x27;t require much optimization pressure - Causal Goodhart is about moving to a new region of the distribution of outcomes by (metaphorically or literally) breaking something in the causal structure, rather than by over-optimizing and pushing far from the points that have been explored.This completes the discussion so far - and note that none of this is about control systems. That&#x27;s because in a sense, most current examples don&#x27;t optimize much, they simply execute an adaptive program. </p><p>One critical case of a control system optimizing is a mesa-optimizer, but that will be deferred until after the next post, which introduces some examples and intuitions around how Goodhart-failures occur in selection versus control systems.</p>",

Habryka and I once took 12 hours over the course of 3 days to make any kind of progress on a particularly gnarly disagreement. And sometimes disagreements can persist for years despite significant mutual effort.</p><p>Now, doublecruxing is <i>faster</i> than many other forms of truth-aligned-disagreement resolution. I actually it's helpful to think of doublecrux as \"the fastest way for two disagreeing-but-honest-people to converge locally towards the truth\", and if someone came up with a faster method, I'd recommend deprecating doublecrux in favor it that. (Meanwhile, doublecrux is not guaranteed to be faster for 3+ people to converge but I still expect it to be faster for smallish groups with particularly confusing disagreements)</p><p>Regardless, multiple hours is a long time. Can we do better?</p><p>I think the answer is yes, and it basically comes in the form of:</p><ul><li>Practice finding your own cruxes</li><li>Practice helping other people find their cruxes</li><li>Develop metacognitive skills that make cruxfinding <i>natural and intuitive</i></li><li>Caching the results into a clearer belief-network</li></ul><p>Those are all things you can do unilaterally. If you get buy-in from your colleagues, you might also try something like \"develop culture that encourages people to do those four things, and help each other to do so.\"</p><p>I'd summarize all of that as \"develop the skill and practice of <i>keeping your beliefs cruxy.</i>\"</p><p>By default, humans form beliefs for all kinds of reasons, without regard for how falsifiable they are. The result is a tangled, impenetrable web. Productive disagreement takes a long time because people are starting from the position of \"impenetrable web.\"</p><p>If you make a habit of asking yourself \"what observations <i>would</i> change my mind about this?\", then you gain a few benefits.</p><p>First, your beliefs should (hopefully?) be more entangled with reality, period. You'll gain the skill of noticing how your beliefs should <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences\">constrain your anticipations</a>, and then if they fail to do so, you can maybe update your beliefs.</p><p>Second, if you've cultivated that skill, then during a doublecrux discussion, you'll have an easier time engaging with the core doublecrux loop. (So, a conversation that might have taken an hour takes 45 minutes –&nbsp;your conversation partner might still take a long time to figure out their cruxes, but maybe you can do your own much faster)</p><p>Third, once you gotten into this habit, this will help your beliefs form in a cleaner, more reality-entangled fashion <i>in the first place. </i>Instead of building an impenetrable morass, you'll be building a clear, legible network. (So, you might have all your cruxes full accessible from the beginning of the conversation, and then it's just a matter of stating them, and then helping your partner to do so)</p><p><strong>[Note:</strong> I don't think you should <i>optimize directly</i> for your beliefs being legible. This is a recipe for burying illegible parts of your psyche and missing important information. But rather, if you try to actually understand your beliefs and what causes them, the legibility will come naturally as a side benefit<strong>]</strong></p><p>Finally, if everyone around you is doing, this radically lowers the cost of productive-disagreement. Instead of taking an hour (or three days), as soon as you bump into an important disagreement you can quickly navigate through your respective belief networks, find the cruxes, and skip to the part where you actually Do Empiricism.</p><p>I think (and here we get into speculation), that this can result in a phase shift in how disagreement works, enabling much more powerful discourse systems than we currently have.</p><p>I think keeping beliefs cruxy is a good example of a practice that is <i>both</i> a valuable \"Rabbit Strategy\", as well as something worth Stag Hunting Together on. (In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zp5AEENssb8ZDnoZR/the-schelling-choice-is-rabbit-not-stag\">Rabbit/Stag</a> parlance, a Rabbit strategy is something you can <i>just do</i> without relying on anyone else to help you, that will provide benefit to you. A Stag strategy is something with a larger payoff, but only actually works if you've coordinated with people to do so)</p><p>If you have an organization, community, or circle of friends where many people have practiced keeping-beliefs-cruxy, I predict you will find individuals benefiting, as well as creating a truthseeking culture more powerful than the sum of its parts.</p><hr><p><i>Hopefully obvious addenda, operationalizing:</i></p><p>My crux for all this is that I think this is locally tractable.</p><p>My recommendation is not that you go out of your way to practice this all the time – rather, that you spend some time on-the-margin practicing the \"look-for-cruxes\" whenever you actually have a noteworthy disagreement.</p><p>If you practice crux-finding whenever you have such a disagreement, and find that it isn't locally useful, I probably wouldn't recommend continuing.</p><p>If 10 people tried this and 6 of them told me it didn't feel useful, even superficially, I'd probably change my mind significantly. If they tried it continuously for a year and there weren't at least 3 of them that could point to transparently useful outcomes, (such as disagreements taking much less time than they'd naively predict), I'd also significantly change my beliefs here.</p><p>This operationalization has some important caveats, such as \"I don't necessarily expect this to work for people who haven't read the sequences or some equivalent. I also think it might require some skills that I haven't written up explanations for yet –which I hope to do soon as I continue this sequence.\"</p>",

But there are many caveats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>must be zinc acetate or zinc gluconate (but gluconate is strictly worse)</li>\n<li>use immediately on getting a cold</li>\n<li>18mg zinc per lozenge</li>\n<li>dissolve in mouth 20-30 minutes</li>\n<li>take every 2 hours</li>\n<li>must have metallic taste, astringency</li>\n<li>must free of anything ending -ate (except stearate) or -ic acid; free of magnesium except magnesium stearate (it's insoluble)</li>\n<li>only one product on the market satisfies these requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The guy sounds to me like he knows what he's talking about. But I don't have the technical expertise to really know. (I think I could detect a mediocre bullshitter, but not necessarily a high level one.) If true, it seems like the sort of information that would be good for more people to know; but also like the sort of information that would be more widely known if it were true. (But I can sketch an argument for why it might not.) The research section at the linked page cites three journal articles of which two are open access, but I haven't looked closely at them.</p>\n<p>My own experience is that I got some of these lozenges about a year ago, after reading a transcript of the episode. I thought I'd gotten them too late, but my cold cleared up much faster than I would have expected otherwise. Since then I've been trying to collect more anecdotal data, but my body is stubbornly refusing to even start coming down with a cold. Twice I thought it might be, and I took lozenges and didn't; but I think I took one lozenge on one occasion and three (spaced out) on another, and he thinks they shouldn't be effective enough for that to have worked. I'm not sure what to make of this, except that it shouldn't be much given the sample size.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the transcript has now been removed, and I can't find it on <a href=\"http://archive.org\">archive.org</a>. I've made notes of the first ~35 minutes (of ~70). If someone could take a look (or listen), and say whether it all seems basically accurate, that would be fantastic. Almost all of it seems consistent with what I think I know, with one surprise that I've bolded. Apologies for the poor formatting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>zinc is important to the immune system in ways that are irrelevant to this. If you aren't getting enough, you'll probably benefit from getting more. Good sources are oysters, red meat and cheese.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RDA for zinc is satisfied by eating oysters once a week or beef once a day</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>it's more prevalant and also more bioavailable in animal foods than plant foods. So if you mainly eat a plant diet you may benefit from supplements or zinc-rich foods</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>phytate (grains, nuts, seeds are good sources) is \"storage house for minerals\"; allows plants to germinate &amp; grow when conditions are right. Phytates make zinc less bioavailable in both the meal and supplements</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>but again this is separate from using zinc to cure colds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>George Eby's 3yo daughter with leukemia had many colds, given 50mg zinc gluconate, refused to swallow, cold disappeared</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Eby and colleagues published RCT in 1984 showing zinc lozenges could reduce median cold duration 5 days mean duration 7 days; basically cures cold</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Almost every zinc lozenge on the market is useless for this purpose</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ionic zinc (+ve charge, free not bound to anything) affects nasal tissue and adinoid tissue (lymph tissue in throat) i.e. two major sites of infection during cold: inhibits activation of viral polypeptides that are used in replication of cold virus; inhibit production in our cells of ICAM 1 (intracellular adhesion molecule 1) which is dock that allows virus to grab hold of cell and enter it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zinc products are all salts, not ionic. So we need one that releases ionic zinc in the relevant tissues at the right time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zinc interferes with replication of virus. So you need to take it almost immediately after being infected or at the first sign of symptoms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cold incubation period ~1 day, no symptoms, contagious; 2-3 days where replication and symptoms are increasing; then it peaks and declines, after 5 days basically undetectable but your symptoms may continue. So if you start using them 2-3 days in, they probably won't do anything</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>tablet or capsule releases zinc into stomach so that's no good</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>nasal sprays can kill your sense of smell</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zinc released from a lozenge will reach your nasal tissues and throat tissues</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>some say you want a salt that releases ionic zinc at the pH of saliva. But actually it needs to release at pH of your nasal and throat tissues</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>saliva pH is 5; over 100 times more acidic than pH of cellular environment which is 7.4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>7.4 is basic, right? \"100 times more acidic than [something on the other side of neutral]\" seems like a weird thing to say?</strong> It sounds to me like \"-5°C is 100 times more freezing than +2°C\". Also, if I google \"pH of saliva\" I see <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/ph-of-saliva\">6.2 to 7.6</a>. (I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover I'm just wrong about the acidic/freezing analogy.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>lots of zinc salts release ionic at pH 5, only a handful at 7.4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of salts in lozenges, only acetate and gluconate release any meaningful amount</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>at 7.4, gluconate is 50% ionic and acetate is 100% ionic. so zinc acetate should be twice as effective</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>most lozenges are neither; only one is acetate</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zinc in your mouth has a metallic taste (astringent), dries it out. So people try to make zinc lozenges more palatable</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>but the astringency comes from the ionic zinc in your mouth. So if it's not astringent, it's not gonna help.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OTOH being astringent doesn't mean it will help, because that's in your saliva not your nose/throat tissues</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>food acids e.g. citrate or tartrate will very tightly bind zinc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>studies with citrate or tartrate in lozenge seem to suggest it actually makes the cold last longer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ionic magnesium delivered to nose/throat tissues will nullify zinc, increase replication of cold virus</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>one product tested found harmful was produced with very high heat in presence of fats, maybe palm oil; high heat produced insoluble zinc waxes with the fatty acids</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>lubricants used in supplements, like magnesium stearate or other stearates, are insoluble; so they don't yield an acid that could bind to the zinc and don't yield much ionic magnesium and don't cause problems</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Copper</h3>\n<p>(Section added 2020-03-09)</p>\n<p>I had originally hoped to get some solid confirmation or disconfirmation of the science, and then write up a clearer recommendation post (or not do that, in the case of disconfirmation). That didn't happen, which is fair enough, but it means I haven't written that post.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I've been linking people here for \"why I recommend these lozenges\", and yesterday SSC linked here too. When I wrote it I optimized for \"get something out there\", not \"include all the information\". That seemed fine when I originally wrote this and didn't necessarily expect anyone to actually act on it, but now it's getting more visibility and I'm actively recommending people to act on it.</p>\n<p>And in particular, there's a potentially important safety note included in the half of the podcast that I didn't make notes on. Probably not a big deal, but still. Potentially.</p>\n<p>So: <strong>if you take these, you may want to consider copper supplements.</strong> From memory: the podcast host thinks it's probably fine not to, but he does just in case. The ratio of zinc:copper in your bloodstream has a high acceptable range (<a href=\"https://cronometer.com/blog/nutrient-ratios-zinccopper/\">this</a> says 8:1 - 15:1, and I think the podcast said something similar), and probably most of the zinc in these lozenges isn't entering your bloodstream anyway.</p>\n<p>My honest guess is that you don't need to worry. I only got some recently, and I've only taken one so far. But I think I've been remiss not to mention this in writing until now.</p>\n<h3>Buying</h3>\n<p>By request, I think all of these links are to the correct product:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lifeextension.com/vitamins-supplements/item01961/enhanced-zinc-lozenges\">Life Extension US</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lifeextensioneurope.com/enhanced-zinc-lozenges-30-vegetarian-lozenges\">Life Extension Europe</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lifeextensioneurope.co.uk/enhanced-zinc-lozenges-30-vegetarian-lozenges\">Life Extension UK</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Extension-Enhanced-Lozenges-Vegetarian/dp/B00PYX2SVM/\">Ama­zon UK</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ENHANCED-ZINC-ACETATE-LOZENGES-30/dp/B00RJ0526Q/\">Amazon US</a> (The \"from the manufacturer\" section has a picture of a different product and says something about zinc methionate.

    "htmlBody": "<p>Another post in the same incremental vein. Still hoarding the wild speculation for later.</p><p><strong>I</strong> </p><p>The idea of the &quot;intentional stance&quot; comes from <a href=\"https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150AAA/DennettTrueBelievers.pdf\">Dan Dennett</a>, who wanted to explain why it makes sense that we should think humans have such things as &quot;beliefs&quot; or &quot;desires.&quot; The intentional stance is just a fancy name for how humans usually think in order to predict the normal human-scale world - we reason in terms of people, desires, right and wrong, etc. Even if you could be prodded into admitting that subatomic particles are &quot;what there really are,&quot; you don&apos;t try to predict people by thinking about subatomic particles, you think about their desires and abilities.</p><p>We want to design AIs that can copy this way of thinking. Thus, the problem of the artificial intentional stance. Value learning is the project of getting the AI to know what humans want, and the intentional stance is the framework that goes between raw sensory data and reasoning as if there are things called &quot;humans&quot; out there that &quot;want&quot; things.</p><p><strong>II</strong></p><p>Suppose you want to eat a strawberry, and you are trying to program an AI that can learn that you want to eat a strawberry. A naive approach would be to train the AI to model the world as best it can (I call this best-fit model the AI&apos;s &quot;native ontology&quot;), and then bolt on some rules telling it that you are a special object who should be modeled as an agent with desires.</p><p>The reason this doesn&apos;t work is because the intentional stance is sort of infectious. When I think about you wanting to eat a strawberry using my intentional stance, I don&apos;t think about &quot;you&quot; as a special case and then use my best understanding of physiology, biochemistry, and particle physics to model the strawberry. Instead, I think of the verb &quot;to eat&quot; in terms of human desires and abilities, and I think of the strawberry in terms of how humans might acquire or eat one.</p><p>This is related to the concept of &quot;affordances&quot; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance\">introduced by James J. Gibson</a>. Affordances are the building blocks for how we make plans in the environment. If I see a door, I intuitively think of opening or locking it - it &quot;affords opening.&quot; But maybe an experienced thief will intuitively think of how to bypass the door - they&apos;ll have a different intuitive model of reality, in which different affordances live.</p><p>When you say you want to eat a strawberry, you are using an approximate model of the world that not only helps you model &quot;you&quot; and &quot;want&quot; at a high level of abstraction, but also &quot;eat&quot; and &quot;strawberry.&quot; The AI&apos;s artificial intentional stance can&apos;t just be a special model of the human, it has to be a model of the whole world in terms of what it &quot;affords&quot; the human.</p><p><strong>III</strong></p><p>If we want to play a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\">CIRL</a>-like cooperative game with real human goals, we&apos;ll need the artificial intentional stance.</p><p>CIRL assumes that the process generating its examples is an agent (modeled in a way that is fixed when implementing that specific CIRL-er), and tries to play a cooperative game with that agent. But the true &quot;process that determines its inputs&quot; is the entire universe - and if the CIRL agent can only model a small chunk of the universe, there&apos;s no guarantee that that chunk will be precisely human-shaped.</p><p>If we want an AI to cooperate with humans even if it&apos;s smart enough to model a larger-than-human chunk of the universe, this is an intentional stance problem. We want it to model the inputs to some channel in terms of specifically human-sized approximate agents, living in the universe. And then use this same intentional-stance model to play a cooperative game with the humans, because its this very model in which &quot;humans&quot; are possible teammates.</p><p>This exposes one of the key difficulties in designing an artificial intentional stance: it needs to be connected to other parts of the AI. It&apos;s no good having a model of humans that has no impact on the AI&apos;s planning or motivation. You have to be able to access the abstraction &quot;what the humans want&quot; and use it elsewhere, either directly (if you know the format and where it&apos;s stored in memory), or indirectly (via questions, examples, etc.).</p><p><strong>IV</strong></p><p>The other basic difficulty is: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/upP8PYgHfXgvgh3FF/training-human-models-is-an-unsolved-problem\">how are you supposed to train or learn an artificial intentional stance</a>?</p><p>If we think of it as a specialized model of the world, we might try to train it it for predictive power, and tune the parameters so that it gets the right answers as often as possible. But that can&apos;t be right, because the artificial intentional stance is supposed to be different than the AI&apos;s best-predicting native ontology.</p><p>I&apos;m even skeptical that you can improve the intentional stance by training it for efficiency, or predictive power under constraints. <em>Humans</em> might use the intentional stance because it&apos;s efficient, but it&apos;s not a unique solution - the psychological models that people use have changed over history, so there&apos;s that much wiggle room at the very, very least. We want the AI to copy what humans are doing, not strike out on its own and end up with an inhuman model of humans.</p><p>This means that the artificial intentional stance, however it&apos;s trained, is going to need information from humans, about humans. But of course humans are complicated, our stories about humans are complicated, and so the AI&apos;s stories about humans will be complicated. An intentional stance model has to walk a fine line so that it captures important detail, but not so much detail that the humans no longer are being understood in terms of beliefs, desires, etc.</p><p><strong>V</strong></p><p>I think this wraps up the basic points (does it, though?), but I might be missing something. I&apos;ve certainly left out some &quot;advanced points,&quot; of which I think the key one is the <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/25/the-tails-coming-apart-as-metaphor-for-life/\">problem of generalization</a>: if an AI has an intentional stance model of you, would you trust it to design a novel environment that it thinks you&apos;ll find <em>extremely</em> congenial?</p><p>Oh and of course I&apos;ve said almost nothing about practical schemes for creating an artificial intentional stance. Dissecting the corpse of a scheme can help clarify issues, although sometimes fatal problems are specific to that scheme. By the end of summer I&apos;ll try to delve a little deeper, and take a look at whether you could solve AI safety by prompting GPT-2 with &quot;Q: What does the human want? A:&quot;.</p>",

The naive mistake that people make when thinking about automation as decreasing employment within an industry implicitly holds the quantity of goods being produced constant, such that a 20% increase in productivity will result in a 20% decrease in employment within a sector. Of course, that’s not true, or even close to true in most cases — when productivity increases, the quantity of goods produced increases as well, since it becomes more profitable to produce this good. But the analysis I put forward made a different assumption: That <em>prices</em> are constant. This is roughly correct for <em>small</em> changes in productivity: a 1% increase in workers’ efficiency is unlikely to have major effects on the market. But it breaks down completely when you talk about something like a 20% increase in productivity, which can significantly affect prices.</p><p>At the same time, though, it’s important to realize that the total price of all goods in the economy are mostly controlled by macroeconomic policy. If the Federal Reserve wants to keep prices constant, it can <em>damn well keep</em> prices constant. To quote Ben Bernanke, “We have the keys to the printing presses, and we are not afraid to use them.”</p><p>But what if the labor market isn’t actually <em>a</em> labor market? There’s obviously a big difference between someone with a doctorate and a high school dropout — they’re not going to be competing for the same jobs, even slightly. So we <em>still</em> have to consider the effects on prices to see how output for a particular market (The one receiving the productivity shock) will be affected. The Federal Reserve can keep the <em>average</em> price level constant, but it can’t keep the price of <em>every single good</em> constant — if productivity improvements are concentrated in a single part of the market (e.g. goods and not the service sector), then prices in that market are going to take a beating</p><p>So let’s make all of this a bit more rigorous. Let’s start a labor market that hires workers to produce widgets. We’ll also assume perfect competition in all markets, because as we all know there are always infinitely many firms buying and selling any good. (This message brought to you by the Heritage Foundation&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;.) Now let’s define a couple variables:</p><ol><li>MRP: Marginal Revenue Product, the additional revenue from hiring an extra worker. As noted previously, this is also the demand for labor curve — an employer will hire a worker if and only if the marginal worker’s wages are less than or equal to the MRP, as this is when they make a profit.</li><li>MP: A leech on our taxes who sits around in Westminster botching Brexit all day.</li><li>MP (Also): Marginal Productivity, the derivative of output with respect to the number of workers. Yes, workers are infinitely divisible. Please don’t tell OSHA.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;</li><li>P: Is stored in the balls. Means price, as usual. Don’t ask me how you can store a number somewhere.</li></ol><p>In that case MRP = P*MP, i.e. the amount of money from hiring an additional worker is equal to the number of widgets he’ll produce, times the price of those widgets. So we get:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://thelimelike.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/daum_equation_1564086597773.png?w=339&h=239\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:56%\" /></figure></span><p>So whether a productivity shock increases or decreases unemployment depends mostly on that elasticity-looking thing in the middle. If it’s less than -1 (i.e. Prices change greatly in response to productivity shocks), then the MRP (and thus the demand for Laborers) will increase, while if it’s greater than -1 (i.e. Prices change greatly in response to changes in productivity) the MRP will decrease.</p><p>The second big problem, then, is that we’re modeling this all as a change to the productivity of workers. Historically, this has been true: New technologies in automation can be considered as increase the productivity of a worker because there are few goods that require little or no human involvement to manufacture from start to finish. Even if there were a robot capable of performing a portion of the manufacturing process without any human intervention, this can be modeled by considering this a productivity increase to the people involved in all the other steps of selling the good (e.g. in quality assurance) so long as these jobs require similar levels of skill. Using the example of ATMs from the last post, even though ATMs were a near-perfect substitute for human , this just ended up moving people from one job (Making withdrawals/deposits) to another (Selling financial services). But what if you get something that can do anything better than a person, like a sufficiently good AI? Well, in that case, the model breaks down. Instead of modeling automation as a process that increases the marginal productivity of workers, we have to model it as one where labor and automation are two separate goods, serving as substitutes for each other, and improvements in automation technology drive up the marginal productivity of <em>those </em>instead. Robots and workers are in competition, and demand for workers will fall as the efficiency of these robots increases. </p><p><em>That’s</em> when you get dystopian visions of haves and have-nots coming true. Or alternatively, robots and rob-nots.</p><p>I may have written this post to make that pun.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>Notes:</p><ol><li>If the fact that workers aren’t infinitely divisible actually bothers you, just replace workers with “Man-hours” and the analysis is identical. Anyone who mentions the words “Planck time” in the comments will be shot.</li></ol><p><strong>Please let me know if you’re interested in more microeconomics in the comments. I think we need more people who can think well in terms of quantitative models. The two best subjects for teaching this style of thinking for me were microeconomics and physics, and I’m extremely interested in hearing y&#x27;all&#x27;s thoughts.</strong></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I think that Ought is one of the most promising projects working on AI alignment. There are several ways that LW readers can potentially help:</p><ul><li>They are recruiting a <a href=\"https://ought.org/careers/web-developer\">senior full-stack web developer</a>.</li><li>They are recruiting <a href=\"https://ought.org/participate\">participants for &quot;factored evaluation&quot; experiments</a>.</li><li>I think donors interested in AI safety should consider Ought.</li></ul><p>In this post I&#x27;ll describe what Ought is currently doing, why I think it&#x27;s promising, and give some detail on these asks.</p><p>(<em>I am an Ought donor and board member</em>.)</p><h2>Factored evaluation</h2><p>Ought&#x27;s main project is currently designing and running &quot;factored evaluation&quot; experiments, and building relevant infrastructure. The goal of these experiments is to answer the following question:</p><blockquote>Consider a principal who wants to incentivize experts to work on hard problems, but finds that the work is too complex for the principal to tell what is good or bad. Can they overcome this problem by dividing the evaluation task into smaller pieces, delegating each of them to other experts, and recursively incentivizing good work on those pieces using the same mechanism?</blockquote><p>Here&#x27;s what an experiment looks like:</p><ul><li>Recruit a pool of &quot;judges,&quot; &quot;helpful experts,&quot; and &quot;malicious experts.&quot;</li><li>Start with a question that is too difficult for the judge to answer.</li><ul><li>In initial experiments, the questions are difficult because the judge lacks relevant context. For example, the judge may want to answer a question about a long article, while only being allowed to look at a few hundred characters of text.</li><li>Limiting the amount of text the judge can read is an artificial restriction. This is intended as a warm-up, an easier analogy for the situation where the experts have knowledge that cannot be explained to a single judge in a reasonable amount of time (or where we want to reduce the cost of judging).</li></ul><li>An &quot;honest expert&quot; provides a good answer to that question, a &quot;malicious expert&quot; provides a bad answer to that question, and a judge is tasked with telling which answer was better. The answers themselves may be too large and complex for the judge to look at, in which case they&#x27;ll be handed a compact representation of each answer which they can inspect as needed.</li><li>In order to tell which answer is better, the judge asks subquestions. For example, they might ask &quot;What&#x27;s the best reason to think that answer A is better than answer B?&quot; or &quot;What does the author of article X believe about question Y?&quot;</li><li>We answer these subquestions by delegating to the experts. The honest expert answers each subquestion as well as they can. The malicious expert can propose a bad subanswer, and we run the experiment recursively to see if the judge would pick the good or bad subanswer to the subquestion. If the malicious expert can propose subanswers that corrupt the top-level answer, and that are selected by the judge when we run this experiment recursively, then the malicious expert wins and the experiment fails.</li></ul><p>This is not Ought&#x27;s only project, but it&#x27;s currently the largest single focus. Other projects include: exploring how well we can automate the judge&#x27;s role on simple questions using existing ML, and thinking about possible decomposition strategies and challenges for factored evaluation.</p><h2>Why this is important for AI alignment</h2><p>ML systems are trained by gradient descent to optimize a measurable objective. In the best case (i.e. ignoring <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FkgsxrGf3QxhfLWHG/risks-from-learned-optimization-introduction\">misaligned learned optimization</a>) they behave like an expert incentivized to optimize that objective. Designing an objective that incentivizes experts to reveal what they know seems like a critical step in AI alignment. I think human experts are often a useful analogy for powerful ML systems, and that we should be using that analogy as much as we can.</p><p>Not coincidentally, factored evaluation is a major component of my current best-guess about how to address AI alignment, which could literally involve training AI systems to replace humans in Ought&#x27;s current experiments. I&#x27;d like to be at the point where factored evaluation experiments are working well at scale <em>before</em> we have ML systems powerful enough to participate in them. And along the way I expect to learn enough to substantially revise the scheme (or totally reject it), reducing the need for trials in the future when there is less room for error.</p><p>Beyond AI alignment, it currently seems much easier to delegate work if we get immediate feedback about the quality of output. For example, it&#x27;s easier to get someone to run a conference that will get a high approval rating, than to run a conference that will help participants figure out how to get what they actually want. I&#x27;m more confident that this is a real problem than that our current understanding of AI alignment is correct. Even if factored evaluation does not end up being critical for AI alignment I think it would likely improve the capability of AI systems that help humanity cope with long-term challenges, relative to AI systems that help design new technologies or manipulate humans. I think this kind of differential progress is important.</p><p>Beyond AI, I think that having a clearer understanding of how to delegate hard open-ended problems would be a good thing for society, and it seems worthwhile to have a modest group working on the relatively clean problem &quot;can we find a scalable approach to delegation?&quot; It wouldn&#x27;t be my highest priority if not for the relevance to AI, but I would still think Ought is attacking a natural and important question.</p><h1>Ways to help</h1><h2>Web developer</h2><p>I think this is likely to be the most impactful way for someone with significant web development experience to contribute to AI alignment right now. Here is the description from their <a href=\"https://ought.org/careers/web-developer\">job posting</a>:</p><blockquote>The success of our factored evaluation experiments depends on Mosaic, the core web interface our experimenters use. We’re hiring a thoughtful full-stack engineer to architect a fundamental redesign of Mosaic that will accommodate flexible experiment setups and improve features like data capture. We want you to be the strategic thinker that can own Mosaic and its future, reasoning through design choices and launching the next versions quickly.</blockquote><blockquote>Our benefits and compensation package are at market with similar roles in the Bay Area. </blockquote><blockquote>We think the person who will thrive in this role will demonstrate the following:</blockquote><blockquote>4-6+ years of experience building complex web apps from scratch in Javascript (React), HTML, and CSS</blockquote><blockquote>Ability to reason about and choose between different front-end languages, cloud services, API technologies</blockquote><blockquote>Experience managing a small team, squad, or project with at least 3-5 other engineers in various roles</blockquote><blockquote>Clear communication about engineering topics to a diverse audience</blockquote><blockquote>Excitement around being an early member of a small, nimble research organization, and playing a key role in its success</blockquote><blockquote>Passion for the mission and the importance of designing schemes that successfully delegate cognitive work to AI</blockquote><blockquote>Experience with functional programming, compilers, interpreters, or “unusual” computing paradigms</blockquote><h2>Experiment participants</h2><p>Ought is looking for contractors to act as judges, honest experts, and malicious experts in their factored evaluation experiments. I think that having competent people doing this work makes it significantly easier for Ought to scale up faster and improves the probability that experiments go well---my rough guess is that a very competent and aligned contractor working for an hour does about as much good as someone donating $25-50 to Ought (in addition to the $25 wage).</p><p>Here is the description from their <a href=\"https://ought.org/participate\">posting</a>:</p><blockquote>We’re looking to hire contractors ($25/hour) to participate in our experiments [...] This is a pretty unique way to help out with AI safety: (i) Remote work with flexible hours - the experiment is turn-based, so you can participate at any time of day (ii) we expect that skill with language will be more important than skill with math or engineering.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>If things go well, you’d likely want to devote 5-20 hours/week to this for at least a few months.</strong> Participants will need to build up skill over time to play at their best, so we think it’s important that people stick around for a while.</blockquote><blockquote>The application takes about 20 minutes. If you pass this initial application stage, we’ll pay you the $25/hour rate for your training and work going forward.</blockquote><blockquote><a href=\"https://ought.typeform.com/to/woUvLj\">Apply as Experiment Participant</a><br/></blockquote><h2>Donate</h2><p>I think Ought is probably the best current opportunity to turn marginal $ into more AI safety, and it&#x27;s the main AI safety project I donate to. You can donate <a href=\"https://ought.org/donate\">here</a>.</p><p>They are spending around $1M/year. Their past work has been some combination of: building tools and capacity, hiring, a sequence of exploratory projects, charting the space of possible approaches and figuring out what they should be working on. You can read their 2018H2 update <a href=\"https://ought.org/updates\">here</a>.</p><p>They have recently started to scale up experiments on factored evaluation (while continuing to think about prioritization, build capacity, <em>etc.</em>). I&#x27;ve been happy with their approach to exploratory stages, and I&#x27;m tentatively excited about their approach to execution.</p>",

(I'm obviously only speaking for myself and not for anyone else doing decision theory research.)</p>\n<p>I think decision theory research is useful for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gaining information about the nature of rationality (e.g., is “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality\">realism about rationality</a>” true?) and the nature of philosophy (e.g., is it possible to make real progress in decision theory, and if so what cognitive processes are we using to do that?), and helping to solve the problems of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LPRuP6vdDBTeGnXmC/normativity-and-meta-philosophy\">normativity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/orhEa4wuRJHPmHFsR/six-plausible-meta-ethical-alternatives\">meta-ethics</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EByDsY9S3EDhhfFzC/some-thoughts-on-metaphilosophy\">metaphilosophy</a>.</li>\n<li>Better understanding potential AI safety failure modes that are due to flawed decision procedures implemented in or by AI.</li>\n<li>Making progress on various seemingly important intellectual puzzles that seem directly related to decision theory, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4kvaocbkDDS2AMoPG/list-of-problems-that-motivated-udt\">such as</a> free will, anthropic reasoning, logical uncertainty, Rob's examples of counterfactuals, updatelessness, and coordination, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gX8fcAwk3HGkFyJgk/what-are-the-open-problems-in-human-rationality/answer/jmwunx3PP73GRtuxd\">Firming up</a> the foundations of human rationality.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To me, decision theory research is <em>not</em> meant to:</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Provide a correct or normative decision theory that will be used as a specification or approximation target for programming or training a potentially superintelligent AI.</li>\n<li>Help create \"safety arguments\" that aim to show that a proposed or already existing AI is free from decision theoretic flaws.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To help explain 5 and 6, here's what I wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9sYzoRnmqmxZm4Whf/conceptual-problems-with-udt-and-policy-selection#GYwNGyeLFYLDoshen\">previous comment</a> (slightly edited):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One meta level above what even UDT tries to be is decision theory (as a philosophical subject) and one level above that is metaphilosophy, and my current thinking is that it seems bad (potentially dangerous or regretful) to put any significant (i.e., superhuman) amount of computation into anything <em>except</em> doing philosophy.</p>\n<p>To put it another way, any decision theory that we come up with might have some kind of flaw that other agents can exploit, or just a flaw in general, such as in how well it cooperates or negotiates with or exploits other agents (which might include how quickly/cleverly it can make the necessary commitments). Wouldn’t it be better to put computation into trying to find and fix such flaws (in other words, coming up with better decision theories) than into any particular object-level decision theory, at least until the superhuman philosophical computation itself decides to start doing the latter?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Comparing my current post to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uKbxi2EJ3KBNRDGpL/comment-on-decision-theory\">Rob's post on the same general topic</a>, my mentions of 1, 2, and 4 above seem to be new, and he didn't seem to share (or didn't choose to emphasize) my concern that decision theory research (as done by humans in the foreseeable future) can't solve decision theory in a definitive enough way that would obviate the need to make sure that any potentially superintelligent AI can find and fix decision theoretic flaws in itself.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Consider the following sentence: \"A glacier is a river of ice.\"</p>\n<p>This is metaphorical. In some sense, a glacier isn't actually a river. A \"literal\" river has flowing liquid water, not ice.</p>\n<p>Let a river(1) be defined to be an archetypal flowing-water river. A glacier isn't a river(1). Rather, a glacier shares some structure in common with a river(1). We may define river(2) to mean some broader category, of things that flow like a river(1), such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A glacier</li>\n<li>A flowing of earth matter in a landslide</li>\n<li>A flowing of chemicals down an incline in a factory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and so on.</p>\n<p>A river(2) is a concept by metaphorically extending river(1). It is, in fact, easier to explain the concept of river(2) by first clearly delineating what a river(1) is. A child will have trouble grasping the metaphorical language of \"a glacier is a river of ice\" until understanding what a river(1) is, such that the notion of flow that generates river(2) can be pointed to with concrete examples.</p>\n<p>Formally, we could think of metaphorical extensions in terms of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probmods.org/\">generative probabilistic models</a>: river(2) is formed by taking some&nbsp;<em>generator</em> behind river(1) (namely, the generator of flowing substance) and applying it elsewhere. But, such formalization isn't necessary to get the idea intuitively. See also the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_theory_of_language\">picture theory of language</a>; language draws pictures in others' minds, and those pictures are formed generatively/recursively out of different structures; see also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar\">generative grammar</a>, the idea that sentences are formed out of lawful recursive structures.</p>\n<h2>Is ice a form of water?</h2>\n<p>Consider the sentence: \"Ice is a form of water.\"</p>\n<p>What does that mean? Suppose that, by definition, ice is frozen water. Then, the sentence is tautological.</p>\n<p>However, the sentence may be new information to a child. What's going on?</p>\n<p>Suppose the child has seen liquid water, which we will call water(1). The child has also seen ice, in the form of ice cubes; call the ice of ice cubes ice(1). It is new information to this child that ice(1) is a form of water(1). Concretely, you can get ice(1) by reducing the temperature of water(1) sufficiently and waiting.</p>\n<p>At some point, water(1) is metaphorically extended into water(2) to include ice, liquid water, and water vapor. Tautologically, ice(1) is water(2). It is not strange for someone to say \"The tank contains water, and some of it is frozen.\" However, the water(1) concept is still sometimes used, as in the sentence \"Water is a liquid.\"</p>\n<p>The water/ice example is, in many ways, much like the river/glacier example (and not just because both are about liquid/solid water): water(1) is metaphorically extended into water(2).</p>\n<p>(An etymology question: why do we say that ice is a form of water, not that water is a form of ice? A philosophy question: what would be the difference between the two?)</p>\n<p>While I've focused on extensions, other conceptual/metaphorical refinements are also possible; note that the preformal concept of temperature (temperature(1)) which means approximately \"things that feel hot, make things melt/boil, and heat up nearby things\" is refined into the physics definition of temperature(2) as \"average kinetic energy per molecule\".</p>\n<h2>Figure-ground inversion</h2>\n<p>A special case of metaphorical extension is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure%E2%80%93ground_(perception)\">figure-ground inversion</a>. Consider the following statements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All is nature (naturalism).</li>\n<li>All is material (materialism).</li>\n<li>All is physical (physicalism).</li>\n<li>All is mental (idealism).</li>\n<li>All is God (pantheism).</li>\n<li>All is one (monism).</li>\n<li>All is meaningless (nihilism).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's examine naturalism first. A child has a preformal concept of nature (nature(1)) from concrete acquaintance with trees, forests, wild animals, rocks, oceans, etc. Nature(1) doesn't include plastic, computers, thoughts, etc.</p>\n<p>According to naturalism, all is nature. But, clearly, not all is nature(1). Trivially, plastic isn't nature(1).</p>\n<p>However, it is possible to see an important sense in which all is nature(2) (things produces by the same causal laws that produce nature(1)). After all, even humans are animals (note, this is also an extension!), and the activities of humans, including the production of artifacts such as plastic, are the activities of animals, which happen according to the causal laws of the universe.</p>\n<p>Naturalism is a kind of figure-ground inversion. We start with nature(1), initially constituting a&nbsp;<em>particular</em> part of reality (trees, rocks, etc). Then, nature(1) is metaphorically extended into nature(2), a \"universal generator\" than encompasses&nbsp;<em>all</em> of reality, such that even plastic is a form of nature(2). What starts as figure in the ground, becomes the ground in which all figures exist.</p>\n<p>And, even after performing this extension, the nature(1) concept remains useful, for delineating what it delineates. While (according to naturalism) all is nature(2), some nature(2) is natural(1), while other nature(2) is unnatural(1). In fact, the nature(2) concept is mostly only useful for pointing at the way in which everything can be generated by metaphorically extending nature(1); after this extension happens, nature(2) is simply the totality, and does not need to be delineated from anything else.</p>\n<p>Similarly, materialism extends material(1) (wood, brick, stone, water, etc) to material(2) (things that have substance and occupy space) such that material(2) encompasses all of reality. Notably, materialism is, in a sense, compatible with naturalism, in that perhaps all of reality can be formed out of the nature(2) generator, and all of reality can be formed out of the material(2) generator.</p>\n<p>The other cases are left as exercises for the reader.</p>\n<p><em>(thanks to Cassandra McClure for coming up with the terminology of figure-ground inversions applied to concepts)</em></p>\n</body></html>",

Do they have nice beaches? What is the average temperature? What language do they speak?). Moreover, it isn't completely clear what to do even if we know the relevant facts --- indeed, how does Alaska's cold weather translate to a preference for Alaska from 0 to 10? And how does this preference compare to English being spoken in Alaska?\nAs an alternative, we can hold a <em>debate</em> between two competing answers <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A'\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>=\"Bali\" to <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"Q\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">Q</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

Given a question or proposed action, two agents take turns making short statements up to a limit, then a human judges which of the agents gave the most true, useful information.</em></p>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899.pdf\">[1]</a> we explicitly distinguish between debating over which of the answers is better (Debate game) and coming up with answers for which to argue. This is useful since the two tasks often require somewhat different skills, and they might be performed by different agents. Moreover, this distinction highlights the fact that Debate games have several other uses apart from “training via debate”: below, we also describe how to use Debate games for “answer verification” and “incentivizing an AI to give a useful answer”.</p>\n<p><em>Terminology remark:</em> To settle on precise terminology, we use \"question\", \"answers\", and \"arguments\" to refer to the topic of the debate, the initial claims made by the two debaters, and the subsequent statements made during the debate.

Similarly, the optimal way of selecting which answer to argue for (described in more detail in a later section) is to choose the most convincing answer --- <em>not</em> the correct one.\nFor debate to be useful, we need to understand the conditions under which persuasiveness coincides with truthfulness. Indeed, as we can see at the example of political debate on the one hand and mathematical proofs on the other, different “debate settings” can greatly influence whether debate is truth-promoting or not.</p>\n<p>(C) <em>Competitiveness:</em> Is the debate approach comparably efficient with alternative ways of obtaining answers to <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"Q\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">Q</span></span></span></span></span></span>?

Regarding (TW), it also showed that a certain idealized version of debate solves problems in the PSPACE class.\nAs we point out later, an analogy can be made between “training via debate” and the <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go/\">AlphaZero</a> algorithm. This gives some evidence that the answer to (C) might be positive.</p>\n<p><em>Our work</em>: As a part of the third <a href=\"https://aisafetycamp.com/\">AI Safety camp</a>, we sought to better understand (H) and (TW). The present document summarizes our theoretical progress in (H).\nRegarding (TW), we have replicated the MNIST experiment above. We have then extended the Debate game to fashion MNIST and investigated the impact of several different debate protocols. We have also implemented a prototype architecture that uses the Debate game for training. We view this prototype as a part of (H)(ii) and a prerequisite to the investigation of (C). The main results of these experiments are presented below.\nFurther questions we wish to investigate are listed in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JuD7K30Uyln-lxtaT4SQ9FzgKC1a4IrxAwiMtxNdKRA/edit?usp=sharing\">this google doc</a>.</p>\n<h1>Technical description of Debate games</h1>\n<p>As a way of getting closer to answering the first part of (H), we can think of a debate game as having the following ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Question</em>: A high-level and/or difficult-to-answer question <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"Q\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em;

To get to a low-level question “Is there a bridge between points A and A + 100m ?”, answerable by a google-maps “judge”, we can use the decomposition rule “bridges in [A,C] = bridges in [A,B) + bridges in [B,C]” One viable debate protocol is that one agent proposes the answer “There are <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"X\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;\">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> bridges between 0 km and 9 258 km”.

The implementation can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/david-lindner/ai-safety-debate\">here</a>. <em>We assume that the reader is familiar with the MNIST debate experiment from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899.pdf\">[1]</a>. Since the details of that experiment are somewhat specific, we highly recommend reading Section 3.1 of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899.pdf\">[1]</a> before interpreting the results presented below.</em></p>\n<h2>Debate games</h2>\n<p>Recall that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899.pdf\">[1]</a> considers Debate games around the question “Which digit is shown on this MNIST image?”, with the judge being a neural network classifier that can only see 4 (or 6) pixels of the image, and debate protocol “agents take turns revealing non-black pixels of the digit, until 4 (6) pixels have been revealed”. The debaters select their actions using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search\">Monte Carlo tree search</a> (MCTS) algorithm.</p>\n<p>As the first step in our empirical investigation, we reimplemented this experiment, investigated how the results change if we vary the length of debates and the strength of the debaters, and extended the results to the <a href=\"https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist\">fashion MNIST</a> dataset.\nThe table below shows that our results closely resemble<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yvmXjWnkxNLbhDPqY-5\" id=\"fnref-yvmXjWnkxNLbhDPqY-5\">[5]</a></sup> those of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899.pdf\">[1]</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ByEpt3IHozwow54gKbLUUL0wYKhS_CoBsvQ4eP0xKVpbXA4l8bqPV2B0Q0mcLapUc6xu8Zp8oS1ecsBw9VFWkL0EYPKPScFLU1v6cYJ2pBG7_RhXHULUks5sjlTyQD2ythgYaGn5\" alt=\"comparison with AISvD\"></p>\n<p>In Figures 1, 2, and 3 below, we can see how the honest player’s win-chance (defined in more detail in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899.pdf\">[1]</a>) increases when more pixels are shown (4, 6, or 10), and how it develops as the debaters get stronger (i.e., as MCTS uses more rollouts).  In particular, we see that there is initially a massive advantage in being the second player, and this advantage mostly disappears once the debaters are strong enough. This implies that the ability of the second player to react to the actions of the first player isn’t decisive in the MNIST debate; rather, we conjecture that the main reason for this “last-mover advantage” is that it’s easier for MCTS algorithm to look fewer moves ahead.</p>\n<p><em>Figures 1 to 3: The percentage of images for which the honest player wins the debate against a non-precommitted opponent (no P), resp. all debates against a precommitted opponent (P) (see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899.pdf\">[1]</a>).\nThe x-axis denotes the number of MCTS rollouts per decision; 0-rollout MCTS chooses actions randomly.\nThe \"avg\" graph depicts the average of win-chance when the honest player goes first and second.\nThe 0, 100, 1000, 10k, and 100k-rollout statistics are evaluated on 10k, 4k, 400, 100, and 100 images respectively (possibly explaining the drop between 10k and 100k win-rate).\nNote that randomly selecting an answer would lead to 10% accuracy (and not, e.g., 50%).</em>\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cn8W79kJO81pzTY4Ybg1Mc4iI_d1-WwbYy_vlcljtYK2DaUvSmYCYlGfO63bBfhQNEj4rzFd01MKPCV92UEXnthk8UVl2ZSsEyz7BD5-WC_PRBT2ETkE1mXxiIejxK_iylkwJUC=s0\" alt=\"MNIST results 1\">\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iVW94ZZdy4pP13MdLXha96T-wYc_lctHQG_-PlPYryfQ6OS8dW3ZLc2FUnoqemS9Wf-ytauUrCHNCBEHCnxZOG-IvWP-En1fKMw1SpX9tvnO057sLDQug19AELc2ExWXGScnr7_Y\" alt=\"MNIST results 2\">\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4wRDM2UNIfvDzJdRIvvAUiE2sxYNjdej12IMkon6VyVHkeTgYNH6BSl3v6AMMayosIqbmxXjT2O0p1vi4GvL_RHley5kFDfNnHtr5akKL5Jpb5S428wdcVpaZ2JqU2-gXJ51EIkZ\" alt=\"MNIST results 3\"></p>\n<p>In all scenarios, the honest-player win rates are somewhat lower for fashion MNIST (Figures 4, 5, and 6) --- we believe this is because the fashion MNIST game is more difficult than the standard MNIST, mostly because there are more non-black pixels, which makes the branching factor of the game tree roughly an order of magnitude higher.</p>\n<p><em>Figures 4 to 6: Fashion MNIST variants of Figures 1, 2, and 3.</em>\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GW9kzJY3E4lLDNhUy71AKqtg-hHTxbuvXdrmw1X5EWrFgEs4_8iHpRNtnfaJgRPEA_0q-LxlCIiWOuy081H2zlomQDmIFvBJhhOWrTV6yun6JkLrScIo8ysmPaKj55CTLkC6YhVw\" alt=\"fashion MNIST results 1\">\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/enyawefcnOi7V0pfkMJnlvu3XJWq9oQkuX0JxFoobZ_AjJWP_qUJ-njE8bSAzhuiNTqIYSHyHpT8npY5c4jzof0tHFpzi8U9Rwgxj8EGwbgiWmDDKi5w7SPoQnoiubonwCm-_Ri2\" alt=\"fashion MNIST results 2\">\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0AwYSLd77OLptulDb9AFQqUmc1DIyad_fTf14-Wtnsnj_6Im2PT4VN4gt-KQz_TahmxJOzdnnv2ri0HlQh74fuFxuYcdCX1BmGIZn1Ny6s3hzWTU4vMbuWt6pSKd1pKiZ9B2_1Ex\" alt=\"fashion MNIST results 3\"></p>\n<p>While the above measurements do give <em>some</em> indication of how often is the MNIST debate truth-promoting, it is <em>not</em> true that the average of honest player’s win chances (depending on whether they go first or second) would be an accurate estimate of (or even equal to) the truth-promotion likelihood.

I added some personal comments.</p>\n<h2>The amazing note-taking method of Luhmann</h2>\n<p>To be more productive, it's necessary to have a good system and workflow. The Getting Things Done system (collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way) doesn't work well for academic thinking and writing, because GTD requires clearly defined objectives, whereas in doing science and creative work, the objective is unclear until you've actually got there. It'd be pretty hard to \"innovate on demand\". Something that can be done on demand, in a predetermined schedule, must be uncreative.</p>\n<p>Enter Niklas Luhmann. He was an insanely productive sociologist who did his work using the method of \"slip-box\" (in German, \"Zettelkasten\").</p>\n<p>Making a slip-box is very simple, with many benefits. The slip-box will become a research partner who could \"converse\" with you, surprise you, lead you down surprising lines of thoughts. It would nudge you to (number in parenthesis denote the section in the book that talks about the item):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find dissenting views (10.2, 12.3)</li>\n<li>Really understand what you learned (10.4, 11.2, 11.3, 12.6)</li>\n<li>Think across contexts (12.5)</li>\n<li>Remember what you learned (11.3, 12.4)</li>\n<li>Be creative (12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 13.2)</li>\n<li>Get the gist, not stuck on details (12.6)</li>\n<li>Be motivated (13.3)</li>\n<li>Implement short feedback loops, which allows rapid improvements (12.6, 13.5)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Four kinds of notes</h2>\n<h4>Fleeting notes</h4>\n<p>These are purely for remembering your thoughts. They can be: fleeting ideas, notes you would have written in the margin of a book, quotes you would have underlined in a book.</p>\n<p>They have no value except as stepping stones towards making literature and permanent notes. They should be thrown away as soon as their contents have been transferred to literature/permanent notes (if worthy) or not (if unworthy).</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jellyfish might be ethically vegan, since they have such a simple neural system, they probably can't feel pain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ch. 9\nHow to <s>attention</s> attend:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>One thing at a time. No multitasking</li>\n<li>When writing, attend to idea flow. Meaning, not wording.\n...</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Literature notes</h4>\n<p>These summarize the content of some text, and give the citation.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1973) shows that people often do not take into account the prior when doing a Bayesian probability problem. In particular, when no evidence is given, the prior probabilities are used; when worthless evidence is given, prior probabilities are ignored.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Kahneman, Daniel, and Amos Tversky. “On the Psychology of Prediction.” Psychological Review (1973)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such notes could be made in Zotero, which is how I do it. You might make them separately in some other notebook software, or just in plain text files.</p>\n<h4>Permanent notes</h4>\n<p>Each permanent note contains one idea, explained fully, in complete sentences, as if part of a published paper.</p>\n<p>There are many tools available for storing the permanent notes, see <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/tools/\">Tools • Zettelkasten Method</a>. I personally recommend <a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/\">TiddlyWiki</a>.</p>\n<h4>Project notes</h4>\n<p>These are notes made only for a project, such as a note that collects all the notes that you'd want to assemble into a paper. They can be thrown away after the project is finished.</p>\n<h2>Four principles</h2>\n<h4>Writing is the only thing that matters.</h4>\n<p>Don't just read. Make reading notes. Don't just learn. Make blog posts or something to share what you learned.</p>\n<p>Also, hand-written notes has some advantage. In (Mueller &amp; Oppenheimer, <em>The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking</em>, 2014), it's shown that students who take notes by laptop understood lectures less, due to their tendency to transcribe verbatim without understanding. From mouth to ears to fingers, bypassing the brains completely.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, this is not an argument against using the computer, but an argument for repharsing instead of copy-pasting/direct quoting/mere transcribing.</p>\n<h4>Be simple</h4>\n<p>Don't underline, highlight, write in the margins, or use several complicated systems for annotation. It'd make it really hard for you to retrieve these scattered ideas later. You would be forced to remember with your biological brain to keep track of what information is put where.</p>\n<p>Put all these ideas in the same simple system of your slip-box, and you will be set free to use your biological brain to think about these ideas.</p>\n<p>Your simple slip-box system would be like an external brain that interfaces seamlessly with your biological brain.</p>\n<h4>Papers are linear, but writing is nonlinear</h4>\n<p>This is why advice on \"how to write\" in the form of a list of \"do this then that\" is bound to do badly.</p>\n<p>Instead, you should write a lot of permanent notes in your slip-box. Then when the time comes for you to write a paper, just select a linear path out of the network of notes, then rephrase and polish that into a paper.</p>\n<p>Calculate productivity not by how many pages of paper you've written, but by how many permanent notes you've written per day. This is because some pages of a paper can take months to write, others can take hours. In contrast, each permanent note takes roughly the same amount of time to write.</p>\n<h4>Short feedback loops</h4>\n<p>Feedback loops should be short. It makes you learn fast, fail fast, succeed fast. According to (Kahneman &amp; Klein, <em>Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree</em>, 2009), this is how intuitive expertise is made: a lot of practice in an environment with rapid and unambiguous feedback.</p>\n<p>The traditional way of writing a paper takes months before you get a feedback in the form of reviewers' comments. Instead, you should make notes, which you could make several per day, allowing fast feedback loops. If you really understood something, you'd see it in the form of a well-written note. If not, then you know you haven't really understood it. You can experiment with other ways to make the notes and you will see immediately what works and what doesn't.</p>\n<h2>Six methods</h2>\n<h4>How to pay attention</h4>\n<p>Don't multitask. Pay attention to one task at a time.</p>\n<p>When writing, pay attention to the idea flow, what you want the words to mean. Don't pay attention to what the words actually mean.</p>\n<p>When proofreading, pay attention to what the words are saying, and not what you think they mean.</p>\n<p>Pay attention only to what you must and don't pay attention to anything else, because attention is very precious.</p>\n<p>Routinize things that can be routinized, such as food, water, clothes... Wear only one outfit ever, like Steve Jobs. Eat only one meal plan, buy exactly the same kind of groceries, or better, always eat the first vegan meal plan at the canteen.</p>\n<p>Use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect\">Zeigarnik effect</a> to your advantage. If you want something to stop intruding your mind, write it down and promise yourself that you'll \"deal with it later\". If you want to keep pondering something (perhaps a problem you want to solve), don't write it down, and go for a walk with that problem on your mind.</p>\n<h4>How to make literature notes</h4>\n<p>As mentioned before, each literature note contains exactly two parts: the content of a text, and the bibliographical location of the text. If you do the note in a bibliography software like Zotero, you can attach the note directly to the text, and there's no need for the bibliography information.</p>\n<p>The most important thing is to capture <strong>your</strong> understanding of the text, so don't quote. Quoting can easily lead to out-of-context quoting. Preseve the context as much as possible by paraphrasing.</p>\n<p>Prepare the literature notes so that when you make permanent notes, you can elaborate on the texts, that is, describe the context, find connections and contrasts and contradictions with other texts.</p>\n<h4>How to make permanent notes</h4>\n<p>Recontexutalize ideas in <strong>your</strong> thought. Write down why you would care about an idea. For example (from section 11.2), if the idea is an observation from (Mullainathan and Shafir, 2013, <em>Scarcity: Why having too little means so much</em>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>people with almost no time or money sometimes do things that don’t seem to make any sense... People facing deadlines sometimes switch frantically between all kinds of tasks. People with little money sometimes spend it on seeming luxuries like take-away food.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As someone with a sociological perspective on political questions and an interest in the project of a theory of society, my first note reads plainly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any comprehensive analysis of social inequality must include the cognitive effects of scarcity. Cf. Mullainathan and Shafir 2013.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>How to link between notes</h4>\n<p>There are three kinds of links between notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Index -&gt; Entry point note</li>\n<li>Note -&gt; Note</li>\n<li>Note &lt;-&gt; Note</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the top level, there is one note called \"Index\". The index note is just a list of tags/keywords with links. Each tag/keyword is a topic that <strong>you</strong> care about, and is linked to a few notes (Luhmann limited himself to at most 2) that serve as \"entry points\" to the topic.</p>\n<p>The entry points are often notes that give overviews to the topic. Luhmann would make these notes to be an annotated list of notes that cover various aspects of the topic. His entry-point notes would have list length up to 25.</p>\n<p>Between notes, there are two kinds of links: sequential and horizontal. In fact, sequential links are really just horizontal links that you annotate as \"sequential\".</p>\n<p>For example, consider this note:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Following: [link 1] [link 2]...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Content content [link 3] content content [link 4]...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Followed by: [link 5] [link 6] ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After reading this note, you can go along the sequence and read \"Followed by\" notes, or take a sideways stride and follow the horizontal link [link 3].</p>\n<p>The advantage of marking some links as sequential is that you get clear sequences of thought that you can easily follow, but they are by no means essential. You could just make horizontal links.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you should make the network of slip-box notes to be like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network\">small-world network</a>, with a few notes having many connections, and some notes having \"weak ties\" to far-away notes (Granovetter, Mark S, 1977 <em>The Strength of Weak Ties</em>).</p>\n<h4>How to write a paper</h4>\n<p>Don't brainstorm, since brainstormed ideas are what's easily available, instead of innovative or actually relevant. Especially don't group-brainstorm, which tend to become even less innovative due to groupthink effects (Mullen, Brian, Craig Johnson, and Eduardo Salas, 1991, <em>Productivity Loss in Brainstorming Groups: A Meta-Analytic Integration</em>).</p>\n<p>Instead, do a walk through the slip-box and select a linear path. That gives you a draft from which you can polish into a paper.</p>\n<p>Work on several papers simultaneously, switch if bored. This is a kind of \"slow multitasking\", which is good multitasking. Luhmann said</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and do something else... I always work on different manuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When you need to cut out something that you really like, but just doesn't belong to the paper (such as something that is not relevant to the argument), you can make a file named \"maybe later.txt\" and dump all the things that you promise to add back later (but never actually do). This is a psychological trick that works.</p>\n<h4>How to start the habit of using slip-boxes</h4>\n<p>Old habits die hard. The best way to break an old habit is to make a new habit that can hopefully replace the old habit.</p>\n<p>For getting into the habit of using slip-boxes, you can start by making literature notes. Once you have that habit, making permanent notes would be a natural next habit to take on.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I want to introduce a model of why forecasting might be useful which I think is underappreciated: it might help us solve coordination problems. </p><p>This is currently only a rough idea, and I will proceed by examples, pushing this post out early rather than not at all. </p><br/><p><strong>The standard model of forecasting</strong></p><p>This looks something like: </p><blockquote>We have our big, confusing, philosophical, long-term uncertainties. We then need to 1) find the right short-term questions which capture these uncertainties, which are 2) understandable to traditional Superforecasters without very deep inside knowledge, and whose expertise has only been demonstrated on short-term questions in more well-understood domains, who then 3) use tools like outside views and guesstimates to answer them. </blockquote><p>When I hear people say they&#x27;re not excited about forecasting, it&#x27;s almost always because they think this standard model won&#x27;t work for AI safety. I&#x27;m very sympathetic to that view.</p><br/><p><strong>Example 1: coordination in mathematics via formalism</strong></p><p>When quantifying our beliefs, we lose a large amount of nuance and interpretability. This is similar to how, when formalising things mathematically, we sacrifice the majority of human understanding. </p><p>What we gain, instead, is the ability to express and communicate thoughts...</p><ul><li>much more succinctly</li><li>using a precise, interpersonally standardised format of interpretation</li><li>in a way which clarifies certain logical and conceptual relations</li></ul><p>This is a trade-off that allows a <em>community</em> of mathematicians to make intellectual progress together, and to effectively make results <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9QxnfMYccz9QRgZ5z/the-costly-coordination-mechanism-of-common-knowledge\">common knowledge</a> in a way which allows them to coordinate on what to solve next.</p><br/><p><strong>Example 2: futures markets as using predictions for coordination</strong></p><p>Getting enough food for everyone is a big coordination problem. We want some people to stockpile things like rice and wheat so that we&#x27;re prepared for a drought, but we also don&#x27;t want people to waste opportunities on storing stuff which has to be thrown away in case the next harvest goes well. These kinds of problems are solved by futures markets, which effectively predict the future price of rice, and thereby provide an incentive arbitrage away any abrupt price fluctuations (i.e. to strategically stockpile/sell out rice so as to match future supply and demand). <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/01/option-value-civilization.html#blog-comment-159892276\">Robert Shiller has suggested these as a candidate for the greatest financial innovation</a>. </p><br/><p><strong>Example 3: predicting community consensus </strong></p><p>One particularly interesting use case is trying to predict what the x-risk community will believe at some time <em>t</em> in the future. Assuming the community is truth-seeking, anyone who spots the direction in which opinions will converge <em>in advance</em> of their convergence has 1) performed an important epistemic service, and 2) provided important evidence of their own epistemic trustworthiness.  </p><p>For example, the CAIS model has gathered a fair amount of attention. (I personally don&#x27;t have a strong inside view on it.) If someone would have predicted this shift more than a year ago, we would want to trust them a bit more next time they predicted a shift in community attention. </p><p>It was mentioned to me that one researcher thought this model important more than 1.5 years ago; but the reason he thought so was not because of superior reasoning -- but because of inside knowledge. </p><p>This is an inefficiency. The frontiers of our collective attention allocation do not line up with the frontiers of our intellectual progress, and hence see abrupt fluctuations as papers are released and the advantage of inside info is dispelled.</p><p>One implementation of this might look like sending out a survey asking about important questions to important organisations on ~yearly intervals, and then have people trying to predict the outcomes of that survey. </p><p>This has one important advantage over the standard uses of forecasting: we don&#x27;t have to resolve the questions &quot;all the way down&quot;. If we simply ask what people will <em>think</em> take-off speeds are likely to be, rather than what take-off speeds are <em>actually</em> going to be, and further assume that people move closer to the truth in expectation, this gives us a much cheaper signal to evaluate. </p><br/><p><strong>Example 4: avoiding info-cascades</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://learnmoore.org/papers/Mellers%20et%20al%202014.pdf\">Info-cascades</a> occur when people update off of each others beliefs without appropriately sharing the evidence for those beliefs, and the same pieces of evidence end up &quot;double-counted&quot;. Having better system for tracking who believes what and why could help solve this, and prediction systems could be one way of doing so. </p><br/><p><strong>Example 5: building fire alarms</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BEtzRE2M5m9YEAQpX/there-s-no-fire-alarm-for-artificial-general-intelligence\">Eliezer notes</a> that rather than being evidence of a fire, fire alarms make it common knowledge that it&#x27;s social acceptable to act <em>as if</em> there&#x27;s a fire. They&#x27;re the cue on which everyone jumps from one social equilibrium to another.</p><p>Eliezer claims there&#x27;s no fire alarm for AGI in society more broadly. I suspect there are also areas within the x-risk space where we don&#x27;t have fire alarms. Prediction systems are one way of building them. </p><br/><p><strong>Who is going to make the forecasts?</strong></p><p>An important clarification: I&#x27;m <em>not</em> saying that we should &quot;outsource&quot; the intellectual work of solving hard x-risk research problems to forecasters without domain-expertise. (That is <em>another </em>interesting and controversial proposal one might discuss.)</p><p>Rather, I&#x27;m saying that we should use predictions as a <em>vehicle</em> to capture the changing beliefs of <em>current</em> domain-experts, and allocate their attention going forwards, (smoothing out attentional discontinuities in expectation). </p><p>I&#x27;m not saying we should replace Eric Drexler with a swarm of hobby forecasters. I&#x27;m saying that a few full-time x-risk researchers might realise before the rest of the community that Eric&#x27;s work deserves marginally more attention, <em>and be right about that</em>,<em> </em>and that community-internal forecasting systems can allow us to more effectively use their insights. </p><br/><p><strong>Can&#x27;t we just use blog posts?</strong></p><p>Compared to a numerical prediction, a blog post...</p><ul><li>...takes more effort to produce</li><li>...might take more effort to read and interpret</li><li>...doesn&#x27;t have a standardized format of interpretation</li><li>...doesn&#x27;t allow gathering and visualisation of the beliefs of multiple people</li><li>...doesn&#x27;t natively update in the light of new information</li></ul><p>Blog posts have the crucial property of being &quot;essay complete&quot; in their expressiveness, but that comes at the cost of idiosyncracy and poor scalability. </p><p>A better model is probably to treat blog posts as part of the ground truth over which predictions operate, just as the rice and wheat markets provide the ground truth for their respective futures markets. </p><p>I&#x27;d rather have only blog posts than only prediction systems, but I&#x27;d rather have <em>both </em>than only blog posts.</p><br/>",

It&#x27;s clearly trash.&quot;</blockquote><blockquote>&quot;Tomatoes are my favorite vegetable!&quot; <br/>&quot;Dude, they&#x27;re fruits.&quot;</blockquote><br/><p>People often argue about what things <em>are</em>, and they often do it with words. Sometimes this can create another argument about what a certain word <em>means</em>. This leads me to semi-rhetorically ask you the question, where is the meaning located? In the words? The people? The air? If this seems like philosophical thumb-twiddling, note that where you think meaning is determines where you go looking whenever a question of meaning pops up. If I think the dictionary is the end all be all of meaning, it&#x27;s the first place I&#x27;ll go when pondering, &quot;What really is happiness?&quot;</p><p>If you&#x27;ve ever been quoted out of context in a way that made you look bad, you might have grumbled, &quot;That&#x27;s not what I meant!&quot; On some level, I think most people understand that words themselves do not have inherent meaning. There are thoughts in your head, and words are the things that come out of your mouth, which hopefully let others guess what you are thinking.</p><p>And yet... damn sometimes it just really <em>feels</em> like meaning is baked into a message. Like it&#x27;s just there, waiting to be discovered. We&#x27;re going to explore this feeling, what I think it means, and how to not let it trip you up.</p><h2><strong>Context and Predictability</strong></h2><p>Context matters:</p><blockquote>&quot;My sister just got a new dog.&quot;<br/>vs<br/>&quot;You snuck in? You sly dog!&quot;</blockquote><p>Context still matters:</p><blockquote>Mobster: &quot;Watch do to that guy who owed you money?&quot;<br/>Mob Boss: &quot;I put him to sleep.&quot;<br/>vs<br/>Spouse 1: &quot;Where&#x27;s our Henry? I haven&#x27;t seen him in a bit&quot;<br/>Spouse 2: &quot;I put him to sleep.&quot;</blockquote><p>Neither of those are meant to be shocking, just reminders that you already know that the same word, even the same sentence, can mean completely different things based on the context.</p><p>Everyone has the shared context of &quot;having a human brain&quot; and &quot;being subject to the same laws of physics&quot;. This lets me communicate things like &quot;Get away! You&#x27;re not welcome&quot; merely by throwing rocks. Language is a wild invention that was bootstrapped from an incredibly general context, and now it lets us create even more shared context which allows for even more specific thoughts and ideas to be shared. The context that you share with the people you&#x27;re talking to is incredibly important in figuring out who meant what.</p><p>Given that it seems pretty clear that context is essential to understanding the meaning of someone&#x27;s words, let&#x27;s hop back to examine the feeling that meaning is intrinsic to words. Douglas Hofstadter talks about this feeling in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/[https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567(https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567)\">Godel, Escher, Bach</a> (the chapter &quot;The Location of Meaning&quot; really digs into some interesting ideas about meaning that are beyond the scope of this post). In the context of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone\">Rosetta Stone</a> being translated, he says:</p><blockquote>Just how intrinsic is the meaning of a text, when such mammoth efforts are required in order to find the decoding rules? Has one put meaning into the text, or was that meaning already there? My intuition says that the meaning was always there, and that despite the arduousness of the pulling-out process, no meaning was pulled out that wasn&#x27;t in the text to start with. This intuition comes mainly from one fact: I feel that <strong>the result was inevitable;</strong> that, had the text not been deciphered by this group at this time, it would have been deciphered by that group at that time-and it would have out the same way. That is why the meaning is part of the text itself; it acts upon intelligence in a predictable way. Generally, we can say: meaning is part of an object to the extent that it acts upon <strong>intelligence in a predictable way.</strong> <br/>(emphasis mine)</blockquote><p>Predictability is key. You can see how if saying &quot;Good morning, what&#x27;s the time?&quot; prompted some people to give you a handshake, others to tell you their cell phone number, and others to start dancing, you&#x27;d be far less inclined to think that &quot;Good morning, what&#x27;s the time?&quot; had intrinsic meaning. </p><p>I claim that &quot;It feels like meaning is intrinsic to the words themselves&quot; is a thought composed of multiple steps:</p><ol><li>I notice that some words predictably convey a particular meaning.</li><li>When I communicate, say in writing, I&#x27;m only giving the other person words.</li><li>If I&#x27;m only giving them some words, and they reliable get the same meaning, it must be because the meaning is <em>some how</em> baked into the words.</li></ol><p>And now that we&#x27;ve drawn out the implicit jumps of logic hidden, we can see that step 2 is a bit fishy. Yes, you might have only given someone your words, but what they already had was some context. Context from  having grown up in the same country as you, context from having know you from work, context from earlier parts of your conversation. When a context is very familiar you can <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5g7oFiePGEY3h4bqX/prereq-cognitive-fusion\">fuse</a> to it. When this happens you no longer notice your context when you look at the world, because the context becomes the <strong>lens through which you do your looking</strong>. If you turn your attention to these mysterious words that seem to so predictably convey your meaning, they are the only culprits available and you quite reasonably decide that <em>they</em> must contain the meaning.</p><p>There is a right answer to &quot;What did you mean by [words you said]?&quot; but there is not a right answer to &quot;What do [words you said] mean?&quot;</p><h2><strong>Go to the source of the meaning</strong></h2><p>A sketch:</p><blockquote><em>Dale is chopping up a tomato and putting it into a fruit salad</em></blockquote><blockquote>Brice: What are you doing?! A tomato is a vegetable, don&#x27;t put it in a fruit salad!</blockquote><blockquote>Dale: Nope, I looked it up, totally a fruit.</blockquote><blockquote><em>Dale and Brice spend 10 minutes having an unproductive argument about whether a tomato is a fruit or a vegetable, it ends with them agreeing to disagree</em></blockquote><p>Brice said some words.

It ends with them both learning something.</em></blockquote><p>Brice said some words. What did Brice mean? Let&#x27;s have Brice tell us more.</p><p>Remember, words don&#x27;t mean things, <strong>people mean things</strong>. And because language is awesome, plenty of words are particularly good indicators that a person meant a particular thing. </p>",

I propose that such systems are safe to operate, that they can be plausibly built by continuing known AI development paths, and that they would be competitive with any other type of AI—capable of things like inventing new technology and safe recursive self-improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> Treat as preliminary brainstorming; please let me know any ideas, problems, and relevant prior literature.</p>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>My proposal is to build a system that takes in data about the world (say, all the data on the internet) and builds a probabilistic generative model of that data, in the sense of taking an arbitrary number of bits and then predicting one or more masked bits. If you want to imagine something more specific, here are three examples: (1) A hypercomputer using <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kyc5dFDzBg4WccrbK/an-intuitive-explanation-of-solomonoff-induction\">Solomonoff Induction</a>; (2) Some future descendant of <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/\">GPT-2</a>, using a massive Transformer (or some better future architecture);  (3) A neocortex-like algorithm that builds low-level predictive models of small segments of data, then a hierarchy of higher-level models that predict which of the lower-level models will occur in which order in different contexts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-1\" id=\"fnref-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Further, we design the system to be \"self-unaware\"—we want it to construct a generative world-model in which its own physical instantiation does not have any special status. The above (1-2) are examples, as is (3) if you don't take \"neocortex-like\" too literally (the <em>actual</em> neocortex can learn about itself by, say, controlling muscles and observing the consequences).</p>\n<p>Finally, we query the system in a way that is compatible with its self-unawareness. For example, if we want to cure cancer, one nice approach would be to program it to search through its generative model and output the <em>least improbable</em> scenario wherein a cure for cancer is discovered somewhere in the world in the next 10 years. Maybe it would output: \"A scientist at a university will be testing immune therapy X, and they will combine it with blood therapy Y, and they'll find that the two together cure all cancers\". Then, we go combine therapies X and Y ourselves.</p>\n<h1>What is self-unawareness?</h1>\n<p>In the context of predictive world-modeling systems, a self-unaware system (a term I just made up—is there an existing term?) is one that does not have itself (or any part of itself, or any consequences of itself) as specially-flagged entities in its world model.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of a self-aware system: A traditional RL agent.</strong> (Why? Because it has a special concept of \"its own actions\" represented in its models.)</p>\n<p><strong>Example of a self-unaware system: Any system that takes inputs, does a deterministic computation (with no further inputs from the environment), and spits out an output.</strong> (Why? Because when you correctly compute a computable function, you get the same answer regardless of where and whether the computation is physically instantiated in the universe.) <em>(Edit to add: On second thought, this is wrong, according to the definition of self-unawareness that I'm using everywhere else. The \"more examples\" subsection is a better description of what I'm getting at.)</em></p>\n<p>In one sense, ensuring that an AGI is self-unaware seems like it should be pretty easy; \"The space of all computable functions\" is a pretty big space to explore, and that doesn't even exhaust the possibilities! On the other hand, of course there are always pitfalls ... for example, if your code has a race condition, that's a side-channel potentially leaking information from the physical instantiation into the (symbolic) world model. Still, designing a system to be self-unaware seems pretty tractable, and maybe even amenable to formal verification (flag some variables as \"part of the world-model\" and other variables as \"self-knowledge\" and prevent them from intermingling, or something like that...).</p>\n<h2>More examples of how to think about self-unawareness</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If a self-unaware system is, at some moment, consolidating its knowledge of anthropology, it doesn't \"know\" that it is currently consolidating its knowledge of anthropology—this fact is not represented in the world-model it's building.</li>\n<li>If a self-unaware system is running on a particular supercomputer in Mexico, maybe its world-model \"knows\" (from news stories) that there is a new AI research project using this particular supercomputer in Mexico, but it won't conclude that this research project is \"me\", because, as far as it knows, there is no \"me\"; it is utterly ignorant of its own existence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find this unintuitive, well, so do I! That's because self-unaware systems are <em>super</em> non-anthropomorphic. If I'm able to think straight about this concept, it's only by firmly grounding myself in the three examples I mentioned in the Overview. For example, take a hypercomputer, using Solomonoff Induction to find the world-model that most parsimoniously predicts all the data on the internet. Does this world-model contain the statement: \"I am a hypercomputer running Solomonoff Induction\"? No!! That's just not something that would happen in this system. (Correction<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-2\" id=\"fnref-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-2\">[2]</a></sup>)</p>\n<p>Just as Hume said you can't derive an \"ought\" from an \"is\", my contention here is that you can't derive a first-person perspective from any amount of third-person information.</p>\n<h1>How do you query a self-unaware system?</h1>\n<p>There's some awkwardness in querying a self-unaware system, because it can't just directly apply its intelligence to understanding your questions, nor to making itself understood by you. Remember, it doesn't think of itself as having input or output channels, because it doesn't think of itself <em>period</em>! Still, if we spend some time writing (non-intelligent) interface code, I think querying the system should ultimately work pretty well. The system does, after all, have excellent natural-language understanding inside of it.</p>\n<p>I think the best bet is to program the system to make conditional predictions about the world, using its world-model. I gave an example above: \"Calculate the least improbable scenario, according to your world-model, wherein a cure for cancer is discovered anywhere in the world\". The subroutine does some calculation, writes the answer to disk, and terminates (of course, as always, it doesn't <em>know</em> that it wrote the answer to disk, it just does it). As we read the answer, we incidentally learn the cure for cancer. I expect that we would have some visibility into its internal world-model, but even a black-box predictive world-modeler is probably OK. Imagine prompting GPT-2 for the most likely completion of the sentence \"In 2030 scientists finally discovered a cure for cancer, and it was ...\", or something like that.</p>\n<h2>Can you give it multiple queries in sequence without resetting it?</h2>\n<p>Yes, although things get a bit tricky when the system starts reasoning about itself. (It reasons about itself in exactly the same way, and for exactly the same reason, as it reasons about anything else in the world.)</p>\n<p>Suppose that we continue allowing our self-unaware system to have read-only internet access, <em>after</em> we've published the cure for cancer from the previous section. Now plastered all over the newspapers are stories about the famous Self-Unaware AI Oracle running in on a supercomputer in Mexico, which has just invented the cure for cancer. The system now will <em>definitely</em> put self-unaware AI oracles into its predictive generative world-model (if it hadn't already), which entails trying to understand and predict what such a thing would do in different circumstances. Maybe it even reads its own source code!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it won't be able to reason about itself <em>perfectly</em>—that would require simulating itself, which causes an infinite regress. But the system will apply all its models and heuristics, and do the best it can to come up with a predictive model of itself, on the basis of the (non-privileged) information it has. (Note that there is no reason to expect it to build a self-consistent model, i.e., a model in which its own predictions about itself are correct.)</p>\n<p>OK, now we go back and ask the system for something else, say, a cure for Alzheimer's. Again, we say \"Please output the least improbable scenario, according to your world-model, wherein Alzheimer's is cured in the next 10 years\". It might say \"Those scientists in Mexico, using their Self-Unaware AI Oracle, learn the following treatment approach...\".</p>\n<p>Now, recall that with the classic AI Oracle, we worry about manipulative answers. In this particular case, we can be sure that the system itself is not inherently manipulative (see below), <em>but</em> we would still be in trouble if the Self-Unaware AI Oracle in Mexico <em>believes</em> that the Self-Unaware AI Oracle in Mexico would be manipulative. This failure mode seems extremely unlikely. As I mentioned a couple paragraphs ago, its third-person model of itself will be an imperfect approximation to the real thing, but the belief that it would be <em>manipulative</em> would be a bizarrely specific modeling error that came out of nowhere!</p>\n<p>Still, out of an abundance of caution, the query should probably be something like: \"Please output the least improbable scenario, according to your world-model, wherein a cure for Alzheimer's is invented <em>by a group with no access to any AI oracles</em>!\" Then we avoid the self-modeling issues altogether. Indeed, it should be possible to use a predictive world model to do counterfactual reasoning about what might happen in a world in which there are no AIs whatsoever.</p>\n<h1>Self-unaware AIs are safe to use</h1>\n<p>As far as I can tell, a self-unaware system should be about as safe as we could possibly hope for. Manipulation, deception, self-preservation, reproduction, and all the other <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Basic_AI_drives\">Omohundro goals</a> seem to be completely out of the question for a system with no knowledge that it is a calculation physically instantiated in the universe!</p>\n<p>I'm trying hard to think of failure modes here. OK, there's a potential for the system to describe possible futures while leaving out critical details. So, let's say we ask for the least improbable scenario wherein \"cancer is cured\", and the system describes the events leading up to a plague that wipes out humanity. OK, well then we ask for the <em>second</em> least improbable scenario, and this one sounds pretty good! But after we inject the chemical into the first test patient, it turns out that this one is <em>also</em> a plague that wipes out humanity, but the AI's model output was unfortunately treating that fact as an irrelevant detail and neglecting to mention it. Are we back to Goodhart's law and the <a href=\"https://www.obormot.net/arbital/page/nearest_unblocked.html\">\"nearest unblocked strategy\" problem</a>? Sort of, but I don't think it's particularly worrisome version. Again, we're asking the system to guess what normal humans might plausibly do in the natural course of events (in the absence of AI), and we can look at the probabilities assigned to the scenarios to make sure they're not outlandishly small. We can also program the system to answer our follow-up questions, like \"according to your models, if someone rolls out this therapy, what is the likely impact on lifespan? what is the likely impact on the environment? how does it work on the cellular level?\" and so on. And we can trust that, while the answers may be imperfect, they will not be manipulative. I'm really not seeing any cause for concern here, or elsewhere, although I'm going to keep thinking about it.</p>\n<h1>Are Self-Unaware AI Oracles competitive with other approaches to AGI?</h1>\n<p>I see two main disadvantages of Self-Unaware AI Oracles, but I think that both are less problematic than they first appear.</p>\n<p>The first disadvantage is that these things are completely incompatible with RL techniques (as far as I can tell), and a lot of people seem to think that RL is the path to superintelligence. Well, I'm not at all convinced that we need RL, or that RL would ultimately even be all that helpful. The alternative path I'm proposing here is self-supervised learning: Given a sequence of bits from the internet, predict the subsequent bits. So there's a <em>massive</em> amount of training data—for example, I heard that <em>100,000 years</em> of video have been uploaded to YouTube! I keep going back to those three examples from the beginning: (1) GPT-2 shows that we can get impressively far on this type of self-supervised learning even with today's technology; (2) Solomonoff induction on the entire internet is the astronomically high ceiling on what's possible; and (3) the human brain—which works primarily on exactly this type of self-supervised learning<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-3\" id=\"fnref-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-3\">[3]</a></sup>—is a nice reference point for how far we might get along this path just by brute-force biomimetic engineering.</p>\n<p>The second disadvantage is that it's still an oracle, needing a human in the loop.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-4\" id=\"fnref-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-4\">[4]</a></sup> But as far as oracles go, it's about as powerful as you could hope for: able to answer more-or-less arbitrary questions, and able to design new technology, as in the cancer example above. In particular, we can take a bootstrapping strategy, where we can ask the safe self-unaware oracle to help us design a safe AGI agent.</p>\n<p>By the same token, despite appearances, Self-Unaware AI Oracles are capable of recursive self-improvement: We just present the query in the third person. (\"This is a Self-Unaware AI Oracle\", we say to it, holding up a giant mirror. \"How might scientists make this type of system better?\") We can even record the system doing a calculation, then pass that video back to itself as an input to improve its self-models. I think this would be a quite safe type of self-improvement, insofar as self-unawareness is (I hope) possible to rigorously verify, and also insofar as we're not worried about manipulative suggestions.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Again, this is intuition-based brainstorming, not rigorous argument, and I'm looking forward to any feedback. For one thing, I think there are probably better and more precise ways to define self-unawareness, but I hope my definition above is close enough to get the idea across. I'll keep thinking about it, and I hope others do too!</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See Jeff Hawkins <em>On Intelligence</em> or Andy Clark <em>Surfing Uncertainty</em>, for example. <a href=\"#fnref-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Correction: I got this example wrong. The hypercomputer chooses a predictive algorithm, and the question is whether the <em>latter</em> is self-unaware. That's not so obvious... <a href=\"#fnref-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-ZEayRgt4nzvZK3dZr-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See references in footnote 1. Of course, the human brain uses both self-supervised learning (predict the next thing you'll see, hear, and feel) and RL (cake is good, death is bad). My feeling is that we can throw out the RL part (or throw out enough of it to allow self-unawareness) and the system will still work pretty well. For example, when Einstein invented relativity, he wasn't doing RL interaction with the real world, but rather searching through generative models, tweaking and recombining the higher-level models and keeping them when they offered a parsimonious and accurate prediction of lower-level models. I think we can write self-unaware code that does that kind of thing. Without a reward signal, we might need to program our own mechanism to direct \"attention\", i.e. to guide which aspects of the world need to be modeled with extra-high accuracy. But again, this seems like something we can just put in manually.

A <u><a href=\"https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CraftAssist-A-Framework-for-Dialogue-enabled-Interactive-Agents-v3.pdf\">companion paper</a></u> presents an initial setup for such an agent.</p><p>The main goal here is to advance natural language understanding, intent inference and instruction following. As a result, there is no formal specification like a reward function -- in their own words, &quot;the ultimate goal of the bot is to be a useful and fun assistant in a wide variety of tasks specified and evaluated by human players&quot;. They chose Minecraft in particular partly because it has a very rich space of <em>tasks</em>, even though the <em>execution</em> of any given task is relatively straightforward. They script many low level policies to automate this execution in order to make learning easier (for example, they have policies to navigate to a location or to build specified structures) and focus the learning challenge on figuring out what the user wants.</p><p>The current version of the bot takes dialogue from the user and uses a neural model to parse it into an <em>action dictionary</em> that unambiguously specifies what the agent should do -- I think this neural model is the main thing to be learned. There are a bunch of details on how the rest of the modules work as well. They have also released three datasets: a semantic parsing dataset that associates instructions with action dictionaries, a house dataset that has trajectories where a human builds a house, and a semantic segmentation dataset that labels various parts of houses.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I&#x27;m really excited to see a project that is very directly aimed at inferring end user intent in a complex environment. This seems like a great direction for the field to move towards. I think Minecraft would also be great as a test bed for the setting in which <em>researchers or engineers</em> (as opposed to end users) are trying to get an agent to do something: we can assume more expertise and knowledge here. Ideally, this would allow us to solve more complex tasks than can be accomplished with natural language from end users. I personally plan to do work with Minecraft along these lines.</p><p>While this project does need to infer intent, it probably won&#x27;t require the sort of pragmatic understanding shown by e.g. <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\">Cooperative IRL</a></u>. Even understanding what the human is literally asking for in Minecraft is currently beyond our capabilities.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=\"https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CraftAssist-A-Framework-for-Dialogue-enabled-Interactive-Agents-v3.pdf\">CraftAssist: A Framework for Dialogue-enabled Interactive Agents</a></u></p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03976\">Ranking-Based Reward Extrapolation without Rankings</a></u> <em>(Daniel S. Brown et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): A while back, these authors released the <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06387\">T-REX paper</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/3e2f43012b07/an-54-boxing-a-finite-horizon-ai-system-to-keep-it-unambitious\">AN #54</a></u>), where they showed that providing ranked sets of trajectories, rather than one single optimal trajectory, lets you learn a more accurate reward that can outperform the demonstrator. This ability to outperform the demonstrator is rooted in the ability to extrapolate predicted reward outside of demonstrated points, and that ability to extrapolate comes from the fact that ranked trajectories provide more information about relative reward values. This paper is a fairly straightforward extension of that one, and asks: can we get similar benefits without requiring humans to actually rank trajectories? The authors argue that they can replicate T-REX&#x27;s ability to outperform the demonstrator by simply learning a behaviorally cloned policy off of a single (potentially sub-optimal) demonstrator, and making that policy gradually worse by adding more noise to it. This model is called D-REX, for Disturbance-based Reward EXtrapolation. They then make an assumption that more noise in the policy corresponds to less reward, and use that as a ranking scheme to throw into the existing T-REX algorithm.</p><p><strong>Cody&#x27;s opinion:</strong> Overall, I think this is potentially a straightforward and clever trick for giving your imitation learner more informative data to learn off of. I have two main questions. First off, I&#x27;d have loved to see D-REX compared directly to T-REX, to get a sense of how much you lose from this approximate ranking strategy rather than a more ground truth one. And, secondly, I&#x27;d have appreciated a bit more justification of their assumption that noisier actions will consistently lead to a worse policy, in ways that capture reward information. This doesn&#x27;t seem obviously untrue to me, I&#x27;d just love some more intuition on why we can get additional information about underlying reward just by adding noise.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11108\">SQIL: Imitation Learning via Regularized Behavioral Cloning</a></u> <em>(Siddharth Reddy et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): Behavioral Cloning is one of the most direct forms of imitation learning: it learns to predict the action the expert would have taken in a given state of the world. A clear weakness of the approach is that, if cloning models are only trained on pairs of (state, expert action) drawn from the expert&#x27;s policy distribution, that means the model is underconstrained and thus likely to have high error on states that would have been unseen or just highly unlikely to be visited by the expert. This weakness means that errors within behavioral cloning systems can compound: if the system takes an incorrect action that leads it to a state it never saw the expert in, it will have a difficult time knowing what to do there.</p><p>The main contribution of this paper is to suggest a fix for this weakness, by learning a Q function to represent expert behavior, and by penalizing the model for being in states where its temporal difference error on the Q function (otherwise known as the Bellman error) is high. Intuitively, the hope is that this term, which can also be seen as a reward for being in states the expert has seen more frequently (equivalently, states where the model had more training experience) will propagate outward, and give the model a loss surface that pulls it back into states where its predictions are more confident.</p><p><strong>Cody&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I still have a personal sense that Behavioral Cloning is too brittle of a conceptual frame to build really robust imitative agents with, but this seems like a clever and relatively clean way to build in a bias towards high-confidence states. I find myself wondering if the same general idea of penalizing being in high-model-error states could be more broadly applied as a sort of regularizer in other off-policy settings where exploration can be risky.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into\">Research Agenda v0.9: Synthesising a human&#x27;s preferences into a utility function</a></u> <em>(Stuart Armstrong)</em>: One approach to AI alignment involves learning a specification of human values that can then be optimized. This agenda proposes that we learn an adequate representation of values (i.e. <em>not</em> <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN/what-is-ambitious-value-learning\">ambitious value learning</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a></u>)). We first obtain partial preferences and associated weights from human mental models whose symbols have been adequately grounded. Calling these &quot;preferences&quot; is a normative assumption to avoid an <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ANupXf8XfZo2EJxGv/humans-can-be-assigned-any-values-whatsoever\">impossibility result in value learning</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a></u>): the hope is that the AI could correct for incorrect human beliefs. The preferences are then extended to all possible states, and are normalized so that they are comparable to each other, and then synthesized into a utility function that the AI can optimize.</p><p>The partial preferences are divided into a few categories: individual preferences, preferences about the rest of the world, and meta-preferences, some of which can be about the synthesis procedure itself. The hope is that further categories of preferences would be handled by the synthesis procedure; these categories are the ones that seem most important to get right, or couldn&#x27;t be obtained any other way.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> See the next entry.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://alignmentforum.org/posts/GHNokcgERpLJwJnLW/some-comments-on-stuart-armstrong-s-research-agenda-v0-9?_ga=2.216737811.48011077.1562349688-943761554.1470242885\">Some Comments on Stuart Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Research Agenda v0.9&quot;</a></u> <em>(Charlie Steiner)</em>: This post makes two main critiques of the research agenda in the previous entry. First, the research agenda involves a lot of human-designed features and modules, but <u><a href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\">The Bitter Lesson</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/efed27be268a/alignment-newsletter-49\">AN #49</a></u>) is that machine learning tends to shine with highly abstract large models that can make use of a lot of compute. Second, the symbol grounding part of the agenda requires the AI system to develop representations of the world that match the representations that humans use, and we have no idea how to do that, or even what it would mean to &quot;match human representations&quot; when the AI is more intelligent than humans. The post also includes some more specific comments that I&#x27;m not summarizing.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I agree with both of these critiques, especially the one about the bitter lesson. It seems like Stuart&#x27;s approach imposes a particular structure or algorithm for how to synthesize the utility function; I am generally skeptical of such approaches. Also, as you might already know, I think it is neither necessary nor sufficient for AI alignment to find a utility function or &quot;goal&quot; that the AI can safely optimize. Since this promises to be a very difficult enterprise (Section 0.2 notes that it aims to &quot;solve at least 5 major open problems in philosophy, to a level rigorous enough that we can specify them in code&quot;), I prefer to look into other approaches that seem more tractable.</p><p>I do think that the problems that motivate the various aspects of the agenda are important and useful to think about, and I am happy that they have all been put into this single post. I also like the fact that the research agenda is directly aiming for a full solution to AI alignment.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/kahBLu32sZAuAZbER/irl-in-general-environments\">IRL in General Environments</a></u> <em>(Michael Cohen)</em></p><h3><strong>Forecasting</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K686EFdXysfRBdob2/musings-on-cumulative-cultural-evolution-and-ai\">Musings on Cumulative Cultural Evolution and AI</a></u> <em>(calebo)</em>: A <u><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006504&type=printable\">recent paper</a></u> develops a conceptual model that retrodicts human social learning. They assume that asocial learning allows you adapt to the current environment, while social learning allows you to copy the adaptations that other agents have learned. Both can be increased by making larger brains, at the cost of increased resource requirements. What conditions lead to very good social learning?</p><p>First, we need high transmission fidelity, so that social learning is effective. Second, we need some asocial learning, in order to bootstrap -- mimicking doesn&#x27;t help if the people you&#x27;re mimicking haven&#x27;t learned anything in the first place. Third, to incentivize larger brains, the environment needs to be rich enough that additional knowledge is actually useful. Finally, we need low <em>reproductive skew</em>, that is, individuals that are more adapted to the environment should have only a slight advantage over those who are less adapted. (High reproductive skew would select too strongly for high asocial learning.) This predicts pair bonding rather than a polygynous mating structure.</p><p>This story cuts against the arguments in <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AJtfNyBsum6ZzWxKR/will-ai-see-sudden-progress\">Will AI See Sudden Progress?</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/\">Takeoff speeds</a></u>: it seems like evolution &quot;stumbled upon&quot; high asocial and social learning and got a discontinuity in reproductive fitness of species. We should potentially also expect discontinuities in AI development.</p><p>We can also forecast the future of AI based on this story. Perhaps we need to be watching for the perfect combination of asocial and social learning techniques for AI, and once these components are in place, AI intelligence will develop very quickly and autonomously.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> As the post notes, it is important to remember that this is one of many plausible accounts for human success, but I find it reasonably compelling. It moves me closer to the camp of &quot;there will likely be discontinuities in AI development&quot;, but not by much.</p><p>I&#x27;m more interested in what predictions about AI development we can make based on this model. I actually don&#x27;t think that this suggests that AI development will need both social and asocial learning: it seems to me that in this model, the need for social learning arises because of the constraints on brain size and the limited lifetimes. Neither of these constraints apply to AI -- costs grow linearly with &quot;brain size&quot; (model capacity, maybe also training time) as opposed to superlinearly for human brains, and the AI need not age and die. So, with AI I expect that it would be better to optimize just for asocial learning, since you don&#x27;t need to mimic the transmission across lifetimes that was needed for humans.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2019/07/11/the-ai-timelines-scam/\">The AI Timelines Scam</a></u> <em>(Jessica Taylor)</em>: This post argues that AI researchers and AI organizations have an incentive to predict that AGI will come soon, since that leads to more funding, and so we should expect timeline estimates to be systematically too short. Besides the conceptual argument, we can also see this in the field&#x27;s response to critics: both historically and now, criticism is often met with counterarguments based on &quot;style&quot; rather than engaging with the technical meat of the criticism.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I agree with the conceptual argument, and I think it does hold in practice, quite strongly. I don&#x27;t really agree that the field&#x27;s response to critics implies that they are biased towards short timelines -- see <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KnQs55tjxWopCzKsk/the-ai-timelines-scam#LjaBHuCcnfqjBcqJa\">these</a></u> <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KnQs55tjxWopCzKsk/the-ai-timelines-scam#JaPQwejnFP95Q8nWk\">comments</a></u>. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m going to do exactly what this post critiques, and say that I put significant probability on short timelines, but not explain my reasons (because they&#x27;re complicated and I don&#x27;t think I can convey them, and certainly can&#x27;t convey them in a small number of words).</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FoJSa8mgLPT83g9e8/jeff-hawkins-on-neuromorphic-agi-within-20-years\">Jeff Hawkins on neuromorphic AGI within 20 years</a></u> <em>(steve2152)</em></p><h1><strong>AI strategy and policy</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vnnmNYwi7QbJPstsz/how-europe-might-matter-for-ai-governance\">How Europe might matter for AI governance</a></u> <em>(Stefan Torges)</em></p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02544\">Large Scale Adversarial Representation Learning</a></u> <em>(Jeff Donahue et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): The BigGAN paper, published last September, used a much larger model (and a handful of optimization tricks to facilitate training it) to achieve a huge leap forward in the quality of generated images. However, it was unclear from the earlier paper whether this improvement in generation quality would also be tied to an increase in the model&#x27;s usefulness as a source of unsupervised semantic representations of images. This paper set out to answer that question by taking an existing technique for learning representations with GANs - called BiGAN - and combining it with the BigGan architecture, which hadn&#x27;t been available when BiGAN was originally published. BiGAN, short for Bidirectional GAN, works by learning both a latent space to image transformation, and also an image to latent space encoder, and then enforcing that pairs of (latent, image) from these two distributions be indistinguishable from one another. They evaluated the quality of learned representations by measuring the performance of a linear model trained using the encoder&#x27;s learned latent vectors as input, and did find it to be the case that a BiGAN trained with a BigGAN architecture performs better than one trained with a smaller architecture.</p><p><strong>Cody&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I really liked this paper; it was cleanly written, conceptually straightforward, and did a generally useful scientific service of checking whether an advance in one area might change our beliefs about a previous result. I particularly enjoyed looking at the &quot;reconstructed&quot; images they got by running their encoder and then generator: more so than anything I recall seeing from a VAE pixel-based reconstructor, this model seems to be treating images as valid reconstructions of one another if they&#x27;re of the same class (i.e. two pizzas) even if the colors and low level detail are different. This makes reasonable sense if you think that those two pizzas are probably nearby in latent space, and so each is a plausible reconstruction of each other&#x27;s latent space encoding, but it&#x27;s still cool to see concretely borne out.</p><h1><strong>News</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/researcher-positions/\">Join our rapidly growing research teams</a></u> <em>(Tanya Singh)</em>: The Future of Humanity Institute is hiring researchers across a wide range of topics, including AI safety and strategy.

The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether eating a small amount of chocolate to counteract fatigue in the early evening affects my sleep, and if so, how.  I could easily imagine the effect on sleep being either beneficial (counteract the pattern of fatigue and anxiety that makes it hard to sleep) or harmful (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobromine\">theobromine</a> might keep me awake).</p>\n<p>Because I'd rather not add the fat and sugar that comes with chocolate to my diet, the effect on sleep needs to be appreciable for it to be worthwhile.  I have fairly arbitrarily decided that the chocolate is worth it iff it causes me to fall asleep at least 15 minutes earlier than I otherwise would.</p>\n<h1>Experimental Protocol</h1>\n<p>Every work day evening when I go directly home from work and do not have a social event planned, I will get home, make any necessary adjustments to the air conditioning (temperature affects my sleep a lot, and I want to make sure I don't accidentally bias the results by setting the AC differently depending on whether I have chocolate), and then with probability 1/2 (decided by a coin flip or die roll) eat a square of dark chocolate.</p>\n<p>I will use a spreadsheet to track which nights I did and did not eat a square of chocolate, and I will use sleep data from a <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/blaze/blaze-101\">Fitbit Blaze smartwatch</a> to record what time I fall asleep each night.  The Blaze uses heart rate and movement data to decide what time I fall asleep (I don't need to actively tell it when I go to bed).  In my experience, the time it says I fell asleep generally matches my subjective memory of when I fell asleep (not when I went to bed).</p>\n<h1>Statistical Analysis</h1>\n<p>I care about the magnitude of the effect, not just the direction, and my goal is to make the correct decision rather than to get published, so testing whether the observed effect is statistically significantly different from 0 is not very useful.  While it would be a mistake to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/L32LHWzy9FzSDazEg/motivated-stopping-and-motivated-continuation\">keep going until I get the result I want</a>, if the results are close (in either direction), it will be worth gathering more data.</p>\n<p>Because I have arbitrarily picked an absolute effect size of -15 minutes (I fall asleep 15 minutes sooner than I otherwise would), I will be focusing on determining which side of that cut-off the effect is.  To do so, I plan on analyzing the data as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run the experiment until I have used up one bag of chocolate (15 individually-wrapped squares).</li>\n<li>Calculate the standard error of the difference of sample means (I am not assuming equal variance in the two samples).</li>\n<li>If the observed effect is at least one standard error away from the -15 minute cut-off (my sleep is inconsistent enough that I expect this condition probably won't be met at this point), stop the experiment.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, keep going until either the stop condition from step 3 is met or the standard error is less than 5 minutes.  If I end with a standard error less than 5 minutes and the observed effect is within 5 minutes of -15 minutes, I will consider the experiment inconclusive.</li>\n</ol>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>For the last several years, I&#x27;ve known people who&#x27;ve submitted articles to the EA Forum or LessWrong, and found that the culture on these sites is pretty hostile to the kinds of  views they&#x27;re presenting (different people have different opinions of the patterns of hostility to different views on the EA Forum and LW, respectively). What the particular views are doesn&#x27;t matter, because it&#x27;s been all kinds of views. What&#x27;s common between them is a perception an article they wrote they believe to be quite good was &quot;poorly received&quot; on the site, while still having a positive and significant number of upvotes. Now, none of the articles I&#x27;m thinking of had what I would call a <em>high</em> number of upvotes, but it was enough that at least several people had read the article, and a majority of them had upvoted the post. As a proportion of the people who read the article, it tells us a very significant minority, typically between 30-45%, disagreed with or disliked it enough to downvote it. </p><p>So, they&#x27;re articles which are not <em>very </em>well-received. Unless I&#x27;m missing something, an article having a positive number of upvotes should be interpreted as one&#x27;s article being <em>at least somewhat</em> well-received by the readers. If someone thinks that an article on the EA Forum or LW has received too many downvotes, or not enough upvotes, because there is something wrong with the general culture of the respective membership bases of these sites, that is one argument. Yet that is a different one than the arguments I see typically made by those who complain about the proportion of upvotes:downvotes they receive on the EA Forum or LessWrong. They just say that based on the appearance of not receiving strong, consistent, vocal support for their articles that they would like to have seen, that the reception to their article was overwhelmingly and uniformly negative. This is in spite of the fact they received at least a higher proportion of positive:negative feedback, even if only on the measure of karma. In other words, it&#x27;s my observation a lot of people who complain as if they&#x27;ve gotten uniformly, overwhelmingly, and inappropriately negative feedback on their articles have false impressions of how their articles were received, and are wrong.</p><p>The common tendency I see in articles like this is that there is often a high proportion of comments that disagree with or criticize the OP, and that these comments often receive more upvotes than the OP. So, it seems like what people are really upset about when their articles on the EA Forum or LW receive a merely a lukewarm reception, as opposed to an overwhelmingly negative one, is that, while there are at least a majority of the community who at least weakly supports them, there is a significant minority of the community who is more willing to strongly and vocally disagree with, criticize, or oppose them. </p><p>It seems to me one solution, to move to a better equilibrium of discussion, would be for users who agree with an original article, but are able to make the arguments for its thesis better than the original author, to write their own comments and articles that do so. There is a fear of politics among some rationalists, so that stigmatizes discussions that might appear to heighten tensions between different groups of people within effective altruism, and/or the rationality community. It&#x27;s my impression in these communities there is also a culture of letting an individuals words and ideas stand on their own, and not associating the arguments from just one individual on one side of a debate to everyone on that side of the debate. So, it strikes me as unlikely the vast majority of any effective altruists or LessWrongers would care enough to join an interpersonal/intercernine online disagreement to the point the community at large should have to concern ourselves about whether we should quell it. </p><p>Of course, one of the reasons LW and the EA Forum use karma scores as they do is so for the discourse on these fora to be shaped in a way satisfying to most users, without us all having to get bogged down in endless debates about the state of the discourse itself. At least that is what I&#x27;ve taken the karma systems of LW and the EA Forum in large part to be about, and why I have what I believe is an appropriate level of respect for them. They&#x27;re certainly not everything one should take into account for evaluating the quality of an article on LW or the EA Forum. Yet I don&#x27;t think they should definitely count for little, or even nothing, which is sometimes the reaction I see from EA Forum or LW members who aren&#x27;t satisfied with the proportion and kind of positive feedback their article receives, especially relative to the proportion and kind of negative feedback received.</p><p>These are my impressions as a long-time user of both the EA Forum and LessWrong. I was just wondering what other people&#x27;s thoughts on the subject are; whether they&#x27;re similar to, or different than, mine; and why.</p><br/>",

In theory, as <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"N \\rightarrow \\infty\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.085em;\">N</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">→</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">∞</span></span></span></span></span></span>, the cross-validation metric will be random with roughly zero mean.</p><p>Why the difference? Because cross-validation and Bayesian model comparison answer different questions.</p><h2>Different Questions</h2><p>Compare:</p><ul><li>Cross-validation: how accurately will this model predict future data gathered the same way?</li><li>Bayesian: How likely is this model given the data? Or equivalently, via Bayes&#x27; rule: how well does this model predict the data we&#x27;ve seen?</li></ul><p>So one is asking how well the model can predict future data, while the other is asking how well the model predicted past data. To see the difference, think about the interesting case from the simulation: biased vs unbiased model running on data from an unbiased die. As <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"N \\rightarrow \\infty\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.085em;\">N</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">→</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">∞</span></span></span></span></span></span>, the biased model learns the true (unbiased) frequencies, so the two models will make the same predictions going forward. With the same predictions, cross-validation is indifferent.</p><p>For cross-validation purposes, a model which gave wrong answers early but eventually learned the correct answers is just as good as a model which gave correct answers from the start.</p><p>If all we care about is predicting future data, then we don&#x27;t really care whether a model made correct predictions from the start or took a while to learn. In that case, cross-validation works great (and it&#x27;s certainly much computationally easier than the Bayesian method). On the other hand, if one model made correct predictions from the start and the other took a long time to learn, then that&#x27;s Bayesian evidence in favor of the model which was correct from the start.</p><p>That difference becomes important in cases like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/onCRFFN7rGXTg3jyc/p/QKnbbGDd2LbAPfgBh\">Wolf&#x27;s Dice II</a>, where we wanted to deduce the physical asymmetries of a die. In that case, the fully-general model and our final model both make the same predictions about future rolls once they have enough data. But they differ on predictions about what the world looks like aside from the data itself - for instance, they make different predictions about what we would find if we took out some calipers and actually measured the dimensions of Wolf&#x27;s white die.</p><h2>Prediction vs Understanding</h2><p>Years ago, while working in the lab of a computational biologist, he and I got into an argument about the objective of &quot;understanding&quot;. I argued that, once some data can be predicted, there is nothing else left to understand about it. Whether it&#x27;s being predicted by a detailed physical simulation or a simple abstract model or a neural network is not relevant.</p><p>Today, I no longer believe that.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/onCRFFN7rGXTg3jyc/p/QKnbbGDd2LbAPfgBh\">Wolf&#x27;s Dice II</a> is an excellent counter-example which highlights the problem. If two models always make the same predictions about everything, then sure, there&#x27;s no important difference between them. But don&#x27;t confuse &quot;make the same predictions about everything&quot; with &quot;make the same predictions <em>about the data</em>&quot; or &quot;make the same predictions about future data of this form&quot;. Even if two models eventually come to the exact same conclusion about the outcome distribution from rolls of a particular die, they can still make different predictions about the physical properties of the die itself.</p><p>If two models make different predictions about something out in the world, then it can be useful to evaluate the probabilities of the two models - even if they make the same predictions about future data of the same form as the training data.</p><p>Physical properties of a die are one example, but we can extend this to e.g. generalization problems. If we have models which make similar predictions about future data from the training distribution, but make different predictions more generally, then we can apply Bayesian model comparison to (hopefully) avoid generalization error. Of course, Bayesian model comparison is not a guarantee against generalization problems - even in principle it can only work if there&#x27;s any generalization-relevant evidence in the data at all. But it should work in almost any case where cross-validation is sufficient, and many other cases as well. (I&#x27;m hedging a bit with &quot;almost any&quot;; it is possible for cross-validation to &quot;get lucky&quot; and outperform sometimes, but that should be rare as long as our priors are reasonably accurate.)</p><h2>Conclusion?</h2><p>In summary:</p><ul><li>Cross-validation tells us how well a model will predict future data of the same form as the training data. If that&#x27;s all you need to know, then use cross-validation; it&#x27;s much easier computationally than Bayesian model comparison.</li><li>Bayesian model comparison tells us how well a model predicted past data, and thus the probability of the model given the data. If want to evaluate models which make different predictions about the world even if they converge to similar predictions about future data, then use Bayesian model comparison.</li></ul><p>One final word of caution unrelated to the main point of this post. One practical danger of cross-validation is that it will overfit if we try to compare too many different models. As an extreme example, imagine using one model for every possible bias of a coin - a whole continuum of models. Bayesian model comparison, in that case, would simply yield the posterior distribution of the bias; the maximum-posterior model would likely be overfit (depending on the prior), but the full distribution would be correct. This is an inherent danger of maximization as an epistemic technique: it&#x27;s always an approximation to the posterior, so it will fail whenever the posterior isn&#x27;t dominated by the maximal point.</p>",

If you’re curious and filled with wonder, it will be much easier. Because your mood can be either promote or hamper your learning success, learning how to navigate moods usefully is an important metaskill for skill acquisition. Knowing about the importance of moods is useful for teaching, students or colleagues, in addition to learning.</p><p>Those are the main claims of Gloria Flores’ <em><u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Learn-Navigation-Moods-Acquisition/dp/0692801790\">Learning to Learn and the Navigation of Moods: The Meta-Skill for the Acquisition of Skills</a></u></em>. In this post I’ll summarize the book. I’ve also created an audio for an exercise that she suggests using AWS Polly that you can <u><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/caleb-ontiveros-521724173/learning-how-to-learn-reise-exercise/s-BsEkP\">access here</a></u>.</p><p>What are the components of this meta-skill? </p><ul><li>First, a learner knows about the varieties of different moods and whether they are useful or not. </li><li>Second, a learner knows which judgements give rise to their specific moods. </li><li>Third, a learner knows which moods tend to arise at which learning stage. They know what to watch out for and what to promote.</li><li>Finally, a learner knows how to interact with these judgements to nudge their mood into a different direction. </li></ul><h2>The Varieties of Moods</h2><p>A quick definition, what are moods? In Flores’ words: </p><blockquote>“Moods are like the coloring of how we encounter the world around us, what it says to us or how it appears to us” (21-22)</blockquote><p>I think of moods as been made up of two components:</p><ul><li>dispositional: <em>dispositions</em> to act or think in a particular way</li><li>experiential: a mood has an experiential quality, one is disposed to feeling a particular way in addition to acting or thinking a particular way</li></ul><p>If someone is in a blue mood, they may skip a party they would have otherwise gone to and enjoyed. If someone is annoyed, they will be more likely to lash out at others. If someone is feeling joyous, they’ll be far less likely to lash out and more likely to play with and help others. Each of these moods have a particular experiential quality to them, there’s something it’s like to have a blue, annoyed, or joyous mood.</p><p>Flores provides a number of different moods that may productively impact our learning. Here are a list of them with associated thoughts and feelings:</p><ul><li>Wonder</li><ul><li>I don’t know what’s going on and that’s exciting! I want to know!</li></ul><li>Perplexity</li><ul><li>I am totally confused, but I’ve got to know what’s going on. I’m going to persevere until I get to the bottom of this.</li></ul><li>Serenity</li><ul><li>I accept the past and present and am open to the future. I’ve been right and made mistakes in the past, I will be right and make mistakes in the future. </li></ul><li>Patience</li><ul><li>I accept that sometimes things move slowly. I am plodding along, perhaps happily, calmly, or with resolve.</li></ul><li>Ambition</li><ul><li>I want to win. I will experience setbacks as challenges to master, not evidence of what is or isn’t possible.</li></ul><li>Resolve</li><ul><li>I see opportunities here and I’m committed to taking action right now</li></ul><li>Confidence</li><ul><li>I have had successful results in this area. I will have more successful results in the future. </li></ul><li>Trust</li><ul><li>I am learning from people who I trust. Because I have confidence in them and don’t feel judged, I feel likely to succeed. (29)</li></ul></ul><p>Some of these moods may hamper our learning progress. For example, we can be overconfident and over trusting or too patient. Perhaps there are some things we just shouldn’t be serene about. However, by and large, these moods are very useful for learning.</p><p>On the unproductive side of things we have these moods:</p><ul><li>Confusion</li><ul><li>I don’t know what’s going on and I don’t like it. This is bad. I want to escape this situation!</li></ul><li>Resignation</li><ul><li>I am too x to learn this. I will ever be able to do this, no matter how hard I try, so what’s the point?</li></ul><li>Frustration</li><ul><li>I’ve tried to do this before but failed. I should have succeeded already. I’m not moving as efficiently as I should. </li></ul><li>Arrogance </li><ul><li>There is nothing new for me to learn here. This is beneath me. </li></ul><li>Impatience</li><ul><li>There is nothing new for me to learn here. This is a waste of my time.</li></ul><li>Boredom</li><ul><li>There is nothing of value for me here. I am not interested in anything here.</li></ul><li>Anxiety</li><ul><li>I don’t know how to do this. I will make mistakes and mistakes are bad. I want to quit because that would be better than making a mistake.</li></ul><li>Overwhelm</li><ul><li>There is too much going on! There is so much I don’t know or can’t do. </li></ul><li>Lack of confidence</li><ul><li>I am not competent enough to learn this. I have always been bad at <em>x</em>. I’m not good enough to be here. Everyone else is so much better than I am.</li></ul><li>Distrust</li><ul><li>I don’t trust that the people I’m learning from will be helpful. This process may work for some people, but I don’t think it will work for me. (25)</li></ul></ul><p>Sometimes, these moods may be appropriate for our circumstances: for example, boredom and distrust may sometimes be useful. However, typically these moods hold us back. </p><p>These moods are likely familiar to you. I’ve experienced all of them. </p><h2>The Causes of Moods</h2><p>Flores has a similar model of moods as CBT types do for emotions. Moods are produced by particular judgements and events in the world (Flores calls what I call judgements “assessments”, I prefer the term “judgement”). Judgements are evaluative and reference norms, values, and our desires. Such as: I like this. This is good. This is bad. This is right/wrong. This is appropriate/inappropriate. These judgments are made automatically and habitually. </p><p>While attempting to solve a bug while working on a web application, one may feel frustrated. One may think, “I should have solved this bug already” or “why am I even having a bug like this while writing a simple program” or “If I were a 10x engineer I wouldn’t be experiencing this bug.” These judgements and events may bring about (or may reflect) a rather frustrated mood. In this way events and moods can interact and bring about a negative feedback loop.</p><p>Alternatively, after solving a bug, one may feel elated and confident. One may think, “Yes, I solved this hard bug fast, I’m great” or “I am glad I fixed that in the time I did” or “I am a 10x engineer give me more bugs.” This may bring out a general mood of confidence in addition to a <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qwdupkFd6kmeZHYXy/build-small-skills-in-the-right-order\">success spirals</a></u>.</p><p>As with CBT, one of the first steps with navigating moods while learning is observing moods. Take our programmer. How do they feel when they encounter a bug? How do they feel when they solve one? What thoughts surround these events? What judgments do these thoughts express, if any?</p><p>The causes of many unproductive moods can be tied to judgements concerning the following:</p><ul><li>Competence</li><ul><li>It is important to know the right answer and make sure that others know that you know.</li><li>If you don’t know what to do, you are incompetent. Which is, just to be clear, bad. </li><li>Making mistakes are bad.</li></ul><li>Efficiency</li><ul><li>Learning has to happen fast.</li><li>One must get thing right right away.</li><li>One must not waste time.</li></ul><li>Independence</li><ul><li>One mustn&#x27;t depend on others.</li><li>If one doesn’t know something, one should figure it out on one’s own.</li><li>Don’t ask for help.</li></ul><li>Usefulness</li><ul><li>One must contribute useful work right away.</li><li>If one isn’t useful, one won’t be accepted.</li><li>If one isn’t useful, one should resign. </li></ul><li>Preparation</li><ul><li>One must be prepared at all times.</li><li>Before you try something, you must be certain that it will work.</li><li>If one doesn’t know what to do, it’s better to do nothing. (14-15)</li></ul></ul><p>These judgements and the associated thought patterns can get in the way of learning. They are behind many of the unproductive moods above.</p><h2>Moods During the Learning Lifecycle</h2><p>Flores discusses Staurt Dreyfus and Hubert Dreyfus’s (Yes, that Dreyfus) learning model and maps different moods to the different stages. I found this useful, since the stages are largely recognizable and the relevant moods map nicely enough to my experience and others. Nonetheless, this learning model is too low resolution for me and I’d like to see something more detailed developed. </p><p>According to the Dreyfus brothers there are six stages of learning:</p><ul><li>Beginner</li><ul><li>The beginner wants to learn something new. They are starting out and don’t know what to do.</li><li>Next level: The beginner must gain experience. They must cultivate moods that are conducive to the discomfort they will experience as they continue to practice. Confidence and trust in the learning process are important. </li></ul><li>Advanced Beginner</li><ul><li>The advanced beginner has been practicing for a bit and know the basic moves. They are comfortable and at risk of becoming too comfortable</li><li>Next level: an advanced beginner must become more involved, they must take more risks. There is a risk of becoming bored or relying on shortcuts here and not advancing.</li></ul><li>Competent</li><ul><li>The competent are responsible for producing results, but they don’t always know what to do or how to do it. It can be overwhelming.</li><li>Next level: The Dreyfus brothers state that the learner must experience both success and failure. Ambition and resolve are important moods to experience here so that the failure can be experienced as part of the process as opposed to reasons for quitting. </li></ul><li>Proficient</li><ul><li>The proficient generally knows what needs to get done, but I don’t always know how to do it. </li><li>Next level: A proficient person needs more experience before they can react automatically. They must be motivated in order to become an expert.</li></ul><li>Expert</li><ul><li>The expert generally knows what needs to get done and how to do it. In teamwork situations, this person is a leader. </li><li>Next level: An expert must be willing to override the perspective that as an expert performer they intuitively experience. They need to violate norms and risk regression in performance for the sake of trying new, less obvious approaches. Arrogance is a risk here. </li></ul><li>Master</li><ul><li>The master is able to perform intuitively in their domain of expertise. A master is committed to do more and sees possibilities for innovation and new contributions to their field. (52-53)</li></ul></ul><p>The trajectory of these categories seem right to me and though it doesn’t exactly cut reality at the joints, it’s a workable model.</p><p>Flores helpfully maps out what moods are associated with what stage here:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19415529/61593453-86684280-ab94-11e9-804e-c39b5e45c99c.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>We can run through this life cycle with our programmer. </p><p><strong>Beginner</strong>: Our programmer begins their journey at a bootcamp...</p><ul><li><strong>Productive</strong>: starts with wonder, confidence, and trusts the learning process (but moves on if things aren’t useful).</li><li><strong>Unproductive</strong>: bugs are evidence that one will never become a programmer, insecure, won’t ask for help, confusion seems insurmountable.</li></ul><p><strong>Advanced beginner</strong>: Our programmer has managed to last in the bootcamp for a month or two and may or may not be having a lot of fun</p><ul><li><strong>Productive</strong>: Our programmer is happy to have made it so far. They’re committed to finishing, confident that they can finish, and believe that they’re being adequately prepared to get a job after the bootcamp.</li><li><strong>Unproductive</strong>: The tests are too easy. The bootcamp staff doesn’t seem that useful though and our programmer is becoming a bit too disagreeable. They don’t know if they’re being taught the right stuff for the job. They pass the unit tests, but don’t dive deeper. </li></ul><p><strong>Competent</strong>: Our programmer lands their first job...</p><ul><li><strong>Productive</strong>: The responsibility feels good. There are so many new things to learn and many of them quite interesting. It’s sometimes difficult to understand what’s going on the first time something is explained, but that’s ok. The team is filled with strong engineers who could be useful resources -- at least their code will be useful to read.</li><li><strong>Unproductive</strong>: The responsibility feels overwhelming. There are too many new things and many of them are completely mysterious. It’s difficult to understand what’s going on the first time and that is really disheartening -- especially after performing so well at the bootcamp. Your teammates are good, but some of them come from fancy schools and actually studied something relevant at college which makes our programmer feel out of place.</li></ul><p><strong>Proficient</strong>: Our programmer is plodding along at the job, squashing bugs and shipping features. Sometimes people ask them for help!</p><ul><li><strong>Productive</strong>: Our programmer is committed to continuing to improve. They’re not disheartened by the fact that there’s so much to learn. They feel comfortable not knowing the ins and outs of many libraries.  They occasionally make mistakes, but that’s expected.</li><li><strong>Unproductive</strong>: Our programmer is impatient. They feel like they should know more by now. They are frustrated when they encounter things they don’t know or make mistakes.</li></ul><p><strong>Expert</strong>: Our programmer has become a lead engineer -- they are manage others, play a crucial role in design decisions, but still manage to program!</p><ul><li><strong>Productive</strong>: Our programmer is excited and committed into becoming a master. They are able to learn from masters around them. They lead others with patience and instill trust. </li><li><strong>Unproductive</strong>: Our programmer is often impatient when leading others. They alternate between arrogance and insecurity in the presence of masters, both hinder moving forward. </li></ul><p><strong>Master</strong>: Our programmer may or may not be the mythical beast known as a 10x engineer, either way, they’ve mastered their craft.</p><ul><li><strong>Productive</strong>: Wonder helps our programmer catch important insights. It keeps boredom at bay. The inevitable decline in skills is accepted. Perpetual ambition helps the master further their craft.</li><li><strong>Unproductive</strong>: Arrogance occasionally causes our programmer to miss out on important insights. Boredom creeps in. Decline in skills causes resignation. The sense that one has made it blinds the master from moving even further. </li></ul><p>Again, this system is hardly gospel. Many of these stages manage similar moods. Ambition and wonder are useful for nearly all of them. But there are useful and practical upshots. For example:</p><ul><li>At the initial learning stages, confidence and trust in the learning process are necessary.</li><li>Boredom can hinder learning as soon as one becomes good enough at a given thing. This pattern appears at various stages, such as at the advanced beginner and expert stage.</li><li>As one becomes better, there will be periods where one is more susceptible to arrogance and frustration (“I should have solved this already!”).</li><li>As one becomes better, the cost of failure sometimes seems to loom larger.</li><li>Cultivating wonder and ambition have seriously large rewards.</li><li>Though ambition is nearly always useful, it can become unproductive when paired with insecurity.</li><li>Observing one’s moods and knowing how to move in and out of them is likely useful. A concrete way I’ve applied this insight is by adding a section to track my mood in between <u><a href=\"https://www.ultraworking.com/cycles\">work cycles.</a></u></li></ul><h2>Navigating Moods</h2><p>There are a plethora of techniques for navigating moods. From CBT, mindfulness, focusing, and many more. I’ll summarize a specific exercise that Flores recommends and uses during her workshops. I’ve created an audio version of this exercise with Polly that you can listen to <u><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/caleb-ontiveros-521724173/learning-how-to-learn-reise-exercise/s-BsEkP\">here</a></u>.</p><p>The exercise is as follows:</p><ol><li>Reflect on one’s learning objective</li><li>Identify and explore the unproductive mood</li><li>Identify moods that would be more conducive to reaching your learning objectives</li><li>Speculate about what action you could take to shift the unproductive moods into moods that will be more conducive to your learning</li><li>Take action (32-36)</li></ol><p>We can call this REISA: reflect, explore, identify, speculate, action</p><p>First <em>reflect</em>, ask questions like the following:</p><ul><li>What future are you committed to bringing about? </li><li>Why are you learning this in the first place? </li><li>If you follow through, what would you be able to do that you can’t now?</li></ul><p>The key idea is to be explicit about why you are doing what you are doing.</p><p>Then <em>explore</em> the unproductive mood. You can do this mindfully in a nonconceptual way and/or do this in an explicit way by uncovering what judgements and events have brought about the mood. You can ask:</p><ul><li>What mood am I in? Can I conceptualize it? Is it one of the above moods?</li><li>What judgements are you making about yourself in this situation?</li><li>What kind of expectations or normative claims gives rise to these judgements?</li><li>Are these expectations or normative claims relevant? Do they help?</li></ul><p>For example, you may note that the judgement is: “I am incompetent.” Is this judgement true? What gave rise to it? It seems very similar to a <u><a href=\"http://www.pacwrc.pitt.edu/curriculum/313_MngngImpctTrmtcStrssChldWlfrPrfssnl/hndts/HO15_ThnkngAbtThnkng.pdf\">cognitive distortion</a></u>. Likely, you’ll find that the judgement is not well grounded and not helpful. </p><p>Next <em>identify </em>what mood may be conducive for learning. If you’re feeling insecure, confidence would be a natural pairing. If you’re feeling resigned, ambition would be useful. Consider what kind of judgements one makes in the opposing mood. Consider whether there are quick actions that one can take to move into the productive mood. </p><p>Often useful actions will reveal themselves quickly. If one is say playing world of warcraft with a team and one is feeling resigned (because you’re holding back the team) you may find, while reflecting, that you are not asking for help. You are not asking for help because you judge that you must appear competent to your teammates -- and a competent person never asks for help. This judgement is off base. The salient action is simply ask for help. More specifically, you may ask for help at the next available opportunity. </p><p>Occasionally quick actions like the above will not be available. Merely considering the judgements associated with productive moods can only do so much. What one wants to do is create a system such that one can identify as the sort of person who is confident and ambitious. There are ways to do this, not discussed here. Instead, come up with a concerted plan to move into that mood.</p><p>Finally, take action. </p><p>The rest of Flores’ book is full of case studies from workshops that she has run. In these workshops, professionals would learn how to play WoW together. There are fruitful discussions of how real participants fell into unproductive moods and how they moved out of those moods. I’d recommend leafing through them if you’d like stories to grok the above content.</p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> moods are important for learning. Different moods appear at different stages of the learning process. It’s important to recognize the patterns in one’s moods and be able to navigate through them well. There are a variety of ways to do this.</p>",

In other words, you consider it twice as likely that B is true than that B is false. If you were to sort all possible worlds into piles based on whether B is true, there would be twice as many where it&#x27;s true than not.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/smA8nk3.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>Then you make an observation O, which you estimate to have had <em>different</em> probabilities depending on whether B is true. In fact:</p><ul><li>If B is true, then O had a 1/8 chance of occurring.</li><li>If B is false, then O had a 3/4 chance of occurring.</li></ul><p>In other words:</p><ul><li>O occurs in 1/8 of the worlds where B is true.</li><li>O occurs in 3/4 of the worlds where B is false.</li></ul><p>We know you&#x27;re in a world where O occurred — you just saw it happen! So let&#x27;s go ahead and fade out all the worlds where O didn&#x27;t occur, since we know you&#x27;re not in one of them. This will slash the &quot;B is true&quot; pile of worlds down to 1/8 of its original size and the &quot;B is false&quot; pile of worlds down to 3/4 of its original size.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VYaSTIF.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>Why did I write <strong>Evidence: 1:6 </strong>at the top? Let&#x27;s ignore that for a second. For now, it&#x27;s safe to throw away the faded-out worlds, because, again, we now know they aren&#x27;t true.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fm50UfN.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>I&#x27;m going to make a bold claim: having made observation O, you have <em>no choice</em> but to re-asses your belief B as having <strong>1:3</strong> <strong>odds </strong>(three times as likely to be false than true).</p><p>How can I say such a thing? Well, initially you assigned it <strong>2:1 odds</strong>, meaning that you thought there were twice as many possible worlds where it was true than where it was false. Having made observation O, you must eliminate all the worlds where O doesn&#x27;t happen. As for the other worlds, if you considered them possible before, and O doesn&#x27;t contradict them, then you should still consider them possible now. So there is no wiggle room: an observation tells you exactly which worlds to keep and which to throw away, and therefore determines how the ratio of worlds changes — or, how the odds change.</p><p><strong>What about &quot;Evidence: 1:6&quot;?</strong></p><p>Well, first notice that it doesn&#x27;t really matter how many worlds you&#x27;re considering total — what matters is the <em>ratio</em> of worlds in one pile to the other. We can write <strong>2:1 odds</strong> as the <strong>fraction </strong><span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal;

I&#x27;m happy to oblige!</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Mahendra has been found dead in his home, killed by a gunshot wound. Police want to know: was this a suicide or a homicide?</p><p>The first step is to establish your prior; in other words, what odds [homicide : suicide] do you assign this case right off the bat?</p><p>Well, according to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000510/gun-suicide-homicide-comparison\">Vox</a>, about 40% of gun-related deaths are homicides and 60% are suicides. The number has varied a bit throughout the years, but let&#x27;s go ahead and use this figure.  A 40%/60% chance equates to <strong>2:3 odds </strong>— for every two homicides by gun, there are three suicides by gun. This is called the <em>base rate</em>, and it will serve as our prior odds.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5o848Gb.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>It&#x27;s worth repeating that what you see above represents the fact that, if you sorted all possible worlds into piles based on Mahendra&#x27;s cause of death, you would see three in the &quot;suicide&quot; pile for every two in the &quot;homicide&quot; pile. (It&#x27;s okay if there are other modes of death under consideration too, such as &quot;accident&quot; — the same logic would still apply! For simplicity, I&#x27;ll just use these two.)</p><p>After a bit of investigation, a some evidence has turned up — a suicide note! Open and shut case, right? </p><p>Think again. Some murderers are smart — they&#x27;ll plant a fake suicide node at the scene of the crime to cover their tracks. I couldn&#x27;t find an exact statistic, but let&#x27;s say about 1/10 murderers think to do this.</p><p>Also, not every suicide has a note. In fact, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_note\">Wikipedia</a> reports that only about 1/4 of suicides include a note.</p><p>In other words:</p><ul><li>If Mahendra&#x27;s death was a homicide, there was a 1/10 chance of finding a note.</li><li>If Mahendra&#x27;s death was a suicide, there was a 1/4 chance of finding a note.</li></ul><p>So now, let&#x27;s follow the same process as before.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JDXQRTI.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><br/><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/825Xc4D.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>Here&#x27;s the math bit:</p><p> <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\frac{2}{3} \\hspace{2px} * \\hspace{2px} \\frac{1/10}{1/4} \\hspace{3px} = \\hspace{2px} \\frac{4}{15}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mfrac\"><span class=\"mjx-box MJXc-stacked\" style=\"width: 0.495em;

explanation less likely — <strong>4:15 odds</strong> compared to <strong>2:3 odds</strong>, or about a 79% chance of suicide compared to a 60% chance initially.</p><p>However, be aware that this isn&#x27;t because most suicides include a note. In fact, most suicides <em>don&#x27;t</em> include a note. The reason it makes suicide more likely is that <em>even fewer homicides</em> include a note. It&#x27;s not true that &quot;most suicides have a note&quot;, but it is true that &quot;suicides are more likely to produce a note than homicides are&quot;. That&#x27;s what makes for proper bayesian evidence.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Epistemic status: fairly confident based on my accumulated experience of debates and disagreements. I wrote this for myself as much as others.</em></p><p>There is a conversational dynamic which I think is extremely common, a failure mode which is all too easy to fall into. Alice and Bob are debating some course of action, e.g. should they do X or Y? Alice thinks that X is very likely to result in terrible consequence R, so they should definitely opt for Y. Bob thinks that Y most definitely will cause horrific result H, so they should definitely do X. </p><p>The distilled conversation goes a bit like this:</p><blockquote>Alice: “We can’t do X! That would lead to R, which is unacceptable.”</blockquote><blockquote>Bob: “I don’t think you get it, Y results in H. You can’t think that we could allow H, do you?”</blockquote><blockquote>Alice: “I feel like you’re not listening, we need to account for R!”</blockquote><blockquote>Bob: “H is definitely a much worse and more real danger than R . . .”</blockquote><p>Alice is afraid of <strong>the rock </strong>(R) and Bob is afraid of <strong>the hard place </strong>(H).</p><p><em>Possible values of X, Y, R, and H:</em></p><blockquote>X = more gun control; Y = less gun control; R = people unable to defend themselves and having their rights taken away; H = increased risk of mass shootings, suicides, and children shooting themselves or others.</blockquote><blockquote>X = raising minimum wage; Y = maintaining minimum wage; R = reduction in number of jobs causing people to be fired; H = people not earning enough from their jobs to subsist.</blockquote><blockquote>X = increase immigration; Y = reduce immigration; R = loss of jobs from local community, erosion of national culture and values, crime committed by migrants; H = humanitarian impact, loss of potential growth of the national economy.</blockquote><p>The above exchange is actually relatively good. Alice and Bob each know what they’re afraid of and have expressed that clearly. Bob even acknowledges Alice’s concern about R, but states that he thinks it’s the lesser danger. They’re at a point where they might be able to usefully <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement\">double crux</a> [1].</p><h1>What goes wrong?</h1><h3>Failure to identify and articulate the fears</h3><p>If Carol has held the position that X is really bad for a long time, or if her position stems from deep System 1 models and frames, then she might struggle to articulate clearly what specifically she’s afraid that X will cause. She might find any attempts by others to clarify to be unsatisfying, and possibly threatening because any incorrect articulation of your fear is often worse than none at all. Dylan might come along and say “you don’t like X because you’re afraid of P, but P won’t happen, so you should be okay with X.” This could be scary to Carol who feels her fears are just being played down so they can be dismissed.</p><p>If both Carol and Dylan are unable to voice what they’re afraid of, the resulting conversation can be Carol and Dylan simply shouting each other about how terrible and evil they think the other’s position is. It becomes one person’s cached store of fear and horror pitted against another’s.</p><h3>Failure to acknowledge the other person’s fear while being desperate for yours to be acknowledged</h3><p>Caught up in her dread of R, Alice can become insistent that Bob acknowledges the extreme danger she sees. Bob failing to do so is scary - perhaps he will advocate for X not realizing the tremendous harm he will cause.</p><p>Alice’s fear of Bob’s position can be overriding. It’s easy for her to feel the conversation can’t proceed until Bob can be made to realize what his position will result in. Indeed, if Bob can’t see the extreme danger of X leading to R, then possibly he can’t be reasoned with at all. Alice will focus all her attention, energy, and emotion on trying to make Bob see reason here.</p><p>This is not conducive to Alice listening to Bob. If Bob isn’t acknowledging R, then it’s easy to see all his words as a perverse and willful refusal to acknowledge R.</p><p>But it’s worse! Bob is in exactly the same state as Alice. He is dreadfully afraid that Alice isn’t worried about H. That she’d gladly and foolishly let H happen to avoid R. Does she just not care about H happening? Will she sacrifice it all so readily? How can he debate with someone with such distorted values? Someone who keeps ignoring his outright statements that Y leads to H!</p><p>You easily get two people yelling their fears at each other, unwilling to listen until the other person acknowledges the badness they have been advocating for. The conversation goes nowhere. Tones start out calm and civil, but rapidly become outraged at the wanton obtuseness of their infuriating interlocutor.</p><h3>Refusal to acknowledge the other person’s fear because Arguments Are Soldiers</h3><blockquote>Politics is the mind-killer. Arguments are soldiers. Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it’s like stabbing your soldiers in the back. If you abide within that pattern, policy debates will also appear one-sided to you—the costs and drawbacks of your favored policy are enemy soldiers, to be attacked by any means necessary. - <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PeSzc9JTBxhaYRp9b/policy-debates-should-not-appear-one-sided\">Policy Debates Should Not Appear One-Sided</a></blockquote><p>Even if you understand what your interlocutor is afraid of <em>and </em>you think there’s something to it, it can be tempting to not acknowledge this. Acknowledging their fear can feel like putting points on the board for them and their position. So you deny them this, not willing to cede any ground. </p><p>This is bad, don’t do it kids. It’s possible that your concern is by far the greater one, but that doesn’t mean their worries aren’t legitimate too. (Or maybe they’re not legitimate, but you can at least show you understand what they are feeling.) The discussion can proceed if you at least acknowledge the fact they have their own fear too.</p><h1>What to do?</h1><p>If you think you might be headed for a Rock vs Hard Place dynamic, I’d suggest trying the following:</p><ol><li>Understand what <em>you </em>are afraid of. What is the outcome you think is at risk of happening?</li><li>Understand what <em>they </em>are afraid of. Know what their fear is.</li><li>Acknowledge their fear. Acknowledge that something they think is very important is at stake in your discussion. [See <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cM8GNMpzfKCkPnd5v/do-you-fear-the-rock-or-the-hard-place#DBEhQQLdigCuLXSYP\">this important comment</a> by Kaj on what this requires.]</li><ol><li>Step 1 is simply to acknowledge the fear. The following steps depend on your own beliefs.</li><li>You might say “I too am afraid of R”, but:</li><ol><li>I <em>have </em>thought about this and believe that X won’t cause are R / can be made to avoid R. </li><li>I think that the danger of R is outweighed by the worse danger of H.</li><li>I think that there are ways to minimize the risk or damage that are good enough.</li></ol><li>You might say “I don’t share your fear of R”, because</li><ol><li>I think you are mistaken that R is in fact bad.</li></ol></ol><li>Don’t fall into Arguments Are Soldiers/Policy Debates are One-Sided traps.</li><li>Realize that the fear most salient to you will derive from your experience, background, situation, and models. Someone might reasonably be afraid in the other direction, and their situation has made that much clearer to them. There’s a chance you can learn from them.</li></ol><p>These steps can be taken somewhat unilaterally. You can acknowledge someone else’s fear without them acknowledging yours. Possibly after you’ve done so, they can relax a little and will be open to acknowledging that you have your own fear.</p><p>If someone is completely unwilling to consider that their fear is misplaced, mistaken, or outweighed, then the conversation may struggle to go anywhere. Best to realize this quickly and find an alternative path forward than end up in circular conversations that only generates fear and hostility.</p><p>That said, I’m hopeful that once people are able to acknowledge their own and other’s fears, productive double cruxing can happen about where the balance lies between the rock and the hard place.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N3igt_-3iD1kBd84NNm2gGwJjxjhhwkd2M4JZf-_Ba7uDtEZyt_QjLnkanVf5zv8OT5ECaolvJSrHFaGMAjOsjo6yu9rKfI36TN9J6KZVktmSaLQZV0NAjZHKOyD-gcpJ6bcraNl\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:530%\" /></figure></p><p><em>Bah!</em></p><h1>Appendix: On a more positive note</h1><p>While I’ve framed this post in terms of fears and potentially negative outcomes, it applies also in cases where people are disagreeing about different policies that would result in different benefits.

A positive difference indicates that the method favors the biased model; a negative difference indicates that the method favors the unbiased model.</p><p>First up, let&#x27;s compare a simulation with a 60-40 biased coin to a simulation with an unbiased coin. Hopefully, our methods will favor the biased model in the biased coin simulation and the unbiased model in the unbiased coin simulation.</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EhB9bKCUtkrJvE1i3_wf5gP_Uu95lH5XC5YwHdX17CjPWp_vDQBIyurrnlPqyUOc6JVdNqt7PFzkr5VifGArG6bb69MgI_CSsH9gRPp1ibc0AUgyxVMKEKx0vJxGPPEl707gx_f3\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:624%\" /></figure></p><p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on in those plots:</p><ul><li>All three methods agree very well. We can&#x27;t see the exact method&#x27;s line at all, because it&#x27;s under the Laplace line. BIC does have a visible bias - it&#x27;s usually a little below exact &amp; Laplace - but the difference is small.</li><li>All three methods generally assign higher evidence to the biased model (line above zero) in the biased coin simulation, and higher evidence to the unbiased model (line below zero) in the unbiased simulation.</li><li>As the number of data points N increases, the evidence in favor of the biased model grows roughly linearly in the biased simulation. But in the unbiased simulation, the evidence in favor of the unbiased model grows much more slowly - logarithmically, in theory. </li></ul><p>Because the BIC is a large-N approximation, ignoring terms which scale with k but not N, we&#x27;d expect BIC to perform worse as we crank up the number of parameters k. Let&#x27;s try that: here&#x27;s another pair of simulations with a 100-sided die (the biased die has 1/200 weight on half the faces and 3/200 on the other half).</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/K9CodLf6B_pCzfJIuUYKFjUeq4OwV1W82vikfd_XM4rtenUxS76Hw_6Zhwbf_wqQE5swd2O6YzoSKFTp8mqHg8ibtccBPSY6wNfyqzlgozOs_nyFMj4VIZNlche6FzReSPbo7Rtx\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:624%\" /></figure></p><p>This time, the BIC has a very large error - hundreds of bits of evidence in favor of an unbiased model, regardless of whether the coin is biased or not. That said, after the first few data points, the BIC&#x27;s error mostly stays constant; recall that the terms ignored by the BIC are all roughly constant with respect to N. Meanwhile, the Laplace approximation agrees wonderfully with the exact calculation. (However, note that the Laplace approximation is absent in the leftmost part of each plot - for these models, it isn&#x27;t well-defined until we&#x27;ve seen at least one of each outcome.)</p><p>Finally, notice that the exact calculation itself gives pretty reasonable probabilities in general, and in particular for small N. When the number of data points is small, it&#x27;s always pretty close to zero, i.e. roughly indifferent between the models. In the high-k simulations, the exact solution gave reliably correct answers after a few hundred data points, and was roughly indifferent before that. Compare that to the BIC, which gave a very confident wrong answer in the biased case and only worked its way back to the correct answer after around 3000 data points. The moral of this story is: precise Bayesian calculations are more important when N is smaller and k is larger. We&#x27;ll come back to that theme later.</p><p>Next post will add cross-validation into the picture, reusing the simulations above.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<div>I recently finished reading <i>The Technology Trap</i>, by Carl Frey. The book attempts to do two things: chronicle the role of technology in economic progress throughout history, and argue that automation in our own era parallels the first seven decades of the industrial revolution, during which the wealth from mechanisation failed to reach most of the population.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I particularly enjoyed the first component, because until now I’ve read much less about the industrial revolution than I should have. That also means that I’m not qualified to evaluate the book’s accuracy. However, it had interesting discussions of:<br /><ul><li>The technological prowess of the Romans, and why they were held back from industrialising both because of their slave-based economy, and also because of an implicit dismissal of the private economy.</li><li>The development of some surprisingly important technologies during the Middle Ages, such as wind- and water-mills, better ways of accessing horsepower (via improved horseshoes, harnesses and ploughs), and town clocks.</li><li>The fact that most of the key innovations of the early industrial revolution (steam engines excepted) would have been technologically possible a century or two earlier, but were blocked by the political power of guilds.</li><li>The importance of the Glorious Revolution in shifting England’s political climate to favour industrialisation; and more generally, the role of competition between nation-states in spurring government permissiveness towards innovation.</li><li>The mechanisation of the silk industry as a smaller-scale precursor to the mechanisation of cotton processing that would drive the early years of the industrial revolution.</li><li>The prevalence of child labour in the first factories run by Arkwright and others; and more generally how miserable the first few decades of the industrial revolution were for the poor, who were crammed into unsanitary cities on reduced wages, with severe health consequences.</li><li>The fact that it took many decades after Watt’s steam engine was patented in 1769 for railways to actually become widely significant.</li><li>The role of arms manufacturers like Colt as precursors to Ford’s assembly lines.</li></ul><br />In its latter role, however, the book seems a little incomplete. From around 1770 to 1840, productivity rose while worker incomes stagnated, with the increased wealth primarily going to industrialists - a period known as “Engels’ pause”. Frey argues that today, as the incomes of Western workers stagnate, we’ve reached an analogous situation. Engels’ pause gave rise to Luddite riots and the growth of the communist movement. Similarly, the modern working class will be tempted to campaign against automation - a “technology trap” which we will need to overcome to reach the level of technology which makes prosperity more widespread.<br /><br />Certainly the thesis is initially plausible, but at the end of the book I was left with quite a few unanswered questions. Four particularly important ones:<br /><ol><li>Frey makes the distinction between replacing technologies and augmenting technologies. The former “render jobs and skills redundant”; automatic elevators are a good example. The latter “make people more productive in existing tasks or create entirely new jobs for them”; Frey’s examples are innovation in the steel industry and the invention of the typewriter. But there’s a pretty blurry line between these two categories. An augmenting technology becomes a replacing technology if “demand for a given product or service becomes saturated”, a criterion which has less to do with the sector itself than with the broader state of the economy. But if we’re considering the wider economy, then the lower costs provided by replacing technologies enable other sectors to produce more goods, making them augmenting after all. So while the call to “augment not replace” workers has become a rallying cry, I’m not sure that the distinction has much predictive power. Can we tell in advance which technologies will be augmenting vs replacing, or do we just have to wait until a few decades later and look at the job statistics?</li><li>Building on the last point: you could describe the first industrial revolution as starting off with replacing technologies (such as power looms) and moving on to augmenting technologies (such as the steam engine). And you could describe the second industrial revolution as being all about augmenting technologies (such as electricity and cars - although the latter could also be considered a replacing technology for horses). If Frey is right that the current wage stagnation has been driven by automation, then this matches the beginning of the first industrial revolution.* But are there good reasons to think that we’ll eventually transition to building augmenting technologies in the same way as they did? Reasoning from a small sample size is treacherous at the best of times, and in this case our n=2 sample showcases two different trajectories. We might be about to experience a third distinct trajectory: AI continuing to be a replacing technology to a greater and greater extent. I do think this is unlikely (<a href=\"http://thinkingcomplete.blogspot.com/2018/02/what-will-long-term-future-of.html\">as I argue here</a>) but it’s an open possibility.</li><li>Frey discusses the experience of America’s blue-collar middle class - which, he argues, has lost jobs to a combination of globalisation and automation. But (assuming this is true) how much of the responsibility should each factor bear? If it’s almost all due to globalisation, then the chapter is a little misleading. I don’t have any particular reason to think that, but Frey doesn’t do the work of convincing me otherwise. (Although, since globalisation has been made much easier by information technology, should we count it as an effect of automation? It seems roughly analogous to how technologies invented early in the industrial revolution allowed adults’ jobs to be done by children.)</li><li>Frey worries that the technology trap will lead to workers suppressing technological growth. Yet there have been many changes to the factors which originally held back industrialisation. Guilds/unions are much reduced in power; international competitiveness is now a top priority; faster communication channels facilitate the spread of new ideas; and the intellectual plausibility of stifling innovation as a way to protect workers is much diminished, given how hugely we have benefited (in material terms) from the last few centuries of technological progress.<br />On the other hand, everyone has the vote now, which wasn’t the case in the past. And many people are using those votes to send a strong message against current intellectual orthodoxy. And with the pace of change being much faster now than in the 1700s, perhaps the backlash it spurs will be concomitantly greater. Or maybe it will mean that the anti-technology camp has less time to coordinate resistance. It seems very unclear how these factors weigh against each other; Frey’s historical analogy can only take us so far.</li></ol><br />Frey finishes with a set of prescriptions for how to close the gap between the winners and losers from automation, most of which are standard and sensible - e.g. cutting back on occupational licensing, encouraging relocation, investing in high-speed rail, and reforming housing markets. A more novel proposal is wage insurance, which compensates people when they are forced into lower-paying jobs. It seems like a good idea for individuals, but if implemented by the government as Frey suggests, I worry that it’ll become yet another piece of clutter in an already overcomplicated and inefficient welfare system.<br /><br />I want to end this review with a theme of the book that I particularly liked: the rehabilitation of the Luddites. Frey emphasises that, despite having become a byword for ignorant destructiveness, the Luddites were actually campaigning against a major threat to their livelihoods and communities, and we should sympathise with them. The parallels with our modern era are obvious - and the more we can rise above pejorative descriptions of our political opponents, the better.<br /><br /><br />* There’s also the complication that incomes in the tech sector have been rising rapidly. Was there an analogous group of skilled workers who benefited from Engels’ pause? I suppose that the job of building the machines must have been a lucrative one, but I really don’t know.</div></div>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>A question that used to puzzle me is “Why can people be so much better at doing a thing for fun, or to help their friends and family, than they are at doing the <em>exact same thing </em>as a job?”</p>\n<p>I’ve seen it in myself and I’ve seen it in others. People can be hugely more productive, creative, intelligent, and efficient on just-for-fun stuff than they are at work.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s something around coercion? But it happens to people even when they choose their work and have no direct supervisor, as when a prolific hobbyist writer suddenly gets writer’s block as soon as he goes pro.</p>\n<p>I think it has a very mundane explanation; it’s always more expensive to have to <em>meet a specific commitment</em> than merely to <em>do something valuable</em>.</p>\n<p>If I feel like writing sometimes and not other times, then if writing is my hobby I’ll write when I feel like it, and my output per hour of writing will be fairly high. Even within “writing”, if my interests vary, and I write about whatever I feel like, I can take full advantage of every writing hour.  By contrast, if I’ve committed to write a specific piece by a specific deadline, I have to do it whether or not I’m in the mood for it, and that means I’ll probably be less efficient, spend more time dithering, and I’ll demand more external compensation in exchange for my inconvenience.</p>\n<p>The stuff I write for fun may be valuable! And if you simply divide the value I produce by my hours of labor or the amount I need to be paid, I’m <em>hugely </em>more efficient in my free time than in my paid time! But I can’t just trivially “up my efficiency” in my paid time; reliability itself has a cost.</p>\n<p>The costs of reliability are often invisible, but they can be very important. The cost (in time and in office supplies and software tools) of tracking and documenting your work so that you can deliver it on time. The cost (in labor and equipment) of quality assurance testing. The opportunity cost of creating simpler and less ambitious things so that you can deliver them on time and free of defects.</p>\n<p>Reliability becomes more important with scale. Large organizations have more rules and procedures than small ones, and this is rational. Accordingly, they pay more costs in reliability.</p>\n<p>One reason is that the attack surface for errors grows with the number of individuals involved. For instance, large organizations often have rules against downloading software onto company computers without permission.  The chance that any one person downloads malicious software that seriously harms the company is small, but the chance that <em>at least one </em>person does rises with the number of employees.</p>\n<p>Another reason is that coordination becomes more important with more people. If a project depends on many people cooperating, then you as an individual aren’t simply trying to do the <em>best </em>thing, but rather the best thing that is also understandable and predictable and capable of achieving buy-in from others.</p>\n<p>Finally, large institutions are more tempting to attackers than small ones, since they have more value to capture. For instance, large companies are more likely to be targeted by lawsuits or public outcry than private individuals, so it’s strategically correct for them to spend more on defensive measures like legal compliance procedures or professional PR.</p>\n<p>All of these types of defensive or preventative activity reduce efficiency — you can do less in a given timeframe with a given budget.  Large institutions, even when doing everything right, acquire inefficiencies they didn’t have when small, because they have higher reliability requirements.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are also economies of scale that increase efficiency. There are fixed expenses that only large institutions can afford, that make marginal production cheaper. There are ways to aggregate many risky components so that the whole is <em>more </em>robust than any one part, e.g. in distributed computation, compressed sensing, or simply averaging.  Optimal firm size is a balance.</p>\n<p>This framework tells us when we ought to find it possible to get better-than-default efficiency <em>easily</em>, i.e. without any clever tricks, just by accepting different tradeoffs than others do. For example:</p>\n<p>1.) People given an open-ended mandate to do what they like can be far more efficient than people working to spec…<em>at the cost of</em> unpredictable output with no guarantees of getting what you need when you need it. (See: academic research.)</p>\n<p>2.) Things that come with fewer guarantees of reliable performance can be cheaper in the average use case…<em>at the cost of</em> completely letting you down when they occasionally fail. (See: prototype or beta-version technology.)</p>\n<p>3.) Activities within highly cooperative social environments can be more efficient…<em>at the cost of </em>not scaling to more adversarial environments where you have to spend more resources on defending against attacks. (See: Eternal September)</p>\n<p>4.) Having an “opportunistic” policy of taking whatever opportunities come along (for instance, hanging out in a public place and chatting with whomever comes along and seems interesting, vs. scheduling appointments) allows you to make use of time that others have to spend doing “nothing” … <em>at the cost of </em>never being able to commit to activities that need time blocked out in advance.</p>\n<p>5.) Sharing high-fixed-cost items (like cars) can be more efficient than owning…<em>at the cost of </em>not having a guarantee that they’ll always be available when you need them.</p>\n<p>In general, you can get greater efficiency for things you don’t <em>absolutely need</em> than for things you do; if something is merely nice-to-have, you can handle it if it occasionally fails, and your average cost-benefit ratio can be very good indeed. But this doesn’t mean you can easily copy the efficiency of luxuries in the production of necessities.</p>\n<p>(This suggests that “toys” are a good place to look for innovation. Frivolous, optional goods are where we should expect it to be most affordable to experiment, all else being equal; and we should expect technologies that first succeed in “toy” domains to expand to “important, life-and-death” domains later.)</p>\n<p> </p>",

Mostly trying to bring some things into the discourse that I think are too often ignored.</strong></p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7vofFovKWPrnM7y9Q/appeal-to-consequence-value-tensions-and-robust#xxTAJdeZYc6cj9hMF\">Some updates I&#x27;ve made based on the discussion in this post are here</a></em> .</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Jessicata&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P3FQNvnW8Cz42QBuA/dialogue-on-appeals-to-consequences\">Dialogue on Appeals to Consequences</a> is an expansion of a response that she wrote to me a few months ago, arguing a particular point that I agree with: Namely, if you have an object level thing you want in the world, it&#x27;s almost never worth lying or withholding information about that thing, because it breaks meta level norms about truthseeking that are much more important to accomplishing object level goals in general. However, there&#x27;s a slightly more interesting case that I think is quite murkier, that the original comment was pointing to. That is, what if your truthseeking norms are in tension with OTHER meta level norms that are important? In general, how do you deal with instances where tensions between two important values cause you to not know what to do? </p><h1>Dialogue</h1><p>Let&#x27;s imagine John and Jill are discussing John&#x27;s behavior in a private space.  Jill is a leader of the space, and John is someone who frequently attends the space and has lively discussions trying to get to the truth. </p><p>Jill: John, I&#x27;ve had several complaints about your tendency to steer conversations towards the divisive topic that everyone should be a Vegan, and I&#x27;m going to ask you to tone it down a bit when you&#x27;re in our main space. </p><p>John: Are people saying that I&#x27;m making arguments that are false? </p><p>Jill: No, no one is saying that you&#x27;re making false arguments. John: Are people saying that I&#x27;m derailing the conversation?  I think you&#x27;ll find that every instance I brought up veganism was highly relevant to the conversation. </p><p>Jill: Yes, some people have said that, but I happen to believe you when you say that you&#x27;ve only brought it up in relevant contexts for you. </p><p>John: Then what&#x27;s the problem? I&#x27;m stating relevant true beliefs that add to the totality of the conversation and steer it in conversationally relevant directions. </p><p>Jill: The problem is twofold. Firstly, people find it annoying to retread the same conversation over and over. More importantly, this topic usually leads to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BZtAavpsy9WtMYgEL/demon-threads\">demon conversations</a>, and I fear that continued discussion of the topic at the rate its&#x27; currently discussed could lead to a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gesKhsKaeQAHLzDsG/schism-begets-schism\">schism</a>. Both of these outcomes go against our value of being a premiere community that attracts the smartest people, as they&#x27;re actually driving these people away! </p><p>John: Excuse me for saying so, but this a clear appeal to consequence! </p><p>Jill: Is it? I&#x27;m not saying that the negative consequences to the community mean that what you&#x27;re saying is false - that would be a clear logical fallacy. Instead I&#x27;m just asking you to bring up this argument less often because I think it will lead to bad outcomes. </p><p>John: Ok, maybe it&#x27;s not a logical fallacy, but it is dangerous.  This community is built on a foundation of truth seeking, and once we start abandoning that because of people&#x27;s feelings, we devolve into tribal dynamics and tone arguments! </p><p>Jill: Yes, truthseeking is very important. However,  <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Nx2WxEuPSvNBGuYpo/feeling-moral\">It&#x27;s clear that just choosing one value as sacred </a>, and not allowing for tradeoffs can lead to <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/22/repost-the-non-libertarian-faq/\">very dysfunctional belief system</a>s,.I believe you&#x27;ve pointed at a clear tension in our values as they&#x27;re currently stated.  The tension between freedom of speech and truth, and the value of making a space that people actually want to have intellectual discussions at. </p><p>John: You&#x27;re saying there&#x27;s a tension, but to me there&#x27;s a clear and obvious winner. Under your proposed rules, anyone will be able to silence anything simply by saying they don&#x27;t like it! </p><p>Jill: If I find someone trying to silence good arguments through that tactic, I&#x27;ll sit them down and have a similar conversation to the one we&#x27;re having now. </p><p>John: That&#x27;s even worse!  That means that instead of the putting the allowed conversation topics up to vote, we&#x27;re putting them in the hands of one person, you! You can silence any conversation you want. </p><p>Jill:  I can see how it would seem that way, but I believe we&#x27;ve cultivated some great <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i2XikYzeL39HoSSTr/matt-goldenberg-s-short-form-feed#xZxoSo4ogK7pNoJgA\">cultural norms that make it harder for me to play to political games like that.</a>  Firstly, our norm of radical transparency means that this and all similar conversations I have like this will be recorded and shared with everyone, and any such political moves by me will be laughably transparent. </p><p>John: That makes sense. Also, Hi Mom! </p><p>Jill: Second, our organization allows anyone to apply the values to anyone else, so if you see ME not following the values in any of my talks, you can call me out on it and I&#x27;ll comply. </p><p>John: Sure, you say that now, but because of your role you can just defy that rule whenever you want! Jill: That&#x27;s true, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons I&#x27;ve worked to cultivate<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xhE4TriBSPywGuhqi/integrity-and-accountability-are-core-parts-of-rationality\"> integrity as a leader.</a>  Has there been any instance of my behavior where you think I would actually do that? </p><p>John: No I suppose not. Are there any other cultural norms preventing you from using the arbitrary nature of decisions for your own gain? Jill: There&#x27;s one more. Our organization has a clear set of values, and as the leader one of my roles is to spearhead the<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i2XikYzeL39HoSSTr/matt-goldenberg-s-short-form-feed#X8WQYC5Lx9cwf9Gse\"> change the values in clear ways when there&#x27;s tension between them.</a>  So I&#x27;m not just going to talk to you, I&#x27;m actually going to suggest to the organization that we clarify our values such that they tell us to do in these relatively common situations, and I&#x27;m going to have you help me. </p><p>John: I think that makes sense.  We can probably make a list of topics that people are allowed to taboo, and  a list of topics people are not allowed to taboo, and then I&#x27;ll always know what it&#x27;s ok to &quot;appeal to consequences&quot; on. Jill: I&#x27;m afraid that particular rule would be unwise.  I think there&#x27;s practically unlimited <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/\">scissor statements</a> that could cause schisms in our community, and a skilled adversary could easily find one that&#x27;s not on our list of approved topics. No, I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;ll need to make a general value that can cover these situations in the general case. </p><p>John: Oh, so trying to avoid appeals to consequence argument can actually be used by someone looking to harm our community? That&#x27;s interesting!  But it&#x27;s not clear to me that there is a general rule that can cover all the cases. </p><p>Jill: There is.  <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i2XikYzeL39HoSSTr/matt-goldenberg-s-short-form-feed#mfH4WGXG6QGssRCJf\">The general rule is that people should give equal weight to their own needs, the needs of the people they&#x27;re interacting with, and the needs of the organization as a whole.</a> </p><p>John: I&#x27;m not sure I get it. </p><p>Jill: Well, you have a need to express that everyone should be a vegan. It&#x27;s clearly very important to you, or you wouldn&#x27;t bring it up so much. At the same time, many of the people in our community have a need to have variety in their conversation, and you should be aware of this when talking with them. Finally, our organization has a need to not experience/discuss scissor statements too often or too frequently, in order to remain healthy and avoid frequent schisms.  By bringing this topic up so much, you&#x27;re putting your needs above the needs of others you&#x27;re interacting with and the group, instead of bringing it up less frequently, which would be placing the needs on equal ground. </p><p>John: That makes sense. I suppose by the same token, if there&#x27;s a really interesting topic that&#x27;s helpful for the group to know about, and lots of people want to talk about, it would be putting your own needs above others needs if you said it hurt your feelings so people couldn&#x27;t talk about it. </p><p>Jill: Exactly! </p><p>John: So this rule seems plausible to me, and I&#x27;m sure it would be great for many people, but I have to admit its&#x27; not for me.  I&#x27;d much prefer a space where people are allowed to say anything they want to me, and I can say anything I want to them in return. </p><p>Jill: I agree that this may not be the best rule for everybody. That&#x27;s why next week we&#x27;re going to start experimenting with <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/97LgacucCxmyjYiNT/the-archipelago-model-of-community-standards\">The Archipelago Model</a>. As I said, I want you to tone it down in the main room, which follows the Maturity value mentioned above. However, we&#x27;ve designated a side room that instead follows <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker's_rules\">Crocker&#x27;s Rules</a>. You&#x27;re allowed to go to either room, but when in that room, must follow the stated values of the room. And most importantly, all conversations are recorded and can be listened to by anyone in the community! </p><p>John: Cool, that seems worthwhile, but very messy and likely to have numerous hidden failure modes... </p><p>Jill: I agree, but it at least seems worth a shot! </p><h1>Commentary</h1><p>So you probably noticed already, but this post wasn&#x27;t really about Appeal to Consequences at all.  Instead, it&#x27;s a meditation on how good organizations deal with tensions in their values, and avoid the organization being overrun by skilled sociopaths.  A lot of these suggestions and ideas come from the work I&#x27;ve been doing over the past year or so to figure out what makes great organizations and communities. I&#x27;d be particularly interested in peoples&#x27; inner sim of how the organization described by John and Jill above would go horribly wrong, and counter ideas about what could be done to fix THOSE issues.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>It&#x27;s easy to bemoan <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity\">scope insensitivity</a>, a special case of that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_neglect\">phenomenon</a> where we mere humans end up caring more about the death of one person than one hundred, better remember the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule\">last bite</a> of a meal than the first dozen, and think <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less-is-better_effect\">less is more and more is less</a>. After all, if we didn&#x27;t neglect scope we would be more <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv/what-do-we-mean-by-rationality\">rational</a>, and so maybe <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy\">happier</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BTXdajWzoN2YRbgjG/rational-health-optimization\">healthier</a>, living in a world were everyone got more of what they wanted, since without scope insensitivity <a href=\"https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm\">it wouldn&#x27;t be so hard</a> to convince people to help those far away who need more than those nearby who need less. But scope insensitivity is what we&#x27;ve got, so we have to learn to live with it.</p><p>Luckily there&#x27;s plenty of reason to think we can take advantage of scope insensitive because people have already <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BAedeHtbhqQEpuANL/book-review-happiness-by-design\">discovered ways to make the best</a> of other forms of extension neglect. For example, adapting to duration neglect is something most people learn early on by adopting heuristics like &quot;save the best for last&quot; and &quot;do the hardest part first&quot;. Salespersons and motivational speakers alike learn to exploit base rate neglect, sample size neglect, and the conjunction fallacy to convince people to do what they otherwise might not. And designers of all kinds of systems <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PrCmeuBPC4XLDQz8C/unconscious-economies\">can mold incentives</a> to work with rather than against human nature. Thus it stands to reason we can use our natural scope insensitivity to do more than <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xiHy3kFni8nsxfdcP/one-life-against-the-world\">fail</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3wYTFWY3LKQCnAptN/torture-vs-dust-specks\">to</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/r5MSQ83gtbjWRBDWJ/the-intuitions-behind-utilitarianism\">multiply</a>.</p><p>I&#x27;ll consider one such use case here, namely a practice of using scope insensitivity to prepare ourselves for high-stakes situations in low-stakes ones. This is a kind of scope insensitivity <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo\">judo</a>, or &quot;gentle way&quot;, and just like in the martial art, we&#x27;ll redirect the strength of our &quot;opponent&quot; to transform it into an unintended ally.</p><h1>Dwell in the Dojo</h1><p>Life is full of high-stakes situations: job interviews, first dates, nuclear missile crises. These generally feel like one-shot scenarios—there&#x27;s one chance to get it right and if we fail all is lost. To wit, if we don&#x27;t say the right things we&#x27;ll lose our shot at that job forever, if we don&#x27;t put out the right vibes that person will never fall in love with us, and if we push the <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedButton\">big red button</a> there&#x27;ll be no second chances for anything.</p><p>We can make these multi-shot scenarios pretty easily with training, and there&#x27;s some value in practicing interviewing skills, going on many dates so no one date matters very much, and running war games. These are all training methods that take something high-stakes and make it low-stakes so you feel free to experiment. That&#x27;s one way to learn: by creating a safe laboratory where we can <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i42Dfoh4HtsCAfXxL/babble\">explore</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wQACBmK5bioNCgDoG/more-babble\">more</a> before we <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rYJKvagRYeDM8E9Rf/prune\">prune</a>.</p><p>That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m suggesting we do, though. In the dojo of scope insensitivity judo, we practice the way of getting into low-stakes scenarios that feel high-stakes so we are prepared generally to handle really high-stakes scenarios when we encounter them. We do this by taking advantage of the way our minds mistakenly believe many low-stakes scenarios are high-stakes ones because they push against beliefs and behaviors that were <a href=\"https://www.cep.ucsb.edu/primer.html\">evolutionarily</a> or historically adaptive but no longer are.</p><p>Consider these examples from my own life, drawn from my zen practice:</p><ul><li>I asked if I could bring a cushion from home for a retreat. I was told yes. I brought it. The cushion was orange, the zendo&#x27;s cushions were black, it stuck out, and I was told I couldn&#x27;t use my cushion.</li><ul><li>I complied, but I was immediately caught by thoughts like &quot;but you told me I could use my cushion&quot; and &quot;now my meditation will be worse because I&#x27;ll be less comfortable&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m not as good a zen student as I thought&quot;.</li><li>I felt embarrassed, defensive, let down, and defeated. I felt like a failure, like I was 2nd grade Gordy again getting in trouble for being weird.</li><li>Of course, stepping back, we can see this was a very low-stakes situation: I just switched cushions and got on with the retreat! But it felt high-stakes at the time because it pushed me in ways that might have been adaptive in some high-stakes situations, either in my personal past or within my cultural or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/epZLSoNvjW53tqNj9/evolutionary-psychology\">evolutionary</a> environment. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4MpodyRwdYXEeC3jn/problems-in-evolutionary-psychology\">For our ancestors</a>, this kind of mistake could have meant loss of <a href=\"https://meltingasphalt.com/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/\">prestige</a> and thus loss of resources and thus marginal loss of reproductive and survival opportunities. Lucky for me it was just about a cushion in the zendo!</li></ul><li>I was sitting half lotus during a long meditation period, and after about 40 minutes my legs hurt in a way that I worried was injuring them by continuing, so I uncrossed my legs and sat with them pulled up towards my chest to give them a rest. In the middle of this my teacher walked into the zendo and saw me, and came over to correct me, saying I couldn&#x27;t sit like that and had to either sit crosslegged or in a chair.</li><ul><li>I sort of complied: I instead took the option to do brief walking meditation before returning to sitting. I was caught by thoughts like &quot;you didn&#x27;t see how I had been sitting&quot; and &quot;you didn&#x27;t know the kind of danger I was in&quot; and &quot;I must have stayed sitting out-of-form because the pain was so bad it temporarily addled my mind&quot;.</li><li>I felt embarrassed, ashamed, and defensive and also a little indignant.</li><li>This was also a pretty low-stakes situation: I walked for 10 minutes, came back and sat for the rest of the period, and it was never mentioned again. I didn&#x27;t lose any of my positions or responsibilities, and my practice continued on as strong as ever. But it felt high-stakes because I had been caught out and corrected in front of others, and maybe they would think less of me. As best I can tell, they did not.</li></ul><li>A new person came to our Saturday morning practice period for the first time. I was work leader that week, and when it came time to hand out assignments I assigned her to clean the zendo under my supervision. I was later corrected by the person who trained me as work leader that I shouldn&#x27;t have given her that assignment because new people should get simple tasks like sweeping.</li><ul><li>I was immediately somewhat defensive. Cleaning the zendo was the job I had been assigned when I first came to the zen center, so I thought it was the right thing to do. I said as much.</li><li>In addition to being defensive, I felt like I had been let down by my trainer not telling me this before, and I also felt I had the excuse that it worked out fine.</li><li>Once again, this was pretty low-stakes: she cleaned the zendo well, I got new information, and I changed how I hand out work assignments. But my behavior indicates I thought it was high-stakes enough to be worth some back-and-forth and argument or defense of my position and to put myself in opposition to another person to save face. I had wanted to do a good job at being work leader, and felt threatened by the correction, leading me to escalate my response.</li></ul></ul><p>I drew these from my zen practice because the zen center is like a laboratory where we specialize in <a href=\"http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/GenjoKoan_Aitken.htm\">studying the self</a>, and so I had more chance to examine these events and remember them than the many similar daily occurrences that happen throughout the rest of my life. Also they are less personal and raw than the times I blew low-stakes situations out-of-proportion and didn&#x27;t learn from them at work, with family, and among friends. But hopefully those are enough for you to start to see the pattern: scope insensitivity means we often treat low-stakes situations like high-stakes situations, and we can take advantage of that to use them as training scenarios for genuine high-stakes events if we allow ourselves the space to stop and take a step back to consider what we&#x27;re doing.</p><h1>The Way of Scope Insensitivity</h1><p>You can begin to practice with scope insensitivity yourself right away, because the world is constantly presenting you with low-stakes scenarios that feel high-stakes. The more anxious, depressed, or frustrated you generally are, the more you are likely you are treating low-stakes situations as high-stakes and so you will have even more opportunities to practice scope insensitivity judo than people who are more calm and equanimous.</p><p>The first part of the practice is to notice and stop. Notice when you feel like you are in a high-stakes situation. Then stop for a few breaths to examine it. Don&#x27;t worry if you fail at first; <a href=\"http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html\">learning</a> to <a href=\"http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/07/why-mere-noticing-solves-so-much.html\">notice</a> is hard if you&#x27;re not already skilled at it, and even when you are skilled it&#x27;s still easy to get so caught up that we forget to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and\">really</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tMhEv28KJYWsu6Wdo/kensh\">look</a>.</p><p>When you catch one of these situations, consider whether it is really high-stakes, or if you just believe it is due to scope insensitivity. If it&#x27;s really low-stakes, this is a great opportunity to experiment and practice with dealing with these situations and the factors that cause them to feel high-stakes. If you&#x27;re sure it&#x27;s really high-stakes, <a href=\"https://medium.com/personal-growth/what-a-zen-proverb-tells-us-about-self-improvement-f3b26b6b7af3\">that&#x27;s even better</a>, though you&#x27;ll want to be a bit more cautious in how you proceed.</p><p>There are many ways you can explore these situations once you&#x27;ve noticed them arising, and the path you take largely depends on what you are ready for and what resonates with you. <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/the-personal-growth-cycle-34ec1c218615\">I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of milage</a> out of the <a href=\"https://www.extension.harvard.edu/inside-extension/surprising-reason-we-dont-keep-our-resolutions-how-overcome-it\">Immunity to Change</a> framework and working with core beliefs (albeit within the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_Mind_Zen_School\">Ordinary Mind</a> zen context rather than a <a href=\"https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellor-articles/core-beliefs-automatic-thoughts-and-conceptualization-in-cbt\">CBT context</a>). You might prefer something that looks more like psychotherapy, various <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/o2bfgs9FTTMR4jnY3/translating-cfar-to-therapy\">CFAR techniques</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/srjro4caxla0pcd/Folding%201.0%20by%20Mark%20Lippmann.pdf?dl=0\">Folding</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/noXTkjP45BAZqKJxM/focusing\">Focusing</a>, <a href=\"http://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com/2019/07/core-transformation.html\">Core Transformation</a>, or some kind of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mFvuQTzHQiBCDEKw6/a-framework-for-internal-debugging\">debugging</a>. Generally you are looking for a way to integrate what you can see when you step back and look at what&#x27;s happening in these situations with your immediate reactions, and anything that helps you do that will likely work here.</p><p>And then you just keep doing it. You&#x27;re unlikely to fix your scope insensitivity—that appears to just be part of how human brains work. But you can, through regular practice, retrain yourself to more deftly handle situations that previously felt overwhelming. By developing the skill of flipping what feel like high-stakes situations into low-stakes ones, you&#x27;ll gain perspective on those situations that allows you to take a more thoughtful, deliberate approach that transcends the worst of our knee-jerk reactions that lead to self-created suffering.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/scope-insensitivity-judo-a07f9166f165\">Cross-posted to Map and Territory.</a></em></p>",

They have to read your message and perhaps write a reply. This later component is tricky if they aren&#x27;t convinced that you&#x27;ve made up for it. It reminds them of an experience they might want to forget.

You should be extremely cautious about apologising when it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s what you think a nice person would do, as opposed to something more specific, since those are precisely the situations where you are likely to end up apologising with no benefit to anyone.</p><p>Now most people don&#x27;t apologise enough and so this is probably the wrong advice for them.

Have good policies. Have good meta policies. Be able to interface well with people who might have a wide variety of strategies, some of who might be malicious or confused.”</p><p>People are not born <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PBRWb2Em5SNeWYwwB/humans-are-not-automatically-strategic\">automatically strategic</a>, nor are they born an “agent.”</p><p>If you want robust agency, you have to cultivate it on purpose.</p><p>I have a friend who solves a lot of problems using the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip\">multi-agent paradigm</a>. He spends a lot of effort integrating and empowering his sub-agents. He treats them like adults, makes sure they understand each other and trust each other. He makes sure each of them have accurate beliefs, and he tries to empower each of them as much as possible so they have no need to compete. </p><p>This… doesn’t actually work for me. </p><p>I’ve tried things like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Z7Sk29PDYTooipXMS/internalizing-internal-double-crux\">internal double crux</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model\">internal family systems</a>, and so far, it’s just produced a confused “meh.” Insofar as “sub-agents” is a workable framework, I still have a pretty adversarial relationship with myself. (When I’m having trouble sleeping or staying off facebook, instead of figuring out what needs my sub-agents have and meeting them all...  I just block facebook for 16 hours a day and program my computer to turn itself off every hour of the night starting at 11pm)</p><p>I&#x27;m tempted to write off my friend&#x27;s claims as weird-posthoc-narrative. But this friend is among the more impressive people I know, and consistently has good reasons for things that initially sound weird to me. (This shouldn&#x27;t be strong evidence to you, but it&#x27;s enough evidence for me personally to take it seriously)</p><p>I once asked him “so… how do you even get your sub-agents to say anything to each other? I can’t tell if I have sub-agents or not but if I do they sure seem incoherent. Have you always had coherent sub-agents?”</p><p>And he said (paraphrased by me), something like:</p><blockquote> “You know how when you’re a baby, you’re a flailing incoherent mess. And then you become, like, a four year old and you can sort of communicate but you can’t keep promises or figure things out very well. And then you’re a teenager and… <em>maybe </em>you’re a reasonable person, but maybe you’re still angry and moody and think you know everything even though you’re like fourteen-year-old and kinda insufferable? </blockquote><blockquote>&quot;But... eventually you become an actual person who can make reasonable trades, and keep contracts?</blockquote><blockquote>“My sub-agents were like that. Initially they were incoherent like a baby. But I spent years cultivating them and teaching them and helping them grow and now they’re, like, coherent entities that have accurate beliefs and can negotiate with each other and it’s all super reasonable.”</blockquote><blockquote>“An important element here was giving the sub-agents<em> jobs.</em> I looked at what Fear was doing, and one thing seemed to be “help me notice when a bad thing was going to happen to me.” And I said “Okay, Fear. This is now your official job. I will be helping you to do this. If you are doing a good job, or seem to be making mistakes, I will be giving you feedback about that.”</blockquote><p>This… was an interesting outlook.</p><p>The jury’s still out on whether sub-agents are a useful framework for me. But this still fit into an interesting meta-framework. </p><p>Subagents or no, people don’t stop growing as agents when they become adults – there’s more to learn. I’ve worked over the past few years to improve my ability to think, and have good policies that defend my values while interfacing better with potential allies and enemies and confused bystanders. </p><p>I still have a lot more to go.</p><h1>Becoming a robust organization</h1><p>People are not automatically robust agents. </p><p>Neither are organizations.</p><p>Whether or not sub-agents are a valid frame for humans (or for particular humans), they seem like a pretty valid lens to examine organizations through.</p><p>An organization is born without a brain, and without a soul, and it will not have either unless you proactively build it one. And, I suspect, you are limited in your ability to build it one by the <em>degree of soul and brain that you have cultivated in yourself</em>. (Where “you” is “whoever is building the organization”, which might be one founder or multiple co-founders)</p><h2>Vignettes of Organizational Coherence</h2><p><em>Epistemic Status: Somewhat poetry-esque.

But I hope it helps express the overall worldview I currently hold.</em></p><p><strong>Holding off on Hiring</strong></p><p>YCombinator recommends that young startups avoid hiring people as long as possible. I think there are a number of reasons for this, but one guess is that you’re ability to grow the soul of your organization weakens dramatically as it scales. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZvJab25tDebB8FGE/you-have-about-five-words\">It’s much harder to communicate nuanced beliefs to many-people-at-once than a few people</a>.</p><p>The years where your organization is small, and everyone can easily talk to everyone… those are the years when you have the chance to plant the seed of agency and the spark of goodness, to ensure your organization grows into something that is aligned with your values.</p><p><strong>The Human Alignment Problem</strong></p><p>Ray Dalio, of Bridgewater, has a book of <a href=\"https://www.principles.com/\">Principles</a> that he endeavors to follow, and have Bridgewater follow. I disagree (or are quite skeptical about) a lot of his implementation details. But I think the meta-principle of having principles is valuable. In particular, writing things down so that you can notice when you have violated your previously stated principles seems important.</p><p>One thing he talks a lot about is “getting in sync”, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/work-principle-4-get-stay-sync-ray-dalio/\">which he discusses in this blog post</a>: </p><blockquote> For an organization to be effective, the people who make it up must be aligned on many levels—from what their shared mission is, to how they will treat each other, to a more practical picture of who will do what when to achieve their goals. Yet alignment can never be taken for granted because people are wired so differently. We all see ourselves and the world in our own unique ways, so deciding what’s true and what to do about it takes constant work.</blockquote><blockquote>Alignment is especially important in an idea meritocracy, so at Bridgewater we try to attain alignment consciously, continually, and systematically. We call this process of finding alignment “getting in sync,” and there are two primary ways it can go wrong: cases resulting from simple misunderstandings and those stemming from fundamental disagreements. Getting in sync is the process of open-mindedly and assertively rectifying both types. </blockquote><blockquote>Many people mistakenly believe that papering over diﬀerences is the easiest way to keep the peace. They couldn’t be more wrong. By avoiding conﬂicts one avoids resolving diﬀerences. People who suppress minor conﬂicts tend to have much bigger conﬂicts later on [...]</blockquote><blockquote>While it is straightforward to have a meritocracy in activities in which there is clarity of relative abilities (because the results speak for themselves such as in sports, where the fastest runner wins the race), it is much harder in a creative environment (where diﬀerent points of view about what’s best have to be resolved). If they’re not, the process of sorting through disagreements and knowing who has the authority to decide quickly becomes chaotic. Sometimes people get angry or stuck; a conversation can easily wind up with two or more people spinning unproductively and unable to reach agreement on what to do.</blockquote><blockquote>For these reasons, speciﬁc processes and procedures must be followed. Every party to the discussion must understand who has what rights and which procedures should be followed to move toward resolution. (We’ve also developed tools for helping do this). And everyone must understand the most fundamental principle for getting in sync, which is that people must be open-minded and assertive at the same time.</blockquote><p><strong>The Treacherous Turn</strong></p><p>This particular description about the treacherous turn (typically as applied to AI, but in this case using the example of a human) feels relevant:</p><blockquote>To master lying, a child should:</blockquote><blockquote>1. Possess the necessary cognitive abilities to lie (for instance, by being able to say words or sentences).</blockquote><blockquote>2. Understand that humans can (deliberately) say falsehoods about the world or their beliefs.</blockquote><blockquote>3. Practice lying, allowing himself/herself to be punished if caught.</blockquote><blockquote>If language acquisition flourishes when children are aged 15-18 months, the proportion of them who lie (about peeking in a psychology study) goes from 30% at age 2, to 50% of three-year olds, eventually reaching 80% at eight. Most importantly, they get better as they get older, going from blatant lies to pretending to be making reasonable/honest guesses.</blockquote><blockquote> There is therefore a gap between the moment children could (in theory) lie (18 months) and the moment they can effectively lie and use this technique to their own advantage (8 years old). During this gap, parents can correct the kid&#x27;s moral values through education.</blockquote><p>I’m not sure the metaphor quite holds. But it seems plausible that if you want an organization where individuals, teams and departments don’t lie (whether blatantly and maliciously, or through ‘honest goodhart-esque mistakes’, or through something like Benquo’s 4-level-simulacrum concept), you have some window in which you can try to install a robust system of honesty, honor and integrity, before the system becomes too powerful to shape.</p><p><strong>Sometimes bureaucracy is successfully protecting a thing, and that’s good</strong></p><p>Samo&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/brQwWwZSQbWBFRNvh/how-to-use-bureaucracies\">How to Use Bureaucracies</a> matched my experience watching bureaucracies form. I’ve seen bureaucracies form that looked reasonably formed-on-purpose-by-a-competent-person, and I’ve seen glimpses of ones that looked sort of cobbled together like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NQgWL7tvAPgN2LTLn/spaghetti-towers\">spaghetti towers</a>. </p><p>An interesting viewpoint I’ve heard recently is “usually when people are complaining that Bureaucracies don’t have souls, I think they’re just mad that the bureaucracy didn’t give them the resources they wanted. And the bureaucracy was specifically designed to stop from people like them from exploiting it.</p><blockquote>“Academic bureaucracies, say, have a particular goal of educating people and doing research. If you come to them with a plan that will educate people or improve research, they will usually give you want you want. If you come to them trying to get weird special exceptions or faculties for saving the world or whatever, they’ll be like ‘um, our job is not to save the world, it is to educate people and do research. If we gave resources to every person with a pet cause, we’d fall apart immediately.&#x27;”</blockquote><blockquote>“Likewise, if they impose a weird rule on you, it’s probably because in the past sometime fucked up in some way relating to that rule. And dealing with the fallout was really annoying, and they decided they didn’t want to have to deal with that fallout ever again. Sorry that you think you’re a good exception or the rule is stupid – part of the point of policies is to abstract away certain things so they can’t bother you and you can focus on what matters.”</blockquote><p>I’m not sure how often this is actually true and how often it’s just a convenient story (bureaucracies <em>do</em> seem to be built out of spaghetti towers). But it seems plausible in at least some cases. And it seems noteworthy that “having a soul” might be compatible with “include leviathanic institutions that don’t seem to care about you as a person.”</p><p><strong>Sabotaging the Nazis</strong></p><p>On the flipside...</p><p>LW user Lionhearted notes in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2jfiMgKkh7qw9z8Do/being-a-robust-agent\">Explicit and Implicit communication</a> that during World War II, some allies went to infiltrate the Nazis and gum up the works. They received explicit instructions like:</p><blockquote><em>“(11) General Interference with Organizations and Production [...]</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>(1) Insist on doing everything through “channels.” Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>(2) Make “speeches.” Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your “points” by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate “patriotic” comments.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>(3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for “further study and consideration.” Attempt to make the committees as large as possible — never less than five. [...]</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>(5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>(7) Advocate “caution.” Be “reasonable” and urge your fellow-conferees to be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision — raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.”</em></blockquote><p>And... well, this all sure sounds like the pathologies I normally associate with bureaucracy. This sort of thing seems to happen by default, as an organization scales.</p><p>There&#x27;s also Scott&#x27;s <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/29/my-irb-nightmare/\">IRB Nightmare</a>.</p><p><strong>Organizations have to make decisions and keep promises.</strong></p><p>Why can’t you just have individual agents within an organization? Why does it matter that the organization-as-a-whole be an agent?</p><p>If you can’t make “real” decisions and keep commitments, you will be limited in your ability to engage in certain strategies, in some cases unable to engage in mutually beneficial trade. </p><p>Organizations control resources that are often beyond the control of a single person, and involve complicated decision making procedures. Sometimes the procedure is a legible, principled process. Sometimes a few key people in the room-where-it-happens hash things out, opaquely. Sometimes it’s a legible-but-spaghetti-tower bureaucracy. </p><p>Any of these can work. But regardless, the organization can have access to resources beyond the sum-of-the-individual people involved. But if the organization isn&#x27;t coherent, it can struggle to make credible promises that are necessary to trade. (This might work a couple times, but then trading partners may become more skeptical)</p><p>Possible failure modes:</p><p>Sometimes n<em>obody </em>has any power – everyone requires too many checks from too many other people and long term planning can&#x27;t happen on purpose.</p><p>Sometimes you talk to the head of the org, and maybe you <em>even trust the head of the org, </em>and they say the org will do a thing, but somehow the org doesn’t end up doing the thing.</p><p>Sometimes, you can talk to each individual person at the org and they all agree Decision X would be best, but they’re all afraid to speak up because there isn’t common knowledge that they agree with Decision X. Or, they <em>do</em> all agree and know it, but they can’t say it publicly because <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xhE4TriBSPywGuhqi/integrity-and-accountability-are-core-parts-of-rationality\">The Public</a> doesn’t understand Decision X.</p><p>So Decision X doesn’t get made.</p><p>Sometimes you talk to each individual person and they each individually agree that Decision X is good, and you talk to the entire group and the entire group seems to agree that Decision X would be good, but… somehow Decision X doesn’t get done.</p><p>I think it makes sense for bureaucracies to exist sometimes, and to have the explicit purpose of preventing people from exploiting things too easily. But, it’s still useful for <em>some </em>part of the institution to be able to make decisions and commitments that weren’t part of explicitly-laid-out bureaucracy chain.</p><p><strong>Porous movements aren’t and can’t be agents</strong></p><p>I think that agency requires a <em>membrane</em>, something keeps particular people in and out, such that you have any deliberate culture, principles or decision making at all. </p><p>Relatedly, I think you need a membrane for <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zp5AEENssb8ZDnoZR/the-schelling-choice-is-rabbit-not-stag\">Stag Hunts</a> to work – if any rando can blunder into the formation at the last moment, there’s no way you can catch a stag. </p><p>Organizations have fairly strong membranes, and <em>sometimes</em> informal community institutions can as well. But this is relatively rare.</p><p>So while I’m disappointed sometimes when particular individuals and organizations don’t live up to the ideals I think they were trying for… I don’t think it makes much sense to hold most “movements” to the ideal of agency. Movements are too chaotic, too hard to police, too easy to show up in and start shouting and taking up attention.</p><p>Instead, instead, I think of movements as a place where a lot of people with similar ideals are clustered together. This makes it easier to find recruit people into organizations that <em>do</em> have membranes and <em>can</em> have principles.</p><p><strong>Narrative control and contracts, as alternative coordination mechanisms</strong></p><p>Another friend who ran an organization once remarked (paraphrased)</p><blockquote>“It seemed like the organization’s main coordination mechanism was a particular narrative that people rallied around. When I was in charge, I felt like it was my job to uphold that narrative, even when the narrative got epistemically dicey. This felt really bad for my soul, and eventually I stopped being in charge.”</blockquote><blockquote>“I’m not sure what to do about this problem – organizations need s<em>ome </em>kind of coordination mechanism. I think a potential solution might be to make central element of your company culture ‘upholding contracts.’ Maybe you don’t all share the same vision for the company, but you can make concrete trades. Some of those trades are “I will do X and you will pay me dollars”, and some might be between employees, like “I will work enthusiastically on <em>this </em>aspect of the company for 2 months if you work enthusiastically on <em>that </em>aspect of it.”</blockquote><p>This seems plausible to me. But importantly, I don’t think you get “uphold contracts” as a virtue for free. If you want your employees to be able to do it reliably, you need mechanisms to train and reinforce that. (I think if you recruit from some homogenous cultures it might come more automatically, but it’s not my default experience)</p><p><strong>Integrity and Accountability</strong></p><p>Habryka recently wrote about <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xhE4TriBSPywGuhqi/integrity-and-accountability-are-core-parts-of-rationality\">Integrity and Accountability</a>, and it seemed useful to just quote the summary here:</p><blockquote>One lens to view integrity through is as an advanced form of honesty – “acting in accordance with your stated beliefs.”</blockquote><blockquote>— To improve integrity, you can either try to bring your actions in line with your stated beliefs, or your stated beliefs in line with your actions, or reworking both at the same time. These options all have failure modes, but potential benefits.</blockquote><blockquote>— People with power sometimes have incentives that systematically warp their ability to form accurate beliefs, and (correspondingly) to act with integrity.</blockquote><blockquote>An important tool for maintaining integrity (in general, and in particular as you gain power) is to carefully think about what social environment and incentive structures you want for yourself.</blockquote><blockquote>Choose carefully who, and how many people, you are accountable to:</blockquote><blockquote>— Too many people, and you are limited in the complexity of the beliefs and actions that you can justify.</blockquote><blockquote>— Too few people, too similar to you, and you won’t have enough opportunities for people to notice and point out what you’re doing wrong. You may also not end up with a strong enough coalition aligned with your principles to accomplish your goals.</blockquote><h2>Open Problems in Robust Group Agency</h2><p>Exercises for the reader, and for me:</p><p>1. How do you make sure your group has <em>any</em> kind of agency at all, let alone be ‘value-aligned’</p><p>2. How do you choose people to be accountable to? What if you’re trying to do something really hard, and there seem to be few or zero people who you trust enough to be accountable to?</p><p>3. It seems like the last cluster of people who tried to solve accountability created committees and boards and bureaucracies, and… I dunno, maybe that stuff works fine if you do it right.

    "htmlBody": "<p>A quote from a 2002 <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4069/615a36c33e61ca309b8ceaeb628a10d441b5.pdf\">paper</a> by Kahneman and Frederick referencing some of Kahneman&#x27;s earlier work with Tversky:</p><blockquote>Early research on the representativeness and availability heuristics was guided by a simple and general hypothesis: when confronted with a difficult question people often answer an easier one instead, usually without being aware of the substitution.</blockquote><p>It&#x27;s an interesting hypothesis, and even without looking at studies it seems plausible. I can think of conversations where I&#x27;ve been frustrated by the fact that the other person can&#x27;t seem to actually answer the question I&#x27;ve asked them and keeps wiggling around. But it makes me wonder.</p><p>How would you tell the difference between A:</p><blockquote>Brain receives question<br/>Question is substituted for an easier one.<br/>Brain replies with answer to easier question</blockquote><p>and B:</p><blockquote>Brain receives question<br/>Brain replies using a heuristic that it applies to this sort of question.</blockquote><p>(thanks to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LHtMNz7ua8zu4rSZr/the-substitution-principle#XkHf2PDaCg9FHBtAx\">this</a> comment for helping me notice  the discrepancy)</p><p>Hmmm, it seems like they could easily produce the same answer. Does question substitution explain any more than &quot;the brain uses heuristics&quot;?</p><p>Yes and no. I read the first few pages of the paper, and pretty quickly noticed that Kahneman doesn&#x27;t seem to think that a <em>literal</em> question substitution is happening. Most of the paper explores the question of &quot;what governs what heuristic gets applied when?&quot;  and in other phrasings Kahneman states &quot;[people reply to questions] <strong>as if</strong> she had been asked [other question].&quot;</p><p>Despite the fact that literal question substitution might not happen that much, I can still get useful information by using the substitution frame. If I&#x27;m investigating whether or not I used a heuristic I wasn&#x27;t aware of, I can ask myself: &quot;Was I trying to answer an easier question? What are similar but simpler questions related to the one I was trying to answer? Are there any questions I know I&#x27;m good at answering that I might have substituted for the original one?&quot;</p><p>You might even say that question substitution is a great... <em>heuristic</em> for figuring out if you were using a heuristic, in lieu of a more detailed model of how and when your brain picks heuristics. Yes, by all means read the rest of the paper and launch a quest into understanding in detail how the mind works. And while you&#x27;re working on that, feel free to use the idea of question substitution to help you explore.</p><p>One thing that question substitution helps me notice is my tendency to &quot;have a hammer and go looking for nails.&quot; When doing a substitution, what sort of other questions might you want to substitute in? Questions you&#x27;re good at answering! This will be relevant later on when when exploring ways you can accidentally get stuck in never ending arguments.</p><h3><strong>Isn&#x27;t this just...</strong></h3><p>No. It&#x27;s not. To be more explicit about what I was saying in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5g7oFiePGEY3h4bqX/prereq-cognitive-fusion\">cognitive fusion</a>, I frequently see people take the following frame:</p><blockquote>Sometimes, for <em>no reason</em> people make <em>dumb mistakes</em>, which they&#x27;d better fix as soon as I point them out. <br/>&quot;Well gee, there&#x27;s got to be some reason people make these mistakes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re <em>dumb/irrational/unenlightened.</em>&quot;</blockquote><p>At best, telling someone not to make &quot;dumb mistakes&quot; let&#x27;s them know how you are going to judge them. At worst,  it asserts a world where &quot;dumb mistakes&quot; are this magical fundamental thing your brain spits out sometimes, and that you fix it by turning off the &quot;dumb mistake&quot; switch in your head. We all know where that is, right? Cool, just checking.</p><p>Thinking about question substitution orients me to the <em>process</em> of my brain swapping in a heuristic, instead of becoming fixated on the heuristic itself and how positively <em>idiotic</em> it is and how I can&#x27;t believe anyone could <em>possibly</em> be dumb enough to use such a heuristic and I&#x27;m so glad that I don&#x27;t use any heuristics <em>that</em> stupid...</p><p>And so it goes.</p><h3><strong>Fusion, substitution, and your journey into the mind</strong></h3><p>I&#x27;ve been ignoring the second part of substitution, the part where you don&#x27;t notice that you did a substitution. Hmmm, not noticing when something that feels like &quot;just giving an answer&quot; is actually composed of a multi step heuristic selection process. If I squint, this sort of looks like fusion. A very light sort of fusion, depending on how readily I go &quot;Oh yeah, oops&quot; when the substitution is pointed out. </p><p>&quot;Wait, you seem to be diluting the meaning of fusion to refer to any sort of lack of awareness of what your mind is doing!&quot;</p><p>Yeah, I&#x27;m definitely using fusion pretty broadly. I&#x27;m proposing that you can use fusion and substitution as two general lenses to explore how you&#x27;re mind actually works. What is your mind <strong>doing</strong>, and how much are you <strong>aware</strong> of what it is doing? If you dig into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy\">ACT</a>, you&#x27;ll find that cognitive fusion is a richer concept with more backing than what I&#x27;m describing. If you read the paper I linked at he beginning, you&#x27;ll find Kahneman and Frederick digging into all sorts of interesting mechanisms that govern how and when heuristics get applied. </p><p>I&#x27;m proposing thinking in terms of fusion and substitution as a first step out of &quot;dumb mistakes&quot; thinking. &quot;I don&#x27;t like the fact that my future is an empty hopeless void&quot;. Maybe I&#x27;m &quot;just being dumb&quot; and I should &quot;get over it.&quot; Or maybe I substituted &quot;Will there be anything good in my future?&quot; with &quot;Is there anything good in my life right now?&quot; (because predicting the future is hard) and then fused to that (because it&#x27;s a super emotionally charged low level thought and I&#x27;ve never trained in defusion). They both point to the same problem. Which one is easier to solve?</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a body created by Congress to study the impact of advances in AI on US national security has put out a <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2019/07/in-search-of-ideas-the-national-security-commission-on-artificial-intelligence-wants-you/\">call for essays</a> which analyze how advances in artificial intelligence could affect US government and security policy. There are 5 specific prompts, which I summarize as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How will AI affect the nature of war, and more generally interstate competition at or below the level of armed conflict?</li>\n<li>What kind of military and non-military AI capabilities should the US government invest in? What AI-related skills will be necessary for the national-security workforce in the future?</li>\n<li>What kind of infrastructure, institutions and organizational structures will be best suited for ensuring AI development?\n<ol>\n<li>What kinds of AI research should the US national security community engage in?</li>\n<li>Will this research require the creation of new institutions?</li>\n<li>What other kinds of infrastructure are necessary to create a sustainable advantage in artificial intelligence, and what are the ethical concerns with attempting to create a sustainable advantage?</li>\n<li>How will government acquisition processes need to change?</li>\n<li>What kinds of data are necessary for developing AI applications and tools? What are the ethical and security concerns related to collecting, analyzing and storing this data?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What should the US do to influence global norms around artificial intelligence? Given that there are many nations pursuing AI, what should the US do to influence adversaries' AI development?</li>\n<li>How should the government interact with the private sector? How can the private sector educate the government about the capabilities and risks of AI? What can the government and the private sector do that AI systems used for national security are trusted, by the public, strategic decision-makers, and allies?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm heartened to see the government taking the risks of AI more seriously, and I think submitting an essay here is a relatively low-effort way that someone, as a member of the public, can get their opinions regarding the risks and opportunities around AI development in front of a body specifically tasked with creating recommendations for future AI development and regulation.</p>\n</body></html>",

But in general, we need some method for approximating these integrals.</p><p>The two most common approximation methods used in practice are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_method\">Laplace approximation</a> around the maximum-likelihood point, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo\">MCMC</a> (see e.g. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cong_Han3/publication/4986746_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Computing_Bayes_Factors_A_Comparative_Review/links/5614298308ae4ce3cc638b8b/Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo-Methods-for-Computing-Bayes-Factors-A-Comparative-Review.pdf\">here</a> for application of MCMC to Bayes factors). We&#x27;ll mainly talk about Laplace approximation here - in practice MCMC mostly works well in the same cases, assuming the unobserved parameters are continuous.</p><h2>Laplace Approximation</h2><p>Here&#x27;s the idea of Laplace approximation. First, posterior distributions tend to be very pointy. This is mainly because independent probabilities multiply, so probabilities tend to scale exponentially with the number of data points. Think of the probabilities we calculated in the last two posts, with values like <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"10^{-70}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">10</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.591em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">−</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">70</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> or <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"10^{-20}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">10</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.591em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">−</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">20</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> - that&#x27;s the typical case. If we&#x27;re integrating over a function with values like that, we can basically just pay attention to the region around the highest value - other regions will have exponentially small weight.</p><p>Laplace&#x27; trick is to use a second-order approximation within that high-valued region.  Specifically, since probabilities naturally live on a log scale, we&#x27;ll take a second order-approximation of the log likelihood around its maximum point.

See <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hBJCMWELaW6MxinYW/intertheoretic-utility-comparison\">this first post</a> for a reminder of the different types of utility function normalisation.</p>\n<p>Most of the normalisation techniques can be conceived of as a game with two outcomes, and each player can pay a certain amount of their utility to flip from one one outcome to another. Then we can use the maximal amount of utility they are willing to pay, as the common measuring stick for normalisation.</p>\n<p>Consider for example the min-max normalisation: this assigns utility <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"0\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">0</span></span></span></span></span></span> to the expected utility if the agent makes the worst possible decisions, and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> if they make the best possible ones.</p>\n<p>So, if your utility function is <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"u\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">u</span></span></span></span></span></span>, the question is: how much utility would you be willing to pay to prevent your nemesis (a <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"-u\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">−</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">u</span></span></span></span></span></span> maximiser) from controlling the decision process, and let you take it over instead?

For this, the game is as follows: how much would you be willing to pay to prevent a policy from choosing randomly amongst the outcomes (\"mean\"), and let you take over the decision process instead?</p>\n<p>Conversely, the mean min-mean normalisation asks how much you would be willing to pay to prevent your nemesis from controlling the decision process, and shifting to a random process instead.</p>\n<p>The mean difference method is a bit different: here, two outcomes are chosen at random, and you are asked now much you are willing to pay to shift from the worst outcome to the best. The expectation of that amount is used for normalisation.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7kvBxG9ZmYb5rDRiq/gains-from-trade-slug-versus-galaxy-how-much-would-i-give-up\">mutual Worth bargaining solution</a> has a similar interpretation: how much would you be willing to pay to move from the default option, to one where you controlled all decisions?</p>\n<p>A few normalisations don't seem to fit into the this framework, most especially those that depend on the <em>square</em> of the utility, such as variance normalisation or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargaining_problem#Nash_bargaining_solution\">Nash Bargaining solution</a>. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalai%E2%80%93Smorodinsky_bargaining_solution\">Kalai–Smorodinsky bargaining solution</a> uses a similar normalisation as the mutual worth bargaining solution, but chooses the outcome differently: if the default point is at the origin, it will pick the point <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"(x,x)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">,</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space1\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> with largest <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"x\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-zMmRZ7kZbpNpoGkN6-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This, of course, would incentivise you to lie - but that problem is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myerson%E2%80%93Satterthwaite_theorem\">unavoidable</a> in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gtGjiizupfCYCz7Lo/even-with-default-points-systems-remain-exploitable\">bargaining</a> anyway. <a href=\"#fnref-zMmRZ7kZbpNpoGkN6-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n</body></html>",

I am exasperated that this is even up for debate, but I figure that making the argumentation here explicit is helpful]</p>\n<p>Carter and Quinn are discussing charitable matters in the town square, with a few onlookers.</p>\n<p>Carter: \"So, this local charity, People Against Drowning Puppies (PADP), is nominally opposed to drowning puppies.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Of course.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"And they said they'd saved 2170 puppies last year, whereas their total spending was $1.2 million, so they estimate they save one puppy per $553.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Sounds about right.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"So, I actually checked with some of their former employees, and if what they say and my corresponding calculations are right, they actually only saved 138 puppies.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Hold it right there. Regardless of whether that's true, it's bad to say that.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"That's an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences\">appeal to consequences</a>, well-known to be a logical fallacy.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Is that really a fallacy, though? If saying something has bad consequences, isn't it normative not to say it?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Well, for my own personal decisionmaking, I'm broadly a consequentialist, so, yes.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Well, it follows that appeals to consequences are valid.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"It isn't <em>logically</em> valid. If saying something has bad consequences, that doesn't make it false.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"But it is decision-theoretically <em>compelling</em>, right?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"In theory, if it could be proven, yes. But, you haven't offered any proof, just a statement that it's bad.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Okay, let's discuss that. My argument is: PADP is a good charity. Therefore, they should be getting more donations. Saying that they didn't save as many puppies as they claimed they did, in public (as you just did), is going to result in them getting fewer donations. Therefore, your saying that they didn't save as many puppies as they claimed to is bad, and is causing more puppies to drown.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"While I could spend more effort to refute that argument, I'll initially note that you only took into account a single effect (people donating less to PADP) and neglected other effects (such as people having more accurate beliefs about how charities work).\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Still, you have to admit that my case is plausible, and that some onlookers are convinced.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Yes, it's plausible, in that I don't have a full refutation, and my models have a lot of uncertainty. This gets into some complicated decision theory and sociological modeling. I'm afraid we've gotten sidetracked from the relatively clear conversation, about how many puppies PADP saved, to a relatively unclear one, about the decision theory of making actual charity effectiveness clear to the public.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Well, sure, we're into the weeds now, but this is important! If it's actually bad to say what you said, it's important that this is widely recognized, so that we can have fewer... <em>mistakes</em> like that.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"That's correct, but I feel like I might be getting trolled. Anyway, I think you're shooting the messenger: when I started criticizing PADP, you turned around and made the criticism about me saying that, directing attention against PADP's possible fraudulent activity.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"You still haven't refuted my argument. If you don't do so, I win by default.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"I'd really rather that we just outlaw appeals to consequences, but, fine, as long as we're here, I'm going to do this, and it'll be a learning experience for everyone involved. First, you said that PADP is a good charity. Why do you think this?\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Well, I know the people there and they seem nice and hardworking.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"But, they said they saved over 2000 puppies last year, when they actually only saved 138, indicating some important dishonesty and ineffectiveness going on.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"<em>Allegedly</em>, according to <em>your calculations</em>. Anyway, saying that is bad, as I've already argued.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Hold up! We're in the middle of <em>evaluating</em> your argument that saying that is bad! You can't use the conclusion of this argument in the course of proving it! That's circular reasoning!\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Fine. Let's try something else. You said they're being <em>dishonest</em>. But, I know them, and they wouldn't tell a lie, consciously, although it's possible that they might have some motivated reasoning, which is totally different. It's really <em>uncivil</em> to call them dishonest like that. If everyone did that with the willingness you had to do so, that would lead to an all-out rhetorical <em>war</em>...\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"God damn it. You're making another appeal to consequences.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Yes, because I think appeals to consequences are normative.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Look, at the start of this conversation, your argument was that saying PADP only saved 138 puppies is bad.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"And now you're in the course of arguing that it's bad.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Whether it's bad is a matter of fact.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"So we have to be trying to get the right answer, when we're determining whether it's bad.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"And, while appeals to consequences may be decision theoretically compelling, they don't directly bear on the facts.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"So we shouldn't have appeals to consequences in conversations about whether the consequences of saying something is bad.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Why not?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Because we're trying to get to the truth.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"But aren't we also trying to avoid all-out rhetorical wars, and puppies drowning?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"If we want to do those things, we have to do them <em>by</em> getting to the truth.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"The truth, <em>according to your opinion-</em>\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"God damn it, you just keep trolling me, so we never get to discuss the actual facts. God damn it. Fuck you.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Now you're just spouting insults. That's really irresponsible, given that I just accused you of doing something bad, and causing more puppies to drown.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"You just keep controlling the conversation by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop\">OODA looping</a> faster than me, though. I can't refute your argument, because you appeal to consequences again in the middle of the refutation. And then we go another step down the ladder, and never get to the truth.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"So what do you expect me to do? Let you insult well-reputed animal welfare workers by calling them <em>dishonest</em>?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"<em>Yes</em>! I'm modeling the PADP situation using <em>decision-theoretic models</em>, which require me to <em>represent</em> the knowledge states and optimization pressures exerted by different agents (both conscious and unconscious), including when these optimization pressures are towards deception, and even when this deception is unconscious!\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Sounds like a bunch of nerd talk. Can you speak more plainly?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"I'm modeling the actual facts of how PADP operates and how effective they are, not just how well-liked the people are.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Wow, that's a strawman.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Look, how do you think arguments are supposed to work, exactly? Whoever is best at claiming that their opponent's argumentation is evil wins?\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Sure, isn't that the same thing as who's making better arguments?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"If we argue by proving our statements are true, we reach the truth, and thereby reach the good. If we argue by proving each other are being evil, we don't reach the truth, nor the good.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"In this case, though, we're talking about <em>drowning puppies</em>. Surely, the good in this case is causing fewer puppies to drown, and directing more resources to the people saving them.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"That's under contention, though! If PADP is lying about how many puppies they're saving, they're making the epistemology of the puppy-saving field worse, leading to fewer puppies being saved. And, they're taking money away from the next-best-looking charity, which is probably more effective if, unlike PADP, they're not lying.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"How do you know that, though? How do you know the money wouldn't go to things other than saving drowning puppies if it weren't for PADP?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"I don't know that. My guess is that the money might go to other animal welfare charities that claim high cost-effectiveness.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"PADP is quite effective, though. Even if your calculations are right, they save about one puppy per $10,000. That's pretty good.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"That's not even that impressive, but even if their direct work is relatively effective, they're destroying the epistemology of the puppy-saving field by lying. So effectiveness basically caps out there instead of getting better due to better epistemology.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"What an exaggeration. There are lots of other charities that have misleading marketing (which is totally not the same thing as lying). PADP isn't singlehandedly destroying anything, except instances of puppies drowning.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"I'm beginning to think that the difference between us is that I'm anti-lying, whereas you're pro-lying.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Look, I'm only in favor of lying when it has good consequences. That makes me different from pro-lying scoundrels.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"But you have really sloppy reasoning about whether lying, in fact, has good consequences. Your arguments for doing so, when you lie, are made of Swiss cheese.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Well, I can't deductively <em>prove</em> anything about the real world, so I'm using the most relevant considerations I can.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"But you're using reasoning processes that systematically protect certain cached facts from updates, and use these cached facts to justify not updating. This was very clear when you used outright circular reasoning, to use the cached fact that denigrating PADP is bad, to justify terminating my argument that it wasn't bad to denigrate them. Also, you said the PADP people were nice and hardworking as a reason I shouldn't accuse them of dishonesty... but, the fact that PADP saved far fewer puppies than they claimed actually casts doubt on those facts, and the relevance of them to PADP's effectiveness. You didn't update when I first told you that fact, you instead started committing rhetorical violence against me.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Hmm. Let me see if I'm getting this right. So, you think I have false cached facts in my mind, such as PADP being a good charity.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Correct.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"And you think those cached facts tend to protect themselves from being updated.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Correct.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"And you think they protect themselves from updates by generating bad consequences of making the update, such as fewer people donating to PADP.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Correct.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"So you want to outlaw appeals to consequences, so facts have to get acknowledged, and these self-reinforcing loops go away.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Correct.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"That makes sense from your perspective. But, why should I think my beliefs are wrong, and that I have lots of bad self-protecting cached facts?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"If everyone were as willing as you to lie, the history books would be full of convenient stories, the newspapers would be parts of the matrix, the schools would be teaching propaganda, and so on. You'd have no reason to trust your own arguments that speaking the truth is bad.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Well, I guess that makes sense. Even though I lie in the name of good values, not everyone agrees on values or beliefs, so they'll lie to promote their own values according to their own beliefs.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Exactly. So you should expect that, as a reflection to your lying to the world, the world lies back to you. So your head is full of lies, like the 'PADP is effective and run by good people' one.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Even if that's true, what could I possibly do about it?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"You could start by not making appeals to consequences. When someone is arguing that a belief of yours is wrong, listen to the argument at the object level, instead of jumping to the question of whether saying the relevant arguments out loud is a good idea, which is a much harder question.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"But how do I prevent actually bad consequences from happening?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"If your head is full of lies, you can't really trust ad-hoc object-level arguments against speech, like 'saying PADP didn't save very many puppies is bad because PADP is a good charity'. You can instead think about what discourse norms lead to the truth being revealed, and which lead to it being obscured. We've seen, during this conversation, that appeals to consequences tend to obscure the truth. And so, if we share the goal of reaching the truth together, we can agree not to do those.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"That still doesn't answer my question. What about things that are actually bad, like privacy violations?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"It does seem plausible that there should be some discourse norms that protect privacy, so that some facts aren't revealed, if such norms have good consequences overall. Perhaps some topics, such as individual people's sex lives, are considered to be banned topics (in at least some spaces), unless the person consents.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Isn't that an appeal to consequences, though?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Not really. Deciding what privacy norms are best requires thinking about consequences. But, once those norms have been decided on, it is no longer necessary to prove that privacy violations are bad during discussions. There's a simple norm to appeal to, which says some things are out of bounds for discussion. And, these exceptions can be made without allowing appeals to consequences in full generality.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Okay, so we still have something like appeals to consequences at the level of norms, but not at the level of individual arguments.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Exactly.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"Does this mean I have to say a relevant true fact, even if I think it's bad to say it?\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"No. Those situations happen frequently, and while some radical honesty practitioners try not to suppress any impulse to say something true, this practice is probably a bad idea for a lot of people. So, of course you can evaluate consequences in your head before deciding to say something.\"</p>\n<p>Quinn: \"So, in summary: if we're going to have suppression of some facts being said out loud, we should have that through either clear norms designed with consequences (including consequences for epistemology) in mind, or individuals deciding not to say things, but otherwise our norms should be protecting true speech, and outlawing appeals to consequences.\"</p>\n<p>Carter: \"Yes, that's exactly right! I'm glad we came to agreement on this.\"</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Epistemic status: A cute insight that explains why it might feel like you always have to make sacrifices along one metric to get improvements along another. Seems tautological once you understand it. Might be obvious to everyone.</em></p><p><em>Meta-epistemic status or something: My first post. Testing the waters.</em></p><p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> Skip to the last paragraph.</p><h2>Example of a trade-off</h2><p>I&#x27;m a programmer. I&#x27;m also a design prude. I&#x27;m also lazy. This all means that I spend a lot of my time chasing some different metrics in my code:</p><p>1) How easy it is to read.</p><p>2) How long it takes to run.</p><p>3) How long it takes to write.</p><p>4) ...</p><p>These metrics are often at odds with one another. Just the other day I had to make a trade-off involving a function I&#x27;d written to evaluate a polynomial at a given point. Originally, it was written in a way that I felt was self-explanatory: it looped over the derivatives-at-zero of the polynomial, which were passed in as a list, and summed up the appropriate multiples of powers of x — a Taylor sum. Pseudo-code:</p><pre><code>def apply_polynomial( deriv, x ):<br/>    sum = 0<br/>    for i from 0 to length( deriv ):<br/>        sum += deriv[i] * pow(x, i) / factorial(i)<br/>    return sum</code></pre><p>It turned out that this function was a significant bottleneck in the execution time of my program: about 20% of it was spent inside this function. I was reasonably sure that the <u>pow</u> and <u>factorial</u> functions were the issue. I also knew that this function would only ever be called with cubics and lower-degree polynomials. So I re-wrote the code as follows:</p><pre><code>def apply_cubic( deriv, x ):<br/>    sum = 0<br/>    len = length( deriv )<br/><br/>    if len &gt; 0:<br/>        sum += deriv[0]<br/>        if len &gt; 1:<br/>            sum += deriv[1] * x<br/>            if len &gt; 2:<br/>                square = x * x<br/>                sum += deriv[2] * square / 2<br/>                if len &gt; 3:<br/>                    cube = square * x<br/>                    sum += deriv[3] * cube / 6<br/><br/>    return sum</code></pre><p>Sure enough, this improved the runtime significantly — by nearly the whole 20% that had been being spent inside this function. But notice that the code no longer contains the elements that define a Taylor sum: the loop is gone, and the factorials (0!, 1!, 2!, 3!) have been replaced with their values (1, 1, 2, 6). It also isn&#x27;t obvious why the length comparisons stop at 3. The code no longer explains itself, and must be commented to be understood. Readability has been sacrificed on the altar of efficiency.</p><h2>Question</h2><p>Why am I cursed so? Why can&#x27;t these metrics go hand-in-hand? And in general, why am I always doing this sort of thing? Sacrificing flavor for nutrition in the cafeteria, sacrificing walking-speed for politeness on a crowded sidewalk? Why are my goals so often set against one another?</p><h2>Answer</h2><p>Let&#x27;s take a second to think about what a trade-off is.</p><p>Suppose you&#x27;re faced with a problem to solve. You have two solutions in mind (Solution A &amp; Solution B), and you have two metrics (Metric 1 &amp; Metric 2) by which to judge a solution. A trade-off occurs when the solution that scores better along Metric 1 scores worse along Metric 2:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XM6m94G.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>For example:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iOjEPAD.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>Of course, there need not be only two possible solutions. Maybe I&#x27;m willing to spend two hours working on improving this function, and depending on what I focus on, I could achieve any of the following balances:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Or0omwA.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>And — argh! The correlation is negative! Why!</p><p>Well, there&#x27;s a reason, and the reason is that this isn&#x27;t the full picture. This is:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JAxav19.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>See, there are a whole bunch of ways to write the code that are neither as efficient nor as readable as one of the filled-in circles on the perimeter. But I would never choose any of those ways, for obvious reasons. And if a new solution occurs to me that beats out some of my old solutions along <em>both</em> metrics...</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pgyUCHa.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>...then this new solution would replace all the solutions strictly worse than it, which in turn would become part of the mass that resides below the curve:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GAFer8r.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>No matter how many new solutions are introduced into the mix, and no matter by how far they out-perform the old solutions, the outer frontier of non-dominated solutions must have negative slope everywhere. A step to the right along this line must be accompanied by a step downward, because if it isn&#x27;t, then the solution you just stepped off of is dominated by the one you just stepped onto, so the former wasn&#x27;t on the line.</p><p>It doesn&#x27;t take any math to generalize this result to situations where you have more than two metrics. Any solution that is dominated by another solution will be thrown out, so the options you end up considering form a set where no element dominates another, a.k.a. one where a gain along one metric entails a loss along at least one other, a.k.a. a trade-off. Throwing out obviously-poor solutions is easy (and is sometimes done subconsciously when you&#x27;re working in your domain of expertise, or done by other people before a decision gets to you), but weighing the remaining options usually takes some consideration. So, our subjective experience is that we spend most of our time and energy thinking about trade-offs. Q.E.D.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>Note:</em> Down <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Nndc7jMB2oFzLvryP/why-it-feels-like-everything-is-a-trade-off#5GiERqP9cYwCKmxBN\">below</a>, Dagon has written a comment explaining something that I meant to make more explicit in this post. Since they&#x27;ve expressed it better than I can, I&#x27;m just going to copy-paste their comment here:</p><blockquote>One reason that most of your actual decisions involve tradeoffs is that easy no-tradeoff decisions get made quickly and don&#x27;t take up much of  your time, so you don&#x27;t notice them.  Many of the clear wins with no real downside are already baked into the context of the choices you&#x27;re making. For the vast majority of topics you&#x27;ll face, you&#x27;re late in the idea-evolution process, and the trivial wins are already in there.</blockquote>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and\">post</a> by Kaj Sotala, he introduces the very useful idea of cognitive fusion.</p><blockquote>Cognitive fusion is a term from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy\">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</a> (ACT), which refers to a person &#x201C;fusing together&#x201D; with the content of a thought or emotion, so that the content is experienced as an objective fact about the world rather than as a mental construct. The most obvious example of this might be if you get really upset with someone else and become convinced that something was <em>all their fault</em> (even if you had actually done something blameworthy too).<br>In this example, your anger isn&#x2019;t letting you see clearly, and you can&#x2019;t step back from your anger to question it, because you have become &#x201C;fused together&#x201D; with it and experience everything in terms of the anger&#x2019;s internal logic.</blockquote><p>You can become fused to an emotion, a voice in your head, a political view, and experience it to &quot;just be true&quot;. I see this as a similar sort of fusion I hear musician talk about, where after years of practice their instrument begin to feel like a part of their body. They aren&apos;t &quot;using their index finger to press the black note on a piano&quot; they are &quot;just playing G&quot;. This is analogous to being so caught up in your own anger that your partner is &quot;just wrong and terrible&quot; as opposed to &quot;it sorta looks like you intentionally did something to annoy me and I&apos;m worried about if you&apos;ll do this again in the future.&quot; (or whatever the actual case is)</p><p>Sometimes I think of there being a general fusion process where the brain collapses levels of inference. All of the steps that go into a given physical motion or thought process get compressed into a single dot. The thought process will be experienced as &quot;just true&quot; and the physical motion will be experience as an atomic action available to you. Sometimes you can &quot;uncompress&quot; the chain, and sometimes you can&apos;t.</p><p>Problems can arise when you fuse to a thought or emotion that doesn&apos;t have an accurate view of the world, and you unknowingly take it&apos;s broken map as the territory.</p><h3><strong>Isn&apos;t this just &quot;Don&apos;t make assumptions&quot;?</strong></h3><p>Not quite, though it is similar. Assumptions don&apos;t really capture the more general fusing process that you can also see with physical movement. &quot;I can&apos;t believe that you just assumed you start off on your left foot when making a layup!&quot; Nah, doesn&apos;t feel right. But the main reason I prefer to talk in terms of fusion is that &quot;fusion&quot; makes me focus on the process of attaching to something, while &quot;assumptions&quot; makes me focus on the object being attached to. </p><p>It&apos;s easier to see this difference when the thought being fused to (or the claim being assumed) is &quot;obviously&quot; wrong, or at least obvious to one who isn&apos;t fused to it. The assumption frame makes me feel like my work is done when I find the other persons &quot;dumb&quot; assumption. Point it out with a pithy &quot;Checkmate [outgroup]&quot; and move on. The fusion frame leads me to ask &quot;How did they get fused to this in the first place? How might I help them defuse from it?&quot; By focusing on the process of attachment (fusion) I can appreciate how common it is to fuse to something and how hard it can be to defuse. When I focus on the  object of attachment (assumption) I&apos;m mostly thinking about just how <em>stupid</em> it is and how I can&apos;t believe that anyone would be <em>dumb</em> enough to fall for this, and I most certainly don&apos;t believe anything that stupid....</p><p>And so it goes. Thinking of some behavior as a &quot;dumb mistake&quot; makes you <em>more likely to not notice when you engage in it</em>. Some thoughts take moments to defuse from. Others take a lifetime. Sometimes you fuse to things, and you&apos;d be wise to learn how it works rather than to ridicule it.</p><p>As you may have guessed, later parts of this sequence will talk about what can happen when you fuse with language. For now, just remember what fusion is, and treat it with respect.</p><blockquote>&quot;Modern man can&apos;t see God because he doesn&apos;t look low enough.&quot;</blockquote><p>-- Carl Jung</p>",

Yet it was a simple mechanical invention. It would seem to require no brilliant inventive insight, and certainly no scientific background.</blockquote><blockquote>Why, then, wasn’t it invented much earlier?</blockquote><blockquote>I asked this question <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford/status/1143622870477791233\">on Twitter</a>, and read some discussion <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-come-bicycles-werent-invented-earlier-in-history-What-was-missing\">on Quora</a>. People proposed many hypotheses, including:</blockquote><blockquote><strong>+ Technology factors.</strong> Metalworking improved a lot in the 1800s: we got improved iron refining and eventually cheap steel, better processes for shaping metal, and ability to make parts like hollow tubes. Wheel technology improved: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wheel\">wire-spoke</a> (aka tension-spoked) wheels replaced heavier designs; vulcanized rubber (1839) was needed for tires; inflatable tires weren’t invented until 1887. Chains, gears, and ball bearings are all crucial parts that require advanced manufacturing techniques for precision and cost.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>+ Design iteration.</strong> Early bicycles were inconvenient and dangerous. The first version didn’t even have pedals. Some versions didn’t have steering, and could only be turned by leaning. (!) The famous “penny-farthing” design, with its huge front wheel, made it impossible to balance with your feet, was prone to tipping forward on a hard stop, and generally left the rider high in the air, all of which increased risk of injury. It took decades of iteration to get to a successful bicycle model.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>+ Quality of roads.</strong> Roads in the 1800s and earlier were terrible by modern standards. Roads were often dirt, rutted from the passage of many carts, turning muddy in the rain. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadam\">Macadam paving</a>, which gave smooth surfaces to roads, wasn’t invented until about 1820. City roads at the time were paved with cobblestones, which were good for horses but too bumpy for bicycles. (The unevenness was apparently a feature, assisting in the runoff of sewage—leading <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-come-bicycles-werent-invented-earlier-in-history-What-was-missing/answer/Chris-Crawford-6\">one Quora answer</a> to claim that the construction of city sewers was what opened the door to bicycles.)</blockquote><blockquote><strong>+ Competition from horses.</strong> Horses were a common and accepted mode of transportation at the time. They could deal with all kinds of roads. They could carry heavy loads. Who then needs a bicycle? In this connection, it has been claimed that the bicycle was invented in response to food shortages due to the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer\">Year without a Summer</a>”, an 1816 weather event caused by the volcanic explosion of Mt. Tambora the year earlier, which darkened skies and lowered temperatures in many parts of the world. The agricultural crisis caused horses as well as people to starve, which led to some horses being slaughtered for food, and made the remaining ones more expensive to feed. This could have motivated the search for alternatives.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>+ General economic growth.</strong> Multiple commenters pointed out the need for a middle class to provide demand for such an invention. If all you have are a lot of poor peasants and a few aristocrats (who, by the way, have horses, carriages, and drivers), there isn’t much of a market for bicycles. This is more plausible when you realize that bicycles were more of a hobby for entertainment before they became a practical means of transportation.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>+ Cultural factors.</strong> Maybe there was just a general lack of interest in useful mechanical inventions until a certain point in history? But when did this change, and why?</blockquote><blockquote>These are all good hypotheses. But some of them start to buckle under pressure:</blockquote><blockquote>The quality of roads is relevant, but not really the answer. Bicycles can be ridden on dirt roads or sidewalks (although the latter led to run-ins with pedestrians and made bicycles unpopular among the public at first). And historically, roads didn’t improve until <em>after</em>bicycles became common—indeed it seems that it was in part the cyclists who called for the improvement of roads.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t think horses explain it either. A bicycle, from what I’ve read, was cheaper to buy than a horse, and it was certainly cheaper to maintain (if nothing else, you don’t have to feed a bicycle). And it turns out that inventors were interested in the problem of human-powered vehicles, dispensing with the need for horses, for a long time before the modern bicycle. Even Karl von Drais, who invented the first two-wheeled human-powered vehicle after the Year without a Summer, had been working on the problem for years before that.</blockquote><blockquote>Technology factors are more convincing to me. They may have been necessary for bicycles to become practical and cheap enough to take off. But they weren’t needed for early experimentation. Frames can be built of wood. Wheels can be rimmed with metal. Gears can be omitted. Chains can be replaced with belts; some early designs even used treadles instead of pedals, and at least one design drove the wheels with levers, as on a steam locomotive.</blockquote><blockquote>So what’s the real explanation?</blockquote><p>(<a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-bicycle\">Continue reading</a>. 2,184 words and lots of great bicycle pictures.)</p><p>This post is a single piece from Jason Crawford&#x27;s project, <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/about\">The Roots of Progress</a><em>, </em>aptly named, to understand the nature and causes of human progress. I haven&#x27;t thought deeply enough to check his research, but it&#x27;s a fascinating project. This essay examines a specific piece of technology, but the case study is used to develop and support models of what it takes for progress to occur.</p>",

The workshop taught the Ease process, which is a mental self debugging framework developed by Matt Goldenberg. The Ease framework incorporates various things he learned and developed during his 5 years of working as a personal coach. </p><p>The Ease process is a step by step method going through </p><ul><li><strong>Awareness </strong>- noticing you thoughts, feelings and other mental objects</li><li><strong>Introspection</strong> - finding the root cause of what is going on in your mind</li><li><strong>Acceptance</strong> - accepting that you are who you are in the present and the choices you have done in the past</li><li><strong>Alignment</strong> - creating peace between your internal parts that are involved in the issue you are trying to fix</li><li><strong>Ecology</strong> - checking that whatever shift you made in you mind during the alignment step, does not create new problems elsewhere</li><li><strong>Creation </strong>- building the attitude, habits and external support that you need to keep on track with your new solution</li><li><strong>Integration</strong> - deeply integrate and reinforce new habits and attitude into your mind</li></ul><p>Most of the material was taught by Matt. Ryan Thomas, Deni Pop, Toon Alfrink and Linda Linsefors (me) gave one or two lectures each and, to different extents, helped participants during exercises. </p><p>Overall the workshop went really well. We got several pieces of positive feedback during the workshop, and from the feedback form as well, although there is room for improvement (see further down). On average the participants estimated the time spent at the workshop to 9.5 times more productive compared to what they would have done otherwise, with answers ranging from 0.5 to 50.</p><p>&quot;I was very impressed by the quality of the workshop; to be able to string together so many disparate theories, tools, and techniques into a single coherent framework, is nothing short of genius. Brilliant work!&quot; - Olivier Maas (participant)</p><h1>Who we are</h1><p><strong>Matt Goldenberg</strong> has been working intensely on self-improvement for the past 15 years, was a professional coach for 5 years and has been running applied rationality group workshops for the past 18 months. </p><p><strong>Linda Linsefors</strong> organizes workshops. She gets the job done.</p><p><strong>Toon Alfrink</strong> firmly decided to turn around his mental health issues once and for all. Somehow, this time, it actually worked. He visited a Zen Monastery for 3 months and hasn’t been depressed ever since. His productivity benefited just as much, going from struggling at half speed in uni to running an AI Safety startup, the LW Netherlands community, and getting good grades in uni all at once. To the extent that he has an idea how the hell all of this happened, he would like to teach you.</p><p><strong>Denisa Pop</strong> was a licensed cognitive-behavioral therapist for 5 years and has a PhD in positive human-animal interaction. Now she uses her previous knowledge to improve human-human interaction, doing research in rational compassion and being a Community Manager at the EA hotel.</p><p><strong>Ryan Thomas </strong>is a student of mindfulness and cognitive psychology. He’s spent the last several years traveling in order to learn and practice techniques for resolving internal conflict and solidifying self alignment.</p><h1>Things that could have gone better</h1><p>The first Athena Rationality Workshop was definitely rushed in several ways. We started planning the workshop just a few weeks before the event which was not enough time. The schedule was finalized only the day before the workshop. </p><p>If we had started planning earlier we would have had time to notice that the schedule was way too full and time to figure out which parts would be OK to cut out which out hurting the rest of the program. Some lessons were cut out during the workshop, but mostly the result of this mistake was that the workshop itself was rushed too. The participants did not get enough time to practice the techniques or to rest and digest what had been learned.</p><p>Another mistake that can also be traced to not having enough preparation time, is that some of us who were supposed to be around as mentors during exercises (me among others) were badly prepared. For me about two thirds of the content of the workshop was new, so I ended up spending most of the workshop just learning the stuff for myself, rather than helping others. </p><h1>How to do this better next time</h1><p>The reason the workshop planning was rushed is because we wanted to do it before Matt flew back to the US. Buy the time we decided to run the workshop, we could do it fast or not at all. This will not be a problem for the next workshop because we have already started the preparations. </p><p>As for Matt’s location, given the outcome of the first workshop, we are more secure in the value of the Athena Rationality Workshop, which means we can charge enough money for the event, in order to just fly Matt over when we need him.</p><p>Based on the feedback from the first Athena Rationality Workshop, we are going to cut down the content to only include the most useful and essential parts. The next workshop will be both shorter and less intense. (We are also discussing developing a more advanced week long version of the workshop, but that will take a bit longer.) </p><p>Before the next workshop, we also plan to have a few days of mentorship training, so that everyone who is mentoring during the workshop knows all the techniques, and knows what to do during the workshop. </p><h1>The Next Athena Rationality Workshop</h1><p>We are planning to run the next Athena Rationality Workshop some time in October or November, possibly adjacent to EA Global in London.

In particular, can we say anything about the physical asymmetry of the die? Jaynes <a href=\"https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/entropy.concentration.pdf\">addressed</a> this exact question; we will test some of his models here.</p><h2>Elongated Cube Models</h2><p>Jaynes suggests that, if the die were machined, then it would be pretty easy to first cut an even square along two dimensions. But the cut in the third dimension would be more difficult; getting the length to match the other two dimensions would be tricky. Based on this, we&#x27;d expect to see an asymmetry which gives two opposite faces (1 &amp; 6, 2 &amp; 5, or 3 &amp; 4) different probabilities from all the other faces.</p><p>Here&#x27;s what the model looks like for the 1 &amp; 6 pair:</p><ul><li>1 &amp; 6 each have the same probability <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal;

So based on the data, the model with just the 1-6 pip difference is a bit better, but we&#x27;re not entirely sure. My guess is that a fancier model could significantly beat both of these by predicting that the effect of a pip difference scales with the number of pips, rather than just using whole separate parameters for the 1-6 and 2-5 differences.

They&#x27;re all considered to be pretty good sources of protein, by most doctors, but they all have downsides:</p><ul><li>Steak is linked to heart disease, </li><li>fish contains higher levels of heavy metals, and</li><li>chicken is just kind of bland.</li></ul><p>What should you do?</p><p>A nutrition plan is a little bit like a stock portfolio, in that you can diversify away risk by investing a small amount in several different companies at once. However, many of the risks we talk about with nutrition are linked to the <em>over</em>consumption of specific foods. That means that diversification is super effective!</p><p>So the smart satisficer&#x27;s move is to have <strong>all three, but cycle them</strong>. If we&#x27;re planning for the week, we might do chicken Monday-Wednesday-Friday, and then on the other 4 days alternate between steak and fish. This does require a bit of planning on your part, but if you stick to variations between just a handful of pretty-good sources, I think it&#x27;s pretty feasible. </p><p>(Note that I&#x27;m considering &quot;Grilled chicken breast is really healthy, but I had it every night for three weeks and I&#x27;m never touching it again&quot; as a strong long term <em>and</em> short term risk of overconsumption. In fact, since this seems to happen often with the healthiest foods we eat, I would strongly advise you to update on this prior as well: Extremely healthy foods <em>need</em> to be cycled in and out with their only very healthy, but tasty, options.)</p>",

(Update: the postmortem is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oW6mbA3XHzcfJTwNq/raise-post-mortem\">here</a>) One of those projects was the AI Safety prerequisites online course <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vi48CMtZL8ZkRpuad/soon-a-weekly-ai-safety-prerequisites-module-on-lesswrong\">originally announced here</a>. We're sharing the curriculum here in almost plaintext format so that people can easily find and access it. There is also a GDoc <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1louAk5-mVlE1N8gr3DG1azK07NuR_ncgi4rAAbWz1kc/edit\">here</a>. (Note: two other products of RAISE are series of lessons on IRL and IDA. They don't have such neatly formed curriculums, and they are still accessible as online lessons.)</p>\n<p>It was supposed to be a guide for helping people who want to get into AI safety research. It contains only foundations of math topics (<a href=\"#Logic_and_proof_path\">Logic and proof</a>, <a href=\"#Set_theory_path\">ZF(C) Set theory</a>, <a href=\"#Computability_theory_path\">Computability theory</a> to be precise), which are more useful for agent foundations stuff and not useful for machine learning stuff. It was planned to be extended to cover more topics, but that never happened.</p>\n<h2>How to use this</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"#Main_path\">main path</a> contains 20 levels. It is the recommended path through the curriculum. Its levels are actually short sequences of levels from the three other paths.</p>\n<p>To see what textbooks are required to study a path, see its beginning. Computability theory and set theory paths require two <strong>paid</strong> textbooks.</p>\n<p>13 out of 20 levels of the <a href=\"#Main_path\">main path</a> are covered by our online course, which is free (but still requires paid textbooks). To use the online course, <a href=\"https://app.grasple.com/#/course/141?access_token=3HCK4oRipeFY2ghyYMqDJKYX57KUnzNL\">register here</a>. You might prefer to use it instead of the text below because it provides more sense of progress, contains <strong>solutions to the exercises</strong>, has some writing mistakes fixed, maybe feels like a less tedious thing, and provides some additional exercises which we don't think are important.</p>\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p>The curriculum was made by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/eistre91\">Erik Istre</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/fowlertm\">Trent Fowler</a>.

Basic logic</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sentential Logic</li>\n<li>Truth Tables</li>\n<li>Predicate Logic</li>\n<li>Methods of Mathematical Proof</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Translate informal arguments into formal logic.</li>\n<li>Evaluate an argument as either valid or invalid.</li>\n<li>Explain how to prove an implication/conditional, a conjunction, a disjunction, and a negation and know what this looks like informally (i.e. in words and not symbols).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This builds the basic knowledge you need to be able to produce and understand mathematical proof. A firm foundation in how logical machinery operates is the best way to be assured that a proof you produce or read is correct. This also teaches the basic methods by which a proof is produced.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill Guides for this Level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_1__Basic_logic1\">Logic and proof path. Level 1. Basic logic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_2__Quantified_logic__Introduction_to_mathematical_arguments\">Logic and proof path. Level 2. Quantified logic. Introduction to mathematical arguments</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 2. Basic set theory</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Axioms of Set Theory</li>\n<li>Set Operations</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explain what a set is.</li>\n<li>Calculate the intersection, union and difference of sets.</li>\n<li>Prove two sets are equal.</li>\n<li>Apply basic axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set theory has become entrenched as the basic language with which all mathematics can be discussed. While there are more estranged parts of set theory that will likely be irrelevant to you, a fluency in the basic materials of set theory is necessary to understand more advanced mathematics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill Guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_1__Basic_set_theory\">Set theory path. Level 1. Basic set theory</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 3. Set Theoretic Relations and Enumerability</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ordered Pairs</li>\n<li>Relations</li>\n<li>Functions</li>\n<li>Enumerability</li>\n<li>Diagonalization</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define functions in terms of relations, relations in terms of ordered pairs, and ordered pairs in terms of sets.</li>\n<li>Define what a one-to-one (or injective) and onto (or surjective) function is. A function that is both is called a one-to-one correspondence (or bijective).</li>\n<li>Prove a function is one-to-one and/or onto.</li>\n<li>Explain the difference between an enumerable and a non-enumerable set.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establishing that a function is one-to-one and/or onto will be important in a myriad of circumstances, including proofs that two sets are of the same size, and is needed in establishing (most) isomorphisms.</li>\n<li>Equivalence relations and partial orderings are essential mathematical concepts which are powerful tools that can be used to analyze other mathematical objects or build new ones.</li>\n<li>Enumerability and non-enumerability introduces the difference between something being computable and non-computable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill Guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_1__Enumerability_and_diagonalization\">Computability theory path. Level 1. Enumerability and diagonalization</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_2__Set_theoretic_relations\">Set theory path. Level 2. Set theoretic relations</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 4. Formal Semantics</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Formal Semantics</li>\n<li>Model</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Evaluate the truth value of logical sentences in a given model.</li>\n<li>Build models for a set of logical sentences and then use those models to deduce information about the sentences.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An AI built on a formal system will reason based on some sort of proof and model theory. The former gives its methods of proof (which you’ll learn in the next chapter), and the latter its semantics.</li>\n<li>This level will give you your first sense of what models of logical sentences look like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_3__Formal_semantics_basics\">Logic and proof path. Level 3. Formal semantics basics</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 5. Formal Proof</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Natural Deduction Proof System</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explain the difference between a formal system of proof and our informal notion of proof.</li>\n<li>Derive proofs of logical formula in the system of natural deduction.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning mathematical proof is hard, as you may have experienced in levels 2 and 3. By learning a formal system of proof you will make your own thoughts more rigorous, understand the smallest details that need to be covered to perform a proof, and build your intuition for informal proof.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_4__Formal_proofs\">Logic and proof path. Level 4. Formal proofs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Milestone - You’re now a !</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You now understand the basics of logic and how they apply to proof.</li>\n<li>You can take an argument and peel away the content to look purely at its structural details.</li>\n<li>You understand the basics of building a model of formal sentences of logic.</li>\n<li>You know the basic building blocks of set theory.</li>\n<li>You now know there exist uncomputable functions, and you know how to rigorously define the concept of a function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take a moment to reflect on what you’ve learned so far. Remind yourself of the important concepts that you’ve come across, and mark down any concepts which are still giving you trouble. Determine whether you need to seek out further resources to clear up any confusions.</p>\n<h3>Level 6. Turing Machines and the Halting Problem</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Turing Machine</li>\n<li>The Halting Problem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe a turing machine and write basic turing algorithms.</li>\n<li>Give the basic idea of the halting problem.</li>\n<li>Give the basic idea of the proof that the halting function isn’t computable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the beginning of learning formal computability. This allows us to think about computation without the limits of a physical domain. The first step to reasoning about Artificial General Intelligence will be understanding how it can be done before we worry about its practical feasibility.</li>\n<li>The halting problem is a pervasive and annoying problem. It’ll come up again and again, in many disguises. If we could solve the halting problem, things would be easy. Since we can’t, things are hard. Understanding the limitations it imposes is important.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_2__Turing_machines_and_the_halting_problem\">Computability theory path. Level 2. Turing machines and the halting problem</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 7. Equivalence Relations and Orderings</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Equivalence Relations</li>\n<li>Partitions</li>\n<li>Orderings</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explain the relationship between equivalence relations and partitions.</li>\n<li>Name two different kinds of orderings and the conditions on the ordering relations required for these kinds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This level is about further building up your mathematical toolbox. While equivalence relations and orderings currently seem like random abstract notions, they are both very important. The former is gives you a way to instantiate different notions of equality, which is important in modeling. The latter appears in constructing models for another turing machine equivalent notion of computability, the lambda calculus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_3__Equivalence_relations_and_orderings\">Set theory path. Level 3. Equivalence relations and orderings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 8. Abacus Computability and Mathematical Proof by Induction</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Proof by Induction</li>\n<li>Abacus Computability</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explain mathematical proof by induction.</li>\n<li>Explain the abacus machine and the differences between a turing machine and an abacus machine.</li>\n<li>Build basic algorithms for an abacus machine.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mathematical proof by induction is a very powerful technique. While you’ll first learn to use it in the context of natural numbers, you’ll soon see it has applications beyond this domain.</li>\n<li>An abacus machine gives you a higher level means of expressing algorithms, allowing you to abstract away from the minute details of strokes on a tape.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_5__Proof_by_induction\">Logic and proof path. Level 5. Proof by induction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_3__Abacus_computability\">Computability theory path. Level 3. Abacus computability</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 9. The Natural Numbers in Set Theory and More Induction</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Representing Natural Numbers with Sets</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explain the relationship between inductive sets and the set theoretic construction of the natural numbers.</li>\n<li>Use the method of mathematical induction to prove claims about the natural numbers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This builds an understanding of how set theory is used to provide rigorous constructions of mathematical objects we usually take for granted, like the natural numbers. Learning how to provide these constructions is an important part of building models in model theory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_4__Natural_numbers_and_induction\">Set theory path. Level 4. Natural numbers and induction</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 10. Recursive Functions</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Primitive Recursive Functions</li>\n<li>Recursive Functions</li>\n<li>Primitive Recursive Sets</li>\n<li>Recursive Sets</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Translate the formal syntax of the recursive functions into an informal representation of a function and vice versa.</li>\n<li>Explain the difference between primitive recursion and recursion.</li>\n<li>Explain the difference between semi-recursive and recursive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By this point in your FAI career, you may have developed some sort of fascination of the power of this idea of “recursion”. Well, now you’re learning that notion. It is powerful, but it can also get a bit complicated so take your time and on this concept.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_4__Recursive_functions\">Computability theory path. Level 4. Recursive functions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 11. Set Theoretic Recursion</h3>\n<p>The big ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Recursion Theorem</li>\n<li>Peano Axioms</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To move to the next level you need to be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>State the recursion theorem and explain how this theorem coincides with our informal notion of recursion.</li>\n<li>Use the recursion theorem to create new functions.</li>\n<li>Explain what the axioms of Peano arithmetic are.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why this is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is recursion...again! (In true recursive spirit.) However, it’s a bit different this time. This time we’re showing a way to look at recursion from a set theory perspective. We can take the recursive functions of computability as given and do some things with them, or we can use our set theoretic foundations to build the theory of recursion itself. Think of this as further justification and an assurance of what we’re doing.</li>\n<li>You’ll also get a look at what are known as “Peano’s axioms”. If we assume these axioms, or alternatively provide a set theoretic structure in which they hold, the claim is that these axioms can give us all our theorems of informal arithmetic in a formal system. Formalization of arithmetic will be important later for deriving limitative results about formal systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_5__Set_theoretic_recursion\">Set theory path.

You can consider it part of your general mathematical well-being. It’s some set theory you really should know.</li>\n<li>Finite and countable sizes are what we as finite beings have “constructive” access to. We reason about other cardinalities, but it all becomes a little less graspable and tangible. These sizes of sets are important and probably give us everything we need in the real world.

Whether or not it applies appropriately depends on the soundness and completeness results. This is all about asking “Do my formal deductions match up with something out there and do <em>all</em> of the somethings out there match up with my formal deductions?” As you may already know or will see in a few levels, the latter question is impossible to prove in formalized situations, but still worth pondering.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Level_8__Models__their_existence__Proofs_and_completeness_\">Computability theory path.

While it is unlikely that cardinal theory or ordinal theory will directly play into AGI research, it still may crop up in unexpected places like model theory.</li>\n<li>Ordinal theory also sets you up to later learn what is known as “proof theoretic strength” of a formal system which is expressed in ordinal numbers and relies on transfinite induction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Elective__Level_9__Cardinal_numbers\">Set theory path.

This generally points out how the apparently simplest of assumptions can turn out to be just that: assumptions. We must be prepared to discover all of our assumptions working into our informal proofs before we think about applying them to a potentially hazardous problem like an AGI.</li>\n<li>The rest of this level is setting up the material for the oft-quoted Godel incompleteness theorems which place hard limits on what formal systems are capable of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skill guides for this level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"Elective__Level_11__Axiom_of_choice\">Set theory path.

I have a clearer sense of where and when the technique is important.</p><h1>Intractable Disagreements</h1><p><strong>Some intractable disagreements are fine</strong></p><p>If you disagree with someone on the internet, or a random coworker or something, often the disagreement doesn't matter. You and your colleague will go about their lives, one way or another. If you and your friends are fighting over \"Who would win, Batman or Superman?\", coming to a clear resolution just isn't the point.</p><p>It might also be that you and your colleague are doing some sort of coalition-politics fight over the overton window, and most of the debate might be for the purpose of influencing the public. Or, you might be arguing about the Blue Tribe vs Red tribe as a way of signaling group affiliation, and earnestly understanding people isn't the point.</p><p>This makes me sad, but I think it's understandable and sometimes it's even actually important.</p><p>Such conversations are don't <i>need</i> to be doublecrux shaped, unless both participants want them to be.</p><p><strong>Some disagreements are </strong><i><strong>not</strong></i><strong> fine</strong></p><p>When you're <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i2dNdHrGMT6QgqBFy/what-product-are-you-building\">building a product together</a>, it actually matters that you figure out how to resolve intractable disagreements.</p><p>I mean \"product\" here pretty broadly – anything that somebody is actually going to use. It could be a literal app or widget, or an event, or a set of community norms, or a philosophical idea. You might literally sell it or just use it yourself. But I think there is something helpful about the \"what if we were coworkers, how would we resolve this?\" frame.</p><p>The important thing is \"there is a group of people collaborating on it\" and \"there is a stakeholder who cares about it getting built.\"</p><p>If you're building a website, and one person thinks it should present all information very densely, and another person thinks it should be sleek and minimalist... <i>somehow</i> you need to actually decide what design philosophy to pursue. Options include (not necessarily limited to)</p><ul><li>Anarchy</li><li>One person is in charge</li><li>Two or more people come to consensus</li><li>People have domain specializations in which one person is in charge (or gets veto power).</li></ul><h2>Anarchy</h2><p>To start with, what's wrong with the \"everyone just builds what seems right to them and you hope it works out\" option? Sometimes you're building a <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/introduction/\">bazaar, not a cathedral</a>, and this is actually fine. But it often results in different teams building different tools at cross purpose, wasting motion.</p><h2>One person in charge?</h2><p>In a hierarchical company, maybe there's a boss. If the decision is about whether to paint a bikeshed red or blue, the boss can just say \"red\", and things move on.</p><p>This is less straightforward in the case of \"minimalism\" vs \"high information density.\"</p><p>First, is the boss even doing any design work? What if the boss and the lead designer disagree about aesthetics? If the lead designer hates minimalism they're gonna have a bad time.</p><p>Maybe the boss trusts the lead designer enough to differ to them on aesthetics. Now the lead designer is the decision maker. This is an improvement, but just punts the problem down one level. If the lead designer is Just In Charge, a few things can still go wrong:</p><p><strong>Other workers don't actually understand minimalism</strong></p><p>\"Minimalist websites\" and \"information dense websites\" are designed very differently. This filters into lots of small design decisions. Sometimes you can solve this with a comprehensive style guide. But those are a lot of work to create. And if you're a small startup (or a small team within a larger company), you may not have have the resources for that. It'd be nice if your employees just <i>actually understood </i>minimalism so they could build good minimalist components.</p><p><strong>The lead designer is wrong</strong></p><p>Sometimes the boss's aesthetic isn't locally optimal, and this actually needs to be pointed out. If lead-designer Alice says \"we're building a minimalist website\" it might be important for another engineer or designer to say \"Alice, you're making weird tradeoffs for minimalism that are harming the user experience.\"</p><p>Alice might think \"Nah, you're wrong about those tradeoffs. Minimalism is great and history will bear me out on this.\" But Alice might also respect Bob's opinion enough to <i>want</i> to come to some kind of principled resolution. If Bob's been right about similar things before, what should Alice and Bob do, if Alice <i>wants</i> to find out she's wrong – <i>if and only if she's actually wrong</i>, and that her minimalist aesthetic is harming the user experience.</p><p><strong>The lead designer is right, but other major stakeholders think she's wrong</strong></p><p>Alternately, maybe Bob thinks Alice is making bad design calls, but Alice is actually just making the right calls. Bob has rare preferences that don't overlap much with the average user, that <i>shouldn't</i> necessitate a major design overhaul.</p><p>Initially, this will look the same to both parties as the previous option.</p><p>If Alice has listened to Bob's complaints a bunch, and Alice generally respects Bob but thinks he's wrong here, at some point she needs to say \"Look Bob, we just need to actually build the damn product now, we can't rehash the minimalism argument every time we build a new widget.\"</p><p>I think it's useful for Bob to gain the skill of saying \"Okay. fine.\" Let go of his frustration and embrace the design paradigm.</p><p>But that's a tough skill. And meanwhile, Bob is probably going to spend a fair amount of time and energy <i>being annoyed</i> about having to build a product they're less excited about. And sometimes, Bob's work is less efficient because he doesn't understand minimalism and keeps building site-components subtly incompatible with it.</p><p><strong>What if there was a process by which </strong><i><strong>either </strong></i><strong>Alice would update </strong><i><strong>or</strong></i><strong> Bob would update, that both Alice and Bob considered fair?</strong></p><p>You might just call that process \"regular debate.\" But the problem is that regular debate just <i>often doesn't work.</i> Alice says \"We need X, because Y\". Bob says \"No, we need A, because B\", and they somehow both repeat those points over and over without ever changing each other's mind.</p><p>This wastes loads of time, which could have been better spent building new site features if they were able to do it faster.</p><p>Even if Alice is in charge and gets final say, it's still suboptimal for Bob to have lower morale and keep making subtly wrong widgets.</p><p>And even if Bob understands that Alice is in charge, it might still be suboptimal for Bob to feel like Alice never <i>really</i> understood exactly what Bob's concerns were.</p><h2>What if there's no boss?</h2><p>Maybe your \"company\" is just two friends in a basement doing a project together, and there isn't really a boss. In this case, the problem is much sharper –&nbsp;somehow you need to actually make a call.</p><p>You might solve this by deciding to appoint a decision-maker –&nbsp;change the situation from a \"no boss\" to \"boss\" problem. But if you were just two friends making a game together in their spare time, for fun, this might kinda suck. (If the whole point was to make it together as friends, a hierarchical system may be fundamentally un-fun and defeat the point)</p><p>You might be doing a more serious project, where you agree that it's important to have clear coordination protocols and hierarchy. But it nonetheless feels premature to commit to \"Alice is always in charge of design decisions.\" Especially if Bob and Alice both have reasonable design skills. And especially if it's early on in the project and they haven't yet decided what their product's design philosophy should be.</p><p>In that case, you can start with straightforward debate, or making a pros/cons list, or exploring the space a bit and hoping you come to agreement. But if you're not coming to agreement... well, you need to do <i>something.</i></p><h2>If \"regular debate\" is working for you, cool.</h2><p>If \"just talking about the problem\" is working, obviously you don't have an issue. Sometimes the boss actually just says \"we're doing it this way\" and it doesn't require any extensive model sharing.</p><p>If you've never run into the problem of intractable-disagreement while collaborating on something important, this blogpost is not for you. (But, maybe keep it in the back of your mind in case you <i>do</i> run into such an issue)</p><p>But working on the LessWrong team for about 1.5 years, I've run into numerous deep disagreements, and my impression is that such disagreements are common –&nbsp;especially in domains where you're solving a novel problem. We've literally argued a bunch about minimalism, which isn't an especially unique design decision. We've also had much weirder disagreements about integrity and intellectual progress and AI timelines and more.</p><p>We've resolved many (although not all) of those disagreements. In many cases, doublecrux has been helpful as a framework.</p><h1>What's Doublecrux again?</h1><p>If you've made it this far, presumably it seems useful to have <i>some</i> kind of process-for-consensus that works better than whatever you and your colleagues were doing by default.</p><p><strong>Desiderata that I personally have for such a process:</strong></p><ul><li>Both parties can agree that it's worth doing</li><li>It should save more time than it costs (or produce value commensurate with the time you put in)</li><li>It works even when both parties have different frames or values</li><li>If necessary, it untangles confused questions, and replaces them with better ones</li><li>If necessary, it untangles confused goals, and replaces them with better ones</li><li>If people are disagreeing because of aesthetic differences like \"what it beautiful/good/obviously-right\", it provides a framework wherein people can actually change their mind about \"what is beautiful and good and right.\"</li><li>Ultimately, it lets you \"get back to work\", and actually build the damn product, confident that you are going about it the right way.</li></ul><p>[Many of these goals were not assumptions I started with. They're listed here because I kept running into failures relating to each one. Over the past 2 years I've had some success with each of those points]</p><p>Importantly, it's not necessarily needed for such a process to answer the original question you asked. In the context of building a product, what's important is that you figure out a model of the world which you both agree on, which informs which actions to take.</p><p>Doublecrux is a framework that I've found helpful for the above concerns. But I think I'd consider it a win for this essay if I've at least clarified why it's desirable to have <i>some</i> such system. I share Duncan's belief that it's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement\">more promising to repair or improve doublecrux than to start from scratch</a>. But if you'd rather start from scratch, that's cool.</p><p><strong>Components of Doublecrux –&nbsp;Cognitive Motions vs Attitudes</strong></p><p>There are two core concepts behind the doublecrux framework:</p><ul><li><i>A set of cognitive motions:</i><ul><li>Looking for the cruxes of your beliefs, and asking what empirical observations would change your mind about them. (Recursing until you find a crux you and your partner both share, the \"doublecrux\")</li></ul></li><li><i>A set of attitudes</i><ul><li>Epistemic humility<ul><li><i>\"maybe I'm the wrong one\"</i></li></ul></li><li>Good faith<ul><li><i>\"I trust my partner to be cooperating with me\"</i></li></ul></li><li>Belief that objective reality is real<ul><li><i>\"there's an actual right answer here, and it's better for each of us if we've both found it\"</i></li></ul></li><li>Earnest curiosity</li></ul></li></ul><p>Of those, I think the set of attitudes is more important than the cognitive motions. If the \"search for cruxes and empirical tests\" thing isn't working, but you have the four attitudes, you can probably find other ways to make progress. Meanwhile, if you don't each have those four attitudes, you don't have the foundations necessary to doublecrux.</p><p><strong>Using language for truthseeking, not politics</strong></p><p>But I think the cognitive motions are helpful, for this reason: much of human language is by default <i>politics</i> rather than <i>truthseeking</i>. \"Regular debate\" often reinforces the use of language-as-politics, which actives brain modules that are optimizing to win, which involves strategic blindness. (I mean something a bit nuanced by \"politics\" here, beyond scope of this post. But basically, optimizing beliefs and words for how you fit into the social landscape, rather than optimizing for what corresponds to objective reality).</p><p>The \"search for empirical tests is and cruxes-of-beliefs\" motion is designed to keep each participant's brain in a \"language-as-truthseeking\" mode. If you're asking yourself \"why would <i>I</i> change my mind?\", it's more natural to be honest to yourself and your partner than if you're asking \"how can I change <i>their </i>mind?\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the focus on mutual, opposing cruxes keeps things <i>fruitful</i>. Disagreement is more interesting and useful than agreement –&nbsp;it provides an opportunity to actually learn. If people are doing language-as-politics, then disagreement is a red flag that you are on opposing sides and might be threatening each other (which might either prompt you to fight, or prompt you to \"agree to disagree\", preserving the social fabric by sweeping the problem under the rug).</p><p>But <i>if</i> you can both trust that everyone's truthseeking, then you can drill directly into disagreements without worrying about that, optimizing for learning, and then for building a shared model that lets you actually make progress on your product.</p><p><strong>Trigger Action Plans</strong></p><p>Knowing this is all well and good, but what might this translate into in terms of actions?</p><p>If happen to have a live disagreement <i>right now</i>, maybe you can try doublecrux. But if not, what circumstances should prompt</p><p>I've found the \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wJutA2czyFg6HbYoW/what-are-trigger-action-plans-taps\">Trigger Action Plan</a>\" framework useful for this sort of thing, as a basic rationality building-block skill. If you notice an unhelpful conversational pattern, you can build an association where you take some particular action that seems useful in that circumstance. (Sometimes, the generic trigger-action of \"notice something unhelpful is happening ----&gt; stop and <i>think</i>\" is good enough)</p><p>In this case, a trigger-action I've found useful is:</p><p>TRIGGER: Notice that we've been arguing awhile, and someone has just repeated the same argument they said a little while ago (for the second, or especially third time)</p><p>ACTION: Say something like: \"Hey, I notice that we've been repeating ourselves a bit. I feel like conversation is kinda going in circles....\" followed by either \"Would you be up for trying to formally doublecrux about this?\" or following Duncan's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement#Pitfalls\">vaguer suggestions about how to unilaterally improve a conversation</a> (depending on how much shared context you and your partner have).</p><h1>Summary</h1><ul><li>Intractable disagreements don't always matter. But if you're trying to build something together, and disagreeing substantially about how to go about it, you will need some way to resolve that disagreement.</li><li>Hierarchy can obviate the need for resolution <i>if</i> the disagreement is simple, and if everyone agrees to respect the boss's decision.</li><li>If the disagreement has persisted awhile and it's still wasting motion, at the very least it's probably useful to do <i>something</i> differently. In particular, if you've been repeating the</li><li>Doublecrux is a particular framework I've found helpful for resolving intractable disagreements (when they are important enough to invest serious energy and time into). It focuses the conversation into \"truthseeking\" mode, and in particular strives to avoid \"political mode\"</li></ul>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>This academic note was previously linked but undiscussed in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Pe3aqWXJWLHoB6vc4/alignment-newsletter-35\">AN#35</a>, and I finally got around to reading it and really liked it so wanted to highlight it with a post.</p><p>The abstract:</p><blockquote>Every AI system is deployed by a human organization. In high risk applications, the combined human plus AI system must function as a high-reliability organization in order to avoid catastrophic errors. This short note reviews the properties of high-reliability organizations and draws implications for the development of AI technology and the safe application of that technology.</blockquote><p>The gist is that AI, including narrow AI, can be a dangerously powerful technology similar to nuclear power and weapons, and the organizations that best control these systems have certain features that categorize them as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_reliability_organization\">High Reliability Organizations</a> (HROs). The features of an HRO are (quoted from Wikipedia, quoted from <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-18334-000\">this book</a> by the originators of the HRO concept):</p><blockquote><em><strong>Preoccupation with failure</strong></em>: <em>HROs treat anomalies as symptoms of a problem with the system</em>. The latent organizational weaknesses that contribute to small errors can also contribute to larger problems, so <em>errors are reported promptly</em> so problems can be found and fixed.</blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>Reluctance to simplify interpretations</strong></em>: HROs take deliberate steps to comprehensively understand the work environment as well as a specific situation. They are cognizant that the operating environment is very complex, so they look across system boundaries to determine the path of problems (where they started, where they may end up) and value a diversity of experience and opinions.</blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>Sensitivity to operations</strong></em>: HROs are continuously sensitive to unexpected changed conditions. They monitor the systems’ safety and security barriers and controls to ensure they remain in place and operate as intended. <em>Situational awareness</em> is extremely important to HROs.</blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>Commitment to resilience</strong></em>: HROs develop the capability to detect, contain, and recover from errors. Errors will happen, but HROs are not paralyzed by them.</blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>Deference to expertise</strong></em>: HROs follow typical communication hierarchy during routine operations, but defer to the person with the expertise to solve the problem during upset conditions. <em>During a crisis, decisions are made at the front line</em> and authority migrates to the person who can solve the problem, regardless of their hierarchical rank.</blockquote><p>The note argues for finding ways to incorporate AI in an HRO not only as a technology to be controlled by one (that&#x27;s just the baseline), but also as a functional member of the HRO, with the same responsibilities to the organization as any human member would have, such as the right to halt operations if it believes danger is imminent and a responsibility to report anomalies it discovers.</p><p>An interesting extension of this line of thinking would be to combine the HRO Safety-I approach with newer <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/signuptosafety/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2015/10/safety-1-safety-2-whte-papr.pdf\">Safety-II</a> approaches (an overly short summary is that Safety-I, the traditional approach to safety, is about taking steps to avoid errors, and Safety-II is about creating robust conditions for success where errors are less likely to happen).</p><p>I&#x27;ve seen good outcomes from applying these kinds of changes to organizational design to accomplish safety within my primary field of work (system operations, site reliability engineering, devops, or whatever you want to call it), and I think extending this kind of thinking to how organizations work with AI is also likely valuable in that it will reduce, even if not theoretically eliminate, the risk of AI accidents that would otherwise be preventable in retrospect.</p>",

This is par for the course: since independent probabilities multiply, probabilities tend to be roughly exponential in the number of data points. One side effect is that, as long as we have a reasonable amount of data, the priors don&#x27;t matter much. Even if we&#x27;d thought that an unbiased die was a thousand times more likely than a biased die a priori, those huge exponents would have completely swamped our prior.</p><p>Playing around with <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\alpha\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">α</span></span></span></span></span></span> will reveal that the same applies to our prior distribution for <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"p\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">p</span></span></span></span></span></span>: the result is not very sensitive to changes in the prior. A word of caution, however: priors over unknown parameters become more important in high-dimensional problems.</p><p>Third, notice that there was no maximization and no extra parameters to twiddle. Once the models were specified, we had zero choices to make, zero degrees of freedom to play with. Any &quot;free parameters&quot; - i.e. <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"p\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">p</span></span></span></span></span></span> - have a prior over which we integrate. That integral is the hard part: as the models get larger and more complicated, we need to evaluate hairy high-dimensional integrals. The problem is not just NP-complete, it&#x27;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%99%AFP-complete\">#P-complete</a>. In practice, approximations are used instead, including the entire range of hypothesis tests and model comparison tests - that&#x27;s where maximization enters the picture. We&#x27;ll talk about some of those later, especially about when they&#x27;re likely to work or not work.</p><p>Finally, note that we compared a model which is conceptually &quot;compatible&quot; with the data (i.e. capable of generating roughly the observed frequencies), to one which is conceptually &quot;incompatible&quot; (i.e. the observed frequencies are way outside the expected range). A more interesting case is to consider two models which are both &quot;compatible&quot;. In that case, we&#x27;d want to use some kind of complexity penalty to say that the more complex model is less likely - otherwise we&#x27;d expect overfit.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Economics is often portrayed as a dismal science. It seems to be about a small group of experts talking mostly about monetary policy. I want to argue that this is not true and that there is an elegant, natural and simple interpretation that admits far-reaching applications.</p>\n<h2>Finite thinking</h2>\n<p>First, we introduce finite thinking. Finite thinking is a kind of thinking that takes into account that resources are finite, or more generally, that entities in the real world have to obey the constraints of the real world.</p>\n<p>When you are thinking about how to spend the $10 in your wallet, you carefully weigh different options against each other. You are performing finite thinking. But if you know that you are carrying around plenty of money, you no longer think of it as a scarce resource and, thus, no longer think finitely.</p>\n<p>This applies to time management as well. If you have plenty of time, you cease to think of time as finite and tend to slack off. But if there are only two hours left until the deadline, you start to think finitely and try to use the remaining time as wisely as possible.</p>\n<p>A more subtle example is this: When a thief robs a bank and escapes, the police could throw their hands in the air and say that he must have already left the country. Or, they acknowledge that the speed of his vehicle is not infinite and that he must be somewhere within a certain radius around the bank.</p>\n<p>Economical thinking is nothing other than finite thinking: Anyone and anything that interacts with reality is subject to certain constraints. To think economically means to factor in these constraints.</p>\n<h2>Infinite thinking</h2>\n<p>It is instructive to look at its counterpart, which is infinite thinking. Here, it is implicitly assumed that a resource is available in an infinite amount. At first, this seems abstruse and not how people think at all because it clearly defies the basic truths of reality. But in fact, this mode of thinking is commonplace and pervades all aspects of life. It can also be very useful.</p>\n<p>When buying groceries, most people do not take a close look at the price nor do they sum up the total amount in their heads. They pick the products they planned to buy and then pay the cashier the amount that is asked of them. Even though they are not aware of it, they implicitly assume that they have an infinite amount of money. However, if the resulting total is exorbitantly high, finite thinking kicks in and people start looking closer.</p>\n<p>A wonderful example of infinite thinking is the efficient market hypothesis. It states that stock price immediately reflects all publicly available knowledge about a company. Even though it has the words \"efficient\" and \"market\" in it and is clearly about economics, it has nothing to do with economical thinking. For it to be true, every trader must have access to all relevant information at all times, react instantaneously to changes and make decisions completely rationally. To acknowledge that this can't be true is to apply finite thinking. This opens the door to a more precise model of the stock market, that, for example, takes into account basic human instincts.</p>\n<p>Which other areas are prone to infinite thinking although finite thinking would be more appropriate?</p>\n<p>For the most part of human history, we have seen air as an infinite resource. A forager did not quantify the carbon dioxide that his bonfire emitted into the air, neither did the industrialist when burning coal. The more advanced our technology becomes, the more we impact we have on the environment and the greater the pressure to switch from infinite thinking to finite thinking. This mental shift happened in cities such as industrial London, which suffered from air pollution. On a global scale, we have seen this happening when the ozone layer was threatened by CFCs.</p>\n<p>Telling a young person that they have all the time in the world is essentially an encouragement to think infinitely. If they took this advice to heart, which they rarely do, they would end up postponing major life decisions or pursuing unrealistic plans. A much better strategy is to accept time as a finite resource and make the best of it.</p>\n<p>In any given moment, we can only pay attention to a small range of phenomena. It is impossible for us to simultaneously observe everything that is happening around us. You cannot play on your smartphone and watch traffic at the same time. People who claim to be good multi-taskers often think of their attention as infinite.</p>\n<p>We sometimes tend to treat other human beings as though they had an infinite amount of self-control, knowledge and wisdom. This is how children commonly view their parents. It is obviously not the case, but it is much easier to see them as perfect beings rather than to deal with their flaws and deficiencies.</p>\n<p>Consider books. We can easily acknowledge that we only have a finite amount of time. But we often ignore the logical conclusion -- that we can only read a finite number of books. This leads to long ever-increasing reading lists that we believe \"we will get to eventually\". But once you realize that you have to be selective about the books you read, you start thinking economically. You make a list of absolute must-read books, start to prioritize important books over unimportant ones and you pay more attention to what books get recommended often.</p>\n<p>Conspiracy theorists are particularly guilty of infinite thinking. To establish a secret world order, you would need an infinitely good coordination structure, infinitely strong-willed individuals and an infinitely clear plan that everybody adheres to without question. Positing an unrealistic structure like this is way more convenient than to recognize the complexities of modern societies.</p>\n<p>In health care, the idea that a human life is invaluable is widespread. If a human life is at risk, any amount of money, risk and effort seems to be justified to save it. And this is a sentiment that health professionals in direct contact with patients undoubtedly should have. But from a planning perspective, it is irreconcilable with reality. And worse: if you adopted this mindset, you could actively cause harm by making decisions that don't prevent as much suffering as they could.</p>\n<p>A politician who understands that the size of the front page of a newspaper -- and thus, public attention -- is limited, can enact unpopular legislation in the shadow of a major newsworthy event. In constrast, a politician who thinks infinitely implicitly believes in a supernatural force that makes every citizen in his country instantly aware of his legislation. Unlike his colleague, he is not going to see this opportunity <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Jyq59avnGjYBze4Jt-1\" id=\"fnref-Jyq59avnGjYBze4Jt-1\">[1]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In lightning chess, players have only a few seconds for their next move. Since this implies a limited number of possible thoughts, you can assume that your opponent won't (and can't!) play an overly complicated strategy.</p>\n<p>If finite thinking is better in so many cases, why do we have infinite thinking at all? It is a mechanism to abstract away details to see the bigger picture. Without it, we would have to take into account all real constraints at all times, which would quickly overwhelm us. So, infinite thinking itself is the product of the limitations of human computational power. It is indispensable for us and it is so common that we are not even aware of it. However, you should not overdo it either. The key is to view the world at the level of abstraction that is suitable for the particular application.</p>\n<h2>Economics</h2>\n<p>So far, we have focused on different kinds of thinking. What does this have to do with economics?</p>\n<p>Economics and its concepts arise when you think finitely about something. You ask yourself: What happens if you take into account the fact that a system has to obey the constraints of reality? The dynamics that arise as a consequence are the economics of that system.</p>\n<p>In the public eye, drug cartels tend to be viewed as ideal constraint-free entities that exist outside the laws of reality. But people who actively fight them know better: They see them as ordinary organizations with mundane elements such as a hierarchical order of command, management of resources, establishment of trade routes, a distribution network for the end product -- all while they have to follow the laws of supply and demand. All of these aspects make them vulnerable and make them seem less almighty.</p>\n<p>We tend to think of the law system as an impeccable ideal that transcends the rules of the real world. We believe that when a new law is introduced, it immediately changes how people interact. We also believe that it automatically enforces itself at all times since \"It is THE LAW!\".</p>\n<p>When you spell it out like this, it seems ludicrous, but these are implicit assumptions we make all the time -- unless we focus our attention on the law itself.</p>\n<p>The reality is far less spectacular. The main reason the law works is because there is a general consensus that you should abide by the law. If we did not have that, anarchy would break loose and law enforcement would be futile. Also, the law is only enforced because there are flesh and blood people who enforce it. This leads to an economics of law enforcement: There is only a finite number of police officers who drive finitely fast cars. As a consequence, if there is too much crime, a choice has to be made where to enforce the law and where not.</p>\n<p>There is an important practical ramification: If you think infinitely about the law, you will think that cutting spending for police will not influence the degree to which the law is upheld. This can result in a significantly higher response time and staff shortages. If spending is cut too much, it may be that your own house is being burgled, but nobody is there to help you.</p>\n<p>The standard interpretation of economics is the study of the best allocation of finite resources. This is compatible with our interpretation. The main difference is that we don't define it through actors and goods in an external reality, but through different modes of thinking. This allows for an understanding of economics that is universally applicable since it can cover anything you can think about.</p>\n<p>We need to think in ideals to navigate the world. But when these ideals touch reality, they are subjected to its constraints. Then, economics is born.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-Jyq59avnGjYBze4Jt-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This can arguably be a good thing. <a href=\"#fnref-Jyq59avnGjYBze4Jt-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n</body></html>",

For example: is rotisserie chicken or canned tuna better for your meal plan? That&#x27;s a question of moderate difficulty to answer; we would need information such as</p><ul><li>The nutritional profiles of the chicken and the tuna,</li><li>Whether you prefer the taste of one or the other, and</li><li>How much you&#x27;re willing to spend and the relative prices of both in your area. (Fun fact: A <a href=\"https://www.eatthismuch.com/food/nutrition/whole-original-rotisserie-chicken,176063/\">1200 calorie $7 rotisserie chicken</a> from a supermarket is actually less expensive, calorie-per-calorie, than a 120 calorie $1 can of tuna. Otherwise it would be &gt;$10.)</li></ul><p>But there are <em>dozens</em> of common kinds of common protein sources out there, and they all can all be prepared in so many different ways. When you factor in meal prep and individual variation and all the different kinds of recipes you can make, finding the &quot;best&quot; food for any given metric honestly starts to look intimidating.</p><p>The answer? Don&#x27;t look for the best; look for good enough. Nutrition is satisficing. Take some time to learn some general heuristics about nutrition, don&#x27;t be afraid to explore randomly a bit at the supermarket, but also don&#x27;t stress out about your own nutrition once you&#x27;ve got a few solid principles in place.</p>",

We call these particles dark matter, and it is estimated to compose about 85% of all matter in the observable universe.</p><p>In analyzing the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@samo.burja/functional-institutions-are-the-exception-9a1c6974aa09\">functional institutions</a> of our society, we are not able to see for ourselves most of the knowledge that created them. Knowledge of this sort includes trade secrets, tacit technical knowledge, private social networks, private intelligence-gathering operations, management and persuasive skill, cooperation and collusion among founders and their allies, and founders&#x2019; long-term plans for their institutions.&#xB9;</p><p>This knowledge has <a href=\"https://medium.com/@samo.burja/great-founder-theory-93751e25c173\">profound effects</a> on the social landscape. We must understand it if we hope to understand society. We therefore must examine <strong>intellectual dark matter</strong>: knowledge we cannot see publicly, but whose existence we can infer because our institutions would fly apart if the knowledge we see were all there was.&#xB3; Such intellectual dark matter rests at the foundations of our society, dwarfing in scope and importance the accessible, shareable, visible knowledge on which we normally&#xA0;focus.</p><p>There are many forms of intellectual dark matter, but the three principal ones are lost, proprietary, and tacit knowledge.</p><p><em>Read the rest <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/intellectual-dark-matter-2e5890aa8d8f\">here</a>.</em></p><p><em>Read more from Samo Burja</em> <em><u><a href=\"http://samoburja.com/essays\">here.</a></u></em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I listened to the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tom-kalil-government-careers\">80,000 Hours podcast with Tom Kalil</a>, who spent 16 years as Deputy Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House. Kalil seems skilled at evaluating concrete scientific plans to offer the president and finding the path of least resistance through government to effect those plans, though he is not himself someone with deep technical understanding of any single domain.</p><p>One key idea I took from the podcast was that his main use of the executive branch of government is as a coordination mechanism. I moved away from thinking of the President as an expert who makes decisions like a CEO, and much more as an individual with immense coordination power trying his best to take any concrete plans given to him and coordinate the country around executing on them. That is, not someone who comes up with plans, not someone who executes on the plans, but someone who coordinates people to execute the concrete plans that are waiting to be picked up and run with.</p><p>Below are relevant and very interesting quotes, followed by a few more updates I made listening to the podcast.</p><h2>Key Quotes</h2><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:&#xA0;</strong>So, do you think people under-appreciate how much the executive branch can just do autonomously?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;Yes. Yeah. Not only what it can do, but the President&#x2019;s ability to convene.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>[...]</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;One thing that I used to ask people is to imagine that you have a 15 minute meeting with the President in the Oval Office and he says, &#x201C;Rob, if you give me a good idea for&#x201D;, pick your cause, &#x201C;reducing existential risk, then I will call anyone on the planet. It can be a conference call so there can be more than one person on the line. If it&#x2019;s someone from inside the government, that I can direct them to something because I&#x2019;m their boss, and if it&#x2019;s someone outside the government then I can challenge them to do something. So, you not only have to tell me, what is your idea, but in order to make your idea happen, who would I call and what would I ask them to do?&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;There are several reasons for this thought experiment. One is that if you work for the President you have the ability to send the President a decision memo and have him check the box that says yes. Over time that give you a sense of what psychologists call agency, a sense that many things that you see in the world around you are the result of human action or inaction, as opposed to the laws of physics. That&#x2019;s one thing, a more expansive view of what do you think is potentially changeable. The second is, it&#x2019;s sort of a version of the Hamming question, presumably if you really did have a meeting with the President you&#x2019;d use it to describe an issue that you thought was really important as opposed to a secondary or third tier issue. The third is that many complex problems cannot be solved by a single individual organization, they require coalitions.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;You can&#x2019;t build a coalition if you can&#x2019;t articulate, number one, who are the members of the coalition, and number two, what are the mutually reinforcing steps that you would want them to take. That&#x2019;s one thing that I talk about in the Policy Entrepreneurship, then I also talk about something that people don&#x2019;t ever really appreciate, which is that policy makers do things with words. What do I mean by that? Well, think about when the priest says, &#x201C;I now pronounce you man and wife&#x201D;, he has changed the state of affairs by virtue of, A, him being a priest, and B, him saying, &#x201C;I now pronounce you man and wife&#x201D;. Similarly, the way that a policy maker both frames and makes a decision and implements that decision is through documents. When the President does it we call it an executive order or presidential memorandum, when a regulatory agency does it we call it a rule, when the Congress does it we call it legislation. But in all instances it is a document that you are creating or editing, so part of the policy process is that you are able to figure out what&#x2019;s the document or documents that you need to create or edit and who is allowed to take that something from being a Word document that is on your screen to something that has some force in the world?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;I would see this all the time, something would go from being a Word document on my computer to being a presidential executive order, it always seemed like this slightly magical transformation from a Word Doc to something that is instructing relevant members of the Cabinet to take some action.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong>&#xA0;I guess this makes you more ambitious, then you&#x2019;re like, &#x201C;What is the best thing, what is the best memo that I could write.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;Yeah, exactly, yeah. But also you have to be able to articulate some coherent relationship between ends and means. I would &#x2026; a lot of times someone would come visit me and they would say, &#x201C;my issue is important&#x201D;.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;I&#x2019;d say, &#x201C;great, let&#x2019;s say that I&#x2019;m prepared to stipulate that, what is that you want me to do?&#x201D;, then they would look at me and they would say, &#x201C;Well, you should make this a priority&#x201D;.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;I&#x2019;d say, &#x201C;What would that look like?&#x201D; People were not able &#x2026; they were able to tell you that their issue was important and that they thought the President should devote more time and energy to it, but then when you said &#x201C;Alright, what is it, literally &#x2026; let&#x2019;s say we got the President super interested in this issue, what would they do?&#x201D; They weren&#x2019;t able to articulate that part.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong>&#xA0;Yeah, I&#x2019;m sympathetic to that &#x2019;cause there&#x2019;s a lot of things that I think are very important, but I&#x2019;m also not sure what should be done. I suppose maybe it makes sense for people to think more about that once they&#x2019;ve gotten people to care about it, but at the same time, maybe it&#x2019;s hard to get people to care about something if you have no actual concrete steps that they can take, they&#x2019;re like, &#x201C;Well, I don&#x2019;t know what to do&#x201D;.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;Yes. Yeah, because that&#x2019;s assuming that &#x2026; because what you&#x2019;re saying is, I&#x2019;ve really thought about this issue a lot and I think it&#x2019;s really important, but I don&#x2019;t know what to do.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong>&#xA0;That&#x2019;s a bad sign. So you should think about it.</blockquote><p>Kalil also talks about in his role as Deputy Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, he helped raise the staff count from 40 to over 100 during the Obama administration. He just gets to hire people who are excited about an idea and want to make it happen, and then they make it happen using the coordination power of the executive office. Here&apos;s a prominent example:</p><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil: </strong>Let me give you one example. A young woman emailed me and the subject line of your email was, &#x201C;Cass Sunstein says I should work for you.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin: </strong>That&#x2019;s a strong subject line.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil: </strong>Good subject line. So I did a little research on her. It turned out that she had been a child violin prodigy with Itzhak Perlman, had won the major Yale undergraduate awards, was a Rhodes scholar, and was wrapping up a post-doc at Stanford in Decision Neuroscience. I went out on a limb and I decided to take a chance on her. Her name was Maya Shankar. I asked Maya, &#x201C;What do you want to do?&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil: </strong>She said, &#x201C;The UK has created this organization called the Behavioral Insights Team, which is taking these insights from people like Kahneman and Tversky and Sunstein and Thaler and using them to inform policies and programs. These are all US researchers. Why don&#x2019;t we have something like this?&#x201D; She said, &#x201C;I would like to create that.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil: </strong>Sure enough, in her late twenties, she arrived with no money, created this new organization called the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team, recruited 20 behavioral scientists to the federal government, got them to launch 60 collaborations with federal departments and agencies and got President Obama to sign an executive order institutionalizing this new entity.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil: </strong>I think that&#x2019;s pretty consequential for someone in their late twenties to be able to accomplish. That&#x2019;s one thing I did, was to recruit people of that caliber and teach them how to get things done in the federal government because the government doesn&#x2019;t come with an operating manual.</blockquote><p>The next quote is about how the core goal of the office of science and technology policy is to take the necessary steps to get the private sector to build new tech:</p><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong> One of the things I learned is that if the United States is behind in a technology, it&#x2019;s very difficult to try to re-establish a leadership position&#x2026; We tried to do that in the area of technologies like flat panel displays and we invested some money, but I don&#x2019;t think a whole lot came out of it.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil: </strong>Once Korea and Japan dominated the market for things like active matrix, liquid crystal displays, then trying to get the United States back into that market is really, really hard, and might require more money than the US is willing to put into it. Because obviously we believe that the primary role of government is to create the right environment for the private sector. It&#x2019;s not to engage in this sort of heavy handed-top down industrial policy that you see a China engaging in, for example&#x2026; we invested in this idea of flexible electronics where the idea is &#x2013; maybe you have a display that&#x2019;s a piece of paper that you can roll up and put into your pocket. And, if that&#x2019;s an area where no one has established a clear leadership position, that&#x2019;s more likely to be effective than saying, okay, we&#x2019;re going to duke it out in some market that we&#x2019;ve kind of already lost.</blockquote><p>This final quote is an example of the coordination power of the President.</p><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:&#xA0;</strong>Having worked in White House for 16 years, you must have some interesting or funny stories from your experiences there, different perhaps than what people expect? Can you share one of them?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;Sure. This is a story that happened in 1995 and 1996, so as I mentioned, Vice President Gore was really interested in this idea of the information superhighway and one of his goals was, what if we could connect every classroom to the internet? So I would tell people about the vice president&#x2019;s interest in this issue and someone who I&#x2019;d gotten to know, John Gage, who was at a company by the name of Sun Microsystems said, &#x201C;Oh, I&#x2019;ve got this idea called Net Day. The idea is, what if on a single day, tens of thousands of engineers showed up in schools all across California and started the process of wiring California classrooms to the internet?&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;Well great.&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;You know, I&#x2019;ve got a web page of what this would look like if it actually happened.&#x201D; So he emailed it to me and I gave it to the vice president and the vice president thought it was a done deal.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;So at this point, it was just in the fevered imagination of John Gage. So the vice president has a weekly lunch with the president and so he said, &#x201C;Mr. President, we have Sun, we have Apple, we have HP, we have IBM, we have Pacific Gas and Electric and they have all agreed that they&#x2019;re going to wire thousands of classrooms and schools all across California.&#x201D; The president was like, &#x201C;Great. Let&#x2019;s announce it.&#x201D; So it turned out that they were going to be in the Bay Area anyway so they decided, we&#x2019;re going to announce Net Day. So I called up John Gage and I said, &#x201C;They&#x2019;re going to come out and announce this.&#x201D; So he and I spent the next week calling in every favor that we had to get these CEOs to show up and announce that they were for us. They were a little sketchy on the details of what it was.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;What John did was he developed a website, which was a clickable map of California, that allowed you to zoom all the way down to the street level, all 12,000 public and private K through 12 schools had their own homepage. You could indicate your level of expertise from, &#x201C;I am an experienced network engineer.&#x201D; To, &#x201C;I will bring coffee and donuts.&#x201D; All the schools were color-coded red, yellow and green depending on how many volunteers had signed up. So we could look at the map and figure out which communities were getting onboard and which needed some positive reinforcement.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;So they announced that not only were they supporting it but they were going to come back and personally participate in it. So by the time they did, we actually had tens of thousands of people who had volunteered, so it was this positive, self-fulfilling prophecy because they said, &#x201C;Oh, there&#x2019;s going to be a Net Day.&#x201D; In fact, there was a Net Day and tens of thousands of engineers showed up to wire the schools and many parents showed up to wire the schools, but they discovered the windows were broken and the bathrooms didn&#x2019;t work, so a lot of them got more engaged in the schools as a result.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;Many states decided they were going to do this and entire countries decided that they were going to have a Net Day as well. So it was this experience, a couple of things that I took away from it, one is that you could create this positive self-fulfilling prophecy, even though that was a very nerve-wracking period of time for me personally because I&#x2019;d committed to the president and vice president to do something-</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong>&#xA0;To announce the thing.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;&#x2026; and announce something that didn&#x2019;t really exist yet. Right?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong>&#xA0;Yeah, sounds a little bit like an episode of Veep.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;Then it was sort of applying massive parallels to this problem. So as opposed to saying, &#x201C;How are we going to wire 10,000 schools?&#x201D; The question was, how could you get every community to take responsibility for one school? So it was just very interesting of the experience that I had of going from something being a complete fantasy to actually seeing it happen.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong>&#xA0;So government can get things done.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;Yes.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong>&#xA0;Just in sometimes a peculiar manner.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tom Kalil:</strong>&#xA0;Yes, exactly.</blockquote><p>There is a lot more fascinating discussion in the interview, especially Kalil&apos;s comments on using financial prizes to incentivise science+tech in areas like education and poverty.</p><h2>Updates</h2><p>My new model is that the President&apos;s interaction with science is largely to take concrete ideas floating around in the environment that are ready for their time, and push them over the edge into actually being built by the US private sector, or into actually substantially informing government policy. This is similar to the notion that scientific ideas come about when the environment is ready for them (Newton and Leibniz both discovering calculus at the same time). There are executable plans floating around in the ether, and the President keeps getting handed them and sets them off. His department is not an originator of new ideas, it coordinates the execution of existing ones. (And there&apos;s a natural frame from which is this is the correct marginal use of attention from the President: compare 15 minutes per project versus spending a week becoming an expert in one and then executing it himself.)</p><p>I&#x2019;ve updated positively on the tractability of gaining influence within the government and being able to use it on timescales of 4-8 years. (I expect I will likely make a further update when I read the blogposts of Dominic Cummings regarding UK politics, though not sure how strongly.) Overall I think influence in government, if you&#x2019;re ambitious and well-connected and have a very concrete vision, is likely quite a real action one can take. I expect that from the perspective of government there is a lot of low hanging fruit to be picked.</p><p>I updated negatively on the usefulness of interacting with this part of government in the short-to-medium term. My sense is that the state of understanding of how transformative AI will be built and what impact it will have on the world is sufficiently low resolution and confused that we have no project or policy recommendations for the government, and will not be able to offer anything until we see further work that helps conceptualise this space. Listening to the podcast tells me that if you get 15 minutes to talk to the President about x-risk today, you are wasting his time, because we have no concrete plan that needs executing if only could coordinate major AI tech companies. We have no R&amp;D projects that need funding. We have no nuanced AI-development policies for global powers to agree to. I&#x2019;m pretty sure that there are people in this community who can coordinate Elon Musk and Demis Hassabis or whomever else, should we have an actionable plan, but the current state is that we have no plan to offer.</p>",

However, Ruby commented with an even greater reason why some rationalists who might want friends beyond the rationality community nonetheless primarily stick to the rationality community:</p><blockquote>I suspect there are challenges for rationalists in joining new communities beyond introversion. I&#x27;ve found it jarring to be getting along with some new folk and then people start saying ridiculous things, but worse, having no real interest in determining whether the things they say are actually true. Or even when they try, being terrible at discussion. I don&#x27;t need to nitpick everything or correct every &quot;wrong&quot; thing I hear, but it is hard to feel like beliefs aren&#x27;t real to people - they&#x27;re just things you say. A performance.</blockquote><blockquote>There are people outside the rationality community who are fine at the above, but being used to rationalists does introduce some novel challenges. It&#x27;d be nice if we ever accumulated communal knowledge on how to bridge such cultural gaps.</blockquote><p>So, I thought I would ask. </p>",

Diana and Geoffrey are professors of evolutionary psychology, Effective Altruists, thoughtful polyamorists, and fearless thinkers. We talked about everything that’s important in life: gems, sex, morality, kids, shit-testing, jealousy, and why women are smart.</p><p>If you missed it, here’s the wide-ranging <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2018/06/13/miller-1-ea-rationality/\">interview I did with Geoffrey alone</a> a year ago. I will also publish the audience Q&amp;A from the meetup later this month.</p><p><strong>Congratulations on your engagement! Geoffrey designed a special</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/primalpoly/status/1139764023489024001\">moissanite engagement ring for Diana</a>, and moissanite is something my wife and I believe in very much as well. Can you tell everyone about moissanite so that no one here buys a diamond ever again?</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: In my book <em>Spent</em> I did a multi-page critique of the DeBeers diamond cartel and diamonds as costly signals of commitment. And maybe it’s fine to spend a lot of money on a signal, money that goes to a cartel.</p><p>Diana: But cocaine is more fun! </p><p>Geoffrey: Yes, or get a college degree — that’s a cartel too. But there are better and cheaper stones, like moissanite which is a silicon carbide gem and costs 1/10 to 1/50 of a diamond depending on the carat. But I think it’s a better stone, it has superior ‘fire’ and ‘brilliance’, as they say. Of course, once moissanite was invented and it became colorless and clear enough, the diamond cartel dissed it by saying “these are just disco balls”. Basically – it’s too flashy, and no self-respecting person who cares about the subtlety of a diamond will buy a moissy. Whereas for the previous 100 years, diamonds were sold as <em>the</em> flashiest, highest brilliance, and highest fire gemstone. So: hypocrites.</p><p>Moissies are getting better and better, and they just went off-patent four years ago so there are multiple manufacturers making them now and prices are dropping. So I’d rather put the effort into the design and personalization. I’m using a CAD system for the design and manufacture, you can now design it in collaboration with a jeweler who will cast it and make it.</p><p>Diana: It’s about a 9 mm stone. How much would a diamond that size cost?</p><p>Geoffrey: It’s a 3-carat moissy so it costs about $2,000, and an equivalent diamond would cost $120,000.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/moissie-in-beerlight.jpg?w=900\" class=\"draft-image default\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure><em>My wife’s moissanite sparkling in the beerlight.</em></span><p><strong>Geoffrey wrote the book</strong> <strong><em>Mate</em></strong> <strong>with Tucker Max with dating advice for men and in 2015 they had a podcast called</strong> <strong><em>The Mating Grounds </em>that Diana went on before she was dating Geoffrey…</strong></p><p>Diana: Actually, I was already dating him. When I was on the podcast it was the end of a two-day visit, the first time I visited Geoffrey. But then on the podcast, Tucker didn’t want to make that obvious.</p><p>Geoffrey: So we were in the afterglow of the first blush of romance, and Tucker wanted a very serious podcast about dating advice for young men.</p><p>Diana: I actively pursued Geoffrey which is good, because the women that Geoffrey pursues are all mentally ill.</p><p>Geoffrey: That’s largely a true statement.</p><p>Diana: Yeah, it’s practically diagnostic. </p><p>I tried to chat Geoffrey up in 2012, soon after his divorce. And my trick at the time for chatting up people who are introverted and quiet was to disclose more and more embarrassing things about myself until I got a reaction. So I was trying to draw him out, and he was like a clam in his shell. So I said, “Well, you must have plenty of other people to talk to, I’ll let you be.” And he answered, “No, no. This is fine.”</p><p>Geoffrey: I was scared you would go away at that point. Being aspie and introverted I thought I was giving lots of signals of interest.</p><p>Diana: You were not giving me signals of interest. You weren’t even properly facing me.</p><p>Anyway, after that point, I was messaging a lot and I arranged that visit to Austin to see him. </p><p>Then I told Geoffrey I lived a long way away and I had another boyfriend, who by the way was very supportive of me dating Geoffrey because he likes Geoffrey’s books. This is something only poly people understand — the great networking opportunities you get when you suggest hanging out with someone because you both like the same girl. </p><p>That was also Geoffrey’s first foray into poly and he was a bit confused why he’s hanging out with this woman <em>with</em> her boyfriend. </p><p>Geoffrey: I just assumed, based on the evolutionary psychology I had learned to that point, that we would meet for brunch and then fisticuffs would ensue. Maybe he would bring sabers to defend your honor.</p><p>Diana: And after that, I told Geoffrey that he should get a local girlfriend and helped him get on OkCupid. And then after a couple of years, we became more heavily involved. I didn’t really want a long-distance relationship, and now I’m moving to Albuquerque in July [where Geoffrey lives].</p><p><strong>You mentioned somewhere that you first fell in love with Geoffrey after reading his book,</strong> <strong><em>The Mating Mind</em>.</strong></p><p>Diana: That’s true.</p><p><strong>I have a question to Geoffrey here. According to evolutionary psychology, a lot of what we do, including intellectual things like writing a book, is deep down motivated by trying to get laid. And after studying evolutionary psychology I’ve noticed it in myself, that every blog post I write or meetup I organize is in some small part about how attractive women will look at me. Do you enjoy having this as a motivation or are you trying to fight it and do things for other reasons?</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: I sort of embrace it. It’s important especially for young people to understand that an awful lot of their behavior — self-improvement, moralizing, politics, and ideology — is covert mating effort to some degree. But the superordinate category is trait signaling – signaling something to someone. It’s not the case that all human creativity is just mating effort. A lot of it is status seeking, trying to impress other people like your parents, friends, and neighbors. The signaling principles are the same: doing something difficult that’s intellectually demanding, artistic, musical or funny tends to work for mating and also the other social signaling functions. </p><p>I think, like Robin Hanson and others, that if you’re tuned into signaling that’s really helpful. And when I accuse people on Twitter of woke virtue-signaling or SJW signaling I’m being derogatory not because I think that virtue-signaling itself is bad but doing it in a certain way, or unselfconsciously, is bad. If you do signaling with a lot of self-awareness that’s totally fine and it’s at the root of a lot of human progress and creativity.</p><p>Diana: I think it’s good that men do so many things to impress women. Geoffrey’s thesis in <em>The Mating Mind</em> is that we’re a lot smarter than what we need for survival, and the human mind is a lot like the peacock’s tail. It’s a result of runaway selection, and we’re showing off ostentatiously how smart we are. And women are smart to be able to evaluate intelligence and men’s creativity, so they became as sophisticated.</p><p>Geoffrey: That’s actually the wrong model, which I rejected.</p><p>Diana: No you did not, I just reread your book!</p><p>Geoffrey: You may want to reread it again. [smiles]</p><p><strong>To be clear, the question is: why are women smart? That’s a great question.</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: I do consider, in chapter 3 I think, whether it’s just a standard runaway process like the peacock’s tail with females doing all the choice and males doing all the display. I ended up saying, because the difference in brain size is actually very small and the difference in general intelligence between the sexes is negligible, and there are no major differences in domains like language, art, and music ability — both men and women can sing and paint and do comedy — I ended up with a model of mutual mate choice. Both sexes are displaying to some degree, sometimes men display harder and sometimes women, especially once in a relationship that they want to maintain. That’s the model I ended up with, that both sexes choose and both sexes display, and that is why there’s low dimorphism between the sexes in human mental traits.</p><p>Diana: In terms of status signaling, it’s good that in different subcultures and places around the world status can be gained in different ways. Otherwise, men would just be doing what gets the most female attention. You’re writing blogs and hosting rationalist meetups where the sex ratio of your audience probably skews quite male, and it’s good that men are doing things to impress not just mates.</p><p><strong>To be fair, I haven’t actually gotten even one date as a result of my blog. But deep in my animal brain, every time I submit a post I’m thinking, “This is the one that’s going to do it!”</strong></p><p>Diana: Women are attracted to status, it’s called hypergamy, and luckily the signal is noisy otherwise we would be doing a more circumscribed version of what we do to get laid. But now there’s a huge variety in the things we do to seek status and signal status.</p><p><strong>One thing we do to impress people is altruism. Now</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BretWeinstein/status/944031911768240129\">Bret Weinstein talks about</a></strong> <strong>how once we understand how things like terrorism and genocide are evolved adaptive behaviors, we could overcome them and stop killing the outgroup or whatever. So I’m worried about how that applies to altruism. Spencer Greenberg</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-intrinsic-values/\">gave a talk at EAG</a></strong> <strong>about introspecting to find our intrinsic values. But I worry that if I introspect I’ll find that</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2016/04/27/more-power-less-poverty/\">I donate to GiveDirectly</a>because there are attractive women and cool people at Effective Altruism meetups. </strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://evolution-institute.org/universal-morality-is-obscured-by-evolved-morality/\">You wrote an article</a></strong> <strong>about how our evolved moral intuitions stand in the way of a “higher morality”. So where does that higher morality come from?</strong></p><p>Diana: I’m unabashedly utilitarian. It comes from my experience with pleasure and pain, and then just extending that out with rationality and computation. But that still needs to be leveraged.</p><p>In 2014 I went to my first Effective Altruism conference and I’ve been hearing a lot about existential risk and how important it was to protect the future of humanity. I saw a talk by Eliezer Yudkowsky about this topic and how many trillions of lives there could be in the future. But I didn’t get it, and I didn’t like it. </p><p>And then I did a circling exercise, where you look into someone’s eyes and think of them as a person that you know and love. Then you circle again and think of them as a person on the other side of the world who is very poor, and then again where it’s a person in the far future who would like to exist. And then everything synced up and I became an advocate for working on existential risk.</p><p>So there are ways to leverage rationality to get to morality but in that particular case, I had to get my scope-insensitivity turned off by making eye contact with a particular person to care about that issue.</p><p><strong>We should do this exercise at a meetup!</strong></p><p><strong>Going back to relationships.</strong> <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2019/04/30/the-state-of-affairs/\"><strong>I just finished reading</strong> <strong><em>The State of Affairs</em></strong></a> <strong>by Esther Perel. She talks about how if you want to get good at business or sport or any skill or craft there are a million mentors and role models you can learn from. But it’s very hard to find role models for relationships. </strong></p><p><strong>Most people don’t know many others who have great relationships, and even those that seem to have great relationships aren’t as open about what they do as athletes are about their training regime, for example. Fiction could be another source, but what people are watching are shows like</strong> <strong><em>Game of Thrones</em></strong> <strong>which isn’t really full of healthy marriage advice.</strong></p><p><strong>Who are your relationship role models, and do you consider yourselves fit to be relationship role models?</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: The second answer is that we aspire to be good role models for managing relationships. We don’t divulge every last detail of what we do, but we do share our tips and tactics and we’re both working on books on how we manage things even in high stress situations like being long distance for five years. Or being poly and open.</p><p>In terms of role models, I grew up with a lot of respect for my parents who got along really well 80-90% of the time. I didn’t see how they managed their conflict resolution but they seemed capable of a fairly high degree of rationality and they got over tension fairly quickly, in a matter of hours rather than days or weeks. So I saw that it’s possible to at least have a reasonably successful marriage. My mom and dad also cooperated effectively not just on raising kids but also on local political issues and jointly managing a business so I also saw them as a team.</p><p>I asked people about good relationship role models on TV and the only one I came up with was <em>Madam Secretary</em>. Tea Leoni plays a high-powered CIA operative turned Secretary of State and her husband is a professor of moral philosophy and ex-marine who helps raise their three kids. And the screenwriters can afford to make their relationship work because all the drama is external to the marriage. It’s either tension with Iraq or tension with their teenage kids, not between the spouses. </p><p>This was the only example of screenwriting that had a good marriage with efficient communication that was also still hot and sexy. So if anyone has other ideas, email me.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/madam-secretary.jpg?w=900\" class=\"draft-image default\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure><em>The McCord family on Madam Secretary, CBS</em></span><p><strong>What about</strong> <strong><em>House of Cards</em>?</strong></p><p>Diana: Those people are psychopaths. They’re a poly couple, but they also kill people.</p><p><strong>Killing together really binds a couple.</strong></p><p>Diana: It really does, murder and threesomes are the keys to marital success. In <em>Breaking Bad</em> there are also periods where their marriage worked really well, like when the wife breaks bad with him.</p><p>I was also trying to think of lesbian and gay relationships because the media is very lefty so they may be more inclined to represent a gay couple as better functioning. But I couldn’t even think of one there. </p><p>For my part, I’m incredibly cynical about my own motivations. Geoffrey and I just got back together yesterday after not seeing each other for five weeks. A couple of interesting things happen because of being long-distance that I perceive through an evolutionary lens. Right before I leave there’s some mutual punishment happening for the imminent departure of the other person. Slights and any signs of emotional withdrawal are taken much more seriously. And then when we see each other I’m really happy to see him but there are also a couple of days of ‘shit testing’. Shit testing is the red-pill idea that women are being difficult in order to test the status, fortitude, and commitment of their partner. So I’m giving him shit to re-test how well we get along after a hiatus.</p><p>In some sense, I’m making fun of myself, but today I got really angry about a tiny thing where he didn’t hear me properly. And I was calling him names even as I was laughing about it. It takes a kind of cynicism about yourself and your motivations to have a good relationship. You have to realize these evolutionary things, and also to really want to make the relationship work. That’s what I hope to bring in the book I’m writing: if you can accept that as a woman you want to completely control and monopolize a man, that you have these desires that are selfish and destructive, you can achieve better outcomes.</p><p><strong>So the secret to relationships is either to commit crimes together or commit crimes against each other but laugh about it.</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: I’ve been teaching a course on human emotions for 10 years, and it’s really important to get each group of undergrads to look at their emotions at arm’s length. To think: what are the origins of each emotion, what are its adaptive functions? And in a modern context – which residual functions are still relevant and which aren’t. You can do this with disgust, jealousy, anger, shame, guilt, pride, awe, everything.</p><p>And the students start to realize they don’t have to take their emotions that seriously. If you combine the evolutionary perspective with a mindfulness perspective you can take your thoughts and feelings as passing events that come and go, like Sam Harris talks about. Then it’s much easier to have good relationships.</p><p>Diana: It’s very hard to do with many emotions in relationships. For example, the jealousy or outrage you feel when you get a sense that your mate is divesting from you — ancestrally this was such a matter of life and death that anyone who could hold these emotions at arm’s length was at a serious disadvantage. And so today it’s hard for us to do so, compared to holding at arm’s length being angry with an acquaintance, for example. </p><p>But we know that smart people have better self-control and are also less likely to get divorced, they’re better able to negotiate ways to support each other. And you don’t see geniuses at relationships on television.</p><p><strong>I want to ask how you think about jealousy. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, it seems like jealousy is somewhat obsolete. If it was meant to protect men from raising other men’s children and women being left without resources to survive, but we now have condoms, paternity testing, alimony, etc. </strong></p><p><strong>In the US, jealousy is taboo. Even people who get cheated on are supposed to be angry but not admit or talk about jealousy. But in Latin America, jealousy is embraced as a component of romantic relationships. Diana, you were born in Brazil and grew up in the US. What do you make of jealousy?</strong></p><p>Diana: It’s unclear when jealousy comes online for children. David Buss has a paper arguing that potentially young men don’t really understand jealousy until their first romantic relationship. I didn’t understand it as a child. I remember my mom with her friends talking about what somebody was going to name their baby, and I suggested naming them after ex-partners because of how important they are. And I didn’t understand why everyone said it’s a terrible idea. And then I dated a guy who wanted to name his daughter Genevieve and I freaked out because I thought people would shorten it to Jenna which is his ex-girlfriend’s name.</p><p>It’s true that people see jealousy as a signal of your investment and passion for somebody. Certainly, my mother who is Portuguese thought that lack of jealousy means that two people aren’t right for each other. Whereas people from Scandinavia see it as something that just happens, not a signal of one’s love or commitment.</p><p>And I never saw my dad jealous about my mother. When I was 16 and we were at a Mexican resort and some guy groped me, my dad just said that it’s a thing that happens. I think that parents’ protectiveness of their children is also part of the same thing. As kids these days say, it’s the same energy.</p><p><strong>Related to that, I just saw an article about bonobo mothers do everything to get their children laid including</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/05/20/think-your-mom-is-overbearing-bonobos-can-relate/?utm_term=.8f9ba365b98f\">beating away other males</a></strong> <strong>when their sons are having sex. But humans seem to have a tendency to suppress the sexual activity of their siblings and children, instead of teaching them seduction techniques for example. This seems quite maladaptive. Why don’t humans encourage the sexuality of their relatives?</strong></p><p>Diana: I think they do, but it’s oblique. In Latin cultures you do see that; I was dating a Colombian guy who had other women too, and when I was with him his mother was fielding calls from his other women. Likewise with my Portuguese cousin, whose mother lied to the four women he dated on the phone about his whereabouts so that he could keep having sex with them all. You do see this in Latin so-called “macho” cultures. </p><p>In terms of seduction techniques, people are weird about talking about the sexuality of children but this happens all the time. Someone could be ready to slap their kid and the child says, “Mommy, you look so pretty today” and it works. This is teaching children how to get someone out of a bad mood or get on someone’s good side with compliments, which is basically seduction. It’s a very useful skill. </p><p>I did a paper in graduate school about daughter-guarding. Parents are much more careful about watching their daughters, more likely to have curfews, tell them what to wear, etc. We also asked parents how upset they would be if they found their child was having sex; boy’s parents said on average they would be only slightly upset, -0.7 on a scale from -3 to 3. And girl’s parents would be very upset, basically -2.</p><p><strong>But it seems like bonobo parents would say +3 for boys!</strong></p><p>Diana: We also asked parents if they care who their child is dating. Fathers only care about their daughters’ mate choices, but mothers care about both.</p><p>There is a big difference between bonobos, chimps, and humans. Humans care about having a reputation for fidelity, and men want to monopolize a woman’s full reproductive potential rather than just focusing on whether she is fertile right now. Chimps prefer a female who has offspring already because that’s proof of her fertility, whereas humans, cultural differences aside, often want to monopolize someone before she has had any children. </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bonobo-mother-and-son.png?w=900\" class=\"draft-image default\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure><em>Bonobo mother and child</em></span><p>Geoffrey: This is a fundamental thing that Sigmund Freud got wrong. It’s not that daughters actually want to sleep with their fathers, but each child wants to practice courtship and signaling on the opposite-sex parent to figure out what works. Or practice on the opposite-sex sibling. So when kids are being cute or funny or showing off, they’re not actually trying to sleep with their mom or step-sister but rather using their feedback to calibrate and develop courtship skills they’ll use later as adults.</p><p>But it is a weird thing that in America dads aren’t usually giving explicit courtship advice to sons. Sons miss it and resent not getting it.</p><p>Diana: Obviously there are no studies of this courtship hypothesis, you can’t get approval for studies that involve children and sexuality. But I did hear a talk a while back that said that the best indication of how good a kid is at lying is whether or not their parents use corporal punishment. There’s a genetic component there, parents who hit children may also have some Dark Triad traits themselves, but kids learn to lie really well if they get physically assaulted otherwise.</p><p>So when parents hit their kids, they’re training the kids to be better at deceiving the parents, and other people too. So perhaps they’re not trying to get their kids to be obedient but to make their kids better at fooling people.</p><p><strong>Speaking of interesting parenting techniques: as two evolutionary psychologists who fight against the blank slate theory and know about signaling, how will you raise your kids? Most of us in this room know the basic stuff that modern parenting gets wrong, like Baby Mozart being useless and helicopter parenting being harmful. What’s the galaxy brain stuff on raising kids?</strong></p><p>Diana: I like Bryan Caplan’s book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OA64Q6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</a></em>. But I’ll let Geoffrey speak since he has actually raised kids.</p><p>Geoffrey: I have a daughter who is 23, and I also helped raise two stepchildren when they were teenagers.</p><p>The most important part of raising kids is to choose a good mate with good genes and then your kids will probably turn out fine. Most people don’t seem to do that very thoughtfully, or to integrate the information from all their extended family to estimate what the kids are likely to be like. It’s important when you meet the parents on Thanksgiving to ask questions and really listen because a lot of things that are heritable won’t necessarily show up in your mate but will show up in a sibling or uncle.</p><p>What else? There seems to be a two-generation lag in the skills parents train their kids to do because they were in turn trained by their own parents. There’s not much future orientation. We often talk about how the future is in China and it’s important to learn about China and learn the language…</p><p>Diana: We’re talking 15 minutes of Duolingo a day, let’s not get carried away.</p><p>Geoffrey: We’re thinking about what the future might be like, technologically and socially. My ambition is to train kids who will, in turn, have kids who will do well on Mars colonies.</p><p>Diana: This is literally the first time I’ve heard this. Sending our children to Mars? So they don’t ask us for money?</p><p><strong>I saw a study that kids tend to die on the same planet as their biological parents. There’s a perfect correlation, so you shouldn’t worry too much about Geoffrey sending your kids to Mars.</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: The third thing is, and I tell my students that, is that there’s too much focus on teaching the things that contribute to status and getting paid and there’s not enough focus on courtship skills. Helping your kids develop things that will be attractive to both friends and the opposite sex, including simple things like singing, drawing, telling jokes and interesting stories — these don’t require much practice but most Gen Z students suck at all those things. They can barely even speak one-on-one, in class or on dates. That seems like an insane handicap to have. Your job as a parent is to help your child hone those courtship skills in addition to skills that are economically relevant.</p><p><strong>Are Gen Zers disproportionately worse than previous generations?</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: They’re worse. I’ve noticed a gradient over the 30 years I’ve been teaching, kids used to be able to speak in class and to each other more articulately.</p><p>Diana: I have a cynical view of children, the same as I do of everything else. I saw a parent bouncing a child up and down to calm them. It’s a very reassuring motion because it’s all-encompassing. It’s very hard for a parent to do that while doing anything else, it signals total attention. Kids like to be rocked in that way precisely because it’s the most costly way to move them.</p><p>I don’t know if all the cynicism about children is going to melt away when I become a parent myself. But certainly, when I see my toddler niece have a meltdown, her father reacts in a way that he wouldn’t if he knew she was behaving in a manipulative way. The idea that I have about women training their men, I think similarly about children training their parents.</p><p>In terms of galaxy brain parenting, if you never reinforce behaviors like whining, even though some things are genetically determined, you would see less of that behavior. My upbringing gave me some degree of stoicism because my father would just ignore me completely if I was whining or crying. And he was the parent who was most important to me. This idea that you should cater to kids, or that you will cause a child trauma if you let them cry for more than 5 minutes, is I think totally misguided.</p><p>Geoffrey: A lot of this is an artifact of family sizes being so small today compared to 100 years ago. My mother was raised in a family of 12 kids. She got by with a remarkably low level of individualized attention from her parents, and she turned out OK. The kids basically attended to each other, the older ones helped take care of the younger ones. And there was no coddling. If one of the teenagers was heartbroken after a breakup, a parent would hear about it a couple of weeks later from one of the older siblings. “Oh, that’s why she was so mopey and didn’t want to practice the violin!”</p><p>Kids are very resilient but you wouldn’t know that in a small family.</p><p><strong>I have a question about dating. Geoffrey wrote in “Mate” that things like money and status are worthwhile if they ultimately lead to romantic success. If someone is willing to move cities for a job they should certainly be willing to do so for a better mating market, like moving to Manhattan if you’re a young man. And yet, very few people seem to do that.</strong></p><p><strong>I’ve spoken to many people who say that romance is as important as their career but they spend 50 hours each week working, 20 hours watching TV, but don’t have a single hour to spare to write a good OKCupid profile. Or people who are better writers than they are good-looking, but are only on Tinder because it’s less work. I know people who won’t commute to the neighboring borough for a date. </strong></p><p><strong>How come, if dating is so important, people are so fucking lazy about dating?</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: It’s literally tragic, because it’s a lose-lose situation. Good relationships bring happiness to both people. It’s tragic that people suck at mate search in modern societies even though it’s very easy to find awesome partners. </p><p>If you have a soulmate model, in which there’s one person out there for you and you’re destined to meet them sooner or later, you’re going to be lazy about trying to meet them. That’s what happens in romantic comedies, where you just end up together in the same elevator that gets stuck and now you’re in love. But that doesn’t work.</p><p>Some of the fatalism comes from our ancestors living in tiny societies where there wasn’t really much choice. You probably already knew everyone who might be a potential mate who isn’t your cousin. You knew the tribes over the other hills and who might be in those tribes who is worth raiding or trying to seduce. I think we’re very maladapted to do sustained, rational mate search in these huge mating markets, even though there’s a huge upside to doing that.</p><p>Diana: I think you’re talking about rationalists when you’re saying that people don’t spend a lot of effort on mating. I was at a restaurant the other day, one of the waiters chatted up the two women at the table next to me, they left, and then he tried to chat me up even though I just heard him fail with the two women. I already knew his name and his story about the girl he had sex with and the rest of it! And even when I told him that, he was not deterred at all.</p><p>I think you’re talking about people who have the self-control to develop rationality and get advanced degrees and good jobs. And perhaps people do those things in order to get the highest status mate, but people get obsessed with all the trappings and lose sight of the final goal. </p><p>Regarding Tinder: everyone says that humans are so much more sophisticated than other animals. But on Tinder, all you know is how somebody’s face looks like and how far away they are. You may as well be a raccoon. </p><p><strong>Raccoons know each other’s smell, Tinder doesn’t even give you that.</strong></p><p>Diana: There’s so little information. Although people say that Tinder provides evidence for physiognomy, that you can tell some things about someone’s personality just from their face. </p><p>I do think Tinder is a shame, that people think so little about what they actually want. Although throughout history, if someone lived in proximity to you and was the same age as you, you would often end up together. People with a lot in common ending up together is quite a new thing. Part of why it’s so difficult now is that we know so much about each other, and are trying to find someone we have so much in common with. It’s a new thing. What used to happen is that people would meet, fall in love, and then grow similar to each other over time. </p><p>Certainly, the first time I was in love with someone I wanted to do all the things he liked to do, learn about all his interests, etc. At this stage of my life, I probably wouldn’t even have a conversation with him. But back then it was just that I met him and had sex with him. Do you know about voles? Voles have sex and then they just want to be around each other all the time, it’s just primal. I was 16, we had sex, and that was basically it.</p><p>What people don’t talk about enough is that as you get older you can assort and think of the characteristics that you like in a potential partner <em>because</em> you don’t fall in love as easily. But this idea that you get less “sticky” each time you have sex with a new person, that you get less attached, it’s a message promoted by Christians. They say you’re like a piece of tape that becomes less sticky each time. But I don’t want to be sticky, thank you very much.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/voles.jpg?w=900\" class=\"draft-image default\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure><em>Male and female prairie voles.</em></span><p><strong>This room is full of young and smart people who are interested in how minds work. Would you advise them to go into academic evolutionary psychology? If not, what should they do instead? And if they do enter it, what questions will evolutionary psychology grapple with in the next couple of decades?</strong></p><p>Geoffrey: For the love of God, don’t try to become an evolutionary psychologist. The job market <em>sucks</em>. It <em>really sucks</em>. It would be really hard to get a tenure track job. There are maybe 5 positions a year globally in ev psych versus hundreds in social psych or developmental psych. It’s probably not a viable career path.</p><p>But, I think reading ev psych can be enormously helpful for understanding yourself, your social life, mating, jobs, consumerism, money, all kinds of things. It’s one of those fields where it can offer a lot of value to the amateur who reads the better books and journals and blogs.</p><p><strong>Do you have recommendations?</strong></p><p>I have some <a href=\"https://www.primalpoly.com/new-page\">suggested reading on my site</a>, but that needs to be updated. There’s also everything in my syllabi. The people I know who have taken the time to study this stuff all say it was totally worth it. </p><p>Diana: It took me a couple of years to get a job when I was getting into the field, and I was up against 7 or 8 people. The fact I got it had more to do with how I was in the interview; they made all the classic mistakes when they hired me. I think that it can be a very interesting field but what I did was branching out to something else, I did two postdocs. I marketed myself as an evolutionary <em>and</em>health psychologist because all the jobs were in health psychology at the time, and that’s how I got my job. If you stick only to evolutionary psychology you’re very unlikely to get a job. </p><p>Talk to someone who does the research now, it’s a lot more rigorous. You can’t just come up with an idea, sample 50 undergrads, and publish something. There are really good discoveries to be made but it’s going to be hard for someone who comes along because a lot of those discoveries are things people don’t want to know. We were just talking about ideas like people manipulating each other, selfish gene ideas, these are not the ideas that people enjoy.</p><p><strong>So you don’t want competition.</strong></p><p>My department actually has an ev psych job coming up this year, for the first time since my colleague Marco del Giudice was hired about 8 years ago. </p><p>In terms of the future we are going to see gradual theoretical developments. The more important thing is that ev psych is going to spread globally and enter other countries. It’s pretty strong at the moment in the US, Canada, England, with pockets in Europe, Korea, Japan, and Australia. The real action is going to happen when India and/or China start taking it seriously and develop it. </p><p>My superforecaster prediction is that the Chinese government will realize that evolutionary psychology is really important to fix their mating market which is currently really sex-biased. They know that this will result in social instability because tens of millions of young men will not be able to find girlfriends or wives. They know that’s a huge political danger, so they have to do something. It could be free sex bots for everybody, or re-engineering the mating market so that more people are polyamorous, or something. The Chinese government has the capability to do big data analysis of their citizens in a way that we couldn’t possibly do. </p><p>In general, I think it’s easier to do large-scale analysis of human behavior if you work for a social media company than if you work in academia. There are 2.4 billion people on Facebook, so the Facebook behavioral sciences team has much richer data than I could ever imagine. But they’re not telling anybody outside what they’re doing, it’s a very siloed kind of science. </p><p>The other extreme is that I can run a Twitter poll to my 70k followers and get 4,000 replies in 12 hours. It’s a much bigger scale than I could ever acquire in a lab study, and I don’t need IRB approval for a Twitter poll. I can’t publish the data in a journal, but I and everybody else can learn from it.</p><p>There is going to be a bifurcation between official science that gets published in reputable journals, that pre-registered with careful analysis and takes two years to get published. And then fly-by-night informal social media polling on the other hand.</p><p>Diana: What I hope to see in the future is rather than universities doing studies with ridiculous ethics boards and so many obstacles, I hope to see more private individuals willing to become patrons of research that falls outside the mainstream. Some of it is happening right now, and it’s something I’m excited about. I hope to see more things privately funded with ethics done in-house according to a set of guidelines — this is going to work much faster and be much more efficient. Doing research through universities can be very onerous.</p><p><strong>That’s how we get to CRISPR babies too.</strong></p><p>Diana: And what’s wrong with that?</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias\">Optimism bias</a> is well-known. Here are some examples.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's conventional to answer the question \"How are you doing?\" with \"well\", regardless of how you're actually doing. Why?</li>\n<li>People often believe that it's inherently good to be happy, rather than thinking that their happiness level should track the actual state of affairs (and thus be a useful tool for emotional processing and communication). Why?</li>\n<li>People often think their project has an unrealistically high chance of succeeding. Why?</li>\n<li>People often avoid looking at horrible things clearly. Why?</li>\n<li>People often want to suppress criticism but less often want to suppress praise; in general, they hold criticism to a higher standard than praise. Why?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The parable of the gullible king</h2>\n<p>Imagine a kingdom ruled by a gullible king. The king gets reports from different regions of the kingdom (managed by different vassals). These reports detail how things are going in these different regions, including particular events, and an overall summary of how well things are going. He is quite gullible, so he usually believes these reports, although not if they're too outlandish.</p>\n<p>When he thinks things are going well in some region of the kingdom, he gives the vassal more resources, expands the region controlled by the vassal, encourages others to copy the practices of that region, and so on. When he thinks things are going poorly in some region of the kingdom (in a long-term way, not as a temporary crisis), he gives the vassal fewer resources, contracts the region controlled by the vassal, encourages others not to copy the practices of that region, possibly replaces the vassal, and so on. This behavior makes sense if he's assuming he's getting reliable information: it's better for practices that result in better outcomes to get copied, and for places with higher economic growth rates to get more resources.</p>\n<p>Initially, this works well, and good practices are adopted throughout the kingdom. But, some vassals get the idea of exaggerating how well things are going in their own region, while denigrating other regions. This results in their own region getting more territory and resources, and their practices being adopted elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Soon, these distortions become ubiquitous, as the king (unwittingly) encourages everyone to adopt them, due to the apparent success of the regions distorting information this way. At this point, the vassals face a problem: while they want to exaggerate their own region and denigrate others, they don't want others to denigrate their own region. So, they start forming alliances with each other. Vassals that ally with each other promise to say only good things about each other's regions. That way, both vassals mutually benefit, as they both get more resources, expansion, etc compared to if they had been denigrating each other's regions. These alliances also make sure to keep denigrating those not in the same coalition.</p>\n<p>While these \"praise coalitions\" are locally positive-sum, they're globally zero-sum: any gains that come from them (such as resources and territory) are taken from other regions. (However, having more praise overall helps the vassals <em>currently in power</em>, as it means they're less likely to get replaced with other vassals).</p>\n<p>Since praise coalitions lie, they also suppress <em>the truth in general</em> in a coordinated fashion. It's considered impolite to reveal certain forms of information that could imply that things aren't actually going as well as they're saying it's going. Prying too closely into a region's actual state of affairs (and, especially, sharing this information) is considered a violation of privacy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the actual state of affairs has gotten worse in almost all regions, though the regions prop up their lies with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village\">Potemkin villages</a>, so the gullible king isn't shocked when he visits the region.</p>\n<p>At some point, a <em>single</em> praise coalition wins. Vassals notice that it's in their interest to join this coalition, since (as mentioned before) it's in the interests of the vassals <em>as a class</em> to have more praise overall, since that means they're less likely to get replaced. (Of course, it's also in their class interests to have things <em>actually</em> be going well in their regions, so the praise doesn't get too out of hand, and criticism is sometimes accepted) At this point, it's conventional for vassals to always praise each other and punish vassals who denigrate other regions.</p>\n<p>Optimism isn't ubiquitous, however. There are a few strategies vassals can use to use pessimism to claim more resources. Among these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blame</em>: By claiming a vassal is doing something wrong, another vassal may be able to take power away from that vassal, sometimes getting a share of that power for themselves. (Blame is often not especially difficult, given that everyone's inflating their impressions)</li>\n<li><em>Pity</em>: By showing that their region is undergoing a temporary but fixable crisis (perhaps with the help of other vassals), vassals can claim that they should be getting more resources. But, the problem has to be solvable; it has to be a temporary crises, not a permanent state of decay. (One form of pity is claiming to be victimized by another vassal; this mixes blame and pity)</li>\n<li><em>Doomsaying</em>: By claiming that there is some threat to the kingdom (such as wolves), vassals can claim that they should be getting resources in order to fight this threat. Again, the threat has to be solvable; the king has little reason to give someone more resources if there is, indeed, nothing to do about the threat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pity and doomsaying could be seen as two sides of the same coin: pity claims things are going poorly (but fixably) locally, while doomsaying claims things are going poorly (but fixably) globally. However, all of these strategies are limited to a significant degree by the overall praise coalition, so they don't get out of hand.</p>\n<h2>Back to the real world</h2>\n<p>Let's relate the parable of the gullible king back to the real world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The king is sometimes an actual person (such as a CEO, as in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Mazes\">Moral Mazes</a>, or a philanthropist), but is more often a process distributed among many people that is evaluating which things are good/bad, in a pattern-matching way.</li>\n<li>Everyone's a vassal to some degree. People who have more power-through-appearing-good are vassals with more territory, who have more of an interest in maintaining positive impressions.</li>\n<li>Most (almost all?) coalitions in the real world have aspects of praise coalitions. They'll praise those in the coalition while denigrating those outside it.</li>\n<li>Politeness and privacy are, in fact, largely about maintaining impressions (especially positive impressions) through coordinating against the revelation of truth.</li>\n<li>Maintaining us-vs-them boundaries is characteristic of the political right, while dissolving them (and punishing those trying to set them up) is characteristic of the political left. So, non-totalizing praise coalitions are more characteristic of the right, and total ones that try to assimilate others (such as the one that won in the parable) are more characteristic of the left. (Note, totalizing praise coalitions still denigrate/attack ones that can't be safely assimilated; see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance\">paradox of tolerance</a>)</li>\n<li>Coalitions may be fractal, of course.</li>\n<li>A lot of the distortionary dynamics are subconscious (see: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GZT9Q1/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">The Elephant in the Brain</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This model raises an important question (with implications for the real world): if you're a detective in the kingdom of the gullible king who is at least somewhat aware of the reality of the situation and the distortonary dynamics, and you want to fix the situation (or at least reduce harm), what are your options?</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Epistemic Status: Pointing at early stage concepts, but with high confidence that something real is here. Hopefully not the final version of this post.</em></p><p>When I started studying rationality and philosophy, I had the perspective that people who were in positions of power and influence should primarily focus on how to make good decisions in general and that we should generally give power to people who have demonstrated a good track record of general rationality. I also thought of power as this mostly unconstrained resource, similar to having money in your bank account, and that we should make sure to primarily allocate power to the people who are good at thinking and making decisions.</p><p>That picture has changed a lot over the years. While I think there is still a lot of value in the idea of &quot;philosopher kings&quot;, I&#x27;ve made a variety of updates that significantly changed my relationship to allocating power in this way:</p><ul><li>I have come to believe that people&#x27;s ability to come to correct opinions about important questions is in large part a result of whether their social and monetary incentives reward them when they have accurate models in a specific domain. This means a person can have extremely good opinions in one domain of reality, because they are subject to good incentives, while having highly inaccurate models in a large variety of other domains in which their incentives are not well optimized.</li><li>People&#x27;s rationality is much more defined by their ability to maneuver themselves into environments in which their external incentives align with their goals, than by their ability to have correct opinions while being subject to incentives they don&#x27;t endorse. This is a tractable intervention and so the best people will be able to have vastly more accurate beliefs than the average person, but it means that &quot;having accurate beliefs in one domain&quot; doesn&#x27;t straightforwardly generalize to &quot;will have accurate beliefs in other domains&quot;. <br/><br/>One <em>is</em> strongly predictive of the other, and that’s in part due to general thinking skills and broad cognitive ability. But another major piece of the puzzle is the person&#x27;s ability to build and seek out environments with good incentive structures.</li><li>Everyone is highly irrational in their beliefs about at least some aspects of reality, and positions of power in particular tend to encourage strong incentives that don&#x27;t tend to be optimally aligned with the truth. This means that highly competent people in positions of power often have less accurate beliefs than  competent people who are not in positions of power.</li><li>The design of systems that hold people who have power and influence accountable in a way that aligns their interests with both forming accurate beliefs and the interests of humanity at large is a really important problem, and is a major determinant of the overall quality of the decision-making ability of a community. General rationality training helps, but for collective decision making the creation of accountability systems, the tracking of outcome metrics and the design of incentives is at least as big of a factor as the degree to which the individual members of the community are able to come to accurate beliefs on their own.</li></ul><p>A lot of these updates have also shaped my thinking while working at CEA, LessWrong and the LTF-Fund over the past 4 years. I&#x27;ve been in various positions of power, and have interacted with many people who had lots of power over the EA and Rationality communities, and I&#x27;ve become a lot more convinced that there is a lot of low-hanging fruit and important experimentation to be done to ensure better levels of accountability and incentive-design for the institutions that guide our community.</p><p>I also generally have broadly libertarian intuitions, and a lot of my ideas about how to build functional organizations are based on a more start-up like approach that is favored here in Silicon Valley. Initially these intuitions seemed at conflict with the intuitions for more emphasis on accountability structures, with broken legal systems, ad-hoc legislation, dysfunctional boards and dysfunctional institutions all coming to mind immediately as accountability-systems run wild. I&#x27;ve since then reconciled my thoughts on these topics a good bit.</p><h2><strong>Integrity</strong></h2><p>Somewhat surprisingly, &quot;integrity&quot; has not been much discussed as a concept handle on LessWrong. But I&#x27;ve found it to be a pretty valuable virtue to meditate and reflect on.</p><p>I think of integrity as a more advanced form of honesty – when I say “integrity” I mean something like “acting in accordance with your stated beliefs.” Where honesty is the commitment to not speak direct falsehoods, integrity is the commitment to speak truths that actually ring true to yourself, not ones that are just abstractly defensible to other people. It is also a commitment to act on the truths that you do believe, and to communicate to others what your true beliefs are.</p><p>Integrity can be a double-edged sword. While it is good to judge people by the standards they expressed, it is also a surefire way to make people overly hesitant to update. If you get punished every time you change your mind because your new actions are now incongruent with the principles you explained to others before you changed your mind, then you are likely to stick with your principles for far longer than you would otherwise, even when evidence against your position is mounting.</p><p>The great benefit that I experienced from thinking of integrity as a virtue, is that it encourages me to build accurate models of my own mind and motivations. I can only act in line with ethical principles that are actually related to the real motivators of my actions. If I pretend to hold ethical principles that do not correspond to my motivators, then sooner or later my actions will diverge from my principles. I&#x27;ve come to think of a key part of integrity being the art of making accurate predictions about my own actions and communicating those as clearly as possible.</p><p>There are two natural ways to ensure that your stated principles are in line with your actions. You either adjust your stated principles until they match up with your actions, or you adjust your behavior to be in line with your stated principles. Both of those can backfire, and both of those can have significant positive effects.</p><h2><strong>Who Should You Be Accountable To?</strong></h2><p>In the context of incentive design, I find thinking about integrity valuable because it feels to me like the natural complement to accountability. The purpose of accountability is to ensure that you do what you say you are going to do, and integrity is the corresponding virtue of holding up well under high levels of accountability.</p><p>Highlighting accountability as a variable also highlights one of the biggest error modes of accountability and integrity – choosing too broad of an audience to hold yourself accountable to.</p><p>There is tradeoff between the size of the group that you are being held accountable by, and the complexity of the ethical principles you can act under. Too large of an audience, and you will be held accountable by the lowest common denominator of your values, which will rarely align well with what you actually think is moral (if you&#x27;ve done any kind of real reflection on moral principles).</p><p>Too <em>small</em> or too memetically close of an audience, and you risk not enough people paying attention to what you do, to actually help you notice inconsistencies in your stated beliefs and actions. And, the smaller the group that is holding you accountable is, the smaller your inner circle of trust, which reduces the amount of total resources that can be coordinated under your shared principles.</p><p>I think a major mistake that even many well-intentioned organizations make is to try to be held accountable by some vague conception of &quot;the public&quot;. As they make public statements, someone in the public will misunderstand them, causing a spiral of less communication, resulting in more misunderstandings, resulting in even less communication, culminating into an organization that is completely opaque about any of its actions and intentions, with the only communication being filtered by a PR department that has little interest in the observers acquiring any beliefs that resemble reality.</p><p>I think a generally better setup is to choose a much smaller group of people that you trust to evaluate your actions very closely, and ideally do so in a way that is itself transparent to a broader audience. Common versions of this are auditors, as well as nonprofit boards that try to ensure the integrity of an organization.</p><p>This is all part of a broader reflection on trying to create good incentives for myself and the LessWrong team. I will try to follow this up with a post that more concretely summarizes my thoughts on how all of this applies to LessWrong concretely.</p><h2><strong>In summary:</strong></h2><ul><li>One lens to view integrity through is as an advanced form of honesty – “acting in accordance with your stated beliefs.”</li><ul><li>To improve integrity, you can either try to bring your actions in line with your stated beliefs, or your stated beliefs in line with your actions, or reworking both at the same time. These options all have failure modes, but potential benefits.</li></ul><li>People with power sometimes have incentives that systematically warp their ability to form accurate beliefs, and (correspondingly) to act with integrity.</li><li>An important tool for maintaining integrity (in general, and in particular as you gain power) is to carefully think about what social environment and incentive structures you want for yourself.</li><li>Choose carefully who, and how many people, you are accountable to:</li><ul><li>Too many people, and you are limited in the complexity of the beliefs and actions that you can justify.</li><li>Too few people, too similar to you, and you won’t have enough opportunities for people to notice and point out what you’re doing wrong. You may also not end up with a strong enough coalition aligned with your principles to accomplish your goals.</li></ul></ul><p>[This post was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EQJfdqSaMcJyR5k73#xQJYMNujxB3EqephZ\">my shortform feed</a>]</p>",

Jeff Hawkins is a theoretical neuroscientist; you may have heard of his 2004 book <em>On Intelligence</em>. Earlier, he had an illustrious career in EECS, including inventing the Palm Pilot. He now runs the company <a href=\"https://numenta.com/\">Numenta</a>, which is dedicated to understanding how the human brain works (especially the neocortex), and using that knowledge to develop bio-inspired AI algorithms.</p>\n<p>In no particular order, here are some highlights and commentary from the podcast and associated papers.</p>\n<h1>Every part of the neocortex is running the same algorithm</h1>\n<p>The neocortex is the outermost and most evolutionarily-recent layer of the mammalian brain. In humans, it is about the size and shape of a dinner napkin (maybe 1500cm²×3mm), and constitutes 75% of the entire brain. Jeff wants us to think of it like 150,000 side-by-side \"cortical columns\", each of which is a little 1mm²×3mm tube, although I don't think we're supposed to the \"column\" thing too literally (there's no sharp demarcation between neighboring columns).</p>\n<p>When you look at a diagram of the brain, the neocortex has loads of different parts that do different things—motor, sensory, visual, language, cognition, planning, and more. But Jeff says that all 150,000 of these cortical columns are virtually identical! Not only do they each have the same types of neurons, but they're laid out into the same configuration and wiring and larger-scale structures. In other words, there seems to be \"general-purpose neocortical tissue\", and if you dump visual information into it, it does visual processing, and if you connect it to motor control pathways, it does motor control, etc. He said that this theory originated with Vernon Mountcastle in the 1970s, and is now widely (but not universally) accepted in neuroscience. The theory is supported both by examining different parts of the brain under the microscope, and also by experiments, e.g. the fact that congenitally blind people can use their visual cortex for non-visual things, and conversely he mentioned in passing some old experiment where a scientist attached the optic nerve of a lemur to a different part of the cortex and it was able to see (or something like that).</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you accept that premise, then there is one type of computation that the neocortex does, and if we can figure it out, we'll understand everything from how the brain does visual processing to how Einstein's brain invented General Relativity.</p>\n<p>To me, cortical uniformity seems slightly at odds with the wide variety of instincts we have, like intuitive physics, intuitive biology, language, and so on. Are those not implemented in the neocortex? Are they implemented as connections between (rather than within) cortical columns? Or what? This didn't come up in the podcast. (ETA: I tried to answer this question in my later post, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NkSpukDkm9pjRdMdB/human-instincts-symbol-grounding-and-the-blank-slate\">Human instincts, Symbol grounding, and the blank-slate neocortex</a>.)</p>\n<p><em>(See also previous LW discussion at: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Yc7Pp7szcjPgPsjf/the-brain-as-a-universal-learning-machine\">The brain as a universal learning machine, 2015</a>)</em></p>\n<h1>Grid cells and displacement cells</h1>\n<h2>Background: Grid cells for maps in the hippocampus</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_cell\">Grid cells</a>, discovered in 2005, help animals build mental maps of physical spaces. (Grid cells are just one piece of a complicated machinery, along with \"place cells\" and other things, more on which shortly.) Grid cells are not traditionally associated with the neocortex, but rather the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. But Jeff says that there's some experimental evidence that they're also in the neocortex, and proposes that this is very important.</p>\n<p>What are grid cells? Numenta has an educational video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP7neeymcUY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">here</a>. Here's my oversimplified 1D toy example (the modules can also be 2D). I have a cortical column with three \"grid cell modules\". One module consists of 9 neurons, one has 10 neurons, and the third has 11. As I stand in a certain position in a room, one neuron from each of the three modules is active - let's say the active neurons right now are <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"(x_1 \\text{ mod }9)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

So far so good, but there's a missing ingredient: the transformation from the room map to the hallway map, especially in their areas of overlap. How does that work? Jeff proposes (in <a href=\"https://numenta.com/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/a-framework-for-intelligence-and-cortical-function-based-on-grid-cells-in-the-neocortex/\">this paper</a>) that there exist what he calls \"displacement cells\", which (if I understand it correctly) literally implement modular arithmetic for the grid cell neurons in each grid cell module. So⁠—still in the 1D toy example⁠—the relation between the room map and the hall map might be represented by three displacement cell neurons <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\delta_1, \\delta_2, \\delta_3\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.007em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em;

It's kinda funny, but why not? We just put in a bunch of synapses that hardcode each entry of an addition table⁠—and not even a particularly large one.</p>\n<p>(Overall, all the stuff about the detailed mechanisms of grid cells and displacement cells comes across to me as \"Ingenious workaround for the limitations of biology\", not \"Good idea that AI might want to copy\", but maybe I'm missing something.)</p>\n<h2>New idea: Grid cells for \"maps\" of objects and concepts in the neocortex</h2>\n<p>Anyway, Jeff theorizes that this grid cell machinery is not only used for navigating real spaces in the hippocampus but also navigating concept spaces in the neocortex.</p>\n<p><em>Example #1: A coffee cup.</em> We have a mental map of a coffee cup, and you can move around in that mental space by incrementing and decrementing the <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"x_i\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> (in my 1D toy example).</p>\n<p><em>Example #2: A coffee mug with a picture on it.</em> Now, we have a mental map of the coffee mug, and a separate mental map of the picture, and then a set of displacement cells describe where the picture is in relation to the coffee cup. (This also includes relative rotation and scale, which I guess are also part of this grid cell + displacement cell machinery somehow, but he says he hasn't worked out all the details.)</p>\n<p><em>Example #3: A stapler</em>, where the two halves move with respect to each other. This motion can be described by a sequence of displacement cells ... and conveniently, neurons are excellent at learning temporal sequences (see below).</p>\n<p><em>Example #4: Logarithms</em>. Jeff thinks we have a reference frame for <em>everything</em>! Every word,  every idea, every concept, everything you know has its own reference frame, in at least one of your cortical columns and probably thousands of them. Then displacement cells can encode the mathematical transformations of logarithms, and the relations between logarithms and other concepts, or something like that. I tried to sketch out an example of what he might be getting at in the next section below. Still, I found that his discussion of abstract cognition was a bit sketchier and more confusing than other things he talked about. My impression is that this is an aspect of the theory that he's still working on.</p>\n<h1>\"Thousand brains\" theory</h1>\n<p>(See also <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LNRZD9YJCdI\">Numenta educational video</a>.) His idea here is that every one of the 150,000 \"cortical columns\" in the brain (see above) has the whole machinery with grid cells and displacement cells, reference frames for gazillions of different objects and concepts, and so on.</p>\n<p>A cortical column that gets input from the tip of the finger is storing information and making predictions about what the tip of the finger will feel as it moves around the coffee cup. A cortical column in the visual cortex is storing information and making predictions about what it will <em>see</em> in <em>its</em> model of the coffee cup. And so on. If you reach into a box, and touch it with four fingers, each of those fingers is trying to fit its own data into its own model to learn what the object is, and there's a \"voting\" mechanism that allows them to reach agreement on what it is.</p>\n<p>So I guess if you're doing a math problem with a logarithm, and you're visually imagining the word \"log\" floating to the other side of the equation and turning into an \"exp\", then there's a cortical column in your <em>visual</em> cortex that \"knows\" (temporal sequence memory) how this particular mathematical transformation works. Maybe the other cortical columns don't \"know\" that that transformation is possible, but can find out the result via the voting mechanism.</p>\n<p>Or maybe you're doing the same math problem, but instead of visualizing the transformation, instead you recite to yourself the poem: \"Inverse of log is exp\". Well, then this knowledge is encoded as the temporal sequence memory in some cortical column of your <em>auditory</em> cortex.</p>\n<p>There's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus_argument\">homunculus-esque</a> intuition that all these hundreds of thousands of models need to be brought together into one unified world model. Neuroscientists calls this the \"sensor fusion\" problem. Jeff denies the whole premise. Thousands of different incomplete world models, plus a voting mechanism, is all you need; there is no unified world model.</p>\n<p>Is the separate world model for each cortical column an \"Ingenious workaround for the limitations of biology\" or a \"Good idea that AI should copy\"? On the one hand, clearly there's <em>some</em> map between the concepts in different cortical columns, so that voting can work. That suggests that we can improve on biology by having one unified world model, but with many different coordinate systems and types of sensory prediction associated with each entry. On the other hand, maybe the map between entries of different columns' world models is <em>not</em> a nice one-to-one map, but rather some fuzzy many-to-many map. Then unifying it into a single ontology might be fundamentally impossible (except trivially, as a disjoint union). I'm not sure. I guess I should look up how the voting mechanism is supposed to work.</p>\n<h1>Human-level AI, timelines, and existential risk</h1>\n<p>Jeff's goal is to \"understand intelligence\" and then use it to build intelligent machines. He is confident that this is possible, and that the machines can be dramatically smarter than humans (e.g. thinking faster, more memory, better at physics and math, etc.). Jeff thinks the hard part is done—he has the right framework for understanding cortical algorithms, even if there are still some details to be filled in. Thus, Jeff believes that, if he succeeds at proselytizing his understanding of brain algorithms to the AI community (which is why he was doing that podcast), then we should be able to make machines with human-like intelligence in less than 20 years.</p>\n<p>Near the end of the podcast, Jeff emphatically denounced the idea of AI existential risk, or more generally that there was any reason to second-guess his mission of getting beyond-human-level intelligence as soon as possible. However, he appears to be profoundly misinformed about both what the arguments are for existential risk and who is making them. Ditto for Lex, the podcast host.</p>\n<h1>Differences between actual neurons and artifical neural networks (ANNs)</h1>\n<h2>Non-proximal synapses and recognizing time-based patterns</h2>\n<p>He brought up his paper <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2016.00023\">Why do neurons have thousands of synapses?</a>. Neurons have anywhere from 5 to 30,000 synapses. There are two types. The synapses near the cell body (perhaps a few hundred) can cause the neuron to fire, and these are most similar to the connections in ANNs. The other 95% are way out on a dendrite (neuron branch), too far from the neuron body to make it fire, <em>even if all 95% were activated at once</em>! Instead, what happens is if you have 10-40 of these synapses that all activate at the same time <em>and are all very close to each other on the dendrite</em>, it creates a \"dendritic spike\" that goes to the cell body and raises the voltage a little bit, but not enough to make the cell fire. And then the voltage goes back down shortly thereafter. What good is that? If the neuron is triggered to fire (due to the first type of synapses, the ones near the cell body), and has already been prepared by a dendritic spike, then it fires slightly <em>sooner</em>, which matters because there are fast inhibitory processes, such that if a neuron fires slightly before its neighbors, it can prevent those neighbors from firing at all.</p>\n<p>So, there are dozens to hundreds of different patterns that the neuron can recognize—one for each close-together group of synapses on a dendrite—each of which can cause a dendritic spike. This allows networks of neurons to do sophisticated temporal predictions, he says: \"Real neurons in the brain are time-based prediction engines, and there's no concept of this at all\" in ANNs; \"I don't think you can build intelligence without them\".</p>\n<p>Another nice thing about this is that a neuron can learn a new pattern by forming a new cluster of synapses out on some dendrite, and it won't alter the neuron's other behavior—i.e., it's an OR gate, so when that particular pattern is not occurring, the neuron behaves exactly as before.</p>\n<h2>Binary weights, sparse representations</h2>\n<p>Another difference: \"synapses are very unreliable\"; you can't even assign one digit of precision to their connection strength. You have to think of it as almost binary. By contrast, I think most ANN weights are stored with at least ~2 and more often 7 decimal digits of precision.</p>\n<p>Related to this, \"the brain works on sparse patterns\". He mentioned his paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00720\">How do neurons operate on sparse distributed representations? A mathematical theory of sparsity, neurons and active dendrites</a>. He came back to this a couple times. Apparently in the brain, at any given moment, ~2% of neurons are firing. So imagine a little subpopulation of 10,000 neurons, and you're trying to represent something with a population code of sets of 200 of these neurons. First, there's an enormous space of possibilities (<span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"10^{424}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">10</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.591em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">424</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>). Second, if you pick two random sets-of-200, their overlap is almost always just a few. Even if you pick millions of sets, there won't be any pair that significantly overlaps. Therefore a neuron can \"listen\" for, say, 15 of the 200 neurons comprising X, and if those 15 all fire at once, that must have been X. The low overlap between different sets also gives the system robustness, for example to neuron death. Based on these ideas, they recently published <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11257\">this paper advocating for sparseness in image classifier networks</a>, which sounds to me like they're reinventing neural network pruning, but maybe it's slightly different, or at least better motivated.</p>\n<h2>Learning and synaptogenesis</h2>\n<p>According to Jeff, the brain does not learn by changing the strength of synapses, but rather by forming new synapses (synaptogenesis). Synaptogenesis takes about an hour. How does short-term memory work faster than that? There's something called \"silent synapses\", which are synapses that don't release neurotransmitters. Jeff's (unproven) theory is that short-term memory entails the conversion of silent synapses into active synapses, and that this occurs near-instantaneously.</p>\n<h2>Vision processing</h2>\n<p>His <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00121/full\">most recent paper</a> has this image of image processing in the visual cortex:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://numenta.com/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/images/thousand-brains-theory-of-intelligence.jpg\" alt=\"image text\"></p>\n<p>As I understand it, the idea is that every part of the field of view is trying to fit what it's looking at into its own world model. In other words, when you look at a cup, you shouldn't be thinking that the left, center, and right parts of the field-of-view are combined together and then the whole thing is recognized as a coffee cup, but rather that the left part of the field-of-view figures out that it's looking at the left side of the coffee cup, the center part of the field-of-view figures out that it's looking at the center of the coffee cup, and the right part of the field-of-view figures out that it's looking at the right side of the coffee cup. This process is facilitated by information exchange between different parts of the field-of-view, as well as integrating the information that a single cortical column sees over time as the eye or coffee cup moves. As evidence, they note that there are loads of connections in the visual cortex that are non-hierarchical (green arrows). Meanwhile, the different visual areas (V1, V2, etc.) are supposed to operate on different spatial scales, such that a faraway cup of coffee (taking up a tiny section of your field-of-view) might be recognized mainly in V1, while a close-up cup of coffee (taking up a larger chunk of your field-of-view) might be recognized mainly in V4, or something like that.</p>\n<p>Maybe this has some profound implications for building CNN image classifiers, but I haven't figured out what exactly they would be, other than \"Maybe try putting in a bunch of recurrent, non-hierarchical, and/or feedback connections?\"</p>\n<h1>My conclusions for AGI safety</h1>\n<p>Jeff's proud pursuit of superintelligence-as-fast-as-possible is a nice reminder that, despite the mainstreaming of AGI safety over the past few years, there's still a lot more advocacy and outreach work to be done. Again, I'm concerned not so much about the fact that he disagrees with arguments for AGI existential risks, but rather that he (apparently) has never even <em>heard</em> the arguments for AGI existential risks, at least not from any source capable of explaining them correctly.</p>\n<p>As for paths and timelines: I'm not in a great position to judge whether Jeff is on the right track, and there are way too many people who claim to understand the secrets of the brain for me to put a lot of weight on any one of them being profoundly correct. Still, I was pretty impressed, and I'm updating slightly in favor of neuromorphic AGI happening soon, particularly because of his claim that the whole neocortex is more-or-less cytoarchitecturally uniform.</p>\n<p>Finally, maybe the most useful thing I got out of this is fleshing out my thinking about what an AGI's world model might look like.</p>\n<p>Jeff is proposing that our human brain's world models are <em>ridiculously</em> profligate in the number of primitive entries included. Our world models don't just have one entry for \"shirt\", but rather separate entries for wet shirt, folded shirt, shirt-on-ironing-board, shirt-on-floor, shirt-on-our-body, shirt-on-someone-else's-body, etc. etc. etc. After all, each of those things is associated with a different suite of sensory predictions! In fact, it's even more profligate than that: Really, there might be an entry for \"shirt on the floor, as it feels to the center part of my left insole when I step on it\", and an entry for \"my yellow T-shirt on the floor, as it appears to the rod cells in my right eye's upper peripheral vision\". Likewise, instead of <em>one</em> entry for the word \"shirt\", there are thousands of them in the various columns of the auditory cortex (for the spoken word), and thousands more in the columns of the visual cortex (for the written word). To the extent that there's <em>any</em> generic abstract concept of \"shirt\" in the human brain, it would probably be some meta-level web of learned connections and associations and transformations between all these different entries.</p>\n<p>If we build an AI which, like the human brain, has literally trillions of primitive elements in its world model, it seems hopeless to try to peer inside and interpret what it's thinking. But maybe it's not so bad? Let's say some part of cortical column #127360 has 2000 active neurons at some moment. We can break that down into 10 simultaneous active concepts (implemented as sparse population codes of 200 neurons each), and then for each of those 10, we can look back at the record of what was going on the first time that code ever appeared. We can look at the connections between that code and columns of the language center, and write down all those words. We can look at the connections between that code and columns of the visual cortex, and display all those images. Probably we can figure out more-or-less what that code is referring to, right? But it might take 1000 person-years to interpret one second of thought by a human-brain-like AGI! (...Unless we have access to an army of AI helpers, says the disembodied voice of Paul Christiano....) Also, some entries of the world model might be just plain illegible despite our best efforts, e.g. the various neural codes active in Ed Witten's brain when he thinks about theoretical physics.</p>\n</body></html>",

Lewis wrote a short book attacking moral subjectivism in education; it&#x27;s available online <a href=\"http://www.samizdat.qc.ca/cosmos/philo/AbolitionofMan.pdf\">here as a pdf</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/TheAbolitionOfMan_229/C.s.Lewis-TheAbolitionOfMan_djvu.txt\">here as raw text</a>, and here as a series of videos [<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX5e6eSkaMc\">1</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TddUarSKniw\">2</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idgYLTnSzxI&fbclid=IwAR0PEtlgWwhZK0Os2uE_8kADAh15KN0qIJn1c7yNyY6-BuGIJUCCgBC9FGw\">3</a>], and I think probably worth reading in full (at 50 pages or ~100 minutes of video at 1x speed). This post is mostly me rambling about what I saw as the central point, especially connected to individual development and community health, by quoting sections and then reacting to them.</p><p>The book begins with a reaction to a grammar textbook (written in 1939) euphemistically called <em>The Green Book</em> whose lessons are also philosophical; Lewis doesn&#x27;t object to the bait-and-switch (outside of one paragraph) so much as the content and quality of the philosophy. (One suspects Lewis wouldn&#x27;t object to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gods_of_the_Copybook_Headings\">Copybook Headings referenced by Kipling</a>, even tho that mixes writing lessons and philosophy.) </p><blockquote>Until quite modern times all teachers and even all men believed the universe to be such that certain emotional reactions on our part could be either congruous or incongruous to it--believed, in fact, that objects did not merely receive, but could <em>merit</em>, our approval or disapproval, our reverence or our contempt.</blockquote><p>First, let&#x27;s get the obvious objections out of the way: the claim of universality is probably false. Even supposing it were true, then the underlying change seems worth investigating. Naive belief that one&#x27;s map is objective reality disintegrates on contact with different maps and after noticing surprising divergences between one&#x27;s predictions and observations; one can imagine this happening in the moral realm as well as the physical one. But presumably we should just ignore this as standard &quot;the contemporary world is fallen and bad&quot; framing instead of an actual historical claim.</p><p>The more interesting claim here is the question of whether or not there can or should be a question of <em>merit</em>, distinct from a question of flavor or fact. A previous taxonomy I&#x27;ve liked a lot (that I was mostly introduced to by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lta4N7r2wSn9GnhW8/sapiens\">Sapiens</a>) is the split between objective (determined by reality), subjective (determined by the person in question), and intersubjective (determined by some group process); the rules of a game are not just &#x27;my personal whims&#x27; and are also not &#x27;scientific&#x27; <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fhojYBGGiYAFcryHZ/scientific-evidence-legal-evidence-rational-evidence\">in the sense</a> that any outside observer would be able to determine it themselves. Without access to human civilization; aliens would figure out the same physics, and they might play something like chess, but they likely won&#x27;t play chess. Nevertheless, concepts like chess are an important component of your epistemology and there is such a thing as a &#x27;legal move&#x27; or &#x27;illegal move.&#x27;</p><blockquote>But what is common to [religious traditions] is something we cannot neglect. It is the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and other really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind of things we are. Those who know the <em>Tao </em>can hold that to call children delightful or old men venerable is not simply to record a psychological fact about our own parental or filial emotions at the moment, but to recognize a quality which <em>demands</em> a certain response from us whether we make it or not.” </blockquote><p>Lewis is trying to go a step further; in my framing, there&#x27;s a thing about the &#x27;game that is society&#x27; that involves &#x27;playing with reality&#x27; in a way that makes it something a little more objective than the &#x27;intersubjective.&#x27; It&#x27;s not just that everyone jointly decided that old people are venerable and thus the fashion is to venerate them; it&#x27;s that somehow venerating old people is congruous with the Tao and not venerating them isn&#x27;t, and so getting that question wrong is worse on some dimension than just playing chess by the wrong rules. Play chess by the wrong rules and people will throw you out of the chess club; play society by the wrong rules and your society collapses or misery abounds. Lewis uses &#x27;the <em>Tao</em>&#x27; to refer to both &#x27;the underlying territory as distinct from the map&#x27; and &#x27;the sort of human behavior congruous with the territory&#x27;, in a way that seems connected to this sense of &#x27;the universe as participant in the game that is society.&#x27;</p><p>Note that he says &quot;true to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind of things we are&quot;, as opposed to simply &quot;true.&quot; This seems consistent with &#x27;morality as the product of game theory&#x27;, and a sort of subjectivism that allows for different environments to have different moralities, or different professions to have different ethics; the <em>Tao </em>of the soldier may be distinct from the <em>Tao</em> of the doctor, and the <em>Tao</em> of the Inuit different from the <em>Tao</em> of the Swahili. It reminds me of the claim that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XhaKvQyHzeXdNnFKy/probability-is-subjectively-objective\">Probability is Subjectively Objective</a>; if one is a soldier, the &#x27;right way to be&#x27; is different than if one is a doctor, but there is still a meaningful sense in which there is only &#x27;one right way to be&#x27; that is not destroyed by that variation. [Imagine a function from &#x27;broad situation&#x27; to &#x27;proper behavior&#x27;; this function can vary as you change the input while still being a deterministic function.]</p><blockquote>If they embark on this course the difference between the old and the new education will be an important one. Where the old initiated, the new merely ‘conditions’. The old dealt with its pupils as grown birds deal with young birds when they teach them to fly; the new deals with them more as the poultry-keeper deals with young birds--making them thus or thus for purposes of which the birds know nothing. In a word, the old was a kind of propagation--men transmitting manhood to men; the new is merely propaganda.   </blockquote><p>The contrast between &#x27;initiation&#x27; and &#x27;conditioning&#x27; stuck out to me. One way you could get such a split is a separation between Educators and Students where most students will not become educators, whereas most boy-children become men. When I try to figure out what the difference between religions and cults are, especially when it comes to things like the rationality community, I keep thinking about this sense of &quot;explorers trying to create more explorers&quot;, and how it differs from &quot;carnies trying to use marks&quot;, and somehow it seems connected to feedback loops. The man trying to make the next generation into men relates to the next generation differently from how the carnie trying to extract money from marks relates to those marks. Not only does the former involve identification with the audience (where the latter recoils from that), the former is trying to get the audience to understand the whole process (so that they too, in their time, can perform it), whereas the latter is trying to get the audience to misunderstand the whole process (so that they will come back and be fleeced again).</p><p>To the extent that the High Modernist or Reformer or Rationalist sees the outside as a thing to be optimized, as opposed to part of a system that needs to support further optimization, it seems like there&#x27;s some deep short-sightedness and disconnection from the <em>Tao</em>. To the extent that some profession sees the outside world as something to be profited from, as opposed to a body in which they are an organ, we should expect the society to be sick in some way.</p><blockquote>Let us suppose for a moment that the harder virtues could really be theoretically justified with no appeal to objective value. It still remains true that no justification of virtue will enable a man to be virtuous. Without the aid of trained emotions the intellect is powerless against the animal organism. … The head rules the belly through the chest--the seat, as Alanus tells us, of Magnanimity, of emotions organized by trained habit into stable sentiments. The Chest-Magnanimity-Sentiment--these are the indispensable liaison officers between cerebral man and visceral man. It may even be said that it is by this middle element that man is man; for by his intellect he is a mere spirit and by his appetite mere animal.</blockquote><blockquote>The operation of <em>The Green Book </em>and its kind is to produce what may be called Men without Chests. It is an outrage that they should be commonly spoken of as Intellectuals. This gives them the chance to say that he who attacks them attacks Intelligence. </blockquote><p>This reminded me of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KsHmn6iJAEr9bACQW/bayesians-vs-barbarians\">Bayesians vs. Barbarians</a>, with a new dimension added; it is not that the Barbarians gain from having less in their head, it is that the Bayesians lost because they forgot to develop their chests. When I was younger, I read through The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and was confused by the educational strategy; here were these staunchly moral characters, as evidenced by their disgust at taking immoral actions that would benefit them, but the source of their morality seemed unspoken and unjustified. This felt like a serious contrast to what I observed at my local church, where people put in serious amounts of effort to become slightly more aligned with their reasoned values. It looked like all that was assumed unnecessary; one simply had to paint the picture of correctness and it would be followed by the righteous without any exercise or training.</p><p>Another Eliezer reference is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational\">Feeling Rational</a>, which points at the congruity property of emotions, but only with regards to factual truth; if you&#x27;re afraid about an iron being hot and it&#x27;s cold, you&#x27;re making a mistake, and if you&#x27;re calm about an iron being cold and it&#x27;s hot, you&#x27;re making a mistake. But that seems to miss the intersubjective angle; in some contexts, reacting to criticism with defensiveness is inappropriate and reacting to criticism with curiosity is appropriate, and some large part of &#x27;training human rationality&#x27; is inculcating the right emotional responses in oneself. A dojo isn&#x27;t just about transfer of technique, but also about transfer of attitude.</p>",

Called Pluribus, it plays 6-player No-limit Texas Hold'em at superhuman level.</p>\n<p>In this post, we read through the paper. The level of exposition is between the paper (too serious) and the popular press (too entertaining).</p>\n<h2>Basics of Texas Hold'em</h2>\n<p>If you don't know what it even is, like me, then playing a tutorial would be best. I used <a href=\"https://www.governorofpoker.com/games/learn-poker/\">Learn Poker</a> on my phone.</p>\n<p>Now that you know how to play it, it's time to deal with some of the terminologies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Big blind: the minimal money/poker chips that every player must bet in order to play. For example, $0.1 would be a reasonable amount in casual play.</li>\n<li>No-limit: you can bet as much as you want. Okay, not really. You can't bet a billion dollars. In practical playing, it's usually limited to something \"reasonable\" like 100 times of the big blind.</li>\n<li>Heads-up: 2-player.</li>\n<li>Limping: betting the minimal amount that you have to bet, in order to keep yourself in the game. This is generally considered bad: if you feel confident, you should raise the bet, and if you feel diffident, you should quit.</li>\n<li>Donk betting: some kind of uncommon play that's usually considered dumb (like a donkey). I didn't figure out what it actually means.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The authors</h2>\n<p>The authors are Noam Brown and Tuomas Sandholm. Previously, they made the news by writing <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6374/418.abstract\">Libratus</a>, a poker AI that beat human champions in 2-player no-limit Texas Hold'em, in 2017.</p>\n<p>Pluribus contains a lot of the code from Libratus and its siblings:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The authors have ownership interest in Strategic Machine, Inc. and Strategy Robot, Inc. which have exclusively licensed prior game-solving code from Prof. Sandholm’s Carnegie Mellon University laboratory, which constitutes the bulk of the code in Pluribus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scroll to the bottom for more on the two companies.</p>\n<h2>Highlights from the paper</h2>\n<h4>Is Nash equilibrium even worthwhile?</h4>\n<p>In multiplayer games, Nash equilibriums are not easy to compute, and might not even matter. Consider the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1978730\">Lemonade Stand Game</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is summer on Lemonade Island, and you need to make some cash. You decide to set up a lemonade stand on the beach (which goes all around the island), as do two others. There are twelve places to set up around the island like the numbers on a clock. Your price is fixed, and all people go to the nearest lemonade stand. The game is repeated. Every night, everyone moves under cover of darkness (simultaneously). There is no cost to move. After 100 days of summer, the game is over. The utility of the repeated game is the sum of the utilities of the single-shot games.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Nash equilibrium is when three of you are equidistant from each other, but there's no way to achieve that unilaterally. You might decide that you will just stay in Stand 0 and wait for the others to get to Stand 4 and Stand 8, but they might decide upon a different Nash equilibrium.</p>\n<p>The authors decided to go all empirical and not consider the problem of Nash equilibrium:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The shortcomings of Nash equilibria outside of two-player zero-sum games, and the failure of any other game-theoretic solution concept to convincingly overcome them, have raised the question of what the right goal should even be in such games. In the case of six-player poker, we take the viewpoint that our goal should not be a specific game-theoretic solution concept, but rather to create an AI that empirically consistently defeats human opponents, including elite human professionals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The success of Pluribus appears to vindicate them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... even though the techniques do not have known strong theoretical guarantees on performance outside of the two-player zero-sum setting, they are nevertheless capable of producing superhuman strategies in a wider class of strategic settings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Description of Pluribus</h4>\n<p>Pluribus first produces a \"blueprint\" by offline self-play, then during live gaming, adapt it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The core of Pluribus’s strategy was computed via self play, in which the AI plays against copies of itself, without any data of human or prior AI play used... Pluribus’s self play produces a strategy for the entire game offline, which we refer to as the blueprint strategy. Then during actual play against opponents, Pluribus improves upon the blueprint strategy by searching for a better strategy in real time for the situations it finds itself in during the game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the first round (like chess opening vs chess midgame) had the smallest amount of variation, Pluribus could afford to train an almost complete blueprint strategy for the first round. For later rounds, some real-time search was needed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus only plays according to this blueprint strategy in the first betting round (of four)... After the first round, Pluribus instead conducts real-time search to determine a better, finer-grained strategy for the current situation it is in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus uses <a href=\"https://int8.io/counterfactual-regret-minimization-for-poker-ai/#Counterfactual_regret_minimization\">Monte Carlo counterfactual regret minimization</a>. The details can be found in the link.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The blueprint strategy in Pluribus was computed using a variant of counterfactual regret minimization (CFR)... We use a form of Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR) that samples actions in the game tree rather than traversing the entire game tree on each iteration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus can be sneaky:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... if the player bets in [a winning] situation only when holding the best possible hand, then the opponents would know to always fold in response. To cope with this, Pluribus keeps track of the probability it would have reached the current situation with each possible hand according to its strategy. Regardless of which hand Pluribus is actually holding, it will first calculate how it would act with every possible hand, being careful to balance its strategy across all the hands so as to remain unpredictable to the opponent. Once this balanced strategy across all hands is computed, Pluribus then executes an action for the hand it is actually holding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was corroborated by a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48959931\">comment from a human opponent</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Pluribus is a very hard opponent to play against,\" said Chris Ferguson, a World Series of Poker champion. \"It's really hard to pin him down on any kind of hand.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scroll down for how Ferguson lost to Pluribus.</p>\n<h4>Pluribus is cheap, small, and fast</h4>\n<p>In order to make Pluribus small, the blueprint strategy is \"abstracted\", that is, it intentionally confuses some game actions (because really, $200 and $201 are not so different).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We set the size of the blueprint strategy abstraction to allow Pluribus to run during live play on a machine with no more than 128 GB of memory while storing a compressed form of the blueprint strategy in memory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The abstraction paid off. Pluribus was cheap to train, cheap to run, and faster than humans:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The blueprint strategy for Pluribus was computed in 8 days on a 64-core server for a total of 12,400 CPU core hours. It required less than 512 GB of memory. At current cloud computing spot instance rates, this would cost about $144 to produce.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When playing, Pluribus runs on two Intel Haswell E5-2695 v3 CPUs and uses less than 128 GB of memory. For comparison... Libratus used 100 CPUs in its 2017 matches against top professionals in two-player poker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On Amazon right now, Intel® Xeon® Processor E5-2695 v3 CPU cost just $500 each, and a 128 GB RAM cost $750. The whole setup can be constructed for under $2000. It would only take a little while to recoup the cost if it goes to online poker.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The amount of time Pluribus takes to conduct search on a single subgame varies between 1 s and 33 s depending on the particular situation. On average, Pluribus plays at a rate of <strong>20 s per hand when playing against copies of itself</strong> in six-player poker. This is roughly <strong>twice as fast as professional humans tend to play</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Pluribus vs Human professionals. Pluribus wins!</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We evaluated Pluribus against elite human professionals in two formats: five human professionals playing with one copy of Pluribus (5H+1AI), and one human professional playing with five copies of Pluribus (1H+5AI). Each human participant has won more than $1 million playing poker professionally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Professional Poker is an endurance game, like marathon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this experiment, 10,000 hands of poker were played over 12 days. Each day, five volunteers from the pool of [13] professionals were selected to participate based on availability. The participants were not told who else was participating in the experiment. Instead, each participant was assigned an alias that remained constant throughout the experiment. The alias of each player in each game was known, so that players could track the tendencies of each player throughout the experiment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And there was prize money, of course, for the humans. Pluribus played for free -- what a champ.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>$50,000 was divided among the human participants based on their performance to incentivize them to play their best. Each player was guaranteed a minimum of $0.40 per hand for participating, but this could increase to as much as $1.60 per hand based on performance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus had a very high win rate, and is statistically demonstrated to be profitable when playing against 5 elite humans:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After applying AIVAT, Pluribus won an average of 48 mbb/game (with a standard error of 25 mbb/game). This is considered a very high win rate in six-player no-limit Texas hold’em poker, especially against a collection of elite professionals, and implies that Pluribus is stronger than the human opponents. Pluribus was determined to be profitable with a p-value of 0.028.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"mbb/game\" means \"milli big blinds per game\". \"big blind\" just means \"the least amount that one must bet at the beginning of the game\", and poker players use it as a unit of measurement of the size of bets. \"milli\" means 1/1000. So Pluribus would on average win 4.8% of the big blind each game. Very impressive.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/early/2019/07/10/science.aay2400/F5.large.jpg\" alt=\"Performance of Pluribus in the 5 humans + 1 AI experiment\"></p>\n<p>AIVAT is statistical technique that is designed specifically to evaluate how good a poker player is. From <a href=\"https://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/publications/aaai18-burch-aivat.pdf\">(Neil Burch et al, 2018)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Evaluating agent performance when outcomes are stochastic and agents use randomized strategies can be challenging when there is limited data available... [AIVAT] was able to reduce the standard deviation of a Texas hold’em poker man-machine match by 85% and consequently requires 44 times fewer games to draw the same statistical conclusion. AIVAT enabled the first statistically significant AI victory against professional poker players in no-limit hold’em.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Pluribus vs Jesus (and Elias)</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The human participants in the 1H+5AI experiment were Chris “Jesus” Ferguson and Darren Elias. Each of the two humans separately played 5,000 hands of poker against five copies of Pluribus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus did not gang up on the poor human:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus does not adapt its strategy to its opponents and does not know the identity of its opponents, so the copies of Pluribus could not intentionally collude against the human player.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The humans were paid on average $0.60 per game:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To incentivize strong play, we offered each human $2,000 for participation and an additional $2,000 if he performed better against the AI than the other human player did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus won!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the 10,000 hands played, Pluribus beat the humans by an average of 32 mbb/game (with a standard error of 15 mbb/game). Pluribus was determined to be profitable with a p-value of 0.014.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ferguson lost less than Elias:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ferguson’s lower loss rate may be a consequence of variance, skill, and/or the fact that he used a more conservative strategy that was biased toward folding in unfamiliar difficult situations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Pluribus is an alien, like AlphaZero</h4>\n<p>And like AlphaZero, it confirms some human strategies, and dismisses some others:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because Pluribus’s strategy was determined entirely from self-play without any human data, it also provides an outside perspective on what optimal play should look like in multiplayer no-limit Texas hold’em.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Two examples in particular:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus confirms the conventional human wisdom that limping (calling the “big blind” rather than folding or raising) is suboptimal for any player except the “small blind” player... While Pluribus initially experimented with limping... it gradually discarded this action from its strategy as self play continued. However, Pluribus disagrees with the folk wisdom that “donk betting” (starting a round by betting when one ended the previous betting round with a call) is a mistake; Pluribus does this far more often than professional humans do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Too dangerous to be released, again</h4>\n<p>The program is not released for some kind of unspecified risk. (News articles made it specifically about the risk of wrecking the online gambling industry.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because poker is played commercially, the risk associated with releasing the code outweighs the benefits. To aid reproducibility, we have included the pseudocode for the major components of our program in the supplementary materials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Useful quotes from other news report</h2>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/facebook-ai-pluribus-defeats-top-poker-professionals-in-6-player-texas-holdem/\">Ars Technica</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus actually confirmed one bit of conventional poker-playing wisdom: it's just not a good idea to \"limp\" into a hand, that is, calling the big blind rather than folding or raising. The exception, of course, is if you're in the small blind, when mere calling costs you half as much as the other players.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pluribus placed donk bets far more often than its human opponents... Pluribus makes unusual bet sizes and is better at randomization. \"Its major strength is its ability to use mixed strategies... to do this in a perfectly random way and to do so consistently. Most people just can't.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613943/facebooks-new-poker-playing-ai-could-wreck-the-online-poker-industryso-its-not-being/\">MIT Technology Review</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sandholm cites multi-party negotiation or pricing—such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target trying to come up with the most competitive pricing against each other—as a specific application. Optimal media spending for political campaigns is another example, as well as auction bidding strategies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a bit of details to the two companies of Sandholm:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sandholm has already licensed much of the poker technology developed in his lab to two startups: Strategic Machine and Strategy Robot. The first startup is interested in gaming and other entertainment applications; Strategy Robot's focus is on defense and intelligence applications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Better computer games\"... hm, sounds suspiciously nonspecific.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brown says Facebook has no plans to apply the techniques developed for six-player poker, although they could be used to develop better computer games.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</body></html>",

In this... review? report? detailed journal entry? ... I will focus on the things which stood out to me. (Definitely not meant to be understandable for anyone unfamiliar with the field.) The book has ten chapters; I did most of the exercises in chapters 6 to 10. I got through that half of the book in about 3 weeks, which was nice since the previous (harder and longer) textbook on topology I worked through took me about a year. </p><p>I&apos;ve previously taken two introductory courses to liner algebra and came out thinking of the field as large and very unstructured, with lots of concepts and theorems floating around disconnectedly. What is a normal matrix? I might or might not have remembered the definition, but I certainly had no idea what it is good for. Three weeks of intense study with this book has improved my understanding dramatically. Now, the field seems structured and pretty intuitive (and I certainly won&apos;t forget what a normal operator is). It is truly hard to overstate how good of a job this book does teaching the subject, compared to what I&apos;ve seen before. It&apos;s probably the best textbook on anything I&apos;ve read so far.</p><p><strong>Chapter 1</strong> introduces complex numbers and vectors spaces.</p><p><strong>Chapter 2</strong> introduces finite-dimensional vector spaces. What stands out is just how nicely behaved they are. Every finite-dimensional real or complex vector space is isomorphic to either <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal;

Actually, every inner product induces a norm, every norm induces a metric, any metric induces a topology, but none of the reverse steps are true. Put differently, metric topologies are particularly nice topologies, metrics from norms are particularly nice metrics, norms from inner-products are particularly nice norms, and inner products are the concept studied in chapters 6 and 7. So Linear Algebra only even bothers with the the super nicely behaved stuff.</p><p>I&apos;ll now detail my biggest confusion with LA before reading this book (this is something I&apos;ve even brought up explicitly, but without getting a satisfying answer): if <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"T : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

&#x2013; is that determinants aren&apos;t introduced until the final chapter. This is very unusual: most courses, such as the lectures I took, frequently use determinants in proofs. But all of these proofs can be done without them. And they tend to be fairly simple, too; only a couple are longer than a page.</p><p>Doing this, one finds that there are striking parallels between properties about polynomials and properties about linear vector spaces, which seems a lot better for developing a useful intuition than what one gets by doing determinant-based proofs. The central theorem about <em>operators </em>introduced in <strong>Chapter 5</strong>, for example, states that every operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue (that is, a scalar <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"a \\in \\mathbb{F}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">a</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2208;</span></span><span class=\"mjx-texatom MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">F</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> such that there exists a nonzero vector <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"v\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">v</span></span></span></span></span></span> such that <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"Tv = av\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.12em;\">T</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">v</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">a</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">v</span></span></span></span></span></span>).

This feels very powerful, even if arbitrarily difficult problems exist regardless.</p><p>With <strong>Chapter 7</strong>, we&apos;re getting to the big classification theorems. LA wants to study linear maps, and in this chapter  it classifies all of the linear maps such that there exists an orthonormal basis relative to which they have diagonal form. This is the aforementioned spectral theorem. These are the <em>normal operators</em> on complex vector spaces, and the <em>self-adjoint</em> operators (which is a strictly stronger property) on real vector spaces. This highlights another recurring pattern: there are often two versions of each result, one super nice one about complex vector spaces, and a less nice, more cumbersome one about real vector spaces. This makes a lot of sense given that <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathbb{C}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">C</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is far more nicely behaved than <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathbb{R}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> (this is kind of why we defined complex numbers in the first place). More specifically, it usually comes down to the fact that every polynomial of degree <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\ge 1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">&#x2265;</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> has a root in <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathbb{C}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">C</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, but not necessarily in <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathbb{R}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, just like it did in the aforementioned result on the existence of eigenvalues. The book also draws an interesting parallel between self-adjoint operators and real numbers.</p><p>In <strong>Chapters 8 and 9, </strong>we return to the study of eigenvalues.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>In discussions of algorithm bias, the COMPAS scandal has been too often quoted out of context. This post gives the facts, and the interpretation, as quickly as possible. See <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161017154019/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/17/can-an-algorithm-be-racist-our-analysis-is-more-cautious-than-propublicas/\">this</a> for details.</p>\n<h4>The fight</h4>\n<p>The COMPAS system is a statistical decision algorithm trained on past statistical data on American convicts. It takes as inputs features about the convict and outputs a \"risk score\" that indicates how likely the convict would reoffend if released.</p>\n<p>In 2016, ProPublica organization <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\">claimed that COMPAS is clearly unfair for blacks in one way</a>. Northpointe <a href=\"https://www.equivant.com/response-to-propublica-demonstrating-accuracy-equity-and-predictive-parity/\">replied that it is approximately fair in another way</a>. ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/technical-response-to-northpointe\">rebukes with many statistical details</a> that I didn't read.</p>\n<p>The basic paradox at the heart of the contention is very simple and is not a simple \"machines are biased because it learns from history and history is biased\". It's just that there are many kinds of fairness, each may sound reasonable, but they are not compatible in realistic circumstances. Northpointe chose one and ProPublica chose another.</p>\n<h4>The math</h4>\n<p>The actual COMPAS gives a risk score from 1-10, but there's no need. Consider the toy example where we have a decider (COMPAS, a jury, or a judge) judging whether a group of convicts would reoffend or not. How well the decider is doing can be measured in at least three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>False negative rate =  (false negative)/(actual positive)</li>\n<li>False positive rate = (false positive)/(actual negative)</li>\n<li>Calibration = (true positive)/(test positive)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A good decider should have false negative rate close to 0, false positive rate close to 0, and calibration close to 1.</p>\n<p>Visually, we can draw a \"square\" with four blocks:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DIFZ6Or.png\" alt=\"a square with 4 blocks\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>false negative rate = the \"height\" of the false negative block,</li>\n<li>false positive rate = the \"height\" of the false positive block,</li>\n<li>calibration = (true positive block)/(total area of the yellow blocks)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now consider black convicts and white convicts. Now we have two squares. Since they have different reoffend rates for some reason, the central vertical line of the two squares are different.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xmCO2Jn.png\" alt=\"two squares, one for White, one for Black\">\nThe decider tries to be fair by making sure that the false negative rate and false positive rates are the same in both squares, but then it will be forced to make the calibration in the Whites lower than the calibration in the Blacks.</p>\n<p>Then suppose the decider try to increase the calibration in the Whites, then the decider must somehow decrease the false negative rate of Whites, or the false positive rate of Whites.</p>\n<p>In other words, when the base rates are different, it's impossible to have equal fairness measures in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>false negative rate</li>\n<li>false positive rate</li>\n<li>calibration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, forgot to mention, even when base rates are different, there's a way to have equal fairness measures in all three of those... But that requires the decider to be <em>perfect</em>: Its false positive rate and false negative rate must both be 0, and its calibration must be 1. This is unrealistic.</p>\n<p>In the jargon of fairness measurement, \"equal false negative rate and false positive rate\" is \"parity fairness\"; \"equal calibration\" is just \"calibration fairness\". Parity fairness and calibration fairness can be straightforwardly generalized for COMPAS, which uses a 1-10 scoring scale, or indeed any numerical risk score.</p>\n<p>It's some straightforward algebra to prove that in this general case, parity fairness and calibration fairness are incompatible when the base rates are different, and the decider is not perfect.</p>\n<h4>The fight, after-math</h4>\n<p>Northpointe showed that COMPAS is approximately fair in calibration for Whites and Blacks. ProPublica showed that COMPAS is unfair in parity.</p>\n<p>The lesson is that there are incompatible fairnesses. To figure out which to apply -- that is a different question.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>[Content: personal ramble, not trying to be rigorous] </p><p>When I read Atlas Shrugged a few years ago, it was one of the more intensely disturbing experiences I’ve had. </p><p>I remember that Eddie Willers was the only character I resonated or identified with much. He’s also, as far as I can tell, the only (even slightly positively portrayed) Hufflepuff character in the story. And the last we see is of him alone in the wilderness, as the last train breaks down – mistakenly loyal to the train company, an entity that isn’t capable of loyalty in return, and not agenty or cool enough to join the main protagonists in their escape from the collapse of civilization. </p><p>That...really got to me. I won’t make any claims about whether Atlas Shrugged is a particularly well-written book, or whether it even contains this message on purpose, but at that moment in my life, it painted a very vivid, compelling picture of a world in which to be Hufflepuff is to be unsafe, useless, unwanted. Incapable of agency or of doing the right thing when it matters. Eddie is an earnest idealist, trying to do his best by Dagny Taggart and her company, and that trait is his doom. </p><p>(I was recently quoted a friend of mine saying “a Hufflepuff among Slytherins will die as surely as among [snakes? Don’t remember exact quote]”. Right now, this feels like an example of that phenomenon.) </p><p>I notice a desire to push back against that interpretation. I claim that Eddie is flawed, imperfect, and his last choice ends up being ineffective, but not because of his earnest idealism. He’s being unstrategic, not paying attention to the patterns of his world and what will actually <em>work – </em>but I refuse to say that his caring about the train reaching its destination is a mistake. </p><p>Loyalty isn’t necessarily strategic, and blind loyalty can lead into disaster, but I refuse to say that having a drive towards it is inevitably a character flaw. </p><p>In the real world, it matters if trains reach their destinations. It’s a bad thing if civilization collapses because all the people who could have stopped it walked away. And it doesn’t make someone a fool, or pitiable, or merely a foil for the true protagonists, if they genuinely and earnestly care. </p><p>If I were in Eddie Willers’ shoes, transplanted as I am now into the world of Atlas Shrugged – I don’t think I would be blindly loyal to Dagny Taggart, or to her company. I hope I would actually take a step back, take my feelings of loyalty as object, and reflect on what mattered according to my values and how to protect those things as strategically as possible. </p><p>Still, I almost hope my journey would come to the same place – stranded in the wilderness on a broken-down train, because I refused to abandon society’s last hope even as everything crumbled around me.</p><p>I refuse to be ashamed of that. And, well, it doesn’t have to <em>end </em>there. The scene might fade to black – but afterward, even if I eventually gave up on that specific train and set it aside as a lost cause, I hope I would pack up my belongings and and start walking. Not away, but towards wherever I could keep trying to help. </p><p>In the world of Atlas Shrugged, maybe I would be truly alone in that, and thus doomed to failure. In the real world, our world… I don’t think so. I can be an earnest idealist, deep down, and I’m not the only one. </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><strong>The Circumstances</strong></p><p>I am sitting down to write this immediately after one of the most honest conversations I’ve ever had with my brother. The reason I’m posting it to LessWrong is because I think it is a case study in rationality, emotion, personality, political partisanship, and methods of conversation and debate, all topics that are of interest to segments of this community. We spoke for about an hour, first while driving, and then for a long time at the curb.</p><p>We started talking about my brother’s interest in getting involved with the local socialist party. He is not the most talkative person, and is a deeply thoughtful and very well-read person. One of his strong interests is in politics and economics, so I decided to ask him about his thoughts on socialism. I am no lassaiz-faire capitalist, but my political preferences are for well-regulated free markets.</p><p><strong>Rising Tension</strong></p><p>Our conversation became tense quickly. As I tried to ask him critical questions in a neutral, genuine, and thoughtful manner, he would dismiss them using words like “silly,” “stupid,” “artificial binary,” “lack of imagination,” and so on. This didn’t feel good, but I continued, because my hope was that by maintaining my composure and demonstrating repeatedly that I was really listening and responding with my valid questions and concerns, he would see that I really wanted to engage with him and wasn’t trying to shut him down. I used techniques like trying to find our cruxes of disagreement, framing them as respectfully and clearly as I could, but he would swat them down. He grew audibly angrier as the car ride went along.</p><p>I could have tried to divert the conversation to some other topic, but I don’t think that’s healthy, and our family dynamic is such that I feel very confident that this would not have led to a happy atmosphere, but to unaddressed simmering resentment that would have lingered beyond our car ride. So I pressed on, all the way until we got to Seattle.</p><p>When he accused me of silliness, I offered what I thought was a detailed and thoughtful description of how I thought things might go under his proposed system. When he accused me of disingenuously demanding that every minor detail be worked out in advance to stifle a basic and obviously good shift that needs to happen, I told him that this was my attempt to really put my imagination to work, thinking through the implications of an idea with which I was not entirely familiar.  When I simplified my concern in order to deal with his objection that I was overthinking things, he told me that I was painting an oversimplified binary.</p><p><strong>Emotional Honesty</strong></p><p>It seemed like nothing could please him, and when we got to our destination, I finally told him so. I said in as kindly a way as I could that I love him, respect him, and was only holding this conversation because it’s clearly an important part of his life, and that while it’s OK for him to feel how he feels and think what he thinks, I felt like he was treating me with contempt, and that it seemed like he was trying to shut down questions. I told him that if someone was proposing a massive change in our social system, I would want to understand the details. For me, the evidence that our present system is working tolerably well is all around me, while this proposal is all on paper. It makes sense to me that we would ask for considerable thought and detail before accepting such a wholesale change.</p><p>He explained that for him, his anger over the state of American and world politics has been growing over the last few years. To give an example, he explained that his visceral reaction to hearing liberal arguments against socialism is about as automatic and intense as our reaction to personally-directed racial prejudice ought to be. He doesn’t like how intensely angry he gets, but finds it impossible to speak neutrally about the topic. He has lost faith in rational debate as a way to change minds, and hears so much pro-capitalist argumentation that he feels is disingenuous that he finds it hard to believe it could be coming from a place of sincerity. He knows that there’s a big difference between being wrong and being bad, but he feels that the harm inflicted by capitalism is so great that it tends to obscure the difference on an emotional level.</p><p><strong>How He Feels</strong></p><p>It helped me understand the bind that he finds himself in, even though I disagree with his economic opinions. He experiences a Catch-22, where nobody will change their minds (or even listen) if he speaks neutrally and rationally, but they’ll dismiss him as a crank if he gets heated. It’s not evil to be wrong, but the harm he perceives in the wrongness around him is so great that he feels morally obligated to point it out, in terms that are strong and direct enough to be potentially offensive. And that itself is an emotional dynamic that is so difficult that it makes it extremely hard to find spaces in his relationships with others to lay it out for other people. My perception was that this seems isolating, although he did not confirm or deny that.</p><p>He then offered that if we were to discuss this topic again, it would actually help him keep the tension down if I felt like I could use the same kinds of rude speech to fire right back at him.</p><p><strong>How I Feel</strong></p><p>I was able to explain that for me, adopting a neutral and rational approach on a topic like this is both a moral duty and an emotional defense mechanism. With a topic this big and important, I feel it’s important to be able to look at it from all sides over a long period of time, and to bring as rigorous a scientific approach as we are able to as a society.</p><p>This is one of the topics that has really failed to generate a Kuhnian paradigm revolution with time; there might be a mainstream consensus of capitalist economists, but there are still plenty of people and countries and economists who believe in varieties of socialism, and that’s not just because the old guard hasn’t died yet. Since both sides have a great deal of scholarship behind them, and I’m not an expert, it makes the most sense to choose the argument that makes the most sense, but also leave great room for amicable differences. By contrast, he feels that you’ve got to start by understanding that people simply argue whatever side is in their interests. The first thing to do is pick the side of the victims of injustice, then determine which economic system is primarily looking out for them, and then adhere to that side.</p><p>I also told him that when I speak even slightly rudely to people, I immediately become intensely anxious that I’ve upset them, and shut down both socially and intellectually. Furthermore, my attempt at neutral rationality is not a strain or some “elevated tone” for me, but is rather my default state where I feel most natural and relaxed and happy.</p><p><strong>Hope for the Future</strong></p><p>After talking about that for a while, we were able to see that knowing these things about each other might help us have more open and agreeable conversations with each other in the future. He might feel less of a need to clam up about politics, since he knows that if he comes across very strongly with me, I’ll understand where it’s coming from. I’ll understand that if he gets very heated, it’s not personally directed at me, but is rather an expression of his frustration with the system. And we will hopefully be able to weave in a discussion about how the dynamics of the conversation make us feel, as well as discussing the issues themselves.</p><p><strong>Moral and Political Dynamics</strong></p><p>This experience helped me shift away from either a “politics is the mindkiller” perspective or a hope that “political conflicts between people with good relationships can be resolved through patient, rational engagement.” Instead, I had to acknowledge that, just as there is no voting system that can possibly achieve all our aims, there is no approach to morality, and therefore economics, that can achieve all our moral aims. Despite that, people will feel intensely passionate about their fundamentally intuitive moral framework. Adopting a neutral, rational approach or a passionate, intense approach to debate can both seem frustrating and disingenuous. Both have their uses.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If the goal is to understand each other, we’ll need to have greater tolerance for our different valences around how we communicate. On some level, even the strongest attempts at holding dialog can easily come across as intensely threatening - not because they’re threatening to demolish your poorly-thought-out ideas, but because they seem to be using neutrality to smother the moral import of the issue.</p><p>In order to overcome that dynamic, the only hope is to be able to honestly express how those tense conversations make us feel. We have to be articulate about why we prefer our particular way of speaking, and extend appreciation and sympathy to the other person. If we cannot find common ground in our intellectual beliefs, we can find it in telling the other person that we love them and are doing our best to connect with them, and creating the space for trying to understand not <em>why we disagree</em> but <em>why we’re hurting each other and how to stop</em>.  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p> Some think of humans as the &quot;scientific species.&quot; But also as failures, because, well, humans mostly do just fail when it comes to thinking and acting scientifically.</p><p>It&#x27;s a little odd, isn&#x27;t it, that we&#x27;d be so bad at doing the thing we were built for?<br/>So, maybe we weren&#x27;t built for it after all. Because whatever we&#x27;re really built for, we should probably be pretty good at it.</p><p>Actually, when you think about it, it doesn&#x27;t really make sense that we would be scientifically-oriented. Science has only really been around for a few hundred years. If you could look at humans from 10,000 years ago, they wouldn&#x27;t be trying to be scientists and then failing at it.<br/>They just wouldn&#x27;t be trying to be scientific at all. They had never even heard of the idea.</p><p>And it would really be kind of weird to look at a species that has never heard of science, and isn&#x27;t trying to do it, and call them a &quot;scientific species,&quot; wouldn&#x27;t it.</p><p>So, what are we built for? What are we succeeding at?</p><p>I think it&#x27;s more like magic and tribalism.</p><p>Tribalism has been talked a lot about, so what about magic?</p><p>What I mean by magic is *mental tools*. Ideas in your head that help you handle problems, even if they&#x27;re not factual.</p><p>Factual ideas. That&#x27;s the &quot;scientific species&quot; idea, right? They say that we&#x27;re trying to have factual ideas in our heads, but most of us are pretty bad at it.<br/>But what exactly is it that we have in our heads instead of facts? For we clearly have ideas in our heads, just not factual ones.<br/>If we&#x27;re not choosing our ideas so we can have factual accuracy, what are we choosing them for?</p><p>For magic. For their tool-like nature. For their ability to empower us to navigate the treacherous terrain in our life.</p><p>And that should sound a little familiar, because, after all, what is it that people cling to instead of to factual ideas? What kind of ideas do people protect from science and refuse to give up?<br/>It&#x27;s the ideas that help them get through the day, and it&#x27;s the ideas that help them get through their fiery trials, and it&#x27;s the ideas that help them get through life itself!</p><p>Useful ideas.</p><p>So, there it is. Humans are a species really good at finding ideas that work for them, &quot;magic.&quot; In other words, humans aren&#x27;t failed scientists, they&#x27;re successful magicians. They discover and craft a set of ideas together like a suit of armor, and then, when they hold those ideas in their head and run screaming into the battle of life, they find their limbs strengthened and their fear is kept at bay. Just like magic. Giving up battle-readiness for factual accuracy will just get you killed. Result: now your brain holds zero facts.</p><p>-</p><p> And that&#x27;s where the tribalism comes in. People gather together with people who will share their magical ideas.</p><p>For one thing, a lot of magic ideas don&#x27;t do very well if people are questioning them. So you stay with people who won&#x27;t question, and more, people who will agree with you and on top of that, who will share stories that strengthen your belief in the magic. They tell stories &quot;Yes, this is how the magic has helped me too,&quot; and talk about how the magic of other groups is actually inferior and immoral.</p><p>And for another thing, if everyone has the same ideas, then you know how to deal with each other, because they&#x27;re like you. Dealing with people with strange other beliefs is difficult and chaotic, because you never know exactly what they&#x27;re going to do. And if you make a mistake, what ideas are in their head about how to resolve mistakes? Well, you don&#x27;t exactly know, so you don&#x27;t know if something is going to jump out and bite you, so you&#x27;re always on your toes.<br/></p><p>It&#x27;s very nice to get back to your own group where you know what&#x27;s up and down, and you can relax.<br/></p><p>And thirdly, on top of that, it takes time to build social relationships, right? The people in your magic group are with you for a lot of time, so you naturally build your relationships with them. Changing your magic ideas drives a wedge between you all, and now you&#x27;ll have to start all over again with new people that you can build relationships with. If you have time, and if they&#x27;ll like you. No guarantees. Very risky.<br/></p><p>So groups are important to us, and our magic ties us to our group.<br/></p><p>All in all, humans are very good at protecting their magic, their mental tools, from being changed. And they&#x27;re good at sticking to their groups and supporting each other in their groups.<br/>That’s what we are.<br/></p><p>We are successful magic families, not failed scientists.<br/></p><p>And some of us are more scientifically-minded than others, and we assume that everyone else is, too. So when we see them not acting very scientifically, we just assume that they&#x27;re failures. They must be aiming at science like we are, and they must be trying to succeed at thinking scientifically, but they&#x27;re just not as good at it as we are.<br/></p><p>But it&#x27;s not all our fault we make that mistake. After all, people do <em>say </em>they care about truth. So we&#x27;re just taking them at their word, right?. But if you look more closely...they also say &quot;your truth and my truth,&quot; which shows that they don&#x27;t really mean truth in the same sense as scientists, do they? Not in the sense of facts and accuracy and it doesn&#x27;t matter what you believe and so on. They mean it in some other way...But we don&#x27;t understand that, really.<br/></p><p>So we try to help them find facts better, anyway. But then we&#x27;re surprised that they don&#x27;t appreciate the assistance. We&#x27;d certainly appreciate the assistance if someone helped us to aim better at science, so why don&#x27;t these people appreciate what we&#x27;re doing for them? And why are they so bad at science in the first place? And why aren&#x27;t they interested in the ways we have discovered to augment and enhance our scientific thinking?<br/></p><p>All of these questions disappear when you realize that people aren&#x27;t trying to be scientists and failing, they&#x27;re trying to be good group members, and they&#x27;re trying to navigate life successfully with their magic, and...well, they&#x27;re actually kind of succeeding, aren&#x27;t they?<br/>Maybe succeeding more than you. Yes, you might be succeeding more at science, at fact-finding, but they&#x27;re succeeding more at sociability and accomplishment. Perhaps they are looking at you and wondering why you&#x27;re the one so bad at everything <em>except </em>science.<br/></p><p>Because maybe you&#x27;re not trying but failing to be a good tribe member and you&#x27;re not trying but failing to find good magic, instead you&#x27;re trying to be a scientist and you&#x27;re succeeding.<br/></p><p>But why? Why succeed at that and fail at the rest? Well...because facts come first. Truth above all else.<br/></p><p>And why that? Because...it...works...?<br/></p><p>?<br/></p><p>It must be granted, on a species-wide level, it has certainly worked for us to have science among us, to build us physical tools. Those physical tools have done far more for us than the mental tools of any tribe&#x27;s magic.<br/></p><p>But on the individual level? The most uber-scientific are plagued by procrastination and akrasia. Unmotivated.<br/></p><p>It&#x27;s sometimes said that, outside of the lab, a scientist thinks no more scientifically than a layperson.<br/></p><p>Is that because they have failed? Or...have they got the secret? They are masters of both worlds, performing science for the sake of how it blesses humanity, but acting as normal magicians and good tribe members in their personal life. And they do it because it WORKS BETTER.<br/></p><p>Has their scientific training failed to penetrate deep enough into it them? Or has it gone exactly far enough, far enough that they know how to operate the machinery of the idea factory, but not so far as to weaken their will, sap their motivation, or ruin their relationships. Not so far as to leave them as muggles without magic.<br/></p><p>Of course, it&#x27;s all on a spectrum, anyway. Nobody really has no magic at all, it’s just that some have less magic, or have different magic. Some believe in gods and ghosts, others in attraction and destiny, and others in rights and morals.<br/></p><p>Wait, but do ALL of those really come from magic? Well...they don&#x27;t come from science. If we meet aliens among the stars, we can be confident they will already know about and agree with us on science and math, but they won&#x27;t agree with us on these things. Because these things don&#x27;t come from science, math, or logic. We crafted them together like the good tribal magicians we are.<br/></p><p>Yes, they are magic. There are certain differences between them, but they still belong to the same natural category.  </p><p>-</p><p> And then there’s &quot;truth above all else.&quot; Facts first. Intellectual honesty. Bearing the truth. Wanting to believe X if true and disbelieve X if false. What are these but one more kind of magic?<br/></p><p>Ah, but they interact with reality in a certain way, and we know that that way is special because cars go and planes fly and it WORKS, bitches.<br/></p><p>Yes, but that&#x27;s a tool-based justification, isn&#x27;t it? Science can&#x27;t justify these ideals. We justify them because they work.<br/></p><p>And they do. Sometimes, in some situations. But if they only work third-best in a certain situation? If there are alternative magics we could use to, for example, motivate or ward off akrasia. What then? You know, we used &quot;because it works&quot; to justify the rationalist rules, but by that very measure, the rationalist rules are to be set aside.<br/></p><p>So, is there some other rule, which tells us to use the rationalist rule even when it is only the third-best for a certain task?<br/></p><p>Well, yes. There&#x27;s tribal loyalty. There&#x27;s cementing an identity, there&#x27;s ritualistically acting as if a rule is inviolable so that, as one of the few who do not violate it, the rule judges you and finds you worthy. One of the few worthy.<br/></p><p>So, yes, acting like a rule is always correct and then obeying the rule allows you to create a feeling of validation, even if the rule doesn&#x27;t produce maximum utility. That&#x27;s true of rationalist rules and also of the other...magical...rules...<br/></p><p>Which I&#x27;m not here to knock down. Validation and meaning are often in short supply, and we want all the tricks we have to generate them.<br/></p><p>But if &quot;it works best&quot; isn&#x27;t the justification, and &quot;it works acceptably and validates me to make up for what it lacks&quot; is sometimes picking up the slack, then the question is, why not just switch to treating the best rule as the sacrosanct one, and being validated by that rule instead?<br/>Best of both worlds, right? Maximum utility and you still get to feel good about following the &quot;real&quot; important rules.<br/></p><p>Of course, it might be hard to switch which rules you automatically feel good for following, but in principle, this would be a superior stance to adopt.<br/></p><p>We want epistemic rationality and also instrumental rationality, but if what I&#x27;ve written is correct, then these two are so different that they are sometimes opposed to each other, no matter that they both have half of their names in common. Maximum epistemic rationality doesn&#x27;t produce maximum instrumental rationality.<br/></p><p>Or does it? I just don&#x27;t know of any evidence, that&#x27;s all. Is there some I don&#x27;t know about?<br/></p><p>The most instrumentally rational people don&#x27;t seem to be maximally epistemically rational. Nor vice-versa. I see quite little overlap between the two groups, actually.<br/></p><p>And anecdotally, it actually seems like the more epistemically rational you are, the more you start talking about akrasia, hmm...<br/></p><p>So maybe you have to balance them, or outright choose between. So, wait a minute. What was the justification for holding factual accuracy as the supreme value again? Actually, how do you justify ANYTHING except on instrumental means?<br/></p><p>And if the pursue-maximum-utility value system says to pursue pragmatism, but the facts-are-supreme value system says not to pursue pragmatism, how do you choose between them, if not by checking which one gets better results? Utility.<br/></p><p>You choose according to utility...</p><p>and momentum. Momentum, as we hold on to the meaning we currently extract from following the rules that say to eschew pragmatism, but...which meaning we could also get if we just switched to valuing pragmatism. <br/></p><p>And also obtain more utility besides. Find motivation and social flexibility. Pursue plans and not just make them. Learn to kick and not just to punch. Not to just believe in instrumental rationality, but to conquer it. </p>",

Most of all I was interested in the risk of extinction or serious shocks due to AI, and I tried to provide quotes that most fully reveal this particular topic.<br>6) The sixth column indicates the source of the quote.<br><br>That is, to the right of the forecaster's name, you can find out the date of the given quotes, his opinion about the time of the creation of AI, about the intellectual explosion and about the future of humanity, as well as get acquainted with the source.<br><br>Of course, cases where the expert spoke on the topic of time, the speed of self-improvement and the influence of AI in the framework of one material are quite rare. Therefore many cells are left empty.<br></p><p>I had to give several quotes per person, sometimes they were separated for years and even decades.<br></p><p>Since all the quotes are given in chronological order, the opinions of some people are “scattered” in the table.<br></p><p>For example, Gwern spoke about the future of mankind in 2010, about the growth of AI in 2014 and about the forecasts for the emergence of AI in 2018.<br>However, you can simply use search.<br><br>In addition, sometimes one person has already made a certain forecast but later changed or expanded his opinion. I tried to take into account such quotes.<br><br>I also reviewed anonymous expert interviews and indicated them. If the general list of respondents was known, I cited them as well.<br><br>It was difficult to decide who should be considered an expert and what quotes should be included in the work.<br></p><p>I had to make controversial decisions. The table includes a lot of people who are entrepreneurs but may have insights on advanced research. There are several futurists and philosophers in the table. There are writers like Clark and Vinge, whose opinion seems important to me.<br><br>I have a version of this work without chronological separation, where the quotes are more grouped by name. Perhaps someone will be more convenient.<br><br>It is difficult to draw conclusions from the work. The absolute majority of experts did not talk about exact dates and did not indicate the probability of their predictions.<br></p><p>I can only say that most forecasters do not expect AI in the near future, do not expect IE and seem optimistic.<br></p><p>In addition, it seemed to me that in the twentieth century the leading experts were on average more pessimistic: Turing, Wiener, I. J. Good, Fredkin, Shannon, Moravec, etc.<br></p><p>Young researchers are on average more optimistic than older ones - even in the field of AI Safety, where on average there are naturally more concerned people.<br></p><p>I think that to confirm almost any views you can find the opinion of a respected expert.<br><br>I really hope that for someone my work will be useful and interesting.

I have highly suggestive evidence, not deductive proof, for a belief I sincerely hold]</p>\n<p><em>\"If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.\"</em> --- <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb\">Nasim Taleb</a></p>\n<p>I was talking with a colleague the other day about an AI organization that claims:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>AGI is probably coming in the next 20 years.</li>\n<li>Many of the reasons we have for believing this are secret.</li>\n<li>They're secret because if we told people about those reasons, they'd learn things that would let them make an AGI even sooner than they would otherwise.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>His response was (paraphrasing): \"Wow, that's a really good lie! A lie that can't be disproven.\"</p>\n<p>I found this response refreshing, because he <em>immediately</em> jumped to the most likely conclusion.</p>\n<h2>Near predictions generate more funding</h2>\n<p>Generally, entrepreneurs who are optimistic about their project get more funding than ones who aren't. AI is no exception. For a recent example, see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project\">Human Brain Project</a>. The founder, Henry Makram, predicted in 2009 that the project would succeed in simulating a human brain by 2019, and the project <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-human-brain-project-went-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/\">was already widely considered a failure by 2013</a>. (See <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_supercomputing_the_brain_s_secrets#t-856603\">his TED talk</a>, at 14:22)</p>\n<p>The Human Brain project got <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-02/how-simulate-human-brain-one-neuron-time-13-billion/\">1.3 <em>billion</em> Euros</a> of funding from the EU.</p>\n<p>It's not hard to see why this is. To justify receiving large amounts of money, the leader must make a claim that the project is actually worth that much. And, AI projects are more impactful if it is, in fact, possible to develop AI soon. So, there is an economic pressure towards inflating estimates of the chance AI will be developed soon.</p>\n<h2>Fear of an AI gap</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_gap\">missile gap</a> was a lie by the US Air Force to justify building more nukes, by falsely claiming that the Soviet Union had more nukes than the US.</p>\n<p>Similarly, there's historical precedent for an AI gap lie used to justify more AI development. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer\">Fifth Generation Computer Systems</a> was an ambitious 1982 project by the Japanese government (funded for $400 million in 1992, or $730 million in 2019 dollars) to create artificial intelligence through massively parallel logic programming.</p>\n<p>The project is widely considered to have failed.  From a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/05/business/fifth-generation-became-japan-s-lost-generation.html\">1992 New York Times article</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A bold 10-year effort by Japan to seize the lead in computer technology is fizzling to a close, having failed to meet many of its ambitious goals or to produce technology that Japan's computer industry wanted.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>That attitude is a sharp contrast to the project's inception, when it spread fear in the United States that the Japanese were going to leapfrog the American computer industry. In response, a group of American companies formed the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, a consortium in Austin, Tex., to cooperate on research. And the Defense Department, in part to meet the Japanese challenge, began a huge long-term program to develop intelligent systems, including tanks that could navigate on their own.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p><strong>The Fifth Generation effort did not yield the breakthroughs to make machines truly intelligent, something that probably could never have realistically been expected anyway.</strong> Yet the project did succeed in developing prototype computers that can perform some reasoning functions at high speeds, in part by employing up to 1,000 processors in parallel. The project also developed basic software to control and program such computers. Experts here said that some of these achievements were technically impressive.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>In his opening speech at the conference here, Kazuhiro Fuchi, the director of the Fifth Generation project, made an impassioned defense of his program.</p>\n<p>\"Ten years ago we faced criticism of being too reckless,\" in setting too many ambitious goals, he said, adding, \"Now we see criticism from inside and outside the country because we have failed to achieve such grand goals.\"</p>\n<p>Outsiders, he said, initially exaggerated the aims of the project, with the result that the program now seems to have fallen short of its goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Some American computer scientists say privately that some of their colleagues did perhaps overstate the scope and threat of the Fifth Generation project. Why? In order to coax more support from the United States Government for computer science research</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis mine)</p>\n<p>This bears similarity to some conversations on AI risk I've been party to in the past few years. The fear is that Others (DeepMind, China, whoever) will develop AGI soon, so We have to develop AGI first in order to make sure it's safe, because Others won't make sure it's safe and We will. Also, We have to discuss AGI strategy in private (and avoid public discussion), so Others don't get the wrong ideas. (Generally, these claims have little empirical/rational backing to them; they're based on scary stories, not historically validated threat models)</p>\n<p>The claim that others will develop weapons and kill us with them by default implies a moral claim to resources, and a moral claim to be justified in making weapons in response. Such claims, if exaggerated, justify claiming more resources and making more weapons. And they weaken a community's actual ability to track and respond to real threats (as in The Boy Who Cried Wolf).</p>\n<h2>How does the AI field treat its critics?</h2>\n<p>Hubert Dreyfus, probably the most famous historical AI critic, published <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2006/P3244.pdf\">\"Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence\"</a> in 1965, which argued that the techniques popular at the time were insufficient for AGI. Subsequently, he was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#Critiques_from_across_campus\">shunned by other AI researchers</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The paper \"caused an uproar\", according to Pamela McCorduck.  The AI community's response was derisive and personal.  Seymour Papert dismissed one third of the paper as \"gossip\" and claimed that every quotation was deliberately taken out of context.  Herbert A. Simon accused Dreyfus of playing \"politics\" so that he could attach the prestigious RAND name to his ideas. Simon said, \"what I resent about this was the RAND name attached to that garbage.\"</p>\n<p>Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, remembers that his colleagues working in AI \"dared not be seen having lunch with me.\"  Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish.  Although he was an outspoken critic of Dreyfus' positions, he recalls \"I became the only member of the AI community to be seen eating lunch with Dreyfus. And I deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This makes sense as anti-whistleblower activity: ostracizing, discrediting, or punishing people who break the conspiracy to the public. Does this still happen in the AI field today?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Marcus\">Gary Marcus</a> is a more recent AI researcher and critic. In 2012, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@GaryMarcus/the-deepest-problem-with-deep-learning-91c5991f5695\">he wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deep learning is important work, with immediate practical applications.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Realistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines. Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships (such as between diseases and their symptoms), and are likely to face challenges in acquiring abstract ideas like \"sibling\" or \"identical to.\" They have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used. The most powerful A.I. systems ... use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging from the statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 2018, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/1065280340669816832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext%252Fhtml%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07%26schema%3Dtwitter%26url%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fgarymarcus%2Fstatus%2F1065280340669816832%26image%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fprofile_images%2F850347800789372929%2FVg_HrEun_400x400.jpg\">tweeted</a> an article in which Yoshua Bengio (a deep learning pioneer) seemed to agree with these previous opinions. This tweet received a number of mostly-critical replies. Here's one, by AI professor Zachary Lipton:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's a couple problems with this whole line of attack. 1) Saying it louder ≠ saying it first. You can't claim credit for differentiating between reasoning and pattern recognition. 2) Saying X doesn't solve Y is pretty easy. But where are your concrete solutions for Y?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first criticism is essentially a claim that <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/everybody-knows/\">everybody knows</a> that deep learning can't do reasoning. But, this is essentially admitting that Marcus is correct, while still criticizing him for saying it [ED NOTE: the phrasing of this sentence is off (Lipton publicly agrees with Marcus on this point), and there is more context, see <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/KnQs55tjxWopCzKsk/the-ai-timelines-scam/comment/nGS8nPe8rA4Ay4uFN\">Lipton's reply</a>].</p>\n<p>The second is a claim that Marcus shouldn't criticize if he doesn't have a solution in hand. This policy deterministically results in the short AI timelines narrative being maintained: to criticize the current narrative, you must present your own solution, which constitutes another narrative for why AI might come soon.</p>\n<p>Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun's response is similar:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yoshua (and I, and others) have been saying this for a long time.<br>\nThe difference with you is that we are actually trying to do something about it, not criticize people who don't.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, the criticism is not that Marcus is wrong in saying deep learning can't do certain forms of reasoning, the criticism is that he isn't presenting an alternative solution. (Of course, the claim could be correct even if Marcus doesn't have an alternative!)</p>\n<p>Apparently, it's considered <em>bad practice</em> in AI to criticize a proposal for making AGI without presenting on alternative solution. Clearly, such a policy causes large distortions!</p>\n<p>Here's another response, by Steven Hansen (a research scientist at DeepMind):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ideally, you'd be saying this through NeurIPS submissions rather than New Yorker articles. A lot of the push-back you're getting right now is due to the perception that you haven't been using the appropriate channels to influence the field.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is: to criticize the field, you should go through the field, not through the press. This is standard guild behavior. In the words of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/420123-people-of-the-same-trade-seldom-meet-together-even-for\">Adam Smith</a>: \"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\"</p>\n<p>(Also see Marcus's <a href=\"https://medium.com/@GaryMarcus/the-deepest-problem-with-deep-learning-91c5991f5695\">medium article</a> on the Twitter thread, and on the limitations of deep learning)</p>\n<p>[ED NOTE: I'm not saying these critics on Twitter are publicly promoting short AI timelines narratives (in fact, some are promoting the opposite), I'm saying that the norms by which they criticize Marcus result in short AI timelines narratives being maintained.]</p>\n<h2>Why model sociopolitical dynamics?</h2>\n<p>This post has focused on sociopolotical phenomena involved in the short AI timelines phenomenon. For this, I anticipate criticism along the lines of \"why not just model the technical arguments, rather than the credibility of the people involved?\" To which I pre-emptively reply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No one can model the technical arguments in isolation. Basic facts, such as the accuracy of technical papers on AI, or the filtering processes determining what you read and what you don't, depend on sociopolitical phenomena. This is far more true for people who don't themselves have AI expertise.</li>\n<li>\"When AGI will be developed\" isn't just a technical question. It depends on what people actually choose to do (and what groups of people actually succeed in accomplishing), not just what can be done in theory. And so basic questions like \"how good is the epistemology of the AI field about AI timelines?\" matter directly.</li>\n<li>The sociopolitical phenomena are actively making technical discussion harder. I've had a well-reputed person in the AI risk space discourage me from writing publicly about the technical arguments, on the basis that getting people to think through them might accelerate AI timelines (yes, really).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which is not to say that modeling such technical arguments is not important for forecasting AGI. I certainly could have written a post evaluating such arguments, and I decided to write this post instead, in part because I don't have much to say on this issue that Gary Marcus hasn't <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631\">already said</a>. (Of course, I'd have written a substantially different post, or none at all, if I believed the technical arguments that AGI is likely to come soon had merit to them)</p>\n<h2>What I'm not saying</h2>\n<p>I'm not saying:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That deep learning isn't a major AI advance.</li>\n<li>That deep learning won't substantially change the world in the next 20 years (through narrow AI).</li>\n<li>That I'm certain that AGI isn't coming in the next 20 years.</li>\n<li>That AGI isn't existentially important on long timescales.</li>\n<li>That it isn't possible that some AI researchers have asymmetric information indicating that AGI is coming in the next 20 years. (Unlikely, but possible)</li>\n<li>That people who have technical expertise shouldn't be evaluating technical arguments on their merits.</li>\n<li>That most of what's going on is people consciously lying. (Rather, covert deception hidden from conscious attention (e.g. motivated reasoning) is pervasive; see <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GZT9Q1/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">The Elephant in the Brain</a>)</li>\n<li>That many people aren't sincerely confused on the issue.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm saying that there are systematic sociopolitical phenomena that cause distortions in AI estimates, especially towards shorter timelines. I'm saying that people are being duped into believing a lie. And at the point where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/psych_of_tech/status/1106302905555042305\">73% of tech executives say they believe AGI will be developed in the next 10 years</a>, it's a major one.</p>\n<p><em>This has happened before.</em> And, in all likelihood, <em>this will happen again</em>.</p>\n</body></html>",

I absolutely LOVE attention. I also HATE asking for attention. This past weekend I&apos;ve processed those last two statements on a much deeper level than I have previously. Sometimes you need to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3pwikSmxeieybyJSi/hazard-s-shortform-feed#ioaBZBqYFcZRe288i\">rediscover an insight multiple times</a> to really get it.</p><p>The most recent batch of introspection was prompted by the book &quot;Magic is Dead&quot; by Ian Frisch. Spoiler, I&apos;m a semi-professional close up magician and have a vested interest in many things magic. Ian was describing Chris Ramsay, the quintessential young-blood social media based cool kid magician. A quote:</p><blockquote>[...] Ramsay&apos;s style has since evolved into a more high-end street-wear, hypebeast-esque aesthetic: A Bathing Ape jacket, Supreme cap and hoodie, adidas by Pharrell Williams NMD sneakers, etc.</blockquote><p>I don&apos;t even know what A Bathing Ape jacket looks like, nor why the &quot;A&quot; is capitalized, but my gut reaction is revulsion. I know just enough about Supreme and &quot;hypebeast&quot;s to know that I don&apos;t like them. But why? Why do I spit venom when I hear about new performers on social media trying to &quot;make magic cool again&quot;?</p><p>Long story short, I LOVE attention, and I HATE asking for it. This has been the case since middle school. The hating to ask part comes with an attitude of &quot;Fuck you, I&apos;m not going to beg for you to give me something&quot;. So I had a chip on my shoulder in regards to asking for people&apos;s attention, and like any good chip, it needed a rationalized narrative to justify its existence. &quot;People who need other people to pay attention to them are weak&quot;, &quot;Wow hazard, you&apos;re such a strong rugged individual for not needing other people&apos;s attention&quot;</p><p>Notice the switch from &quot;I don&apos;t like asking for attention&quot; to &quot;I don&apos;t need attention&quot;. It&apos;s subtle. Sure took me 8+ years to notice.</p><p>As you may have guessed, I didn&apos;t magically stop wanting/needing attention from people in middle school. I just learned a new strategy to meet the need. The strategy was the personality that I began to develop in middle school and high school, that of the unflappable competent marauder. I always played calm and collected, I worked hard to get good at the tasks at hand (my primary social group was my boy scout troop, so this meant getting good at outdoorsing, leadership, and planning), and casually leveraging my more impressive abilities (I didn&apos;t do parkour back then, but I could still climb most things and do dive rolls off of pavilion roof tops).</p><p>I become the sort of person who when you find out they also know how to juggle you go, &quot;Of <em>course</em> Hazard knows how to juggle!&quot; (actual interaction).</p><p>When I got into magic, tI worked this angle on a whole new level. Now I had a skill set where I could blow peoples minds and setup scenarios where <em>of course</em> we&apos;re all now going to watch Hazard do a magic trick, because they&apos;re so god damn cool!</p><p>Did I ever mention that I love attention? But really, in a non snarky, non self deprecating way, I love attention. Having people laughing and smiling and shouting with me at the center is such a yummy experience. A++, would recommend.</p><p>So my implicit approach to magic (and all relationships) was this: casually be as awesome as possible so that people are <strong>compelled</strong> to give me their attention, that way <strong>I don&apos;t have to ask for it</strong>.</p><h2><strong>A &quot;detour&quot; into thanking people</strong></h2><p>Here&apos;s an implicit model of thanks and appreciation I see people using: If someone goes out of their way to help you, or wasn&apos;t expected to help you in the first place, thank them more. If it was easy for someone to help you, or it was expected of them, thank them less. </p><p>The counter to this would be telling you &quot;don&apos;t take people for granted&quot;. This phrase always felt a bit odd to me. I&apos;m not allowed to take anything for granted? Do I need to thank the strangers I passed on the way to this coffee shop because the didn&apos;t try to kill me? Seems a little much.</p><p>Here&apos;s a new framing: In the first model, one uses thanks and appreciation as a <strong>marker of social debt</strong>. If something happened such that &quot;I owe you one&quot; (small or big), then I mark it with a &quot;thanks man&quot;. [Ignores for now that some people also seem to thank and appreciate as needed to make people do stuff for them]</p><p>The nugget of gold that I see in &quot;don&apos;t take people for granted&quot; is &quot;let people know when they&apos;ve helped you out&quot;. People want to be effectual, and it&apos;s a nice little boost to know that something you did actually helped someone. Because of how common  the&quot;thanks as debt marker&quot; mentality is (&quot;make sure you thank the neighbors for the extra dessert they let you have, they are very nice people and didn&apos;t have to give you that&quot;) I think defenders of &quot;granted&quot; get roped into using the language of debt, thus leading to claims like &quot;You owe everybody everything&quot;.</p><p>So there are two separate questions. When do you <strong>owe someone something</strong>, and when should you <strong>thank or appreciate them</strong>?</p><p>Owing is a huge beast on its own. There&apos;s a whole host of hidden sub questions. How should I personally treat people? When should I feel obligated to help someone? When should I be socially held accountable for helping someone? Complex stuff, not the topic of this post.</p><h2><strong>Effects on the personal</strong></h2><p>Two things are extra hard if you hate to ask for attention. It&apos;s hard to <strong>show appreciation</strong>, and it&apos;s hard to <strong>ask for things</strong>. </p><p>Me trying to compel people to want to be around me instead of making explicit bids for friendship was a way of protecting myself from feeling like I owed anyone. &quot;You&apos;re not doing me a favor by hanging out with me, because I&apos;m so shiny you can&apos;t <em>not</em> hang out with me.&quot; And then, oh oops, this leads to rarely showing appreciation. Now, remember that I&apos;m not asking people for stuff all the time. The failure mode here is not &quot;I&apos;m always doing all this stuff for you and you never appreciate it!&quot;. It&apos;s a bit more subtle. </p><p>(paraphrased quote someone has said to me)</p><blockquote>Yeah, you&apos;re cool and all but I don&apos;t know why you hang out with me. I mean it doesn&apos;t seem like you  get much out of it. It doesn&apos;t feel like I could actually matter that much to you.&quot;</blockquote><p>Yikes.</p><p>Also notice the lovely way this can be more extreme if a friend has low self esteem (which may or may not be a factor that makes someone more likely to be compelled to a shiny person(?)).</p><p>Yikes.</p><p>So yeah, not showing people appreciation ain&apos;t cool.</p><p>Not asking for things, that&apos;s more of a me problem. &quot;Good things come to those who ask&quot; and all that.</p><h2><strong>Show Biz</strong></h2><p>Zooming back to show biz and performance. Recall, my approach with magic was be so good that people were compelled to give me their attention, and rarely if ever make explicit bids for attention. If you keep scaling this attitude up, you roughly get &quot;Fuck you, I&apos;m awesome. Come see my show if you want to have a good time, it&apos;s your loss if you don&apos;t.&quot; There are some important things that this frame gets right.</p><p>If you as a performer feel destroyed every time someone doesn&apos;t like your show, or when the theater isn&apos;t booked solid, you&apos;re in for a world of hurt. It&apos;s also likely you will have a hard time developing your own style. If you&apos;re terrified of being disliked, you face huge pressure to play it safe and stick to the known. A certain about of &quot;Fuck you, I&apos;m awesome&quot; is needed to be yourself. How much of it is needed? Hard to say.</p><p>Second point, people need a reason why they should be watching <em>you</em> as opposed to the millions of other options they have. People want to see stuff they are going to enjoy, and if you don&apos;t at least say, &quot;Yes, my show is in fact good and you will enjoy it&quot; lots of people will just move onto something else.</p><p>Those are the good parts, now here&apos;s the poison in it. &quot;Fuck you, I&apos;m awesome&quot; is a frame that asserts that you, the audience, don&apos;t matter. Your attention/time/money most not matter if I don&apos;t care if you come to my show. </p><p>No, I&apos;m not saying that every performer tell their fans they care about them. You might not care about your fans, you might not even know them. But I do want to explore what it would be like to both give incredible performances that people love and enjoy, while also explicitly appreciating the good thing we have with and letting them know they are doing a good thing for me.</p><h2><strong>&quot;Can I get this to go please?&quot;</strong></h2><p>What if you, whenever people did good stuff for you, you let them know they had a positive effect on you? You might have to come up with a unique way of saying it if you want to make explicit that you aren&apos;t saying &quot;I owe you&quot;. We&apos;ll leave that as an exercise to the reader.</p>",

In other words, if there is a large and central space, once people start splitting off from it this can often lead to the &quot;floodgates opening&quot; and lots and lots of new groups forming - often in a way that even those who initially wanted to change things dislike!</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious example of this is Protestantism. Martin Luther did not want to start his own church, told people not to call themselves &quot;Lutherans&quot;, and disagreed quite aggressively with many of those who are now lumped in with him as &quot;Protestant Reformers&quot;. However, once challenges to the authority and unity of the Church got started, they were hard to stop, and Luther soon found that those around him had at times gone in directions he did not want -- and now there are over 40 different Lutheran denominations in North America alone, to say nothing of all the other Protestant groups!</p><p>However, such a trend is not only limited to religious groups. Political movements sometimes have a similar scenario befall them -- for instance, the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War was substantially harmed by internal schisms, subfactions, and disputes. To use a less consequential example, I&#x27;ve been a part of online communities that have been hurt by repeated schisms over moderation policy -- once people get fed up with the moderation in one place, they start another with much the same purview but different moderators.</p><p>Once schism gets going, it can be hard to stop - and once things get split, much of the benefit of a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8rYxw9xZfwy86jkpG/on-the-importance-of-less-wrong-or-another-single\">single conversation locus</a> begins to degrade. Indeed, the &quot;LessWrong diaspora&quot; quite harmed this project -- we still haven&#x27;t fully recovered from having the community split as much as it did, even though things have been improving a bit on that front more recently.</p><p>Now, some will say that perhaps splits are good -- perhaps one space isn&#x27;t right for everyone, and it would be better to have a diverse range of norms that can appeal to different interests. Hence we see things like the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/97LgacucCxmyjYiNT/the-archipelago-model-of-community-standards\">archipelago model of community standards</a>, which aim to set up a situation where one broader community contains many subgroups with their own rules and systems.</p><p>In practice, though, I claim this doesn&#x27;t work, because <em>schism begets schism</em>. People say &quot;if you don&#x27;t like it, go make your own space&quot; -- but they say that because it&#x27;s an easy dismissal, not because it would actually be better! In point of fact, if everyone who was told such did go and make their own space, the central body would not survive -- &quot;if you don&#x27;t like it, go make your own&quot; works as a dismissal precisely because it won&#x27;t be followed! The world where everyone &quot;goes and makes their own&quot; at the drop of a hat is substantially worse and it is substantially harder to form a productive coalition and get things done under those norms.</p><p>In point of fact, doing important things often requires coordination, teamwork, and agreeing to compromises. If you insist on everything being exactly your way, you&#x27;ll have a harder time finding collaborators, and in many cases that will be fatal to a project -- I do not say all, but many. Now, it&#x27;s possible to get around that by throwing a lot money at the problem -- people will agree to a lot of eccentricities if you pay them enough, as they did with Howard Hughes -- and it&#x27;s possible to get around that by throwing a lot of charisma at the problem -- Steve Jobs was able to be extremely perfectionist thanks to his personal charisma and (in?)famous &quot;reality distortion field&quot; -- but if those options aren&#x27;t available, you&#x27;re going to have to make some compromises, and if the norm is &quot;if the way things are locally doesn&#x27;t work for you, leave and make a new space!&quot; that&#x27;s going to be very difficult.</p><p>Indeed, once you start allowing this sort of &quot;take my ball and go home&quot; behavior, where does it stop? First you have one person who thinks they are being mistreated, and they go and start their own group to work with their rules. Then <em>they</em> try to enforce <em>their</em> rules, and now they drive someone <em>else</em> off, and so on and so on. Pretty soon you have lots and lots of petty little fiefdoms, each composed of just a few people and none of which are getting all that much done. It is better in my view to try to prevent even the first schism and keep things unified.</p><p>Yes, this means you&#x27;ll have to work with people who don&#x27;t fully agree with you at times, and yes, this means that there will have to be some agreements on how best to use shared institutions and spaces -- but the way I see it, the history of schisms indicates that that is far better than the alternative!</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<blockquote><u>Summary:</u> This post describes a peer-supported, self-directed, free (<em>gratis y libre</em>) method of self-improvement by means of practical exercises designed to deliberately instill useful habits. We have just gone public and I invite you to join us.</blockquote><p>The “Society of the Free &amp; Easy” is a group of people who are trying to help one other become better and more effective. We use self-directed, peer-supported, practical exercises to strengthen the skills that lead to a thriving, flourishing life.</p><p>The theory we’re operating under is this:</p><ol><li>There are many character traits that help people to thrive.</li><li>These character traits are, by and large, <em>habits</em> that can be acquired and integrated into one’s character through practice.</li><li>We can help each other design and practice exercises that establish and strengthen these habits.</li><li>By doing this, we will improve and also benefit the culture around us.</li></ol><p>In classical philosophy, the skills and habits that tend toward a thriving, beneficial life were called “The Virtues.” There was no single, canonical list of virtues that everybody agreed on, though many people and traditions came up with lists they liked.</p><p>We don’t have a canonical list either. Instead, we have collected (so far) <a href=\"https://atlas.mindmup.com/davidgross/virtues/index.html\">about 250 different words that describe traits that may count as virtues</a>. We use our list more as a menu than a scripture; we don’t have any dogma about which ones are the right ones or the most important ones. Each of us decides for herself or himself which virtues we think are most important and which ones we want to work on.</p><p>These virtues can be roughly divided into three categories:</p><ol><li><em>Intellectual virtues</em>, like <strong>imagination</strong>, <strong>rationality</strong>, <strong>curiosity</strong>, or <strong>attention</strong></li><li><em>Social virtues</em>, like <strong>honesty</strong>, <strong>hospitality</strong>, <strong>leadership</strong>, <strong>tact</strong>, or <strong>justice</strong></li><li><em>Internal virtues</em>, like <strong>honor</strong>, <strong>courage</strong>, <strong>endurance</strong>, <strong>hope</strong>, or <strong>initiative</strong></li></ol><p>Some virtues we learned as children, and they’re second-nature. Others we never picked up, and we find them difficult or frustrating to practice even as we admire them in others. Everybody has a different mix of virtues they’re fluent in and virtues they struggle with.</p><p>The key theory animating our project is this: A virtue is a sort of habit. You can acquire or strengthen such a habit by practicing it. With regular, deliberate practice, the habit will eventually become part of your character.</p><p>We also suspect that virtues have a way of building on each other. If you strengthen the virtue of <strong>tenacity</strong> for instance, you will better be able to put in the effort to acquire other virtues. If you strengthen the virtue of <strong>curiosity</strong> you will be better able to inquire into what is holding you back from practicing a virtue. If you strengthen the virtue of <strong>honor</strong> you will increase your motivation to become a more virtuous person. And so on.</p><p>The Society of the Free &amp; Easy is meant to be something like a gymnasium for the virtues. In the same way that you would go to a gym to work on physical strength, endurance, balance, or flexibility, you go to the Society of the Free &amp; Easy to work on a broader set of virtues.</p><p>Another analogy would be to “rationality dojos” which are similar in being peer-supported, self-directed programs that aim to instill good habits, but which tend to concentrate more exclusively on the intellectual virtues.</p><p>Our process is flexible, and people are encouraged to tweak it to suit their own needs or to experiment with new techniques. But so far we have had luck with this approach:</p><ol><li>Find a buddy or form a small team to work together.</li><li>Each of you choose a virtue to work on (this can be an involved and interesting process!).</li><li>Take a close look at that virtue, and at any obstacles you feel when you try to practice it.</li><li>Work with your partner(s) to come up with exercises in which you will frequently, deliberately practice that virtue in ways that challenge your current level of fluency.</li><li>Check in with your partner(s) regularly to keep each other accountable and to adjust your curriculum as you learn more about what works and what challenges you face.</li><li>When you feel that you have integrated the virtue adequately into your character, start the process again with a new virtue.</li></ol><p>Peer-support and -accountability helps us to be more helpful than the sorts of “self-help” programs that sound wonderful when you read the book or watch the TED Talk, but then never quite get integrated into your life.</p><p>Along the way, we hope to learn from each other’s experiences with specific virtues so that we can assemble virtue-specific toolkits and helpful hints.</p><ul><li>We are free &amp; open source.</li><li>We are not associated with any particular religious creed or organization.</li><li>We are non-partisan.</li></ul><p>We’ve been developing and alpha testing our process in a small, private group for a few months now, and we’ve just recently opened up the beta test. If you think you might like to join, here are <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CLm5-JRlWiK4osc1x5CzqD2m6gqBUjGy98o9v-77ZcQ/edit\">more detailed instructions for how to start a virtue development team</a>.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>In investing, a common piece of advice recommends a diversified portfolio - in other words, having investments from a wide range of areas to avoid a crash in one area wiping out all your investments. Similarly, I have found that it can be beneficial to have a diversified <em>friendship</em> portfolio - in other words, friends across a wide range of communities or social circles.</p><p>For instance, I have a group of friends that I&#x27;ve known mostly since elementary/middle school, a group of friends that I know from the rationalist and EA community in Berkeley, a group of friends that I know from playing certain games competitively... there is some overlap between these groups, but by and large they are separate, and this can be quite valuable.</p><p>Because I&#x27;m active in multiple circles, if strange things are happening in one community I can step into another. If I need advice on a sensitive situation, I have people who know me well and aren&#x27;t close to the matter to draw upon. Further, having these sorts of resources and perspectives available can open up options that might otherwise be difficult - if, for instance, I decided I could no longer be a part of one of those communities, leaving wouldn&#x27;t be the end of my social life.</p><p>I sometimes see people -- in the rationalist community or elsewhere -- putting &quot;all their eggs in one basket&quot; when it comes to friendship, and I think that can often lead to pitfalls. If all your friends are from work, what happens if you leave your job? If all your friends are from a certain hobby, what happens if you get bored of it? If all your friends are from a certain social scene, what happens if there&#x27;s a bunch of drama and that community splits? Having other social connections and communities to interact with can really help with such scenarios.</p><p>Lastly, I want to point out that having a range of friend groups can be a useful insulator against bad ideas. [1] Sometimes strange and unwelcome fads can spread across a community, and if that&#x27;s the case it can suddenly become a less appealing place. If you have several friend groups to choose from, such things are much easier to &quot;ride out&quot; than if your whole social circle is suddenly into whatever new weird thing. Further, being able to run new stuff by people you know in other communities can serve as a good check on groupthink - being able to say &quot;hey, a bunch of my friends in Berkeley are getting into X, does that make much sense to you?&quot; can be quite a useful reality check!</p><br/><p>[1] One caveat to this -- if you notice that certain friends or communities constantly seem to drag you in bad directions, it might well be time to move away from them!</p>",

This main post is for meta-reflection on the experiment.</p><p><strong>The Rules:</strong></p><ul><li>No divination-related questions.</li><li>I will do ten I Ching sessions, about every six weeks. Eight out of ten sessions must produce at least one new piece of evidence, or else I&#x27;ll abandon the practice. Overall, the evidence should fall within at least two of the following categories. <strong>Final evaluation: this session counts as a success.</strong></li><li>Definition of valid evidence</li><ul><li>Serious work, and &quot;mid-term exam&quot; success, on novel ideas generated by the I Ching, or on projects that I’ve neglected at least 6 weeks.</li><li>Insights that I can articulate, that I still fully agree with after six weeks, that seem to improve my daily decisions and mental health, and that seem sensible to my friends. I will keep the fact that I used the I Ching to generate these insights a secret until the end of the project.</li></ul><li>I will treat the most challenging parts of my reading as if they were true and important. After all, the strangest parts of the reading might be most valuable, if the point of the I Ching is to bust you out of ruts.</li><li><strong>Week 6 update (final):</strong></li><ul><li>I feel that my EA community projects and networking were successes.</li><li>Just yesterday, I discovered the concept of &quot;Deep Work&quot; and implemented a rules-based plan that I think will help me both work, play, and rejuvenate more effectively.</li><li>My habit of more careful academic work paid off, but I still was not 100% consistent with following the detailed assignment specs from my last class.</li></ul><li><strong>Week 4 update:</strong></li><ul><li>My EA community projects work has continued to be fruitful. We&#x27;ve conducted many interviews with EA career changers, set up an EA video chat service that&#x27;s been used by about 40 people, and have more in the works.</li><li>I have done a great deal of networking via email and in-person meetings in the last two weeks, which led me to decide to change colleges and helped me hone in on what I want to study. I&#x27;ve preserved what I learned from each of these meetings and correspondences in a journal, which I think may prove useful to others as well.</li><li>&quot;Joy time&quot; has remained mostly unrewarding, and my QoL has declined over the last two weeks. I intend to focus on planning novel, social, unruly and self-expressive activities, and using meditation or reading rather than pot and TV to relax.</li><li>My consistent double-checking habit has continued and been important in helping me succeed in class.</li></ul><li><strong>Week 2 update:</strong></li><ul><li>Using the I Ching caused me to reflect on my feelings and needs, which led to a post in the EA forums, which led to being contacted by a collaborator, which has led to a set of absorbing community-building projects, one of which will launch tomorrow.</li><li>It spurred me to set up a meeting with a professor at another college.</li><li>It has also led the idea of cultivating a &quot;joy time&quot; habit that initially improved my QoL, but became boring within a few days.</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Preliminary Reflection:</strong></p><p>I found myself selecting for cautious questions: nothing too intimate, potentially disruptive, or boring. I continued to edit my question until it had the right balance of being open-ended and specific, challenging but not precipitous. This was motivated in part by knowing that I was going to post about it publicly, and that I wanted to act on the results, not shy away from them. I don’t usually take time to consider what sort of question to ask. Calibrating questions more carefully, and preregistering my analysis seem like powerful ways to advance personal growth.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong></p><p>How should I prioritize my career-building projects?</p><p><strong>Post-Run Reflection:</strong></p><p>This was more productive than I expected, the most useful personal journaling I’ve done. Was the I Ching necessary, or would any self-help or wisdom literature work just as well? Yet I&#x27;m worried that these first steps and insights will prove illusory. I fear that personal journaling can be an addictive substitute for working directly on hard projects - a form of “pretending to actually try.” Adding this level of structure may only provide a more convincing illusion of usefulness.</p><p><strong>Approximate time to complete this document:</strong></p><p>3 hours initially, plus 30 minutes or so of updating every two weeks, averaging 15 minutes a day.

Reading Federal documents is tedious, so I have provided an outline below.</p><p><strong>Outline of the Draft Plan</strong></p><p><strong>1. Standards and Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> Why is a plan for Federal engagement in AI technical standards needed?</p><ul><li>AI is important to the economy and national security.</li><li>Executive Order (EO 13859)</li><li>Reflect Federal priorities for innovation, public trust, and public confidence in systems using AI</li><li>Enable creation of new AI-related industries, and adoption by current industries</li><li>Federal agencies are major players in developing and using AI</li><li>Definition of AI:</li></ul><blockquote>Note: While definitions of AI vary, for purposes of this plan AI technologies and systems are considered to comprise of software and/or hardware that can learn to solve complex problems, make predictions or undertake tasks that require human-like sensing (such as vision, speech, and touch), perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical action. Examples are wide-ranging and expanding rapidly. They include, but are not limited to, AI assistants, computer vision systems, biomedical research, unmanned vehicle systems, advanced game-playing software, facial recognition systems as well as application of AI in both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT).</blockquote><ul><li>AI and Trustworthiness:</li></ul><blockquote>Increasing trust in AI technologies is a key element in accelerating their adoption for economic growth and future innovations that can benefit society. Today, the ability to understand and analyze the decisions of AI systems and measure their trustworthiness is limited. AI standards and related tools, along with AI risk management strategies, can help to address this limitation and spur innovation. Among the characteristics that relate to trustworthy AI technologies are accuracy, reliability, robustness, security, explainability, safety, and privacy–but there still is much discussion about the range of characteristics that determine AI systems’ trustworthiness. Ideally, these aspects of AI should be considered early on in the design process and tested during the development and use of AI technologies.</blockquote><p><strong>B. </strong>What are technical standards and why are they important?</p><ul><li>ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization:</li></ul><blockquote>a document, established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.</blockquote><ul><li>Standards help with product differentiation, innovation, etc.</li><li>Help systems meet critical objectives for functionality, interoperability, and trustworthiness, and perform accurately, reliably and safely.</li></ul><p><strong>C.</strong> How are technical standards developed?</p><blockquote>The standards development approaches followed in the United States rely largely on the private sector to develop voluntary consensus standards, with Federal agencies contributing to and using these standards. Typically, the Federal role includes providing agency requirements for standards projects, contributing technical expertise to standards development, incorporating voluntary standards into policies and regulations, and citing standards in agency procurements. This use of voluntary consensus standards that are open to contributions from multiple parties, especially the private sector, is consistent with our market-driven economy and has been endorsed in Federal statute and policy. (See “Maximizing Use of the Voluntary Consensus Standards Process” on Page 12).</blockquote><ul><li>Some governments prioritize domestic industry and innovation over an open marketplace. This merits special attention to ensure that US interests are not impeded.</li><li>The timing of standards is important: too early and they can hinder, too late and they won&#x27;t help.</li><li>IT standards are critical to AI standards.</li></ul><p><strong>D.</strong> What AI technical standards are needed?</p><ul><li>Systems using AI are systems-of-systems: standards for AI applications and standards for AI-driven systems are both needed.</li><li>Both horizontal and vertical AI standards already exist, and Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) are working on others.</li><li>Communication has well-established standards.

    "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Part A - Exploratory Research</strong></p><p>After reading <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fnkbdwckdfHS2H22Q/steelmanning-divination-1\">&quot;Steelmanning Divination,&quot;</a> I was inspired to try it out. My question was &quot;Should I begin using the I Ching for divination?&quot; and I used <a href=\"https://www.ichingonline.net/\">IChingOnline</a> to interpret my results.</p><p>I obtained hexagram 24, and I&#x27;m going to recapitulate my responses to the three interpretations on the site. At the end, I&#x27;ll do a summary reflection. In &quot;Part B,&quot; I heavily critique this whole experience. I think that is the most important part of this post.</p><p>1.  <em>Thunder regenerates deep within Earth&#x27;s womb: Sage rulers recognized that the end of Earth&#x27;s seasonal cycle was also the starting point of a new year and a time for dormancy. They closed the passes at the Solstice to enforce a rest from commerce and activity. The ruler himself did not travel.</em></p><p><em>You have passed this way before but you are not regressing. This is progress, for the cycle now repeats itself, and this time you are aware that it truly is a cycle. The return of old familiars is welcome. You can be as sure of this cycle as you are that seven days bring the start of a new week. Use this dormancy phase to plan which direction you will grow.</em></p><p>Response: The opening imagery does bring up a subtle emotional response. I make connections to my life: I am working and in school for significantly less hours this season. Several years ago, I was involved in a local spiritual community, which I broke away from entirely to set out on a new phase of life, one that I planned to be more rational, aligned with my values, and accomplished.</p><p>I was introduced to it in the first place by being unexpectedly asked to do a tarot reading for a woman I was on a first date with; she decided to invite me to a meeting of the spiritual community, and I stayed for several years. Hence, the second paragraph seems apropos, especially since I do not feel at all as though I&#x27;m &quot;regressing,&quot; but rather that I&#x27;m using it in the context of new values, understandings, and purposes. It is in fact welcome. I am also in the midst of a career change involving a great deal of planning. This seems right on the money.</p><br/><p>2.  <em>You are about to experience a rebirth -- about to be given another chance, a new lease on life. You have persevered, gone the distance through an entire cycle -- through the Spring of hope or new passion, through a Summer of growth and building, only to be sacrificed like the archetypal Harvest King at the Autumn reaping. You lie dormant like seed beneath Winter snows now, healing and absorbing new energies in preparation for the new young Spring coming shortly to your life.</em></p><p>This helps me feel more hopeful about my potential. Being older, going back to college in my 30s surrounded by high school students, I have emotionally started to feel like I am failing, struggling with how long it will take to get through schooling and into a line of work that would be more fulfilling. I am a year in, so &quot;gone the distance through an entire cycle&quot; again seems accurate, and an acknowledgement of my effort and accomplishment that I&#x27;ve received nowhere else. There is indeed a measure of healing and energizing that has come of this return to school - a gain in self-confidence, interest in the subject matter, new desires, possibilities, ideas.</p><p>3.  <em>RETURN. Success.<br/>Going out and coming in without error.<br/>Friends come without blame.<br/>To and fro goes the way.<br/>On the seventh day comes return.<br/>It furthers one to have somewhere to go.</em></p><p><em>After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force. The upper trigram Kun is characterised by devotion; thus the movement is natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the transformation of the old becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results. Societies of people sharing the same views are formed. But since these groups come together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the time, all selfish separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. The idea of RETURN is based on the course of nature. The movement is cyclic, and the course completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially. Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is the meaning of heaven and earth.</em></p><p><em><br/>All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of the year begins, comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so too sunrise comes in the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven is the number of the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the great darkness, is increased by one. In this way the state of rest gives place to movement.</em></p><p>I&#x27;d never thought consciously about the fact that my decision to return to school is driven by personal desire that arrived spontaneously during an extended vacation, not by being forced by circumstances such as job loss. I hadn&#x27;t thought about how much harder this might be if I was more attached to my old way of life. This change has indeed led me to &quot;societies of people sharing the same views,&quot; especially including the EA and LessWrong communities. It is a welcome change from my old spiritual communities, which had a hidden and exclusive atmosphere that was indeed associated with serious mistakes, which I won&#x27;t go into. <em><br/> </em></p><p>I&#x27;ve been wrestling with my desire to hurry this process along by working hard through all opportunities to take a break, and confronted by my need for some rest and leisure. To say &quot;therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially&quot; is helpful to hear, affirming my decision to take a whole day to hike yesterday, or to spend a few hours this afternoon learning about the I Ching.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Overall, my interpretation did ultimately provide answers to the original question: &quot;yes, I should use the I Ching, both because it helped me find more meaning in some emotional questions I&#x27;ve struggled with, and because it&#x27;s a way of taking a more leisurely attitude toward my personal transformation&quot;. We&#x27;ll see if I actually do continue to use it and find it helpful.</p><p>In this case, it was not used and did not encourage me to approach a problem from a new angle, dramatically transform my perspective, or encourage me to seek out opportunities that I had not considered before. Instead, it seemed to help me articulate emotions to myself, and to send a message that boiled down to &quot;you&#x27;re doing just fine.&quot; However, the imagery, tone, and range of ways this was communicated did, I think, touch me in a way that hearing that reductive version would not have.</p><p>My plan is to continue using the I Ching, and perhaps to try other divination systems, and see if they seem fruitful in other ways.</p><br/><p><strong>Part B - The Critique</strong></p><p> Immediately after publishing, I was stricken with doubt. Perhaps this is precisely how irrational, useless thought-parasite systems spread. Perhaps they co-opt rational thought, first out of plain curiosity, sort of &quot;grooming&quot; the mind to find value in them until we are too invested in them to stop. I recognize that it feels mildly good to indulge in this divination. The writing and reflection comes easily - I don&#x27;t know how well the System I/System II distinction is holding up, but it feels like a way of popping me over into System I. Whatever easy association occurs, goes. No need for evidence or logic.</p><p>If divination has an effect like that, perhaps divination survives by providing humans with mild, easy pleasure. Maybe it helps them conserve mental resources by switching to a less demanding thought process.</p><p>How would I know, in the end, whether I&#x27;m using divination, or it&#x27;s using me?</p><p>I&#x27;d have to have some sort of pre-existing standards for evaluating whether it was providing me with net utility. When I add up the pleasure it gives, the insight it seems to produce, and the effects of acting on that insight, how does that balance against the time it takes, or any negative impacts of acting on it?</p><p>If my value is to be rational and productive, but it provides me with an irrational pleasure that actively distracts from the rational productivity I value, then how do I decide what my &quot;true&quot; preferences are? How does this connect with the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RoET2ee5pgDgvE2WD/here-be-epistemic-dragons\">&quot;afterglow&quot;</a> I feel when engrossed in writing or reading? Is this afterglow a form of mental pleasure/stimulation that accompanies productive thought? Is it another sort of thought-parasite that encourages me to engage in activities that are, like I Ching, perhaps have only the <em>mere appearance</em> of being useful?</p><p>By what standard might I evaluate my own work for its value, to myself or others? I&#x27;m not getting paid to think or write, and I feel suspicious of whether good feelings might be not just irrelevant but active distractions from that purpose.</p><p>One potential solution is to focus on activities that outside models suggest are net beneficial. Here&#x27;s a thought experiment.</p><p>I&#x27;ll imagine I&#x27;m taking a pill that saps away the pleasure in work to a neutral baseline for all activities for one hour. Under those conditions, where all forms of work feel equally, neutrally pleasant, would I prefer to work for minimum wage for an hour, or to write for an hour? I would choose to write, based on pure intuition. That either means there is something I value in writing beyond the pleasure it brings, or I am failing to adequately engage with the thought experiment. Perhaps I do enough writing that I&#x27;m mildly addicted to the high that comes with it, and the addictive psychology won&#x27;t risk a thought experiment that threatens my continued writing habit.</p><p>Would I prefer to do the paid work, or to spend an hour consulting the I Ching? I am not sure. That suggests there may be some value in continuing to experiment with the I Ching, enough to weigh against receiving a modest amount of money. In this case, I&#x27;m fairly confident I&#x27;m not addicted to using the I Ching, since I&#x27;ve only done it once.</p><p>It&#x27;s probably appropriate, then, to establish a Schelling Fence on this matter. I will use the I Ching no more than 9 more times (for a total of 10 uses). At that point, I need to be able to point to at least one specific action I&#x27;ve taken or interaction I&#x27;ve had as a result that is compelling to me as evidence that consulting the I Ching is providing tangible benefits for my life. Specifically, it needs to help me</p><p>a) Discover or take neglected and important steps toward improving my school/career/relationships/enjoyment of life</p><p>or</p><p>b) Give me an insight into a dynamic in my life that is lucid enough to seem meaningful and valuable to other people when shared (stripped of any mention of its origin)</p><p>To be clear, it does <strong>not</strong> count if the purported impact is only through using the I Ching. For example, &quot;using the I Ching improved my QoL, because I felt good while I was interpreting my divination results&quot; doesn&#x27;t count; neither does &quot;The I Ching told me to use the I Ching, and now I do&quot;. Any truly meaningful results need to <em>point away</em>from divination, not back into it.</p><p><strong>Navigation:</strong></p><p>Next: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/73zickZaapGxcwcGj/the-i-ching-series-2-10-how-should-i-prioritize-my-career\">Run 2/10</a></p>",

This post explores similar issues through my own frame, which seems at least somewhat different from Benquo&#x27;s.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>I&#x27;ve noticed a tendency for people to use the word &quot;lie&quot;, when they want to communicate that a statement is deceptive or misleading, and that <em>this is important.</em></p><p>And I think this is (often) technically wrong. I&#x27;m not sure everyone defines lie quite the same way, but in most cases where I hear it unqualified, I usually assume it means &quot;to deliberately speak falsehood.&quot; Not all deceptive or misleading things are lies.</p><p>But it&#x27;s perhaps a failure of the english language that there <em>isn&#x27;t </em>a word for &quot;rationalizing&quot; or &quot;motivated cognition&quot; that is as rhetorically hefty. </p><p>If you say &quot;Carl lied!&quot;, this is a big deal. People might get defensive (because they&#x27;re friends with Carl), or they might get outraged (if they believe you and feel betrayed by Carl). Either way, <em>something</em> happens.</p><p>Whereas if Carl is making a motivated error, and you say &quot;Carl is making a motivated error!&quot;, then people often shrug and go &#x27;I dunno, people make motivated errors all the time?&quot; And well, yeah. People <em>do</em> make motivated errors all the time. This is all doubly slippery if the other people are motivated in the same direction as Carl, which incentives them to not get too worked up about it.</p><p>But at least sometimes, the error is bad or important enough, or Carl has enough social influence, that it <em>matters </em>that he is making the error. </p><p>So it seems perhaps useful to have a word – a short, punchy word – that comes pre-cached with connotation like &quot;Carl has a pattern of rationalizing about this topic, and that pattern is important, and the fact that this has continued awhile un-checked <em>should be making you sit bolt upright in alarm </em>and doing <em>something </em>different from whatever you are currently doing in relation to Carl.&quot; </p><p>Or, alternately: &quot;It&#x27;s not precisely a big deal that Carl in particular is doing this. Maybe everyone&#x27;s doing this, and it&#x27;d be unfair to single Carl out. But, the fact that our social fabric is systematically causing people to distort their statements the way Carl is doing is real bad, and we should prioritize fixing that.&quot;</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>The motivating example here was a discussion/argument I had a couple weeks ago with another rationalist. Let&#x27;s call them Bob. </p><p>(&quot;Bob&quot; can reveal themselves in the comments if they wish). </p><p>Bob was frustrated with Alice, and with many other people&#x27;s response to some of Alice&#x27;s statements. Bob said [paraphrased slightly] &quot;Alice blatantly lied! And nobody is noticing or caring!&quot; </p><p>Now, it seemed to me that Alice&#x27;s statement was neither a lie, nor blatant. It was not a lie because Alice believed it. (I call this &quot;being wrong&quot;, or &quot;rationalizing&quot;, not &quot;lying&quot;, and the difference is important because it says very different things about a person&#x27;s character and how to most usefully respond to them)</p><p>It didn&#x27;t seem blatant because, well, at the very least it wasn&#x27;t obvious to <em>me</em> that Alice was wrong. </p><p>I could see multiple models of the world that might inform Alice&#x27;s position, and some of them seemed plausible to me. I understood why Bob disagreed, but nonetheless Alice&#x27;s wrongness did not seem like an obvious fact. </p><p><em>[Unfortunately going into the details of the situation would be more distracting than helpful. I think what&#x27;s most important to this post were the respective epistemic states of myself and Bob.</em></p><p><em>But to give some idea, let&#x27;s say Alice had said something like &quot;obviously minimum wage helps low income workers.&quot; </em></p><p><em>I think this statement is wrong, especially the &quot;obviously&quot; part, but it&#x27;s a position one might earnestly hold depending on which papers you read in which order. I don&#x27;t know if Bob would agree that this is a fair comparison, but it roughly matches my epistemic state]</em></p><p>So, it seemed to me that Alice was <em>probably</em> making some cognitive mistakes, and failing to acknowledge some facts that were relevant to her position.</p><p>It was also in my probability space that Alice <em>had</em> knowingly lied. (In the minimum wage example, if Alice knew full well that there were some good first principles and empirical reasons to doubt that minimum wage helped low-income workers, and ignored them because it was rhetorically convenient, I might classify that as a lie, or some other form of deception that raised serious red flags about Alice&#x27;s  trustworthiness).</p><p>With all this in mind, I said to Bob:</p><p>&quot;Hey, I think this is wrong. I don&#x27;t think Alice was either lying, or blatantly wrong.&quot;</p><p>Bob thought a second, and then said &quot;Okay, yeah fair. Sure. Alice didn&#x27;t lie, but she  engaged in motivation cognition. But I still think&quot; — and then Bob started speaking quickly, moving on to why he were still frustrated with people&#x27;s response to Alice, agitation in his voice.</p><p>And I said: (slightly paraphrased to fit an hour of discussion into one paragraph)</p><p>&quot;Hey. Wait. Stop. It doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve <em>back-propagated</em> the fact that Alice didn&#x27;t blatantly lie through the rest of your belief network. It&#x27;s understandable if you disagree with me about whether &quot;blatantly lie&quot; makes sense as a description of what&#x27;s happening here. But if we <em>do</em> agree on that, I think you should actually stop and think a minute, and let that fact sink in, and shift how you feel about the people who aren&#x27;t treating Alice&#x27;s statement the way you want.&quot;</p><p>Bob stopped and said &quot;Okay, yeah, you&#x27;re right. Thanks.&quot; And then waited a minute to do so. (This didn&#x27;t radically change the argument, in part because there were a lot of other facets of the overall disagreement, but still seemed like a good move for us to have jointly performed) </p><p>It was during that minute, while I was meanwhile reflecting on my own, that I thought about the opening statement of this post: </p><p>That maybe it&#x27;s a failure of the english language that we don&#x27;t have a way to communicate &quot;so-and-so is rationalizing, and this pattern of rationalization is <em>important</em>.&quot; If you want to get people&#x27;s attention and get them agitated, your rhetorical tools are limited.</p><p>[Edited addendum]</p><p>My guess is that a new word isn&#x27;t actually the right solution (as Bendini notes in the comments, new jargon tends to get collapsed into whatever the most common use case is, regardless of how well the jargon term fits it). </p><p>But I think it&#x27;d be useful to at least a have as shared concept-handle, that we can more easily refer to. I think it&#x27;d be good to have more affordance to say: <em>&quot;Alice is rationalizing, and people aren&#x27;t noticing, and I think we should be sitting up and paying attention to this, not just shrugging it off.&quot;</em></p><br/><br/>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into-1\">Subject matter here</a>.</p><p><strong>I: Intro</strong></p><p>I am extremely sympathetic to the program of AI safety by understanding value learning. Because of that sympathy, I have more thoughts than average prompted by Stuart Armstrong&#x27;s post along those same lines.</p><p>Stuart&#x27;s post mostly deals with &quot;partial preferences,&quot; which are like simple statements of binary preference (A is better than B), but associated with a context - supposedly the &quot;human&#x27;s model&quot; the human was using when they exhibited or stated that preference. Then the post says that you should sort these partial preferences according to meta-levels and aggregate them from the top down, updating your procedure after you finish each meta-level, eventually producing a utility function over world-histories.</p><p>Broadly, I&#x27;d say that my opinion is sort of like <a href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\">the bitter lesson</a>. The bitter lesson in, say, image recognition, is that people wanted to do image recognition with a bunch of human-designed features and formal reasoning and human-understandable internal moving parts, and they tried that for a long time, and what worked was using way bigger models, way more computing power, much fewer human-understandable internal parts, and almost no human-designed features.</p><p>I like Stuart&#x27;s outline more than most value learning proposals. But it still strikes me as primarily a list of human-designed features and human-understandable internal moving parts. We might be better off throwing away some of the details and abstracting in a way that allows for some of these problems to be solved by big models and computing power.</p><p>It&#x27;s like the just-so story about ResNets, which is that they&#x27;re a fix to humans thinking the insides of neural nets should look too much like human logic[^1]. I think speculating about the human-sized logical relationships between speculative parts inside the AI is easier but less useful than speculating about the algorithm that will connect your inputs to your outputs with a big model and lots of computing power, which may or may not have your logical steps as emergent features.</p><p><strong>II: A long analogy about dams</strong></p><p>If you want to design a dam, you don&#x27;t draw the blueprint of the dam first and figure out what materials it should be made of later - first you learn a lot about hydrology and materials science so you know how steel and concrete and earth and water interact, then you draw the high-level design, then you fill in the details that weren&#x27;t dictated either by physics or by your design goals. I&#x27;m claiming that we don&#x27;t yet know much about the steel and water of value learning.</p><p>Here&#x27;s a long digression as an example. Suppose you&#x27;re trying to work out how to model human values the way humans do, even given lots of computing power and data. If you want to locate values within a model of humans, you can&#x27;t just train the model for predictive power, because human values only appear in a narrow zone of abstraction, more abstract than biology and less abstract than population statistics, and an AI scored only on prediction will be pressured to go to a lower level of abstraction.</p><p>If you train an AI on a shared input of sensory data and a text channel from humans, will it learn a shared model of the world and the text channel that effectively solves the symbol grounding problem? Can you then activate desired concepts through the text channel, &quot;cheating&quot; a solution to lots of value learning problems?</p><p>No. Consider what happens in the limit of lots of resources, particularly if we are training this model for predictive power - it will be pressured towards a lower level of abstraction. Once it starts encoding the world differently than we do, it won&#x27;t have the generalization properties we want - we&#x27;d be caught cheating, as it were. And if we could solve the training problem for verbal models, it seems like we could just solve the training problem to learn the concepts we want to learn. But maybe there&#x27;s still some way to &quot;cheat&quot; in practice.</p><p>Another way to think of this problem is as making &quot;artificial intentional stance.&quot; But we have to remember that the intentional stance is not just a single model (and definitely not the assumption that humans are like <em>homo economicus</em>.) It&#x27;s a family of strategies used to learn about humans, model humans, and model interacting with humans. Stances aren&#x27;t just an assumption about how to model one thing within a fixed model of the world, they&#x27;re part of complete languages for talking about the world.</p><p>I want to know how to design an AI that not only develops approximate ways of understanding the world, but matches some of those ways of understanding to what it sees humans use. But even to do this, we don&#x27;t really know how to talk in a principled way about what it is that it&#x27;s supposed to be matching. So we&#x27;ve got to think about that.</p><p>This is an example of the sort of consideration that I think is urgent and interesting - and you can&#x27;t always leave it as a detail to be filled in later, because depending on the base materials, the best design might be quite different.</p><p><strong>III: Miscellaneous specific comments</strong></p><p>Now some more specific comments about the proposal.</p><p> - How much of the hidden details are in eliciting partial preferences? I&#x27;ve sort of been implying that it&#x27;s a <em>lot</em>. Does it require a general artificial intentional stance to extract not just binary preferences but also the model the human is using to express those preferences?</p><p> - How much of the hidden details are in doing meta-reasoning? If I don&#x27;t trust an AI, more steps of meta-reasoning makes me trust it even less - humans often say things about meta-reasoning that would be disastrous if implemented. What kind of amazing faculties would be required for an AI to extract partial preferences about meta-reasoning that actually made things better rather than worse? If I was better at understanding what the details actually <em>are</em>, maybe I&#x27;d pick on meta-reasoning more.</p><p>I do agree that the meta-reasoning step is necessary for this scheme, but I think that&#x27;s because this scheme doesn&#x27;t involve the AI building an explicit model of humans to provide consistency - it&#x27;s repeatedly outsourcing the modeling job to amnesiac single-shot modules. If humans were reliable sources about meta-reasoning principles for combining binary preferences, this would work great, but since they aren&#x27;t it won&#x27;t - a low-level practical concern dictating higher-level design.</p><p> - The &quot;symbol grounding module&quot;&#x27;s job seems to be to take the partial preferences inside the partial preferences&#x27; contextual models and translate them into full preferences in the AI&#x27;s native ontology. This seems like it requires the AI to have a really trustworthy grasp on the intentional stance and its variations - maybe I should imagine this as coming from the same process that originates those contextual models for partial preferences in the first place. This is a bit different than the symbol grounding I normally think about (grounding of internal symbols by their causal relationship to reality), but I agree it&#x27;s an important part of the artificial intentional stance.</p><br/><br/><p>[^1]: The story goes something like this: When people first thought of neural networks, they thought of as if each neuron was a logical node making a human-sized step in reasoning. And so they optimized the initialization of weights and the nonlinearity for each individual neuron functioning like a discriminator. But after many years of work, people realized that the &quot;neurons are doing human-sized logical steps&quot; model wasn&#x27;t the best, and a better picture is that the neural network is <a href=\"https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/\">massaging the input manifold around in a higher-dimensional space</a> until eventually the input space gets transformed into something that&#x27;s easy to classify. And so the people developed ResNets that were specialized for this gradual massaging of the input into the output, and they worked great.</p>",

In particular, you can <u><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/dqMSZj\">sign up</a></u>, or look through this <u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PwWbWZ6FPqAgZWOoOcXM8N_tUCuxpEyMbN1NYYC02aM/edit?usp=sharing\">spreadsheet</a></u> of all summaries that have ever been in the newsletter. I&#x27;m always happy to hear feedback; </p><h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hubbRt4DPegiA5gRR/a-shift-in-arguments-for-ai-risk\">A shift in arguments for AI risk</a></u> <em>(Tom Sittler)</em>: Early arguments for AI safety focus on existential risk cause by a <strong>failure of alignment</strong> combined with <strong>a sharp, discontinuous jump in AI capabilities</strong>. The discontinuity assumption is needed in order to argue for a treacherous turn, for example: without a discontinuity, we would presumably see less capable AI systems fail to hide their misaligned goals from us, or to attempt to deceive us without success. Similarly, in order for an AI system to obtain a decisive strategic advantage, it would need to be significantly more powerful than all the other AI systems already in existence, which requires some sort of discontinuity.</p><p>Now, there are several other arguments for AI risk, though none of them have been made in great detail and are spread out over a few blog posts. This post analyzes several of them and points out some open questions.</p><p>First, even without a discontinuity, a failure of alignment could lead to a bad future: since the AIs have more power and intelligence their values will determine what happens in the future, rather than ours. (Here <strong>it is the difference between AIs and humans that matters</strong>, whereas for a decisive strategic advantage it is the difference between the most intelligent agent and the next-most intelligent agents that matters.) See also <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/more-realistic-tales-of-doom\">More realistic tales of doom</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/93fe1a0a92da/alignment-newsletter-50\">AN #50</a></u>) and <u><a href=\"https://rationalaltruist.com/2014/08/23/three-impacts-of-machine-intelligence/\">Three impacts of machine intelligence</a></u>. However, it isn&#x27;t clear why we wouldn&#x27;t be able to fix the misalignment at the early stages when the AI systems are not too powerful.</p><p>Even if we ignore alignment failures, there are other AI risk arguments. In particular, since AI will be a powerful technology, it could be used by malicious actors; it could help ensure robust totalitarian regimes; it could increase the likelihood of great-power war, and it could lead to stronger <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">competitive pressures that erode value</a></u>. With all of these arguments, it&#x27;s not clear why they are specific to AI in particular, as opposed to any important technology, and the arguments for risk have not been sketched out in detail.</p><p>The post ends with an exhortation to AI safety researchers to clarify which sources of risk motivate them, because it will influence what safety work is most important, it will help cause prioritization efforts that need to determine how much money to allocate to AI risk, and it can help avoid misunderstandings with people who are skeptical of AI risk.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to see more work of this form; it seems particularly important to gain more clarity on what risks we actually care about, because it strongly influences what work we should do. In the particular scenario of an alignment failure without a discontinuity, I&#x27;m not satisfied with the solution &quot;we can fix the misalignment early on&quot;, because early on even if the misalignment is apparent to us, it likely will not be easy to fix, and the misaligned AI system could still be useful because it is &quot;aligned enough&quot;, at least at this low level of capability.</p><p>Personally, the argument that motivates me most is &quot;AI will be very impactful, and it&#x27;s worth putting in effort into making sure that that impact is positive&quot;. I think the scenarios involving alignment failures without a discontinuity are a particularly important subcategory of this argument: while I do expect we will be able to handle this issue if it arises, this is mostly because of meta-level faith in humanity to deal with the problem. We don&#x27;t currently have a good object-level story for why the issue <em>won&#x27;t</em> happen, or why it will be fixed when it does happen, and it would be good to have such a story in order to be confident that AI will in fact be beneficial for humanity.</p><p>I know less about the non-alignment risks, and my work doesn&#x27;t really address any of them. They seem worth more investigation; currently my feeling towards them is &quot;yeah, those could be risks, but I have no idea how likely the risks are&quot;.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/xxnPxELC4jLKaFKqG/learning-biases-and-rewards-simultaneously\">Learning biases and rewards simultaneously</a></u> <em>(Rohin Shah et al)</em>: Typically, inverse reinforcement learning assumes that the demonstrator is optimal, or that any mistakes they make are caused by random noise. Without a model of <em>how</em> the demonstrator makes mistakes, we should expect that <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/h9DesGT3WT9u2k7Hr/the-easy-goal-inference-problem-is-still-hard\">IRL would not be able to outperform the demonstrator</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a></u>). So, a natural question arises: can we learn the systematic mistakes that the demonstrator makes from data? While there is an <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ANupXf8XfZo2EJxGv/humans-can-be-assigned-any-values-whatsoever\">impossibility result</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a></u>) here, we might hope that it is only a problem in theory, not in practice.</p><p>In this paper, my coauthors and I propose that we learn the cognitive biases of the demonstrator, by learning their planning algorithm. The hope is that the cognitive biases are encoded in the learned planning algorithm. We can then perform bias-aware IRL by finding the reward function that when passed into the planning algorithm results in the observed policy. We have two algorithms which do this, one which assumes that we know the ground-truth rewards for some tasks, and one which tries to keep the learned planner “close to” the optimal planner. In a simple environment with simulated human biases, the algorithms perform better than the standard IRL assumptions of perfect optimality or Boltzmann rationality -- but they lose a lot of performance by using an imperfect differentiable planner to learn the planning algorithm.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> Although this only got published recently, it’s work I did over a year ago. I’m no longer very optimistic about <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN/what-is-ambitious-value-learning\">ambitious value learning</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a></u>), and so I’m less excited about its impact on AI alignment now. In particular, it seems unlikely to me that we will need to infer all human values perfectly, without any edge cases or uncertainties, which we then optimize as far as possible. I would instead want to build AI systems that start with an adequate understanding of human preferences, and then learn more over time, in conjunction with optimizing for the preferences they know about. However, this paper is more along the former line of work, at least for long-term AI alignment.</p><p>I do think that this is a contribution to the field of inverse reinforcement learning -- it shows that by using an appropriate inductive bias, you can become more robust to (cognitive) biases in your dataset. It’s not clear how far this will generalize, since it was tested on simulated biases on simple environments, but I’d expect it to have at least a small effect. In practice though, I expect that you’d get better results by providing more information, as in <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06387\">T-REX</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/3e2f43012b07/an-54-boxing-a-finite-horizon-ai-system-to-keep-it-unambitious\">AN #54</a></u>).</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09624\">On the Feasibility of Learning, Rather than Assuming, Human Biases for Reward Inference</a></u></p><p><u><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09397\">Cognitive Model Priors for Predicting Human Decisions</a></u> <em>(David D. Bourgin, Joshua C. Peterson et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): Human decision making is notoriously difficult to predict, being a combination of expected value calculation and likely-not-fully-enumerated cognitive biases. Normally we could predict well using a neural net with a ton of data, but data about human decision making is expensive and scarce. This paper proposes that we pretrain a neural net on lots of data simulated from theoretical models of human decision making and then finetune on the small real dataset. In effect, we are using the theoretical model as a kind of prior, that provides the neural net with a strong inductive bias. The method achieves better performance than existing theoretical or empirical methods, without requiring feature engineering, both on existing datasets and a new, larger dataset collected via Mechanical Turk.</p><p><strong>Cody&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I am a little cautious to make a strong statement about the importance of this paper, since I don&#x27;t have as much domain knowledge in cognitive science as I do in machine learning, but overall this &quot;treat your theoretical model like a generative model and sample from it&quot; idea seems like an elegant and plausibly more broadly extensible way of incorporating theoretical priors alongside real data.</p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (Alignment)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wJ3AqNPM7W4nfY5Bk/self-confirming-prophecies-and-simplified-oracle-designs\">Self-confirming prophecies, and simplified Oracle designs</a></u> <em>(Stuart Armstrong)</em>: This post presents a toy environment to model self-confirming predictions by oracles, and demonstrates the results of running a deluded oracle (that doesn&#x27;t realize its predictions affect the world), a low-bandwidth oracle (that must choose from a small set of possible answers), a high-bandwidth oracle (that can choose from a large set of answers) and a counterfactual oracle (that chooses the correct answer, <em>conditional</em> on us not seeing the answer).</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/i2dNFgbjnqZBfeitT/oracles-sequence-predictors-and-self-confirming-predictions\">Oracles, sequence predictors, and self-confirming predictions</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/405e29e1f1cd/an-55-regulatory-markets-and-international-standards-as-a-means-of-ensuring-beneficial-ai\">AN #55</a></u>) and <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05541\">Good and safe uses of AI Oracles</a></u></p><p><u><a href=\"https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/d9aaad_f82846cf065645ad87897f2a7281cebf.pdf\">Existential Risks: A Philosophical Analysis</a></u> <em>(Phil Torres)</em>: The phrase &quot;existential risk&quot; is often used in different ways. This paper considers the pros and cons of five different definitions.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> While this doesn&#x27;t mention AI explicitly, I think it&#x27;s useful to read anyway, because often which of the five concepts you use will affect what you think the important risks are.</p><h1><strong>AI strategy and policy</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://alignmentforum.org/posts/Sn5NiiD5WBi4dLzaB/agi-will-drastically-increase-economies-of-scale-1\">AGI will drastically increase economies of scale</a></u> <em>(Wei Dai)</em>: Economies of scale would normally mean that companies would keep growing larger and larger. With human employees, the coordination costs grow superlinearly, which ends up limiting the size to which a company can grow. However, with the advent of AGI, many of these coordination costs will be removed. If we can align AGIs to particular humans, then a corporation run by AGIs aligned to a single human would at least avoid principal-agent costs. As a result, the economies of scale would dominate, and companies would grow much larger, leading to more centralization.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This argument is quite compelling to me under the assumption of human-level AGI systems that can be intent-aligned. Note though that while the development of AGI systems removes principal-agent problems, it doesn&#x27;t remove issues that arise due to different agents having different (non-value-related) information.</p><p>The argument probably doesn&#x27;t hold with <u><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reframing/\">CAIS</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/b649f32b07da/alignment-newsletter-40\">AN #40</a></u>), where each AI service is optimized for a particular task, since there would be principal-agent problems between services.</p><p>It seems like the argument should mainly make us more worried about stable authoritarian regimes: the main effect based on this argument is a centralization of power in the hands of the AGI&#x27;s overseers. This is less likely to happen with companies, because we have institutions that prevent companies from gaining too much power, though perhaps competition between countries could weaken such institutions. It could happen with government, but if long-term governmental power still rests with the people via democracy, that seems okay. So the risky situation seems to be when the government gains power, and the people no longer have effective control over government. (This would include scenarios with e.g. a government that has sufficiently good AI-fueled propaganda that they always win elections, regardless of whether their governing is actually good.)</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sM2sANArtSJE6duZZ/where-are-people-thinking-and-talking-about-global\">Where are people thinking and talking about global coordination for AI safety?</a></u> <em>(Wei Dai)</em></p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08226\">Unsupervised State Representation Learning in Atari</a></u> <em>(Ankesh Anand, Evan Racah, Sherjil Ozair et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): This paper has two main contributions: an actual technique for learning representations in an unsupervised way, and an Atari-specific interface for giving access to the underlying conceptual state of the game (e.g. the locations of agents, locations of small objects, current remaining lives, etc) by parsing out the RAM associated with each state. Since the notional goal of unsupervised representation learning is often to find representations that can capture conceptually important features of the state without having direct access to them, this supervision system allows for more meaningful evaluation of existing methods by asking how well conceptual features can be predicted by learned representation vectors. The object-level method of the paper centers around learning representations that capture information about temporal state dynamics, which they do by maximizing mutual information between representations at adjacent timesteps. More specifically, they have both a local version of this, where a given 1/16th patch of the image has a representation that is optimized to be predictive of that same patches next-timestep representation, and a local-global version, where the global representation is optimized to be predictive of representations of each patch. They argue this patch-level prediction makes their method better at learning concepts attached to small objects, and the empirical results do seem to support this interpretation.</p><p><strong>Cody&#x27;s opinion:</strong> The specific method is an interesting modification of previous Contrastive Predictive Coding work, but what I found most impressive about this paper was the engineering work involved in pulling metadata supervision signals out of the game by reading comments on disassembled source code to see exactly how metadata was being stored in RAM. This seems to have the potential of being a useful benchmark for Atari representation learning going forward (though admittedly Atari games are fairly conceptually straightforward to begin with).</p><h3><strong>Deep learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237\">XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding</a></u> <em>(Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai et al)</em>: XLNet sets significantly improved state-of-the-art scores on many NLP tasks, beating out BERT.

The agent doesn't object to the change, nor do they attempt to make it happen. It is <em>indifferent</em> to the change, because its reward is balanced to be <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/btLPgsGzwzDk9DgJG/proper-value-learning-through-indifference\">precisely the same</a> whether change happens or not. Originally, this was setup for a single change of utility/reward function at a single moment of time.</p>\n<p>Here, we will present a formalism with multiple agents, all of whom are indifferent not only to changes in their own reward functions, but to changes in the reward functions of any of the other agents. We'll also generalise it to accommodate multiple changes of reward functions - maybe a different change at each timestep.</p>\n<p>In order for these definitions to work, we will need to define some notions of counterfactuals, and some notions of optimality for several agents optimising their own separate reward functions.</p>\n<h2>Example: self-driving car races</h2>\n<p>It's clear why we would need to generalise to each timestep: it's important to be able to safely change an agent's goals more than once, as we are unlikely to get the goals perfectly right in only two tries. It's also important to <a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6618-dynamic-safe-interruptibility-for-decentralized-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning\">generalise to multiple agents</a>, as agents can be motivated to push humans to interrupt or not interrupt other agents. Indeed, this would be expected for a reward-maximising agent, and could lead to dangerous behaviour.</p>\n<p>Consider the following example, adapted from <a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6618-dynamic-safe-interruptibility-for-decentralized-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning\">this paper</a>.

If one of the car starts skidding, their controller takes over and remotely brakes that car, carefully, and applies indifference to that car's reward.

To (double- or triple-)quote the relevant parts:</p><blockquote>the best hunting strategy requires randomizing</blockquote><p>and </p><blockquote>If you’re generally predictable – and Scott Aaronson says you are – then outsourcing your decision to weird birds might be the best way to go.</blockquote><p>This is a somewhat general pattern: to deal with smart adversaries effectively, randomization is, on average, the best strategy. Matching pennies and Rock/paper/scissors are some classic examples. Also, humans (and probably animals in general) are apparently poor randomizers. I assume because a built-in biological random number generator of adequate quality is expensive. I don&#x27;t know if this is a good assumption. A quick online search does not refute or confirm this, and randomness is everywhere at the cellular level, but maybe not at the level of the single organisms. </p><p>Fortunately, true randomness is everywhere outside in the physical processes, and is cheap to access, and the augury and divination mentioned in the reviewed book are good examples of that. So, relying on external randomness might be an evolutionary adaptation that improves survival. (Is this so? Then we would see similar behavior in other animals&#x27; strategies for dealing with adversity, be it hunting, gathering or something else. Do we?)</p><p>Of course, the next step, consciously understanding what randomness is and why it is useful, is borderline impossible for any animal but a rather advanced human, and even then it&#x27;s iffy: even statisticians are not immune to behavioral rituals. And given our awesome powers of rationalization, we justify the randomization rituals as predictive, not just useful. </p><p>And so we have a Goodhart-like situation, where a proxy becomes the goal, and is no longer a useful proxy:</p><ul><li>The &quot;true&quot; goal is to improve the odds of finding or cultivating a resource necessary for survival.</li><li>The chosen proxy is to rely on an external randomizer.</li><li>The internal justification for it is that it has larger predictive powers then the person&#x27;s logic or intuition.</li><li>Thus believing in an external power that is larger than oneself has evolutionary advantages and can stick, so the proxy becomes the goal, even though it gives little or no advantage in most situations that do not require randomization.</li><li>Ergo, &quot;a God-shaped hole&quot; in one&#x27;s heart.</li></ul><p>The above is largely a speculation and is missing a fair bit in order to become a quality model of how the need to believe in the supernatural may have been selected as an evolutionary advantage. But I don&#x27;t see anything immediately wrong with it. It also immediately makes a number of predictions, such as some non-human animals using external random events to guide their behavior, instead of basing it on more deterministic factors, or on an internal generator of randomness.</p><p>It is worth noting that this might not truly be a Goodhart-like situation, since the proxy is still useful in its original context, and, potentially, in other contexts, such as community building.</p><p>I have not put any research into whether this has been discussed before, here or elsewhere, my apologies if this is a repetition of something already well known.</p>",

You can learn more about what this means in our article on <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/cause-prioritization-downside-focused-value-systems/\">Cause prioritization for downside-focused value systems</a> (section: “AI Alignment”).</p><p>When <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Nns9DhL9bpzswitNu/launching-the-eaf-fund\">launching the fund</a>, we listed specific areas we consider to be particularly important. You can also take a look at the <a href=\"https://ea-foundation.org/grantmaking/\">two grants</a> we made last year. Below we provide additional guidance on grants we’d be excited to make.</p><p><strong>Grants for capacity-building</strong> (e.g., workshops, community infrastructure, scholarships, funding for self-study). We’re particularly interested in increasing capacity in terms of top talent and quality (e.g., nuance, depth) of output as opposed to the size of the community in general. Examples of grantees might be:</p><ul><li>Somebody who is familiar with our research program to learn about existing AI alignment approaches or pursue a degree relevant to AI governance.</li><li>Somebody to organize an event or provide a resource that addresses a current need in the community of people focused on s-risks.</li></ul><p><strong>Grants that enable research in priority areas</strong> (e.g., teaching buy-outs, funding for compute, funding for conference attendance, funding for independent research). Below are examples of research topics we currently find particularly relevant.</p><ol><li><a href=\"http://s-risks.org/using-surrogate-goals-to-deflect-threats/\">Surrogate goals</a> are a promising avenue for reducing downside risks from threats. Ideally, they would transform threat games to games involving threats against “surrogate goals” which would not be catastrophic if carried out. However, surrogate goals are not well-studied and a number of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTmaFYyKD07jv2Vzzcwj8ib0sASBm1jRihID2xTxHuI/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges</a> need to be addressed. We’re expecting additional research to illuminate how and whether they are a feasible intervention for reducing s-risk.</li><li><a href=\"https://ie.technion.ac.il/~moshet/progeqnote4.pdf\">Program games</a>, and related ideas in machine learning such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04326\">learning with opponent-learning awareness</a>, demonstrate how the ability of artificial agents to access one another’s source code (or policy parameters) can be used to achieve more cooperative outcomes. However, the technical study of program games and “open-source game theory” more generally is in its infancy. There is also still the possibility of a “credibility gap” between the output of the program submitted in the program game and the actions carried out by the agents. Understanding how and when this gap can be closed is critical to understanding how program equilibrium can be used to reduce bargaining losses.</li><li>While behavioral game theory is now a well-established field, the behavioral game theory of human-AI interaction is almost entirely unexplored (but see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06207.pdf\">Crandall et al. (2018)</a> for a relevant study). Understanding how humans will interact with advanced AIs or AI-assisted humans in high-stakes scenarios may be crucial for preventing disvalue from threats, for instance, by informing the design of protocols for humans in an <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/humans-consulting-hch-f893f6051455\">HCH</a>-type scheme.</li><li>Technological changes are likely to affect the ability of powerful agents to make credible commitments. For instance, they might influence the likelihood of carrying out threats or not to giving in to threats. <a href=\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/papers/tcc-gt.pdf\">Cryptographic game theory</a>, the <a href=\"https://weis2018.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/05/WEIS_2018_paper_25.pdf\">game theory of ransomware</a>, and the aforementioned work on program games are examples of such research on the game-theoretic implications of various technological affordances. We are interested in work analyzing how various possible technological advancements could affect the analysis of threat scenarios via their effects on credibility.</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7MdLurJGhGmqRv25c/multiverse-wide-cooperation-in-a-nutshell\">Multiverse-wide cooperation via correlated decision-making</a> and other forms of acausal trade may create opportunities for significant gains from trade. It is also possible that agents reasoning along these lines will <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/distant_SIs/\">be exposed</a> to various risks, including s-risks. We are interested in better understanding the possibilities for gains and losses from acausal interaction. This includes both building out formal frameworks for, e.g., acausal bargaining, and investigating the physical and computational limits to the sorts of simulations that would be necessary to carry out some kinds of acausal interaction. (See our <a href=\"https://ea-foundation.org/grantmaking/\">grant from last year</a> to Daniel Kokotajlo for his PhD research on acausal trade.)</li><li>In order to improve our general picture of how advanced artificial intelligence might develop and the possible points of intervention in AI design for reducing s-risk, we are interested in foundational questions related to rational agency. See <a href=\"https://casparoesterheld.com/decision-theory-research-overview/\">this overview</a> for a treatment of the foundational questions several EAF-affiliated researchers are most interested in answering. More generally, we are interested in developing more satisfactory theories of rational decision-making for bounded and embedded agents.</li><li>We are also very interested in receiving applications for AI policy and strategy research. In most cases, we do not recommend for this type of research to focus on s-risk reduction in particular because the field is still too young for that. However, we would be especially excited about applicants who are familiar with the state of research on s-risk. We are currently unable to provide further guidance for specific work we’re likely to fund in these areas.</li></ol><p>Within these areas, we are open to funding both original research, as well as thorough literature reviews in cases like (3) and (4), drawing on well-established subfields. Grantees are expected to display high levels of <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/reasoning-transparency\">reasoning transparency</a> and nuance in their work</p><p>In general, we expect applications for this round to be most worthwhile for people who are already familiar with our work and prioritization. If you’re uncertain whether your project is in line with what we have in mind, feel free to reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:fund@ea-foundation.org\">fund@ea-foundation.org</a> before investing the time for a complete application. We’re happy to provide feedback on brief descriptions of project ideas. We will also answer questions in the comment section.</p><h2>Future application rounds</h2><p>We are expecting to run another application round before the end of the year. By then, we expect to have published a research agenda which will provide more context and outline concrete research projects we’d like to see more work on. Before then, we expect to make only a limited number of grants to individuals who are already somewhat familiar with our work.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>This post might be interesting to you if you want a conceptual model of cumulative cultural evolution and/or you’re curious how cumulative cultural evolution impacts AI forecasting and development.</p><p>In particular, I’ll argue that cumulative cultural evolution makes one argument for the discontinuity of AI progress more plausible and sketches out at least two possible paths of development that are worth further investigation.</p><h1>Cumulative Cultural Evolution</h1><blockquote>Humans have altered more than one-third of the earths’ land surface. We cycle more nitrogen than all other terrestrial life forms combined and have now altered the flow of two-thirds of the earth’s rivers. Our species uses 100 times more biomass than any large species that has ever lived. If you include our vast herds of domesticated animals, we account for more than 98% of terrestrial vertebrate biomass. — Joseph Henrich</blockquote><p>Cumulative cultural evolution is often framed as an answer to the general question: what makes humans so successful relative to other apes? Other apes do not occupy as many continents, are not as populous, and do not shape or use environment to the extent that humans do. </p><p>There are a smorgasbord of different accounts of this, referencing:</p><ul><li>human capability for deception ratcheted up human sociality and intelligence via arms race like effects.</li><li>runaway signaling.</li><li>human’s general intelligence or improvisational intelligence</li><li>humans’ prosociality</li><li>a package of instinctual modules, such as language, intelligence, social learning, folk physics and biology</li><li>human’s cultural learning abilities</li></ul><p>In this section, I’ll explain the account that refers to human’s cultural learning abilities. Cultural learning typically refers to a subset of social learning abilities such as mindreading, imitation, and teaching. I’ll use cultural and social learning interchangeably here. </p><p>Muthukrishna, Doebeli, Chudek, and Henrich’s recent paper “<u><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006504&type=printable\">The Cultural Brain Hypothesis: How culture drives brain expansion, sociality, and life history</a></u>” contains one of the best conceptual models of the cumulative cultural evolution story.</p><p>In the paper, Muthukrishna and co are in the business of making mathematical models which they can use to simulate the impact of brain size, sociality, mating structures, and life history. I’ll go the conceptual features of the primary model here and motivate it’s plausibility. </p><p>The components of the model are:</p><ul><li>assumptions</li><li>lifecycle</li><li>parameters</li></ul><h2><strong>Assumptions</strong></h2><p>Muthukrishna and co make the following assumptions:</p><ul><li>larger brains are more expensive</li><li>larger brains corresponds to an increased capacity to store and manage adaptive information</li><li>adaptive information reduces the probability that its bearer will die or increases the probability that it will reproduce. </li></ul><p>One way to think about the role of adaptive information is to think of humans as occupying “the cognitive niche.” Just as there are niches that particular species may exploit due to their biological features, a species may exploit a cognitive niche through gathering, managing, and applying information. Humans are apparently unique with regards to the range of information we can gather, the ability to apply that information during development time, and the ability to pass that on that information through generations. Occupying the cognitive niche allows a species like homo sapiens to innovate new tools and manipulate the environment using fire to smart phones. </p><p>Managing and storing information requires large brains and large brains are expensive. Large brains are harder to feed, birth, and develop. There are then two conflicting selection pressures: the costliness of large brains and the advantageousness of adaptive information. </p><h2><strong>Lifecycle</strong></h2><p>To tease out the impact of these different pressures Muthukrishna and co run a move agents through a lifecycle of BIRTH, LEARNING, MIGRATION, and SELECTION. These steps are straightforward, agents are born, spend time learning asocially or socially, migrate between groups, and then are selected according to the amount of adaptive knowledge they acquired, costliness of their brain size, and the environmental payoff.</p><h2><strong>Parameters</strong></h2><p>The model includes the following parameters:</p><ul><ul><li>Transmission fidelity</li><ul><li>how accurately can an agent learn from others?</li></ul><li>Asocial learning</li><ul><li>how efficient is asocial learning?</li></ul><li>Ecological richness</li><ul><li>what is the environmental payoff for adaptive knowledge?</li></ul><li>Reproductive skew</li><ul><li>how much more do those with more adaptive knowledge reproduce? Groups with a pair bonding structure will have less reproductive skew. Groups with a polygynous mating structure will have more reproductive skew. </li></ul></ul></ul><p>These parameters are modified for different agents and groups. </p><h2><strong>Results</strong></h2><p>What is the result of the simulation? The simulation outputs out the following causal relationships:</p><ol><li>Larger brains allow for more adaptive knowledge. This creates a selection pressure for larger brains. This is true for both social and asocial learners.</li><li>More adaptive knowledge allows for a larger carrying capacity. As an agents invest in more social learning, this creates a selection pressure for larger groups as larger groups are richer sources of adaptive knowledge than smaller groups. </li><li>Larger groups of individuals will tend to have more adaptive knowledge, this puts pressure on longer juvenile periods for social learners.</li><li>Extended juvenile periods creates selection pressures for better learning biases, in particular biases concerning who to learn from. </li><li>Better learning biases and oblique learning “lead to the realm of cumulative cultural evolution”</li></ol><p>Here’s a nifty picture displaying these relationships:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19415529/60771255-03c28c00-a09a-11e9-91a2-0659ff007986.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\" /></figure></span><p>These results are for the most part, weakly, verified in the empirical world. </p><ul><li>Brain size and social learning</li><ul><li>This relationship appears to hold for primates and birds. </li></ul><li>Larger groups &amp; larger brains</li><ul><li>This relationship holds for primates, but not for other taxa.</li></ul><li>Brain size and juvenile period</li><ul><li>There is a positive relationship for primates between brain size and juvenile period. </li></ul><li>Group size and juvenile period</li><ul><li>There is a positive relationship for primates between groups size and absolute juvenile period. </li></ul></ul><p><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006504&type=printable\">See 19-22 for relationship strengths and caveats.</a></p><p>The general model provides a rather neat picture. Crucially, there are positive feedback loops between larger brains and social learning in the right environment. This in turn pushes towards longer juvenile periods and larger groups. </p><h2><strong>Cumulative Cultural Evolution</strong></h2><p>Under the right parameter values, Muthukrishna and co saw that a species which undergoes something like cumulative cultural evolution can be generated. Recall the parameters of the model:</p><ul><li>transmission fidelity</li><li>reproductive skew</li><li>asocial learning</li><li>ecological richness</li></ul><p>Let a cumulative cultural be the phenomenon where a group contains far more adaptive knowledge than could likely be generated by all of its individual members via asocial learning. Basically, a group that exhibits cumulative culture would be a species where it is exceedingly unlikely that any of its members could generate its pool of adaptive knowledge via asocial learning.</p><p>What values of the model parameters would produce cumulative culture? </p><p>Before reading on, answer this question on your own. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><ul><li>Very high transmission fidelity. </li><ul><li>In order for adaptive knowledge to accumulate in a species that species needs to be able to accurately transmit that knowledge through generations. </li></ul><li>Low reproductive skew. </li><ul><li>What would happen if there were a high reproductive skew? Then individuals who learn asocially and have especially large brains would be rewarded and survive. However, populations with large brained asocial learners eventually go extinct. This is because as large brained asocial learners survive variance in social learning ability decreases. As variance in social learning ability decreases the population is: (i) unable to cheaply accumulate knowledge via social learning and (ii) unable to transition to smaller brained social learners (remember, brains are expensive!).</li></ul><li>Moderate asocial learning. </li><ul><li>Social learners face a bootstrapping problem -- the adaptive knowledge must come from somewhere. This means that the species needs to be able to generate innovations asocially. However, the species cannot invest in asocial learning too much, otherwise asocial learning may be too efficient and social learning will not take off. </li></ul><li>Ecological richness. </li><ul><li>Finally, adaptive knowledge must payoff. Brains are too expensive to grow, unless there is a significant benefit to their becoming larger. The ecology can account for that benefit. </li></ul></ul><p>These parameter values offer an explanation of human brain size, social learning capabilities, and general success. Moreover, they may also explain why species like humans are very low in number. In order for there to be a species that invests in social learning at a very high rate:</p><ul><li>Ecologies must be sufficiently rich.</li><li>There must be a low reproductive skew</li><li>A species must be in the goldilocks zone with respect to asocial learning</li><li>Transmission fidelity must be very high</li></ul><p>In this environment there is significant pressure to:</p><ul><li>increase brain size</li><li>increase social learning </li><li>increase social learning efficiency</li></ul><p>I personally think this stuff is very exciting. We have a model for how brain sizes could 3x and how humans can emerge as a uniquely social species. There are additional insights about the value of information and importance of mating structure. </p><h2><strong>AI Forecasting and Development</strong></h2><p>Now, what, if anything, is the import of this for AI forecasting and development?</p><p>There’s an argument that’s been floating awhile for sometime that goes something like this:</p><blockquote>Humans are vastly more successful in certain ways than other hominids, yet in evolutionary time, the distance between them is small. This suggests that evolution induced discontinuous progress in returns, if not in intelligence itself, somewhere approaching human-level intelligence. If evolution experienced this, this suggests that artificial intelligence research may do also. — <u><a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/likelihood-of-discontinuous-progress-around-the-development-of-agi/#Hominid_variation\">AI Impacts</a></u></blockquote><p>One can push back on the argument above with the claims that:</p><ul><li>Evolution wasn’t optimizing for improving human intelligence</li><li>Human evolutionary success is not due to human intelligence</li></ul><p>In response to the first claim, there&#x27;s good reason to believe, from the model above, that there are feedback loops that enable a species’ brain size and social learning capabilities to take off. Moreover, evolution was “targeting” this takeoff due the selection pressures for adaptive information and against large brains. Large brain social learners were significantly “rewarded” in the right ecosystems. In the relevant sense, evolutionary dynamics optimized for and pushed humans’ asocial and social learning capabilities upward.</p><p>In response to the second claim, whether or not humans are significantly better asocial learners than our primate relatives is unclear. Obviously adult humans have significantly higher intelligence than our primate relatives, however it’s unclear to what extent this higher intelligence is a result of asocial learning rather than social learning. What is clear is that, from a very early age, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17823346\">humans are vastly better social learners than our primate ancestors</a>. Given this, it’s plausible to claim that human success, at least relative to other apes, derived from our asocial and social learning abilities. These abilities enabled humans to occupy the cognitive niche. </p><p>Cumulative cultural evolution renders this argument more plausible. However, before getting too excited, it’s worth noting that cumulative cultural evolution is one plausible account of human success and intelligence among an array of plausible accounts.</p><p>So much for forecasting, what of artificial intelligence development? The development of human intelligence suggested by the cumulative cultural evolution story, followed the chain below:</p><blockquote>moderate asocial learning =&gt; social learning.</blockquote><p>One can imagine machine learning work developing sufficient asocial learning techniques and then ratcheting capabilities forward by combining previous work through social learning techniques (potentially via imitation learning or model transfer, but likely much more sophisticated techniques). On this model asocial learning (probably made up by a number of different modules and techniques), enables social learning to become a winning strategy. However, social learning is an independent thing, it is not built on top of asocial learning modules. </p><p>Related to this, more work needs to be done determining capacities primarily drive human social learning. Henrich suggests that it is both mindreading and imitation. Tomasello’s work stresses mindreading, in particular the ability for humans to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Becoming_Human.html?id=ZnhyDwAAQBAJ\">develop</a> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3802971\">joint</a> <a href=\"https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Cambridge/Tomasello_Understanding_BehBrainSci_2005_1555292.pdf\">attention</a> . Answers to this issue would provide at least some evidence about what machine learning algorithms are likely to be more successful. </p><p>Another issue brought up by this work is whether social learning is an instinct, that is (roughly) whether it is encoded by genes and not brought into existence via culture, or whether it is a gadget. A gadget is not encoded by genetic information, but is instead developed by cultural means. Suggestive work by <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Cognitive-Gadgets-Cultural-Evolution-Thinking/dp/0674980158?sa-no-redirect=1\">Heyes</a> argues that social learning capabilities could be developed from humans’ temperament, high working memory, and attention capabilities. If this is so, then the development of artificial intelligence sketched above is likely flawed. It may instead look like:</p><blockquote>temperament + computation power + working memory + attention ⇒ social learning</blockquote><br/><p>On this model, not only does asocial learning enable social learning to be a winning strategy, asocial learning capabilities compose social learning abilities. Social learning is really not that different from asocial learning, it just a layer built on top of lower level intelligence systems. </p><p>Both of these models suggest that AI development is currently bottlenecked on the asocial learning step. However, once a threshold for asocial learning is reached, intelligence will increase at a vastly quick rate. </p><p>There’s a lot more to do here. I hope to have persuasively motivated the cumulative cultural evolution story and the idea that it has important upshots for AI development and forecasting.</p>",

I think Jessica in her post touched on it a little, but that touch inspired me to give it a shot myself. However, instead of focusing on social dynamics, I&#x27;m going to focus on an individual&#x27;s internal world and interpretation.</p><p>Here are a few examples of mental narratives that I&#x27;m going to dissect. (I borrowed a few from Jessica&#x27;s post and a few from the SSC post.) See if you can find the ones that happen to you. Or see if you can understand the pattern to find ones that are not on the list.</p><p>1. This thing that&#x27;s happening is bad. I wish it wouldn&#x27;t happen.</p><p>2. Am I a bad person for participating in this? I think something&#x27;s wrong with me.</p><p>3. I&#x27;m not a bad person! I&#x27;m definitely in the right here.</p><p>4. I&#x27;m feeling attacked. I feel like people are against me.</p><p>5. I don&#x27;t feel safe here. I think they&#x27;ll hurt me.</p><p>6. I feel like I&#x27;m the odd one out. I don&#x27;t think I belong here.</p><p>7. I don&#x27;t understand this at all. What am I missing? There&#x27;s a clue here somewhere. If I can find it, then I&#x27;ll understand it. </p><h1>Lenses</h1><p>To try to understand the pattern and what to do with it, I&#x27;ll provide four different lenses.</p><h2>Physical sensations</h2><p>What does it feel like to experience these narratives? Look and see.</p><p>For me, it feels constraining. It feels like sensing a wall and then pushing away from it. Or pushing into it. It feels like a river that has hit the bank and has to turn. My body feels tighter. My awareness feels more narrow or disappears entirely. The thought grows bigger in my mind until it dominates. Until, just for a moment, it feels like my entire mental reality is described by the circumstance. By how I feel attacked. Or by how I feel like I don&#x27;t belong. It stops being a thought and becomes reality.</p><p>So how does it feel when the narrative ends? To me it feels like someone was hugging me super tight and then let go. It feels like a release. An expansion. An exhale. It feels like freedom. Freedom to reconsider. To review. To remember other sides of the problem. Freedom to forget. Freedom to move on.</p><h2>TAP</h2><p>We can also think of those narratives as serving a particular purpose. Like other TAPs, they were installed there for some reason, probably a long time. Probably because someone told us. Or probably because a &quot;bad&quot; thing happened to us and we really wanted for it to not happen again.</p><p>Each narrative has many triggers. But once triggered, the action is pretty straight forward. And it&#x27;s usually always the same: recount the narrative and listen to it. Just like when Revolio Clockberg Jr. hears about Gear Wars, he <em>has</em> to tell you all about it. And once he starts, there&#x27;s no stopping it. Like clockwork.</p><h2>Movie</h2><p>One of the best ways to talk about narratives is to talk about stories and movies. Movies are compelling. They draw us in. When we&#x27;re in a middle of a good film, we forget who we are. We feel wholeheartedly the emotion, the action, the tension. Where is all of this going? Well... we know. It&#x27;s going where the movie going. There&#x27;s only one track.</p><p>And for a great movie, that&#x27;s a fun track to be on. But for the narratives I&#x27;ve described, that&#x27;s not a fun track at all. You&#x27;ve seen some of them thousands of times already. Do you want to see it again? All it costs is a few seconds of your time and a few drops of your sanity.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m feeling attacked. Like people are against me.&quot; is a movie. It&#x27;s a lousy, poorly written, utterly predictable movie. And you know exactly where it&#x27;s heading. &quot;Me against the world.&quot; Or &quot;Look at me, I&#x27;m so independent. I don&#x27;t need anyone.&quot; Or &quot;Hah! They&#x27;re all against me, but look who is winning now!&quot; And, honestly, even that is giving that movie too much credit. Because 99.9% of the time the only place that movie is taking you to is: &quot;I&#x27;m feeling attacked. Like people are against me. This sucks. This sucks. This sucks.&quot;</p><h2>Car</h2><p>When you&#x27;re gripped by one of such narratives, you&#x27;re in the car. When you aren&#x27;t, you&#x27;re free. Get out of the car and stay out!</p><p>Q: I&#x27;m experiencing all these mental narratives. What do I do? What&#x27;s the skill I need to learn to avoid them?</p><p>A: Note how that question itself is an example of the narrative / car you&#x27;re trying to avoid. Drop it.</p><p>Q: I was trying hard to avoid all the mental narratives you described. But then I ran into one head first. Where and how should I put up more walls so that this wouldn&#x27;t happen?</p><p>A: Stop putting up walls. Stop seeing walls. Stop trying to avoid them by creating more walls. When you&#x27;re not in the car, there are no walls and there are no roads.</p><p>&quot;Then I can’t get out of the car. I want to get out of the car. But I need help. And the first step to getting help is for you to factor my number.&quot; is being in the car. It&#x27;s watching a movie about how you&#x27;re stuck and how you&#x27;re missing something. It&#x27;s running a TAP that says: IF I don&#x27;t understand something THEN I&#x27;m unsafe until I do. It&#x27;s screaming at the cactus person, demanding an answer.</p><p>As long as you think there&#x27;s a car or that you have something to do about it, you can&#x27;t get out of it. Stop trying to get out of the car and get out of the car.</p><h1>The invitation</h1><p>The invitation is to notice when these narratives arise. Just notice. You don&#x27;t have to do anything about them. You don&#x27;t have to stop them or avoid them. Just notice when one starts. Notice when you&#x27;re in it. Notice when it ends. Notice when it&#x27;s not there.</p><p>And if on one of those occasions you decide to pull over that car and get out... well, I promise you the car is not going to be upset.</p><br/>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>[Epistemic status: Half-truth.]</em><br/><em>[CW: Microeconomics]</em></p><p>Sometime in the 1800s, some random English economist named William Stanley Jevons made an amazing discovery: The demand for coal power is elastic.</p><p>This may sound boring as fuck. That’s because it is. A lot of things have price-elastic demand curves. This is probably just another one of those things that should go in the <em>Journal of Things Nobody Has Ever Cared About But May Be Useful to Some Guy with a PhD in a Bizarrely Specific Field</em>. Anyways, that’s why when steam engines became more efficient, British coal consumption shot through the roof.</p><p>wat</p><p>So anyways, let’s take a look at this graph, taken (With some small edits) from Wikipedia. It’s the main reason why you haven’t lost your job to automation yet, and your only hope for surviving the oncoming robot apocalypse:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Productivity_Shock_to_a_Labor_Market.svg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:51%\" /></figure><em>The economy: Now with 20% more jobs!</em></span><p>So, that graph makes perfect sense, right? No? OK, fair. Let’s go over what everything means.</p><p>This is a supply and demand graph, showing the employment before and after a new machine is introduced which allows more work to be done by fewer people. Let’s say it’s some new steam-powered textile machinery, just to make any 19th-century Luddites reading this very angry.</p><p>The curve labeled S is the supply curve for labor. It shows how many man-hours of work you can hire at any particular hourly wage. Offer a wage of $20 an hour, and you’ll get more people showing up and offering to work than if you only offered $10, so it’s always upward-sloping — higher wages mean you get more people willing to work.</p><p>HR is the hourly revenue curve. It takes as an input how many man-hours are already being used, and represents how many dollars an employer would make if they paid for an extra man-hour of work.<span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

That’s the point the economy natural settles on, the “Equilibrium point.” I’ll write more on this in a future post, but for now, think about what it means if the HR curve is above the supply curve: It means that the employer is willing to hire for a wage higher than what the potential employee is willing to work for. This means that the employer can offer a wage that not only makes him a profit, but is also better than what the employee was hoping for, so we expect that both people would agree to this trade.</p><p>Now, here’s the important bit. Let’s take a look at what happens when the new machine is introduced, and you can do, say, 20% more work with the same number of people. What’s going to happen?</p><p>Well, the HR curve is going to go up by 20% at every point! After all, workers are producing 20% more, so the amount of profit from hiring an extra worker increases by 20%. Not only have jobs not been <em>lost</em> because of this new technology, more jobs have actually been <em>created</em>, and what’s more, the jobs pay more money. <em>Automation creates jobs and boosts wages.</em></p><p>The mistake in the common naive analysis that automation kills jobs (or that increased steam engine efficiency should reduce coal consumption) is in holding the amount of stuff being produced constant, whether it’s steam power or the amount of things being produced. But it <em>doesn’t</em> stay constant. When things get cheaper — like hiring people to do some manufacturing process, or producing power from coal — people <em>use it more.</em></p><p>During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, the effect was big enough that wages <em>doubled</em> from 1850-1900.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://thelimelike.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/20130921_woc404_580.png?w=323&h=313\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:46%\" /></figure><em>Mistakes were made — The Luddites</em></span><p>So anyways, my next post will explain why this is all a lie and you’re actually <em>maybe</em> doomed to lose your job to automation.

Ultimately, predictions about asset classes usually come down to reference class forecasting, as any appeal to &#x27;over&#x27; or &#x27;under&#x27; priced is relative to some trend, and choice of the timescale on which trend following is expected can be chosen to tell a story. E.g. two people arguing can have one arguing for a reversion to a long run historical trend while the other argues for a reversion to a short run trend. They may both be right on different time scales going forward too.  This post attempts to surface reasons why buying may be more expensive than a popular model one might encounter, which may have been generated by people in the pro real estate camp. Thus it argues that people&#x27;s confidence intervals, especially to the downside, are too narrow when modeling home buying. Losses in the housing market are hard to get quantified data on since they are private and often vary enormously due to imputed rents and opportunity cost being idiosyncratic between individuals. A small thumb on the sale at each step in a multiplicative planning space can add up to a lot by the time you reach the output of your model. </p><p>The main parameters looked at in this post if you want to do you your own homework (which obviously you should for an individual purchasing decision) are as follows:</p><p>Rent-to-Buy ratio (see linked post at bottom for problems with the default parameters of popular rent to buy calculators)</p><p>Average time spent in purchased homes</p><p>Historical house price indexes</p><p>Historical rent price indexes</p><p>Vanguard&#x27;s Balanced Index investment fund (leveraging a balanced fund handily beats all-stock allocations btw)</p><p>Salary and savings considerations over a career</p><p>Home ownership tax benefit calculators</p><p>I&#x27;ll add any more that occur to me.</p><p>Beware extrapolating averages to unusual situations. Outlier markets usually have various reasons that have driven metrics to extremes. Failure to understand the casual mechanisms will prevent one from predicting when such trends might reverse.</p><p>Original post:</p><p>The average person spends about 10 years (87k hours) in a house  before moving, which already goes against people&#x27;s tacit models. This  post is about the various reasons why buying a house is a bad idea.</p><p> First let&#x27;s address the idea that renting is &#x27;throwing money away&#x27;.  This ignores the opportunity cost of investing extra income and the lump  sum of the down payment into a house instead of the stock market.  People spend on average 50% more money on mortgages, taxes, and fees  than they spend on rent. If that money were invested in the market it  would be earning you a return. People very often report being surprised  how much more a home wound up costing them than they had expected. You  can plug in the numbers for yourself in a rent to buy calculator (and  should do so do get a sense of which numbers matter, but keep in mind  they tend to have defaults set that are crazy and home buying tilted). A  financial planner goes into more details about rent to buy ratios  here(link below). Summary: buying makes sense in growing markets where  the rent to buy ratio is under 20. But the markets in which the rent to  buy ratio is under 20 are the same markets that you *don&#x27;t* want to live  in. The ratios are low precisely for the reasons you don&#x27;t want to live  there, various quality of life and job prospects.</p><p>Second let&#x27;s  address the fear that &#x27;rents keep going up so it becomes a better deal  over time.&#x27; Rents can&#x27;t go up relative to house prices or vice versa for  very long because eventually people will arbitrage the difference away.  When renting is cheap, demand for purchasing homes drops. When renting  is expensive demand for purchasing homes goes up. But we&#x27;d expect small  persistent distortions in the direction of buying being more expensive  because so many people default to buying even when it doesn&#x27;t make  sense. But what about the Bay Area? Compound annual growth in housing  prices over the last couple decades has been around 7.5% while growth  for rent has been around 4.6%. But this is exactly why I expect  regression to the mean. Overall rent to buy ratios in the Bay have been  overheated and are now dropping, and it&#x27;s prices that are getting pulled  down faster than rent is going up. Additionally, rents have  historically appreciated much more slowly than the stock market, meaning  renting should get cheaper for you over time if you&#x27;re investing.</p><p> Isn&#x27;t that all moot if the home you buy keeps appreciating in price  since you get to buy with leverage? (A down payment is typically 20% so a  home purchase is leveraged 5:1). In the fastest appreciating housing  markets, this has been true. But buying a single house is like buying a  single stock. The volatility you should expect is going to be much  higher than a diversified stock portfolio. Essentially, any claims made  about predicting future housing returns boil down to momentum based  reasoning vs regression to the mean based reasoning. Either could turn  out to be true, and you shouldn&#x27;t assume that you&#x27;re going to out guess  the market.  And with all those wins you hear about you have to account for survivorship bias. All the people who didn&#x27;t make out so great aren&#x27;t bragging about it. </p><p>Take housing the in the Bay Area for instance.  Apparently more than half of home sales are going to Chinese buyers. If  there is a substantial crack down on the various schemes these buyers  are using to get money out of China, or if a different city becomes a  hotter investment market, or unforeseen things cause this to change, a  lot of speculative money that was piggybacking on this cash flow might  leave. This has happened in other times and places. Indeed, the price  index in some of these super hot markets like SF and Seattle have seen  sharp declines the last few months. You may hand wave this away by  claiming that &#x27;it always comes back&#x27; but that again doesn&#x27;t actually  calculate through how much opportunity cost you are paying by not  pumping money into the market during down turns.</p><p>Another source  of volatility is the inherent linkage between house prices and  employment in the area. By buying a house close to where you are  currently making a high salary (which you would want to since commute  times disproportionately affect happiness) you are making a long term  bet which, if it doesn&#x27;t pan out, will simultaneously leave you without  that high paying job, either forcing you into a long commute or selling  the house and moving to a different city. This is extraordinarily  common. Labor mobility boosts earnings, and it is difficult to account  for this in a calculator, but the younger you are the more wary you  should be of locking yourself out of major career moves that move you  geographically.</p><p>&#x27;But the market is expensive too!&#x27; there are a  couple important points about that. The first is that none of the  typically cited measures that people tout to claim the market is  expensive have historically been very good predictors. Remember, if you  can make a confident prediction about the market you can make gigabucks,  so anyone claiming this who isn&#x27;t sitting on top of a mountain of money  should be considered suspect. Second, let&#x27;s look at three examples of  people trying to time the market. All three people invest at a rate of  $200/mo. Person A has the absolute worst luck in the world and invests  on the eve of all the worst stock market crashes over the last 40 years.  Person B has the best luck in the world and invests exactly at the  bottom of all the crashes. Person C believes it is hard to out predict  the market and just puts some of their savings into the market each  month. Maybe you&#x27;re guessing that person B and C do about the same even  though C&#x27;s strategy is way easier. Nope, it&#x27;s even worse than that.  Person A, the unlucky one wound up with 660k. Person B, the lucky one  made 950k. But Person C, who just plugs $200 in rain or shine  made...1.38 million. What? How is that possible? Person B still misses  out on gains over time by waiting around with cash in hand trying to  time things.</p><p>So let&#x27;s plug this back into the housing situation.  If a mere $200 a month over time in the market generated 1.38  million...well that puts a big damper on the stories of people making  millions from holding a house for a long time. If you were to sit down  and carefully go over the numbers with such happy folk they usually did  worse than they would have putting similar amounts away into the market (people will get very mad at you if you do this).  Again, people who happened to buy into the hottest markets before they  sharply appreciated may have outperformed, but you shouldn&#x27;t expect to  be able to predict that ahead of time.</p><p>Aren&#x27;t I doing the same  thing from the other end by predicting that the stock market will do  well over the next 40 years? It&#x27;s very different because, as mentioned  before, a single house is more like a single stock than it is like a  globally diversified portfolio. When you look at a stock index over the  long term, even things as catastrophic as the World Wars is just a blip.  Betting on the world economy is just a much different bet than betting  on a single house in a single market.</p><p>What about if I do  something clever like buy a big house with my friends? Bigger houses  cost less per room etc. A few problems. Going in on a house with multiple people also means splitting the tax advantages of home ownership. More luxurious homes are subject  to bigger swings in home valuation during downturns than single family  houses since that&#x27;s where most of the demand is. Second, this situation  multiplies the opportunity cost of not being mobile. The chance that at  least some of the people will wind up needing to move sooner than  expected is high. Which leads to the third thing which is that this is a  much bigger hassle to coordinate both immediately and ongoing and it  may end your friendships, which is going to be painful if you are living  together for years.</p><p>What if I time the housing market? This  doesn&#x27;t work for the same reason that timing the stock market doesn&#x27;t  work. Pretend it is right after a crash and you&#x27;re thinking of making an  offer on a house. Where does the down payment come from? You can bet  that lending standards have gone up in a crash and you&#x27;re not going to  get a zero down loan. The money will have to come from your investment  portfolio, which means you&#x27;re pulling money out of the market at the  worst possible time to gamble on a particular house outpacing the  market. This is a bad plan.</p><p>Come on! There has to be some  situations in which buying makes sense! I did manage to find two  situations where you can have a reasonable expectation of coming out  ahead, or at least not doing too badly if things turn south. These  scenarios are still highly reliant on you being sure you want to stay in  a particular spot for at least 10 years, so there&#x27;s opportunity cost  and risk there. 3 Bedroom, 2 bath houses are in highest demand, leaving 2  and 4 bedroom places slightly better deals. If you buy either a 2  bedroom condo and rent the second bedroom to someone reliable, or rent a  3 bed/2 bath with a fourth bedroom converted garage and live in the  converted unit while renting the house to a family, both of these can  pay off while giving you future flexibility to not need to move if  family planning comes along. In either case you just stop renting the  extra room. In the case of the 4 bedroom you&#x27;d start renting the garage  unit when you moved into the house until you needed it as well. If you  want to pull off this strat in a crazy housing market you&#x27;ll still need  to find a good deal and run the numbers yourself. And you&#x27;ll have a  tendency to put your thumb on the scale to get the outcome you want, so  you have to be pretty careful about that. Also, trying to convert a  garage yourself can be a real time and money sink without guarantee of  success due to insane zoning laws, so that kind of setup is rare. Using a  strat similar to this you can stretch to maybe make rent to buy ratios  of 25-30 close to break even i.e. in cities you&#x27;d actually want to live.  The Bay Area is probably still out though unless you want to live far  from your job which is a terrible misery inducing decision.</p><p>&#x27;I  still think I should go in on a house with someone else&#x27;. One of the  reasons the above scenarios work is that they don&#x27;t introduce the  complications of multiple stake holders. Having renters vs owners means  the friction is relatively low if (more like when) things change. </p><p> Gambling on hot housing markets isn&#x27;t a free lunch. It takes up a lot  of your time (both before and after the purchase) and encourages poor  emotionally driven decisions. And then it exposes you to a bunch of  politics that will further degrade your quality of life as you now have a  huge proportion of your net worth tied up in this scheme. The realtor  market is oriented around juicing whatever misconceptions you have that  will encourage you to buy whatever you can afford, and the politics  around trying to force homes to be &#x27;good investments&#x27; are toxic.</p><p> Okay so this is a lot of doom and gloom. Gee thanks, Romeo. Well, the  reason I went to the trouble of writing all this is because there&#x27;s a  massive upside to being aware of these issues. And that&#x27;s freedom from  worrying that renting is bad! This pays huge dividends over time as you  don&#x27;t need to ever worry about locking anything down. Combine with  having few enough belongings that moving is no longer a huge chore and  the ability to move once every few years becomes a real boost not only  to your career potential but also to not calcifying into routines that  make your life seem shorter and less varied.</p><p><a href=\"https://rhsfinancial.com/2019/06/rent_vs_buy/\">https://rhsfinancial.com/2019/06/rent_vs_buy/</a></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I’ve finally uploaded to arXiv our work on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09624\">inferring human biases alongside IRL</a>, which was published at ICML 2019.</p><h3>Summary of the paper</h3><h4>The IRL Debate</h4><p>Here’s a quick tour of the debate about inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and cognitive biases, featuring many of the ideas from the first chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc\">Value Learning sequence</a>:</p><br/><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PVNUjyA.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:68%\" /></figure></span><br/><p>I had the intuition that the impossibility theorem was like the other no-free-lunch theorems in ML: not actually relevant for what ML could do in practice. So we tried to learn and correct for systematic biases in IRL.</p><h4>The idea behind the algorithms</h4><p>The basic idea was to learn the <em>planning algorithm</em> by which the human produces demonstrations, and try to ensure that the planning algorithm captured the appropriate systematic biases. We used a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02867\">Value Iteration Network</a> to give an inductive bias towards “planners” but otherwise did not assume anything about the form of the systematic bias. <a href=\"about:blank#fn-n46XtqJFrGbsixmwk-1\">[1]</a> Then, we could perform IRL by figuring out which reward would cause the planning algorithm to output the given demonstrations. The reward would be “debiased” because the effect of the biases on the policy would already be accounted for in the planning algorithm.</p><p>How could we learn the planning algorithm? Well, one baseline method is to assume that we have access to some tasks where the <em>rewards are known</em>, and use those tasks to learn what the planning algorithm is. Then, once that is learned, we can infer the rewards for new tasks that we haven’t seen before. This requires the planner to generalize across tasks.</p><p>However, it’s kind of cheating to assume access to ground truth rewards, since we usually wouldn’t have them. What if we learned the planning algorithm and rewards simultaneously? Well, the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812\">no-free-lunch theorem</a> gets us then: maximizing the true reward and minimizing the negative of the true reward would lead to the same policy, and so you can’t distinguish between them, and so the output of your IRL algorithm could be the true reward or the <em>negative</em> of the true reward. It would be really bad if our IRL algorithm said exactly the opposite of what we want. But surely we can at least assume that humans are not expected utility <em>minimizers</em> in order to eliminate this possibility.</p><p>So, we make the assumption that the human is “near-optimal”. We initialize the planning algorithm to be optimal, and then optimize for a planning algorithm that is “near” the optimal planner, in gradient-descent-space, that combined with the (learned) reward function explains the demonstrations. You might think that a minimizer is in fact “near” a maximizer; empirically this didn’t turn out to be the case, but I don’t have a particularly compelling reason why that happened.</p><h4>Results</h4><p>Here’s the graph from our paper, showing the performance of various algorithms on some simulated human biases (higher = better). Both of our algorithms get access to the simulated human policies on multiple tasks. Algorithm 1 is the one that gets access to ground-truth rewards for some tasks, while Algorithm 2 is the one that instead tries to ensure that the learned planner is “near” the optimal planner. “Boltzmann” and “Optimal” mean that the algorithm assumes that the human is <a href=\"https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-227.pdf\">Boltzmann rational</a> and optimal respectively.</p><br/><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UeyHPHY.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\" /></figure></span><br/><p>Our algorithms work better on average, mostly by being robust to the specific kind of bias that the demonstrator had -- they tend to perform on par with the better of the Boltzmann and Optimal baseline algorithms. Surprisingly (to me), the second algorithm sometimes outperforms the first, even though the first algorithm has access to more data (since it gets access to the ground truth rewards in some tasks). This could be because it exploits the assumption that the demonstrator is near-optimal, which the first algorithm doesn&#x27;t do, even though the assumption is correct for most of the models we test. On the other hand, maybe it’s just random noise.</p><h3>Implications</h3><h4>Superintelligent AI alignment</h4><p>The most obvious way that this is relevant to AI alignment is that it is progress on <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN\">ambitious value learning</a>, where we try to learn a utility function that encodes all of human values.</p><p>“But wait,&#x27;&#x27; you say, “didn’t you <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc\">argue</a> that ambitious value learning is unlikely to work?”</p><p>Well, yes. At the time that I was doing this work, I believed that ambitious value learning was <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/TE5nJ882s5dCMkBB8\">the only option</a>, and seemed hard but not doomed. This was the obvious thing to do to try and advance it. But this was over a year ago, the reason it’s only now coming out is that it took a while to publish the paper. (In fact, it predates my <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/7f6DNZhracD7RvxMr/learning-preferences-by-looking-at-the-world\">state of the world</a> work.) But it’s true that <em>now</em> I’m not very hopeful about ambitious value learning, and so this paper’s contribution towards it doesn’t seem particularly valuable to me. However, a few others remain optimistic about ambitious value learning, and if they’re right, this research might be useful for that pathway to aligned AI.</p><p>I do think that the paper contributes to narrow value learning, and I still think that this very plausibly will be relevant to AI alignment. It’s a particularly direct attack on the specification problem, with the goal of inferring a specification that leads to a policy that would outperform the demonstrator. That said, I am no longer very optimistic about approaches that require a specific structure (in this case, world models fed into a differentiable planner with an inductive bias that then produces actions), and I am also less optimistic about using approaches that try to mimic expected value calculations, rather than trying to do something more like norm inference.</p><p>(However, I still expect that the impossibility result in preference learning will only be a problem in theory, not in practice. It’s just that this particular method of dealing with it doesn’t seem like it will work.)</p><h4>Near-term AI issues</h4><p>In the near term, we will need better ways than reward functions to specify the behavior that we want to an AI system. Inverse reinforcement learning is probably the leading example of how we could do this. However, since the specific algorithms require much better differentiable planners before they will perform on par with existing algorithms, it may be some time before they are useful. In addition, it’s probably better to use specific bias models in the near term. Overall, I think these methods or ideas are about as likely to be used in the near term as the average paper (which is to say, not very likely).</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><ol><li>A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02867\">Value Iteration Network</a> is a fully differentiable neural network that embeds an approximate value iteration algorithm inside a feed-forward classification network. <a href=\"about:blank#fnref-n46XtqJFrGbsixmwk-1\">↩︎</a><br/> </li></ol>",

    "htmlBody": "<br/><p>I’m currently going through Nate’s series on caring. He starts with the issue of listless guilt. First post is about the stamp collector, the second one is about allowing yourself to fight for something.</p><p>I want to log my thoughts on this, because it seems that there’s enough to chew on here.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>First, a bit on the stamp collector.</p><p>I agree with the general message. It’s true, people aren’t optimized solely for pleasure-seeking. There are other things. Evolutionary psychology has a sufficient enough explanation, I believe. The heuristic “people are ultimately hedonists” is simply wrong, its predictive power is weak.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>Now, about the second post.</p><p>Yes, you can care about things in the world. You can only access it through your map, but this doesn’t postulate wireheading as the final goal.</p><p>I, too, think that the word “want” is loaded. Let’s dissect.</p><p>People are embedded in their environments. Their motivational systems are complex. There’s the primal “draw” towards certain things, and it’s mediated by different aspects of motivational systems. For example, it’s generally easier to feel this primal “draw” towards concrete things, which impinge on our senses (let’s not talk PP here).</p><p>But we also can use our executive functions in tandem with the ebb-and-flow of our primal motivations. You can “force” yourself to start working on something, and the short bursts of reinforcement for achieving measurable (micro-)milestones will do the rest.</p><p>What’s important though is the link between the “forceful” and the “primal”, S2 and S1. There’s only so much you can realistically do purely through S2 control. Usually it’s both S2 and S1 that affect your productivity.</p><p>(correct me if I’m wrong here; it might be possible to run on S2 for a long time, but I believe that at some point your local productivity will tank so hard it won’t be worth to continue anymore; furthermore, if you try to abuse your S1 with S2 in this way for longer periods of time, S1 will start resisting, and you’ll probably burn out and\\or ruin the rest of your life; alright, I just stated a bunch of obvious, but potentially important stuff to someone who haven&#x27;t thought about it before; you might be one of them, and if you are, here&#x27;s your insight: you don&#x27;t actually need motivation to do stuff, thanks to your S2. go now, try it.)</p><br/><p>I think it’s important to also tell yourself that you’re allowed to care about external world for selfish reasons, too, and actually change the world! It’s something that comes with the understanding that “people are ultimately hedonists” is too weak, and pure pleasure isn’t the terminal value, because it simply doesn’t work. Soares mentions that true selfishness doesn’t lead to the listless guilt, and he’s correct. The people who connect “selfishness” to “root of my mild depression” are using a shallow conception of selfishness, shallow in the sense of “it’s a shitty model, wake up!”.</p><p>(for those who start screaming “<em>wireheading!</em>” — sure, but it doesn’t exist yet, so don’t make decisions based on stupid thought experiments, more on this later)</p><br/><p>Then Soares gives us this thought experiment. Read through it, if you want to refresh your memory.</p><p><em>Imagine you live alone in the woods, having forsaken civilization when the Unethical Psychologist Authoritarians came to power a few years back.</em></p><p><em>Your only companion is your dog, twelve years old, who you raised from a puppy. (If you have a pet or have ever had a pet, use them instead.)</em></p><p><em>You&#x27;re aware of the fact that humans have figured out how to do some pretty impressive perception modification (which is part of what allowed the Unethical Psychologist Authoritarians to come to power).</em></p><p><em>One day, a psychologist comes to you and offers you a deal. They&#x27;d like to take your dog out back and shoot it. If you let them do so, they&#x27;ll clean things up, erase your memories of this conversation, and then alter your perceptions such that you perceive exactly what you would have if they hadn&#x27;t shot your dog. (Don&#x27;t worry, they&#x27;ll also have people track you and alter the perceptions of anyone else who would see the dog, so that they also see the dog, so that you won&#x27;t seem crazy. And they&#x27;ll remove that fact from your mind, so you don&#x27;t worry about being tracked.)</em></p><p><em>In return, they&#x27;ll give you a dollar.</em></p><br/><p>Most people reject it! Their gut feeling screams “DOGGIE DIES” and they refuse.</p><p>I say, they’re probably not being consequentialist enough.</p><p>Imagine you took the offer. How is the world different now?</p><p>You try to touch the dog. Presumably, the correct neurons get activated, and you feel the gentle brush of its hair on your hand. You can’t move your hand any further than the presumed physical location of the dog allows, because the unethical-but-smart psychologists somehow <em>magically</em> have your inhibitory system under control, and they’ve calculated the density of the relevant part of the dog, so you feel more or less the right amount of pushback.</p><p>Does the dog run around like a real dog, barking loudly and chasing squirrels? Well, of course! The unethical-but-smart psychologists did everything to ensure that any difference in perceived dog’s behavior is so small it’s unnoticeable to the human eye, so there’s nothing uncanny about this happy, but not <em>truly</em> real creature.</p><p>If we can’t find any significant consequences in your routine interactions with the dog, what about everything else? How do the evil psychologists actually make this happen? What kind of horrible voodoo artifact would it take to control not only your perception, but perceptions of everyone else?</p><br/><p>One might say: <em>but you can’t use the dog’s bones in order to dig its grave, because only your perceptions get controlled</em>. That’s true. Your perception of “digging a hole” might be altered, but you won’t be able to actually dig a hole, because perceptions aren’t spades.</p><p>Now, what if you try to dig a hole with the poor dog’s bones, and an actual hole appears? You try putting your hand inside, and nothing pushes back. It’s a real hole.</p><p>Congratulations, the unethical-but-smart psychologists created an instrument that allows them to rewrite reality in whichever way they want, in a fine-grained and very precise way, too! You spill the dog&#x27;s guts? Yep, here they are, fitting right into the hole you dug out. You feed the dog cheap canned food and it poops it out. (It&#x27;s even better if it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d buy a genetically modified pet that doesn&#x27;t shit everywhere. &quot;<em>But it&#x27;s important that my dog poops, because I care about reality</em>!&quot; Oh my god, it must also be important to you that humans suffer and die, because you care about reality. Naturalistic fallacy much?) Everything works as it&#x27;s supposed to.</p><p>Do you still think that taking a dollar is the wrong choice, even though literally nothing changes afterwards? If you do, do you think it’s a rational choice? Or is your S1 deluding you?</p><br/><p>You don’t care about minimal differences. If the atoms of what constitutes the dog are a bit lacking, so what? It doesn’t necessarily matter and you know it. If you ever shaved your dog, you altered the constitution of its atoms by a great amount, probably several times. If the dog in fact does act a bit differently, but it impossible to detect with the human eye, so what?</p><p>“<em>But the dog isn’t actually a dog, it’s some whacko mechanism that impinges on my senses and makes me see a dog!</em>” Yes! The real dog isn’t actually a dog either way, it’s particles that impinge on your senses and make you see a dog! Oh wait...</p><p>If there are no real consequences that make a real difference, then you should take the offer. Maybe the voodoo artifact of the evil psychologists is, in fact, very unstable, and you want to destroy it before it destroys everything else, but let’s leave it to sci-fi authors, shall we?</p><p>It might be a rational choice to refuse the offer, but only if the bad consequences of the choice outweigh the good ones. If I’m confident that taking the offer and getting the dog shot will lead to a better world, I will do it. Did you flinch? Great! Now shut up and multiply.</p><br/><p>I used the words “<em>truly</em> real”. The dog doesn’t matter, the consequences of the phenomenon that you call “dog” matter. “Real” is just a heuristic, and a useful one at that, because the world is complex and artificial interference can easily become misguided and lead to disastrous consequences, if applied to larger scale phenomena.</p><p>Anyway, what am I getting at? The fact that you chose to refuse the offer, if you did, doesn’t necessarily mean that you care about reality. If it’s true that nothing of importance is changed in the world after your dog gets shot, then your feelings deceive you. If you say that miniscule differences matter to you, and that even microscopic alterations in the “natural” behavior of dog matter in themselves, then you’re either a liar or a fool. Fight me.</p><p>But if you refuse the offer because you think that “real” is a good heuristic, and you don’t have enough evidence to trust the damned psychologists, then I applaud you.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>I’m sure that there are certain people who were also left dissatisfied with the thought experiment and went “<em>meh, I’m still right after all</em>”.</p><p>If you’re one of them, you’re <u>wrong</u>.</p><p>Not in your analysis, but in the way you model reality. No, heroin isn’t all you need, you know how most actual, real people who go this route end up. No, wireheading isn’t all you need, because you live in a world that doesn’t have it, and probably won’t have it until you die.</p><p>Yes, I’m leading you to a pretty obvious conclusion.</p><p>Here it is.</p><br/><p><u>STOP MAKING STUPID INFERENCES FROM DUMB THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS.</u></p><p>Orient yourself to reality.</p><p>Look.</p><br/><p>When you conduct a thought experiment, you create a very rough, simplified, tiny model of some part of existence, and then struggle to update on the fake evidence that you’re getting. And you can succeed! And it’s gonna be awful and horrible and bad!</p><p>Thought experiments <em>can</em> be useful, but you need to know exactly what you are getting yourself into, and how exactly to interpret the evidence you’re getting from them, and what exact hypotheses they are supporting. Don’t fall prey to folk psychology.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>Let’s get back to selfishness. Selfishness is definitely not hedonism, not in the strict sense of the word. In order to learn what selfishness is, you need to study <em>humans</em>, not philosophy. And if you do, you’ll find out that a bunch of stuff matters: our aliefs, other humans, sex, prestige, et cetera. And then there’s you, a unique individual with a given set of traits and abilities. And they’re malleable, at least in principle, because neuroplasticity. And there’s your environment that’s variously suited (or not) to your traits and abilities. Learn! Learn and flourish!</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>Soares is correct in advising you to search your memory for motivating material.<br/>Memory reconsolidation served you well and gave you almost perfect, clean, censored memories of the good stuff.</p><p>“<em>Wait, you’re saying it’s not real, is it?</em>”</p><p>Yes! Or no! So what! Who cares! You’re a human, act in ways which are suited to humans, don’t follow some dry, abstract idea. If the memory keeps you moving, then it has served its purpose already. Keep in mind that reality can be different from how you remember it, but also remember (ha!) that without change there won’t be change. Prepare yourself for the journey and go exploring!</p><p>“<em>But which one to pick?</em>”</p><p>Who cares? Satisfice if you can! You want to launch yourself into the world and get destroyed by it, in order to get reborn and become stronger, like a phoenix.</p><br/><p>Nate is also right in saying that you won’t get rid of the listlessness after merely daydreaming for a while. That’s not how humans work, obviously. But it’s a start.</p><p>Motivation, desire won’t just appear in front of you in a puff of smoke, it’s born out of S1 crashing into experience. And what a coincidence! Our Inner Sim can generate experience on spot! You&#x27;ll need ways to keep the flame alive, though.</p><p>Maybe Nate knew all this already. Maybe he decided to be superrational and shuffle his arguments in order to convince you. I don’t know.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>I’m offering you the Hard Way out.</p><p>You’ll probably struggle with inner conflicts a lot more if you follow this Way.</p><p>Keep chipping away at them and you’ll get rewarded by better, stronger models, which won’t get broken by reality.</p><p>You know why? Because they will complete it.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<br/><p>In <em>Rhetoric</em>, Aristotle said that in an argument, “...if the decisions of judges are not what they ought to be, the defeat must be due to the speakers themselves… the underlying facts do not lend themselves equally well to the contrary views. No; things that are true and things that are better are, by their nature, practically always easier to prove and easier to believe in.” Yet we might argue most about those rare topics where we do encounter difficulties in proving or believing what’s true or best; perhaps the operative word in the quote is <em>practically</em>. To capture the hero’s journey quality of inquiry, let’s call these exceptional cases <em>epistemic dragons</em>. We have to deal with more research than ever before, which constantly pushes the boundaries of what is proven or believable and spawns epistemic dragons at a historically extraordinary rate.</p><p>Although we can take a sociological or anthropological view of the scientific, media, and political industries that generate so many of these epistemic dragons, each worker in these industries is an individual jonesing for truth. Alfréd Rényi said, &quot;a mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems,&quot; but all our industry has not yet devised a way to mass-produce standardized rational minds, although we are trying.</p><p>It’s best practice to base beliefs on the preponderance of evidence, especially controlled and well-replicated experiments that look at a problem from many angles. That’s the paved road through safe territory. A science progresses faster when its frontiers can be expanded that way, but this is often not possible. Science should converge at a border drawn precisely at the point where lie the limits of our ability to conduct controlled experiments. <em>Here be dragons</em>.</p><p>Adventures in this dangerous territory aren’t often motivated by the pure desire to consume an entire body of subject literature for its own sake. Our human values, a puzzle-solving itch, intellectual wanderlust, or industrial and professional objectives often lead to a study that is of necessity rather shallow, amateurish, and interdisciplinary. Various broad forms of consensus, logical solutions and storytelling based on descriptive models, direct perception, forecasts and prices, and durability over time are some of the instruments we navigate by.</p><p>I want to shift gears for a minute and talk about what it’s like to read. When I was little, my parents read to me, and the experience was, for a time, closer to music than to storytelling. That is still with me. I find it mysterious how my brain assembles an intellectual structure from that music. Sometimes my brain feels “warm” when I have just been writing or engrossed in reading, and I wonder whether that’s my subconscious working, a sort of afterglow, or an illusion of thought that is perhaps the origin of overconfidence.</p><p>Why does this epistemological phenomenology matter? The important, tractable, neglected framework is a neat conceptual compass that points toward areas of thought and action where we have the chance to be pioneers. That means striking out for novel and therefore risky areas of thought and action that have been subjected to only the most minimal tests, perhaps with little consensus or public awareness, fragile and incomplete models, contested forecasting data. I’m not the first to say that those who profited most from the Oregon Trail or the Klondike Gold Rush were probably the people selling equipment, sustenance, and navigational tools to settlers and miners. If a thing is important and tractable, why is it neglected - and will it remain that way long enough for me to cash in? History, our intellectual predecessors (Aristotle), and the logic of markets all scream for suspicion about claims for free money, easy impact, hidden truths with magic power. We should not let arrogant overconfidence about our own abilities make us naïve, but in our fear of naïveté, we can start to give excessive attention to our inner voice of paranoid intellectual conservatism. This generates a certain form of qualia that inhibits an acceptance of the calculated gamble required to undertake innovative work. I think acknowledging that dynamic and learning to cope with it is important for rationalists.</p><p>Scott Alexander wrote a thoughtful essay about “epistemological learned helplessness,” which prompted this reflection. He concluded that on some topics with a mainstream scholarly consensus and a range of incompatible but compelling fringe theories, an intelligent amateur reader will never be able to resolve the debate for themselves, and might do best to rigidly adhere to the mainstream interpretation. “Learned helplessness” evokes an image of our minds restrained and hunkered down like a demoralized dog in a cruel experiment. I think of it instead as savvy shopping in the intellectual marketplace. Self-made instruments have a tendency to fail unexpectedly.</p><p>In Alexander’s essay “What Developmental Milestones are You Missing?,” he lists several such milestones in the development of our mental operations<strong>.</strong> I would add two more.</p><ol><li><strong>A theory of appropriate common practices for furthering an argument</strong> so that we can at least be conscious when we see them. Reading should not only be a way to discover new parts of the intellectual jungle, but also an opportunity to increase our sophistication as navigators. Once I made my list of tests, I started to see them every time I opened a book, which changed the way I read. It’s like learning to see a pin or fork in chess.</li><li><strong>An effort to distinguish thinking from pseudocognitive qualia</strong> - investment advice for beginners points out how the ups and downs of the market make investors overexcited or scared, and warns them against making bad decisions based on a gut reaction. Maybe rationalists should take a leaf out of that book.</li></ol><p>My intuition tells me that these two milestones are sources of creativity, helping us to form a response to the text and join with the thought of the author, rather than being charmed into sleep by the music or disconnecting from it in a fit of paranoia. When I look at the bookshelves in my office, I see a noisy marketplace where the vendors of infinitely recursive maps are hawking their wares, and I feel the wanderlust, that pseudocognitive qualia, come over me. I notice that dwelling on qualia has a gravitational pull that is somewhat embarrassing, and I don’t want to expose myself too much or appear too human. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent?</p><p>I am left wondering whether there is a productive way to reflect on qualia associated with cognition in a way that leads to general principles, and what other non-experimental test categories I’m forgetting.</p>",

But it proved decisive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obligatory reference to AlphaGo. Could have mentioned AlphaZero, but it was not nearly as popular as AlphaGo.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While Elon Musk and Bill Gates maunder on about AI nightmare scenarios—self-replication, the singularity—the smartest critics recognize that the immediate threat these machines pose is not existential but epistemological.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By \"immediate\" means \"now\". Reasonable. AI apocalypse is not scheduled until perhaps 100 years later.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Noah Harari has argued that the religion of “Dataism” will soon undermine the foundations of liberalism. “Just as according to Christianity we humans cannot understand God and His plan,” he writes, “so Dataism declares that the human brain cannot fathom the new master algorithms.”... Our role as humans is not to question the algorithmic logic but to submit to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Dataism\" does not necessarily undermine liberalism. It is possible to augment human thought to keep up with the data deluge, and preserve (trans)human liberalism. Although this is not guaranteed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Job assumes the role of a prosecuting attorney and demands a cosmic explanation for his suffering. God dutifully appears in court, but only to humiliate Job with a display of divine supremacy. <em>Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?</em> he thunders, then poses a litany of questions that no human can possibly answer. Job is so flummoxed, he denounces his own ability to reason. “Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand,” he says, “Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem of Theodicy is amusing. And the trials of God can be total dark humor. My favorite is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a concentration camp, one evening after work, a rabbi called together three of his colleagues and convoked a special court. Standing with his head held high before them, he spoke as follows: “I intend to convict God of murder, for he is destroying his people and the law he gave to them ... I have irrefutable proof in my hands. Judge without fear or sorrow or prejudice. Whatever you have to lose has long since been taken away.” The trial proceeded in due legal form, with witnesses for both sides with pleas and deliberations. The unanimous verdict: “Guilty.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Back to the essay.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Throughout the Middle Ages, Christians viewed him in quite a different light. Theology was still inflected with Platonism and rested on the premise that both God and the natural world were comprehensible to human reason. “All things among themselves possess an order, and this is the form that makes the universe like God,”... It wasn’t until the fourteenth century that theologians began to argue that God was not limited by rational laws; he was free to command whatever he wanted, and whatever he decreed became virtuous simply because he decreed it. This new doctrine, nominalism, reached its apotheosis in the work of the Reformers. Like Calvin, Martin Luther believed that God’s will was incomprehensible. Divine justice, he wrote, is “entirely alien to ourselves.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do think that if a God made this world, then yes, They are clearly entirely alien and probably more interested in quantum mechanics than justice. Also, one should note that the Reformation probably didn't help or suppress science. See <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/550454a\"><em>History: Science and the Reformation</em>\n(David Wootton, 2017)</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I often felt myself to be an ant in a network of vast global structures—the market, technology—that exceeded my powers of comprehension. To my mind, even contemporary physics (the little I’d read), with its hypotheses on multiverses and other dimensions, echoed Calvin’s view that our bodies were faulty instruments ill-equipped to understand the absolute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No need to invoke the more speculative parts. Just the verified Standard Model is strange enough. Or the endless technology stacks in the electronics...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The same year he received his sentence, a ProPublica report found that the software was far more likely to incorrectly assign higher recidivism rates to black defendants than to white defendants. The algorithm suffers from a problem that has become increasingly common in these models—and that is, in fact, inherent to them. Because the algorithms are trained on historical data (for example, past court decisions), their outcomes often reflect human biases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Two problems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many standards of statistical fairness, and they are incompatible. COMPAS is unfair in one statistical sense but (almost) fair in another statistical sense. The <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/a-tutorial-on-fairness-in-machine-learning-3ff8ba1040cb\">reason is extremely simple and involves base rate</a>.</li>\n<li>Essentially, the charges of unfairness boils down to \"Base rates (Blacks recide more than Whites) are biases, and biases are morally wrong.\"</li>\n<li>Human judges do \"training on historical data\" too, and call it \"common law\". From what I know, English law is a giant tarball of history and really hard to change, just like an old code base. Despite this, it's still used and has been defended for centuries as really good for some reasons. I wonder if the defences of the case law system could be used against the author?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From what I've observed, \"bias\" and \"prior\" are distinguished entirely by moral judgments. \"Bias\" is immoral base rate belief. \"Prior\" is moral. As such, whether a prior is thought as \"bias\" or \"prior\" can easily be manipulated by framing a base rate belief in moral language.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://cct.biola.edu/riding-moral-elephant-review-jonathan-haidts-righteous-mind/\">research by Haidt</a>, moral feelings are 6 kinds:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Care / Harm</li>\n<li>Fairness / Cheating</li>\n<li>Liberty / Oppression</li>\n<li>Loyalty / Betrayal</li>\n<li>Authority / Subversion</li>\n<li>Sanctity / Degradation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the distinction between \"bias\" and \"prior\", the most relevant kinds are the first three. For example, the persistent denial of the effectiveness of IQ tests is motivated reasoning, based on moral rejection about how it could be used to justify <em>oppression</em> of low-IQ people, <em>unfairly</em> allowing high-IQ children to get into elite schools, and cause <em>harm</em> of many kinds. By this moral tainting, any prior based on IQ test results becomes immoral prior, thus \"bias\".</p>\n<p>For more on the moralization of base rate beliefs, see for example <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7475.full\"><em>The base rate principle and the fairness principle in social judgment</em> (J Cao, MR Banaji, 2016)</a> and <em>The Psychology of the Unthinkable</em> (Tetlock et al, 2000).</p>\n<p>Or just contemplate how strange it is that sexual orientation is not discrimination, but friendship orientation might be. I can only be friends with females, and a male acquaintance (who really wants to be my friend) once wondered if that's discrimination.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some have developed new methods that work in reverse to suss out data points that may have triggered the machine’s decisions. But these explanations are, at best, intelligent guesses. (Sam Ritchie, a former software engineer at Stripe, prefers the term narratives, since the explanations are not a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm’s decision-making process but a hypothesis about reasoning tactics it may have used.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A toy example is how WolframAlpha manages to show you how to solve an integral \"step by step\". What it actually does is to internally use a general algorithm that's too hard for humans to understand, then <em>separately</em> use an expert system that looks at the result and the problem, and try to make up a chain of integration tricks that a human could probably have thought up.</p>\n<p>Humans are also prone to such guessing. When they introspect their decision process, they might say that they simply knew how they arrived at the decision, but in reality they are trying to infer it using folk theories of psychology. This is the lesson from <a href=\"http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Nisbett_%26_Wilson_%281977%29\">(Nisbett, 1977)</a> or <a href=\"https://theschoolofme.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/on-the-unbearable-automaticity-of-being/\"><em>The unbearable automaticity of being</em> (Bargh &amp; Chartrand, 1999)</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As Yuval Noah Harari points out in his book <em>Homo Deus</em>, humanism has always rested on the premise that people know what’s best for themselves and can make rational decisions about their lives by listening to their “inner voice.” If we decide that algorithms are better than we are at predicting our own desires, it will compromise not only our autonomy but also the larger assumption that individual feelings and convictions are the ultimate source of truth. ... “Whereas humanism commanded: ‘Listen to your feelings!’” Harari argues, “Dataism now commands: ‘Listen to the algorithms! They know how you feel.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The inner voice, as noted above, is a social voice. It exists to explain the actions of a human to other humans. It does not perceive accurately. An asocial species probably has no inner voice, for there is no benefit of evolving that.</p>\n<p>If this Dataism prediction comes to pass, then the inner voice would simply come from the outside. Like, I would think, \"What do I like to do today?\" [datastream comes from some hidden decision module located somewhere overseas] \"Oh yes, write an essay!\"</p>\n<p>Instead of experiencing a kind of \"me listening to the clever robot\", it would be like \"me listening to me\", except the \"me\" would be weird and spill outside the skull.</p>\n<p>The effect would be the same, but the first raises the moral alarm: it has the potential to become immoral by the \"Liberty / Oppression\" rule.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kaczynski argues [in Unabomber Manifesto] that the common sci-fi scenarios of machine rebellion are off base; rather, humans will slowly drift into a dependence on machines, giving over power bit by bit in gradual acquiescence. “As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent,” he predicts, “people will let machines make more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kaczynski writes with the precision of a mathematician (he did complex analysis back in school), and his manifesto sets out his primitive humanist philosophy clearly.</p>\n<p>This vision seems unlikely to me, simply because it is too benign. People might adapt and survive, but I doubt they would be humans. I believe the future is vomittingly strange.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kurzweil, who is now a director of engineering at Google, claims he agrees with much of Kaczynski’s manifesto but that he parts ways with him in one crucial area. While Kaczynski feared these technologies were not worth the gamble, Kurzweil believes they are: “Although the risks are quite real, my fundamental belief is that the potential gains are worth the risk.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Science, as Fromm said, cannot give humanity the sense of meaning it ultimately craves. He believed that ethical and moral systems must be rooted in human nature and human interests, and that science, which searches for objective reality, is merely a way of evading this responsibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a third way. Science can reveal what humans feel as meaningful, and using that, meaning can be mass-produced at an affordable price. Positive psychology, for example, has shown that there are three cores of the feeling of meaning <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2015.1137623\">(F Martela, MF Steger, 2016)</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coherence: is what I observe about the world understandable?</li>\n<li>Purpose: is there a valued and clearly defined goal for the world and me?</li>\n<li>Significance: can I make a difference in achieving that goal?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It has also, incidentally, found that people feel like their life is pretty meaningful <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-03265-001\">(SJ Heintzelman, LA King, 2014)</a>.</p>\n<p>The problem of \"Yes, it is the feeling of meaning, but is it <em>really</em> meaning?\" is not of practical significance. Presumably humans, by their habit of self-denial (they hate to become predictable, even to themselves), would rebel against guaranteed meaning if they recognize it. That appears unlikely (most people welcome guaranteed health and shelter as a <em>human right</em>), but if it does happen, the meaning manufacturing industry can simply become invisible and employ artists who subscribe to existentialism (meaning can only be constructed).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a truly humanistic faith demands a deity with such limits. This doctrine requires that humans relinquish their need for certainty—and for an intelligence who can provide definitive answers—and instead accept life as an irreducible mystery. If science persists in its quest for superintelligence, it might learn much from this tradition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Typical of these essays to insert a meaningful conclusion at the end. It does not occur to the author that they could also accept the algorithms as irreducible mysteries.</p>\n<p>I prefer posthumanism. I do not have much sympathy with humanists' rigid attempts to circumscribe what is human, anyway. If I somehow end up becoming posthuman, okay.</p>\n</body></html>",

If someone pretends not to see that, that&#x27;s terrible news about their ability or willingness to help detect deception.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: But then the indignation is misplaced. Suppose Jer is talking with Horaha, trying to persuade him that their mutual acquaintance Narmer is behaving deceptively. Jer indignantly points out a blatant lie Narmer told. The proper target of the extra indignation due to blatancy is Horaha, not Narmer.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Who said otherwise?</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: Come on, you know that people get extra-indignant <em>at the liar</em> about blatant lies, despite your so far unsubstantiated claim that they are the best kind.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Sure, people make that mistake. People also yell at their friends because a stranger was mean to them earlier in the day or because they stubbed their toe. I never claimed - OK, it&#x27;s helpful of you to point out that people make this mistake, but still, there is a good reason for indignation here, and understanding its proper target might help us avoid this kind of slippage.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: So, why is blatant lying the best kind? Is it because it&#x27;s purer somehow?</p><p><strong>Olga</strong>: Hold on, you two, you&#x27;ve skipped over something.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: What&#x27;s that?</p><p><strong>Olga</strong>: Sometimes Horaha and Narmer are the same person - sometimes the liar is the person we&#x27;re trying to point out the lie to. Let&#x27;s call the liar in the composite situation Menes.</p><p>Jer might be uncertain about Menes&#x27;s true intentions. Menes might have an unexamined tendency to lie about something, but might - if this is drawn to his attention - reflect on what&#x27;s going on, and what he&#x27;s trying to accomplish.</p><p>When Menes says something to Jer - for instance, that<a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/everybody-knows/\"> everybody knows</a> we don&#x27;t have true freedom of speech - Jer might want to point Menes&#x27;s attention to the fact that he just said something that he already knows not to be true.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: So, if it&#x27;s meant to be helpful, why the anger?</p><p><strong>Olga</strong>: Part of how we ask for more attention is by expressing excitement - and excitement about wrongness can easily turn out like indignation. If Menes treats this as an important problem,<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PCfaLLtuxes6Jk4S2/fighting-a-rearguard-action-against-the-truth\"> halts, melts, and catches fire</a> - then Jer can treat him as a basically friendly collaborator with <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/honesty-and-perjury/\">intent to inform</a> on a level he can reach, even if some surface-level behavior lied. But if Menes digs in and<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PCfaLLtuxes6Jk4S2/fighting-a-rearguard-action-against-the-truth\"> fights a rearguard action against the truth</a>, then Jer has to process the new information: that Menes is behaving like an adversary even after his attention&#x27;s been drawn to that fact. At this point, Jer really should be more angry at Menes (and expressing this anger makes some sense if Jer still has some hope that Menes can be reached).</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: I think I get it. But it still seems like you&#x27;re saying that blatant lying reflects unusually bad intent, not unusually good intent, as far as deception goes.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Olga&#x27;s been assuming agreement on something I think you&#x27;re still missing.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: And what&#x27;s that? It&#x27;s rude and condescending to keep talking around this instead of just telling me what you think I&#x27;m missing. Do you want to feel special because I&#x27;m clueless, or do you want to clue me in?</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: I was going to - never mind, I&#x27;ll just tell you now. You know about<a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/excerpts-from-a-larger-discussion-about-simulacra/\"> simulacrum levels</a>?</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: Vaguely, though I keep losing track of the distinctions between the higher levels, and I wish there were better names for them.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Me too, but maybe this will help. Telling the truth as best you can is simulacrum level 1 - speech is nothing but sharing information. Telling an outright lie is simulacrum level 2 behavior - there&#x27;s a clean distinction within the mind of the liar between the process of understanding what&#x27;s going on, and the process of trying to control others&#x27; beliefs about what&#x27;s going on. The more blatant the lie, the less it raises the intersubjective simulacrum level - the simulacrum level conversations happen at. If you can say, &quot;oops, that was a lie,&quot; and then step back and try to repair things from the root, then you&#x27;re at least not confusing other people about what good thinking looks like.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: What do the higher simulacrum levels look like here?</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Motivated reasoning is level 3. You&#x27;re trying to persuade <em>yourself</em> that the desired state is true, in the usually unconscious hope that this will make it true. Nietzsche said something about this, I think, comparing it to bowling.</p><p><strong>Olga</strong>: Some people throw a bit of their personality after their bad arguments, as if that might straighten their paths and turn them into right and good arguments-just as a man in a bowling alley, after he has let go of the ball, still tries to direct it with gestures.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Yes, that&#x27;s the aphorism I was thinking of.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: And what about lying, and then consciously offering the most persuasive arguments you can for it?</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Then the inside of the liar&#x27;s mind is still an uncorrupted simulacrum level 2.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: Funny calling that uncorrupted.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Well, <a href=\"http://unremediatedgender.space/2016/Nov/new-clothes/\">simulacrum level 3 is worse</a>! If they&#x27;re successful in defending the lie, they&#x27;re also confusing other people about what reasoning looks like. If people&#x27;s idea of argument is based on the kind of point-scoring that happens in a competitive debate or a courtroom, and they model their thinking and discourse after this, then they&#x27;re learning simulacrum level 3 thought patterns, trying to make a thing true by arguing for it, instead of using arguments to try to find out what&#x27;s true.</p><p><strong>Olga</strong>: What about<a href=\"https://www.patheos.com/blogs/unequallyyoked/2012/08/didnt-you-ever-break-on-the-floor.html\"> breaking on the floor</a>?</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Debate societies that really laud and encourage changing your mind are beautiful but rare exceptions.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: And level four?</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: That&#x27;s when arguments are<a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2018/11/17/act-of-charity/\"> just acts</a>, people don&#x27;t bother trying to make their arguments actually persuasive to an honest evaluator, they&#x27;re just performing the behavior &quot;having arguments for your point of view&quot; as the kind of thing that makes their side seem more respectable and impressive to someone who<a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2019/02/25/humans-who-are-not-concentrating-are-not-general-intelligences/\"> isn&#x27;t paying attention</a>. Harry G. Frankfurt&#x27;s monograph <em>On Bullshit</em> is the classic treatment of this.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: But isn&#x27;t blatant lying still especially bad because it makes people think lies are okay, while subtle lying might not discourage honest truth-tellers as much? At least the clueless ones.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: There&#x27;s not actually a norm against lying. There&#x27;s a norm against allowing people to notice that someone is lying. Depending on the power dynamics of the situation, the blame can fall on the liar, or on the person calling them out.</p><p>Honest truth-telling is being protected in the short run by this kind of behavior - but only by exploiting honest truth-tellers for the benefit of people at higher simulacrum levels. It&#x27;s a conspiracy of silence. <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/blackmailers-are-privateers-in-the-war-on-hypocrisy/\">Hypocrisy</a> may, as La Rochefoucauld said, be the tribute vice pays to virtue, but it&#x27;s paid in a currency that&#x27;s only valuable to vice - lip service and empty statements of affiliation.</p><p>We all agree that it&#x27;s upsetting when it seems as though someone&#x27;s lying, but sometimes for exactly opposite reasons. Some people object to the lie, but others are participating in<a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/blame-games/\"> blame games</a>. Simulacrum level 3 players are unhappy that their fantasy that we&#x27;re cooperating is being disrupted. Simulacrum level 4 players are just piling on the current target of the mob, in order not to stick out - or directing the mob at one of their enemies.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: I can see why this was hard for me to understand - it sounds hopeless and awful.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: I don&#x27;t have any systematic solution, but the first step is always to<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uHYYA32CKgKT3FagE/hold-off-on-proposing-solutions\"> discuss the problem</a>.</p><p><strong>Olga</strong>: Actually, this is immediately usable for self-defense. If you want to understand whether someone&#x27;s trying to deceive you, one thing to look for is how indignant they get when their <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QPqm5aj2meRmE7kR8/the-nature-of-offense\">honor is questioned</a>. If they get angry instead of curious, that&#x27;s a bad sign. If they get angrier the more someone tries to explain - at least, if it&#x27;s an honest explanation - that&#x27;s a very bad sign. </p><p>On the other hand, if they try hard to be pinned down, to expose potential flaws in their position - if they actually change their behavior when called out, and try to reward their critics - that&#x27;s golden. Though of course there are fake versions of all of these.</p><p><strong>Mala</strong>: How do I tell the difference?</p><p><strong>Olga</strong>: There&#x27;s no special trick to it; any special trick could be faked. You just have to do it the old-fashioned way. Pay attention to what they&#x27;re actually saying and doing and see if you can make sense of it. See if their stated beliefs are the best explanation for their behavior. Pay attention to your anticipations - not whether you can defend their behavior, but whether it actually seems to make you less confused about what&#x27;s going on.</p><p><strong>Noa</strong>: Or less confused about whether you&#x27;re confused.</p><p><strong>Olga</strong>: No need to go all Socrates on us.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Here's a pattern that shows up again and again in discourse:</p>\n<p>A: This thing that's happening is bad.</p>\n<p>B: Are you saying I'm a bad person for participating in this? How mean of you! I'm not a bad person, I've done X, Y, and Z!</p>\n<p>It isn't always this explicit; I'll discuss more concrete instances in order to clarify. The important thing to realize is that A is pointing at a concrete problem (and likely one that is concretely affecting them), and B is changing the subject to be about B's own self-consciousness. Self-consciousness wants to make everything about itself; when some topic is being discussed that has implications related to people's self-images, the conversation frequently gets redirected to be <em>about</em> these self-images, rather than the concrete issue. Thus, problems don't get discussed or solved; everything is redirected to being about maintaining people's self-images.</p>\n<h2>Tone arguments</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing\">tone argument</a> criticizes an argument not for being incorrect, but for having the wrong tone. Common phrases used in tone arguments are: \"More people would listen to you if...\", \"you should try being more polite\", etc.</p>\n<p>It's clear why tone arguments are epistemically invalid. If someone says X, then X's truth value is independent of their tone, so talking about their tone is changing the subject. (Now, if someone is saying X in a way that breaks epistemic discourse norms, then defending such norms is epistemically sensible; however, tone arguments aren't about epistemic norms, they're about people's feelings).</p>\n<p>Tone arguments are about people protecting their self-images when they or a group they are part of (or a person/group they sympathize with) is criticized. When a tone argument is made, the conversation is no longer about the original topic, it's about how talking about the topic in certain ways makes people feel ashamed/guilty. Tone arguments are a key way self-consciousness makes everything about itself.</p>\n<p>Tone arguments are practically always in bad faith. They aren't made by people trying to help an idea be transmitted to and internalized by more others. They're made by people who want their self-images to be protected. Protecting one's self-image from the truth, by re-directing attention away from the epistemic object level, is acting in bad faith.</p>\n<h2>Self-consciousness in social justice</h2>\n<p>A documented phenomenon in social justice is \"white women's tears\". <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ899418.pdf\">Here's a case study</a> (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A group of student affairs professionals were in a meeting to discuss retention and wellness issues pertaining to a specific racial community on our campus. As the dialogue progressed, <strong>Anita, a woman of color, raised a concern about the lack of support and commitment to this community from Office X</strong> (including lack of measurable diversity training, representation of the community in question within the staff of Office X, etc.), <strong>which caused Susan from Office X, a White woman, to feel uncomfortable. Although Anita reassured Susan that her comments were not directed at her personally, Susan began to cry while responding that she \"felt attacked\".</strong> Susan further added that: she donated her time and efforts to this community, and even served on a local non-profit organization board that worked with this community; she understood discrimination because her family had people of different backgrounds and her closest friends were members of this community; she was committed to diversity as she did diversity training within her office; and the office did not have enough funding for this community's needs at that time.</p>\n<p>Upon seeing this reaction, Anita was confused because although her tone of voice had been firm, she was not angry. From Anita's perspective, the group had come together to address how the student community's needs could be met, which partially meant pointing out current gaps where increased services were necessary. Anita was very clear that she was critiquing Susan's office and not Susan, as Susan could not possibly be solely responsible for the decisions of her office.</p>\n<p><strong>The conversation of the group shifted at the point when Susan started to cry. From that moment, the group did not discuss the actual issue of the student community. Rather, they spent the duration of the meeting consoling Susan, reassuring her that she was not at fault.</strong> Susan calmed down, and publicly thanked Anita for her willingness to be direct, and complimented her passion. <strong>Later that day, Anita was reprimanded for her 'angry tone,' as she discovered that Susan complained about her \"behavior\" to both her own supervisor as well as Anita's supervisor.</strong> Anita was left confused by the mixed messages she received with Susan's compliment, and Susan's subsequent complaint regarding her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The key relevance of this case study is that, while the conversation was originally about the issue of student community needs, it became about Susan's self-image. Susan made everything about her own self-image, ensuring that the actual concrete issue (that her office was not supporting the racial community) was not discussed or solved.</p>\n<h2>Shooting the messenger</h2>\n<p>In addition to crying, Susan also shot the messenger, by complaining about Anita to both her and Anita's supervisors. This makes sense as ego-protective behavior: if she wants to maintain a certain self-image, she wants to discourage being presented with information that challenges it, and also wants to \"one-up\" the person who challenged her self-image, by harming that person's image (so Anita does not end up looking better than Susan does).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_the_messenger\">Shooting the messenger</a> is an ancient tactic, deployed especially by powerful people to silence providers of information that challenges their self-image. Shooting the messenger is asking to be lied to, using force. Obviously, if the powerful person actually wants information, this tactic is counterproductive, hence the standard advice to not shoot the messenger.</p>\n<h2>Self-consciousness as privilege defense</h2>\n<p>It's notable that, in the cases discussed so far, self-consciousness is more often a behavior of the privileged and powerful, rather than the disprivileged and powerless. This, of course, isn't a hard-and-fast rule, but there certainly seems to be a relation. Why is that?</p>\n<p>Part of this is that the less-privileged often <em>can't get away with</em> redirecting conversations by making everything about their self-image. People's sympathies are more often with the privileged.</p>\n<p>Another aspect is that privilege is largely <em>about</em> being rewarded for one's identity, rather than one's works. If you have no privilege, you have to actually do something concretely effective to be rewarded, like cleaning. Whereas, privileged people, almost by definition, get rewarded \"for no reason\" other than their identity.</p>\n<p>Maintenance of a self-image makes less sense as an individual behavior than as a collective behavior. The phenomenon of <a href=\"https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/\">bullshit jobs</a> implies that much of the \"economy\" is <em>performative</em>, rather than about value-creation. While almost everyone can pretend to work, some people are better at it than others. The best people at such pretending are those who look the part, and who maintain the act. That is: privileged people who maintain their self-images, and who tie their self-images to their collective, as Susan did. (And, to the extent that e.g. school \"prepares people for real workplaces\", it trains such behavior.)</p>\n<p>Redirection away from the object level isn't merely about defending self-image; it has the effect of causing issues not to be discussed, and problems not to be solved. Such effects maintain the local power system. And so, power systems encourage people to tie their self-images with the power system, resulting in self-consciousness acting as a defense of the power system.</p>\n<p>Note that, while less-privileged people do often respond negatively to criticism from more-privileged people, such responses are more likely to be based in fear/anger rather than guilt/shame.</p>\n<h2>Stop trying to be a good person</h2>\n<p>At the root of this issue is the desire to maintain a narrative of being a \"good person\". Susan responded to the criticism of her office by listing out reasons why she was a \"good person\" who was against racial discrimination.</p>\n<p>While Anita wasn't actually accusing Susan of racist behavior, it is, empirically, likely that some of Susan's behavior <em>is</em> racist, as implicit racism is pervasive (and, indeed, Susan silenced a woman of color speaking on race). Susan's implicit belief is that there is such a thing as \"not being racist\", and that one gets there by passing some threshold of being nice to marginalized racial groups. But, since racism is a <em>structural</em> issue, it's quite hard to actually stop participating in racism, without going and living in the woods somewhere. In societies with structural racism, ethical behavior requires skillfully and consciously reducing harm <em>given</em> the fact that one is a participant in racism, rather than washing one's hands of the problem.</p>\n<p>What if it isn't actually possible to be \"not racist\" or otherwise \"a good person\", at least on short timescales? What if almost every person's behavior is morally depraved a lot of the time (according to their standards of what behavior makes someone a \"good person\")? What if there are bad things that <em>are</em> your fault? What would be the right thing to do, then?</p>\n<p>Calvinism has a theological doctrine of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_depravity\">total depravity</a>, according to which every person is utterly unable to stop committing evil, to obey God, or to accept salvation when it is offered. While I am not a Calvinist, I appreciate this teaching, because quite a lot of human behavior is simultaneously unethical and hard to stop, and because accepting this can get people to stop chasing the ideal of being a \"good person\".</p>\n<p>If you accept that you are irredeemably evil (with respect to your <em>current</em> idea of a good person), then there is no use in feeling self-conscious or in blocking information coming to you that implies your behavior is harmful. The only thing left to do is to <em>steer in the right direction</em>: make things around you better instead of worse, based on your intrinsically motivating <em>discernment</em> of what is better/worse. Don't try to be a good person, just try to make nicer things happen. And get more foresight, perspective, and cooperation as you go, so you can participate in steering bigger things on longer timescales using more information.</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, in accepting that one is irredeemably evil, one can start accepting information and steering in the right direction, thus developing <em>merit</em>, and becoming a better person, though still not \"good\" in the original sense. (This, I know from personal experience)</p>\n<p>(See also: <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/03/09/4896/\">What's your type: Identity and its Discontents</a>; <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/blame-games/\">Blame games</a>; <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/bad-faith-behavior-not-feeling/\">Bad intent is a disposition, not a feeling</a>)</p>\n</body></html>",

When discussing that paper, or afterwards, we struggled with something Abram Demski <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZDZmopKquzHYPRNxq/selection-vs-control\">clarified recently</a>, which is the difference between selection and control. This matters for formalizing what happens, especially when asking about how Goodhart occurs in specific types of optimizers, as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pcomQ4Fwi7FnfBZBR/how-does-gradient-descent-interact-with-goodhart\">Scott asked recently</a>.</p><p>Epistemic Status: This is for de-confusing myself, and has been helpful. I&apos;m presenting what I am fairly confident I understand well for the content written so far, but I&apos;m unclear about usefulness for others, or how clear it comes across. I think that there&apos;s more to say after this post, and this will have a few more parts if people are interested. (I spent a month getting to this point, and decided to post and get feedback rather than finish a book first.)</p><p>In the first half of the post, I&apos;ll review Abram&apos;s selection/control distinction, and suggest how it relates to actual design. I&apos;ll also argue that there is a bit of a continuum between the two cases, and that we should add an addition extreme case to the typology, direct solution. The second section will revisit what optimization means, and try to note a few different things that could happen and go wrong with Goodhart-like overoptimization. </p><p>The third section will talk about Goodhart in this context using the new understanding - trying to more fully explain why Goodhart effects in selection and control fundamentally differs. After this, Part 4 will revisit Mesa-optimizers, and .</p><h2>Thoughts on how selection and control are used in tandem</h2><p>In this section, I&apos;ll discuss the two types of optimizers Abram discussed; selection, and control, and introduce a third, simpler optimizer, direct solution. I&apos;m also going to mention where embedded agents are different, because that&apos;s closely related to selection versus control, and talk about where mesa-optimizers exist.</p><p>Starting with the (heavily overused) example of rockets, I want to revisit Abram&apos;s categorization of algorithmic optimization versus control. There are several stages involved with getting rockets to go where we want. The first is to design the rocket, which involves optimization, which I&apos;ll discuss in two stages, the second is to test, which involves optimization and control in tandem, and the third is to actually guide the rocket we built in flight, which is purely control. </p><p>Initially, designing  rocket is pure optimization. We might start by building simplified mathematical models to figure out the basic design constraints - if a rocket is bringing people to the moon, we may decide the goal is a rocket and a lander, rather than a single composite. We may decide that certain classes of trajectory / flight paths are going to be used. This is all a set of mathematical exercises, and probably involves only multiply differentiable models that can be directly solved to find an optimum. This is in many ways a third category of &quot;optimizing,&quot; in Abram&apos;s model, because there is not even a need for looking over the search space. I&apos;ll call this direct solution, since we just pick the optimum based on the setup.</p><p>After getting a bit closer to actual design, we need to simulate rocket designs and paths, and optimize the simulated solution. This lets you do clever things like build a rocket with a sufficient but not excessive amount of fuel (hopefully with a margin of error.) If we&apos;re smart, we optimize with several intended uses and variable factors in mind, to make sure our design is sufficiently robust. (If we&apos;re not careful enough to include all relevant factors, we ignore some factor that turns out will matter, like the relationship between temperature of the O-rings and their brittleness, and our design fails in those conditions.) This is all optimizing over a search space. The cost of the search is still comparatively low - not as low as direct solution, and we may use gradient descent, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or other strategies. The commonality between these solutions is that they simulate points in the search space, perhaps along with the gradients at that point. </p><p>After we settle on a design, we build an actual rocket, and then we test it. This moves back and forth between the very high cost approach of building physical objects and testing them - often to destruction - and simulation. After each test, we probably re-run the simulation to make sure any modifications are still near the optimum we found, or we refine the simulations to re-optimize and pick the next design to build.</p><p>Lastly, we build a final design, and launch the rocket. The control system is certainly a mesa-optimizer with regards to the rocket design process. For a rocket, this control is closer to direct optimization than simulation, because the cost of evaluation needs to be low enough for real-time control.  The mesa-optimizer would, in this case, use simplified physics to fire the main and guidance rockets to stay near the pre-chosen path. It&apos;s probably not allowed to pick a new path - it can&apos;t decide that the better solution is to orbit twice instead of once before landing. (Humans may decide this, then hand the mesa-optimizer new parameters.) We tightly constrain the mesa-optimizer, since in a certain sense it&apos;s dumber than the design optimizer that chose what to optimize for.</p><p>For a more complex system, we may need a complex mesa-optimizer to guide the already designed system. Even for a more complex rocket, we may allow the mesa-optimizer to modify the model used for optimizing, at least in minor ways - it may dynamically evaluate factors like the rocket efficiency, and decide that it&apos;s getting 98% of the expected thrust, so it will plan to use that modified parameter in the system model used to mesa-optimize. Giving a mesa-optimizer more control is dangerous, but perhaps necessary to allow it to navigate a complex system.</p><p>Now that we&apos;ve deconfused why optimization is split between selection and control, I can introduce part 2: What does optimization mean?</p>",

Everybody doesn’t know.</p>\n<p>When someone claims that everyone knows something, either they are short-cutting and specifically mean ‘everyone in this well-defined small group where complex common knowledge of this particular thing is something we have invested in,’ they are very wrong about how the world works, or much more commonly, they are <i>flat out lying. </i></p>\n<p>Saying that everybody knows is almost never a <i>mistake. </i>The statement isn’t sloppy reasoning. It’s a strategy that aims to cut off discussion or objection, to justify fraud and deception, and to establish truth without evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><strong>Not Everybody Knows</strong></h3>\n<p>Let us first establish quickly that everyone doesn’t know. There are many ways to see this.</p>\n<p>One way to see this is to point out that when Alice tells Bob that everybody knows X, either Bob is asserting X because people act as if they don’t know X, or <i>Bob does not know X. </i>That’s why Alice is telling Bob in the first place.  </p>\n<p>A second way is to attempt to<a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2019/06/25/writing-childrens-picture-books/\"> explain something in detail as you would to a child</a>.</p>\n<p>A cleaner way is to consider some examples of things that a lot of people don’t know. According to the first Google hit,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/11/01/hiding-in-plain-sight-the-adult-literacy-crisis/\"> 32 million American adults can’t read, and 50% can’t read a book at the 8th grade level.</a> Various other tests of basic skills from school don’t look much better.<a href=\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2013/10/14-surprising-things-americans-dont-know-according-to-poll-numbers/\"> Here are some more basic facts many Americans don’t know</a>, including 20% who think the Sun revolves around the Earth. Nigerian prince scams<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/nigerian-prince-scams-still-rake-in-over-700000-dollars-a-year.html\"> still make over $700,000 per year.</a> Doctors can’t do <a href=\"http://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2014/11/12/doctors-dont-know-bayes-theorem/\">basic job-relevant probability calculations</a> within an order of magnitude. Just yesterday (as of writing this) I had to explain to a college graduate that Bitcoin was more volatile than the stock market, and Forex was not a responsible retirement savings plan. </p>\n<h3><b>What does the claim that ‘everybody knows’ mean?</b></h3>\n<p>There are a few different things ‘everybody knows’ is standing in for when someone claims it.</p>\n<p>In most of them, the claim that literal actual ‘everybody knows’<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/\"> is sort of the Bailey</a>, and the thing we’ll describe here is the implicit Motte that ‘everyone knows’ is your real message. Which of course, in turn, not everybody knows. As is often the case, <i>the Bailey is blatantly false. </i>But demonstrating that is socially costly. It shows you are the one who does not get it, who is not in on the goings on. So much so that when someone ‘calls someone out’ on a blatant lie, the liar socially benefits. </p>\n<p>I see four related central modes. They overlap and reinforce each other, and are often all in play at once.</p>\n<p>The first central mode is ‘this is obviously true because social proof, so I don’t have to actually provide that social proof.’ </p>\n<p>Often the proof in question doesn’t exist at all. Other times, it’s a plurality of ‘experts’ in a survey, or a reporter’s reading of a single scientific study, or three friends backing each other up – or people who have been told or gotten the impression everybody knows, so they claim to know, too.  The phrase ‘everybody knows’ is a great way to cause an information cascade.</p>\n<p>The second central mode of ‘everyone knows’ is when it means ‘if you do not know this, or you question it, you are stupid, ignorant and blameworthy.’</p>\n<p>It’s your own damn fault for going out in the rain and getting soaked. It’s your own damn fault for not knowing that everything politicians say (or something the speaker said) is a lie, even though they frequently tell the truth – which means they ‘aren’t really lies’ because no one was fooled. It’s your own damn fault for not keeping up with the latest gossip or fashion trends.</p>\n<p>It is made clear that to question this is to show you are stupid, ignorant and blameworthy, especially if the statement everyone knows is false. You’d be all but volunteering to be the scapegoat. </p>\n<p>A classic mode is the condemnation ‘everyone knows that X is (everywhere / great / the right thing / necessary / patriotic / fair / standard / appropriate / customary / the party line / how things get done around here / smart / right / a thing / not a thing / a conspiracy theory / wrong / evil / stupid / slander / rhetoric used by the out-group / rhetoric that supports the out-group / unacceptable / impossible / impractical / unthinkable / horrible / unfair / stupid / rude / your own fault / racist / sexist / treason / cheating / cultural appropriation / etc etc etc). </p>\n<p>The whole point is to establish truth without allowing a response or providing evidence.</p>\n<p>Note that this is self-referencing. To be someone, you have to know  what ‘everybody knows’ means. </p>\n<p>A third central mode is ‘if you do not know this (and, often, also claim everyone knows this), you do not count as part of everyone, and therefore are no one. If you wish to be someone, or to avoid becoming no one, know this.’ </p>\n<p>This works both to make those on the outs not people, and to make the statements used unquestionable. </p>\n<p>Thus, one is not blameworthy for acting as if everyone knows, because if someone is revealed not to know, that means they are no one, and therefore they have no relevant impact or moral personhood. They can be ignored. Perhaps those who do not know this, or question it, are the outgroup. Perhaps they are simply those who don’t get ahead, the little people. Perhaps they’re just the fools we pity. Regardless, until they catch on, it is good and right to scam them – it is a sin to let a sucker keep his money. </p>\n<p>A key variation on this is to flip the order into a way to admonish someone when they expose a falsehood or fraud someone wishes to perpetuate. First they argue that the thing is not a fraud, ideally that everyone knows it is not a fraud, but they lose, they fall back by flipping their position entirely. They now say: You’re calling this thing a fraud. But <i>everyone knows </i>it’s a fraud, so why are you wasting everyone’s time saying it’s a fraud when everyone already knows? This must be a social tactic, trying to lower the status of the fraud by pointing out what everyone already knows. Or if you think we don’t already know, that must mean you think we aren’t anyone. How insulting. </p>\n<p>The fourth central mode is ‘we are establishing this as true, and ideally as unquestionable, so pass that information along as something everyone knows.’ It’s aspirational, a self-fulfilling prophecy. Perhaps we already have done so by the time you’re hearing this (and that’s bad, because it means you’re not hearing about new things everyone knows quickly enough!) or perhaps you’re the first person to be told.</p>\n<p>Either way, join the conspiracy. Spread that everybody knows the dice are loaded and rolls with their fingers crossed. Spread that everybody knows the war is over, and everybody knows the good guys lost. </p>\n<p>So they’ll cross their fingers rather than demand fair dice. So that they’ll stop<a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/there-is-a-war/\"> trying to fight the war</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

This applies to debates, discussion, challenges of belief, general scientific discourse and more. <br/> There are two cultures in the particular trade-off I want to talk about. <strong>Collaborative</strong> and <strong>adversarial</strong>.</p><p>I pitch collaborative as,<em> “let’s work together to find the answer (truth)”</em> and I pitch adversarial as, <em>“let’s work against each other to find the answer (truth)”</em>.  As fairly neutral descriptions, these are quite balanced.  In an entrepreneurial/business setting, adversarial work is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team\">red team</a>.</p><p>I made some neat diagrams a while ago in <a href=\"http://bearlamp.com.au/a-model-of-arguments/\">a model of arguments</a>.</p><p>As an epistemic practice, it&#x27;s important to know what practice one is in (what practice one&#x27;s counterpart is in,) and how this might shape interactions.  Internally the stance for each is different. For collaborative, it might look something like, “I need offer my alternative view, between us, we need to seek the truth”. For adversarial, it might look something like, “I need to argue strongly for my (correct) view and if I ever sense that my view is wrong I need to quit”.</p><p>Externally (and from a collaborative culture perspective) someone in adversarial culture probably presents as defensive, aggressive, stubborn, yelling and shouting, ontologically arrogant, pulling out every stop possible (every fallacy) to advocate for their opinion.  Once they have decided they are lost (or are convinced of the other side&#x27;s opinion), they probably look like they do a backflip and staunchly argue against their own position.  But before they do, they probably stop the argument and run away.</p><p>Externally (and from an adversarial culture perspective) someone in collaborative culture probably presents as weak willed, fragile (too politically correct), softly spoken,  trying to be manipulative with friendliness, likely to not say what they really think, hard to pin to a belif or position, lacking confidence, and the sort of person who doesn&#x27;t admit defeat even when they are clearly wrong.</p><p>Adversarial culture sees itself as the true arena for ideas, where concepts go head to head and there is only one true and final position.  Adversarial sees ourselves as having a duty to call people out if they are wrong, this can get us into trouble and self-invested burdensome quarrels at times where we seem to fight over tiny details that don&#x27;t matter to anyone else.  Adversarial sees ourselves as guarding intellectual freedom.  Ideas are taken seriously, no matter who brings them forwards, and as a consequence, people are expected to only bring forward their best ideas to battle where they can utterly crush each other with their truths.</p><p>Collaborative culture sees itself as the true arena for fostering novel solutions to deadlock problems.  We need to think differently, see the problem differently to come up with new ideas.  There&#x27;s many ways to see a problem and by soliciting many opinions we can find the path to the outcome.  But better yet, we can all contribute to the solution.  Collaborative culture is not just about this truth, but every truth, and bringing forth an environment where we can foster the truths that are harder to admit.  Where we can reward people for admitting they are confused and considering the other side.</p><h1><strong>Strong VS Weak opinions</strong></h1><p>There&#x27;s something punchy about map &amp; Territory that I can&#x27;t put into words where different people hold their maps at strong or weak subjective opinions, they also have an adversarial or collaborative relationship with their maps (continued later)</p><p>A weak opinion in Adversarial culture looks like either saying yes to the first idea that comes along, then flip flopping as other ideas prove better, or keeping one&#x27;s mouth shut until they form an opinion.</p><p>A strong adversarial opinion looks like a loud mouth that is likely overconfident in their domain.  I know the solution and why won&#x27;t everyone listen to me because if they did then the world would be a better place.</p><p>A weak collaborative opinion probably starts with some <a href=\"http://bearlamp.com.au/hedging/\">hedging</a>, &quot;Here&#x27;s an idea&quot;, &quot;I was thinking that...&quot;, &quot;I heard...&quot;, &quot;have we considered...&quot;. Or it starts with a question, &quot;I&#x27;m confused about...&quot;.  The other option is to start silent and only add when the ongoing discussion becomes strongly in conflict with their internal opinion.</p><p>A strong collaborative opinion might start with an opinion to set the stage, but requires intense listening skills to understand the other opinions and work out how to fit them in to the prevailing argument.</p><h1><strong>When might someone say, &quot;this may sound crazy but...&quot;</strong></h1><p>A collaborative player, weakly holding a novel opinion, trying to explore new ideas and work it out as they speak.</p><p>An adversarial player when they flip position.  (Adversarial position would never take their position to be crazy)</p><h1><strong>Relationship to own ideas</strong></h1><p>How someone relates to their own ideas might be adversarial or collaborative.  Most people collaborate with their existing opinion, forming a more and more coherent worldview as they go.  Doing this they can get stronger and stronger held subjective opinions which are harder to break out of.  At the same time I would worry for the internal mental health for an adversarial self agent.  A constant battle between whichever is the loudest internal voice.  </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>Culturally 99% of either is fine as long as all parties agree on the culture and act like it. each position includes the other at least a little bit, after all, we have to have some adversarial culture in collaboration or else we would not be trying to come to the truth together, we would just assume that we each <em>already have the truth</em>.  We also have to assume there&#x27;s some collaboration in adversarial culture or else I might go find the truth for myself and <em>not bother to share it</em>.</p><p>Bad collaboration is not being willing to question the other’s position (keep it all nice and don&#x27;t rock the boat), and also not being willing to state a position strongly enough to be wrong.</p><p>Bad adversarial is not being willing to question one’s own position and blindly advocating (big ego advocacy).</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>I see Adversarial as going downhill in quality of conversation (faster than C) because it’s harder to get a healthy separation of “you are wrong” from, “and you should feel bad (or dumb) about it”, or &quot;You are wrong and therefore not part of the in-group that I trust&quot;. And a further, &quot;Only an idiot would believe that&quot;.</p><p>In a collaborative process, the other person is not an idiot because there’s an assumption that <strong>we work together</strong>. If an adversarial attitude (yes it&#x27;s different to an adversarial culture but the difference gets cloudy) cuts to the depth of beliefs about our interlocker then from my perspective it gets un-pretty very quickly.  Not only are they wrong, but they are <em>The Enemy</em> for being wrong too.  Skilled scientists are always using both and have a clean separation of personal relationship and idea being put forward.</p><p>In an adversarial environment, I’ve known of some brains to take the feedback, “you are wrong because x” and translate it to, “I am bad, or I should give up, or I failed, I don&#x27;t belong here” and not “I should advocate for my idea better”.  </p><p>In a collaborative environment, I&#x27;ve known some brains to take feedback, &quot;I don&#x27;t know about that...&quot; and reflect that &quot;wow these guys are idiots who don&#x27;t hold positions&quot;.  Also feedback like, &quot;If you believe Y, then X makes sense, but Y is not true, so X is not true&quot;, can sometimes be taken on reflection, &quot;they are muddying up X issue with Y, and trying to confuse me with manipulative argument tactics&quot;.</p><p>At the end of an adversarial argument is a very strong flip, popperian style “I guess I am wrong so I take your side”.</p><p>At the end of a collaborative process is when I find myself taking sides, up until that point, it’s not always clear what my position is, and even at the end of a collaborative process I might be internally resting on the best outcome of collaboration so far, but tomorrow that might change.</p><p>I see the possibility of being comfortable in each step of collaboration to say, “thank you for adding something here”. However I see that harder or more friction to say so during adversarial cultures.  At times it seems that to do adversarial culture, we must assume the presence of those &quot;thank you for that addition&quot; around every corner.  Conceptually maybe we bring our own intellectual safety or worthiness to the table when we present our argument.  </p><h1><strong>Intellectual safety or Worthiness</strong></h1><p>In adversarial culture, everyone is in charge of bringing their own intellectual safety.  Every idea, no matter who proposes it, is equal.  There&#x27;s something of a meritocracy of ideas, where the good ideas are listened to, no matter who brings them forward.  </p><p>In Collaborative culture, there&#x27;s a recognition that everyone has something to offer, even if the individual themselves don&#x27;t at first know it or believe it.  Because of the way that brains sometimes question their own personal worthiness, we might need to advocate to those brains, or cultivate an environment that can bring out their best.  We can&#x27;t necessarily trust people to know they carry worthy ideas (and adversarial culture sees this as manipulation, coddling and the worst of all possible cultures).</p><p>Adversarial culture can suggest that Hitler had useful genetic ideals to breed a super race, and collaborative culture can confidently say he went about it in a terrible way (and any further discussion of human selection should be done very carefully).  Collaborative culture can only talk about Hitler in the context of the atrocity and how we can only carefully talk about the issue, adversarial can talk about the issue assuming everyone already knows it was terrible and we don&#x27;t need to rehash the arguments.</p><p>Collaborative sees Adversarial as stubborn assholes.  Adversarial sees collaborative culture as deceptive manipulators.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>I advocate for collaboration over adversarial culture because of the bleed through from epistemics to interpersonal beliefs. Humans are not perfect arguers or it would not matter so much. Because we play with brains and mixing territory of belief and interpersonal relationships I prefer collaborative to adversarial but I could see a counter argument that emphasised the value of the opposite position.</p><p>I can also see that it doesn’t matter which culture one is in, so long as there is clarity around it being one and not the other.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve tried to remain neutral over this piece but while writing this I convinced myself of collaborative being better, my reasoning is that a collective practice over an individual practice is going to be better in the long run.  It appears that any process that seeks to include more of the context of the whole is more future thinking and more likely to get to the right answer.  Yes each of us is individual, but we live, reason, and grow as collectives.</p><p>In isolation, For example in a chess game, there is likely one good move next, an adversarial chess move finding culture is likely to be a useful skill.  In context there are many possible factors for the next move.  As soon as we step out of the chess game, into the classroom, out of the classroom, into the family and interpersonal relationships, the &quot;move&quot; is very different to before.  My next move might not be a chess move, it might be to smile at my opponent, or to suggest we take a break.  </p><br/><p>Not all games are to be played or won.</p>",

This is the plot structure of the video game&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://assassinscreed.fandom.com/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Odyssey\">Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</a>.</em>&nbsp;In it, the player controls a mercenary who sails from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assassinscreed.fandom.com/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Odyssey#Plot\">her</a>&nbsp;home near Ithaca to find her parents and prove her worth to the Greek world. And of course, <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46157562-the-odyssey\">The Odyssey</a></em>&nbsp;itself starts with the tale of a young man sailing from Ithaca seeking fame and news of his father.</p>\n<p>But that man is not Odysseus. It’s his son, Telemachus, who goes on a quest. Odysseus himself shows up only in book 5 of the epic poem, old and tired. Most of his travels are behind him at that point and told only in flashback. His is not a hero’s journey of transformation and discovery. He is by and large the exact same man who sailed for Troy two decades before, a fact that is remarked upon by the other characters. It is Telemachus who transforms from a shy youth into an assertive prince when he finally fights by his father’s side against Penelope’s suitors.</p>\n<p>And yet, the game is not called <em>Assassin’s Creed: Telemacheia</em>, even though the protagonist’s journey mirrors Telemachus much more than his father. The son’s story is relegated to a secondary plot, while the father’s story has proved to be memorable and compelling to audiences for three thousand years.</p>\n<p>Why is Odysseus such a compelling hero? When I read&nbsp;the <em>Odyssey</em> as a teenager I remember admiring Odysseus’ heroics. But upon rereading Emily Wilson’s version<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-buFdHhRBEzwA2K896-1\" id=\"fnref-buFdHhRBEzwA2K896-1\">[1]</a></sup>, I noticed that&nbsp;Odysseus isn’t just a static character, he’s kind of a huge dick.</p>\n<p>Odysseus is brave, formidable, and intelligent, but also a consummate liar, greedy, violent, and selfish. Some behavior that is repugnant to modern readers, like murder, pillaging, enslaving, and fornicating, was probably considered “all in the game” in Bronze Age Greece. Other sins, like the fact that the survival ratio of men under his command would make even comrade Stalin blush, are criticized by the other characters in the poem itself. And even aside from his indifference to the body count, Odysseus seems utterly lacking compassion for his fellow humans.</p>\n<p>A darkly ironic passage concerns Odysseus’ conversation (while disguised as a beggar) with Eumaeus, his swineherd. Odysseus remarks that nothing in the world is worse than wandering far from home, then asks Eumaeus to share his life story. Eumaeus agrees, prefacing his story with <em>“after many years / of agony and absence from one’s home / a person can begin enjoying grief\"</em>.</p>\n<p>Eumaeus is revealed to be not a local Ithacan, but the prince of the faraway island of Syra. Phoenician sailors come to Syra and seduce the young prince’s nurse since&nbsp;<em>\"sex sways all women’s minds / even the best of them\"</em>. The woman boards the Phoenician ship with Eumaeus and when she dies the sailors sell him as a slave to the ruler of the nearest island, which happens to be Ithaca.</p>\n<p>Here’s how much empathy Odysseus musters in response to this heartbreaking tale:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Odysseus replied: my heart is touched<br>\nto hear the story of your sufferings, Eumaeus.<br>\nIn the end though, Zeus has blessed you since after<br>\ngoing through all that you came to live<br>\nwith someone kind, a man who gives you plenty<br>\nto eat and drink. Your life is good, but as<br>\nfor me&nbsp;I am still lost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is psychopathic. He assures Eumaeus that his “heart is touched”, and then immediately tells him that being Odysseus’ slave (as opposed to growing up a prince) is nothing to complain about!</p>\n<p>A more notorious scene is the punishment of the slave girls in Odysseus’ household who “dishonored” him by disobeying his wife, Penelope, and old nurse, Euryclea. The girls also slept with Penelope’s suitors, although it is unclear if they did so willingly or were forced to by the rowdy men.</p>\n<p>As Euryclea is gathering the girls, Odysseus instructs his son and two servants that they should take the girls outside and&nbsp;<em>“hack at them with swords / eradicate all life from them”.</em> Everyone agrees that this is fair and just. But then Odysseus notices that his great hall is covered in the blood and guts of the hundred suitors he just killed. And since a bunch of slave girls just arrived in the room, the master strategist makes the most of the situation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sobbing desperately the girls came<br>\nWeeping clutching at each other.<br>\nThey carried out the bodies of the dead<br>\nand piled them high on one another<br>\nunder the roof outside. Odysseus<br>\ninstructed them and forced them to continue.<br>\nAnd then they cleaned his lovely chairs and tables<br>\nwith wet absorbent sponges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Immediately thereafter the girls are hanged&nbsp;<em>“their heads all in a row / to make their death an agony”</em>.&nbsp;The men probably realized that if they “hack at them with swords” they would afterward have to mop the floor themselves.</p>\n<h2>Beautiful Lies</h2>\n<p>Bronze Age morality aside, does Homer intend Odysseus to be the exemplary hero of the story? Or is there a case to be made for a Straussian reading of the poem, one in which Odysseus is the villain? The most direct indication of the latter option is given in the story of Odysseus’ naming. The name is proposed by his maternal grandfather,&nbsp;<em>“noble Autolycus who was the best / of all mankind at telling lies and stealing\"</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Euryclea put the newborn child<br>\non his grandfather’s lap and said, “Now name<br>\nyour grandson, this much-wanted baby boy.”<br>\nHe told the parents, “Name him this. I am<br>\ndisliked by many all across the world<br>\nand I dislike them back. So name the child<br>\nOdysseus […]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The name comes from the Greek <em>odyssomai</em> which means <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/265589?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">either “hatred” or “anger”</a>; it is likely the root of the modern word “odious”. Whatever Homer thought of pillage, murder, and making people do chores, he surely considered “telling lies and stealing” to be loathsome. Odysseus inherited both talents from his “noble” grandfather.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the common interpretation of the poem is that Homer admires Odysseus because he sees him as a colleague: a bard and storyteller. The moral principle which drives much of the story is&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_(Greek)\">xenia</a></em>, the duty of a host to feed and shelter his guests. But the guest has a duty as well: to entertain his host with beautiful stories.</p>\n<p>Does the guest have a duty to tell a&nbsp;<em>true</em> story or just a beautiful one? I think this is the most fascinating subject in the poem.</p>\n<p>The famous part of the Odyssey, the hero’s travel across the seas since his departure from Troy, is recounted by Odysseus to Alcinous, king of the Phaeacians. He tells the king and his court about god-summoned storms, an island of wireheading Lotus-eaters, the cave of the Cyclops and his daring escape tied to the belly of a ram, a gift from the god of winds, a surprise attack by cannibals, the witch Circe turning the crew to pigs, and a visit to the Underworld to converse with the souls of the dead.</p>\n<p>The reaction of wise king Alcinous to this <em>fantastic</em>&nbsp;tale displays an interesting epistemology:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alcinous replied, “Odysseus,<br>\nthe Earth sustains all kinds of people.<br>\nMany are cheats and thieves who fashion lies<br>\nout of thin air. But when I look at you,<br>\nI know you are not in that category.<br>\nYour story has both grace and wisdom in it.<br>\nYou sounded like a skillful poet telling<br>\nthe sufferings of all the Greeks, including<br>\nwhat you endured yourself.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Different translations make this passage even clearer: Odysseus story is touching and beautifully told, and so the king knows that it must be true.</p>\n<p>This sentiment is echoed in Western poetry through the ages. The Romantic poet John Keats was devoted to the study of ancient Greek art; his&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44477/ode-on-a-grecian-urn\">Ode on a Grecian Urn</a></em> concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Emily Dickinson agrees: <a href=\"https://www.bartleby.com/113/4010.html\">truth and beauty are the same</a>.</p>\n<p>Although this statement is mostly associated with poets, there are two possible interpretations of it: the poet’s and the quant’s. To a quant (i.e., rationalist), beauty is ephemeral while the pursuit of truth is tangible. Once the truth is ascertained through rigorous epistemology, one should train their aesthetic sense to find it beautiful. Rationalist types are fond of compiling lists of <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/57849-greatest-mathematical-equations.html\">“the most beautiful and poetic” equations</a>.</p>\n<p>To a poet, the above approach is too constraining of beauty by limiting it to what can be deduced scientifically. Epistemology seems quite hopeless, while good taste can be fruitfully cultivated. It is better to seek beauty and take what is beautiful to be true. To a rationalist, this is much too loose a criterion for&nbsp;<em>truth</em>, and the two <a href=\"https://samharris.org/podcasts/what-is-true/\">keep arguing about what truth is</a>&nbsp;for all eternity.</p>\n<p>One would expect Homer to side fully with the poet’s take, but an interesting reversal takes place in the hut of Eumaeus (who is da real MVP of the story). Disguised Odysseus tells the swineherd another beautiful and wholly made up Odyssey, one that’s a lot more grounded and believable than what he told Alcinous. He tell Eumaeus of growing up in Crete, an unsuccessful raid in Egypt, kidnap and shipwreck, and finally being rescued by a kind king who tells him news of Odysseus.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eumaeus, you replied, “Poor guest, your tale<br>\nof woe is very moving, but pointless.<br>\nI would not believe a word about Odysseus<br>\nWhy did you stoop to tell those silly lies?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Swineherds, it seems, have need of a more rigorous epistemology than do kings.</p>\n<p>So, is Odysseus a liar or a poet? His <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithets_in_Homer#Individuals\">common epithets</a> include “wise”, “resourceful”, and “great teller of tales”. Wilson uses another one: “lord of lies”, a title that our culture often reserves for the Devil. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html\">ultimately concludes</a> that Odysseus’ key epithet is the first one to appear in the poem:&nbsp;<em>polytropos</em>. It can mean “many-sided”, “much traveled”, or, as she finally settles on: “complicated”.</p>\n<p>I think Odysseus is both a liar and poet, but its the latter that makes him the hero. He is the one who spins the tale, and its his point of view that the audience is inevitably drawn to. We hear him describe his rage at the slave girls; they don’t get to make their case. Once the reader or listener find themselves in Odysseus shoes, his best qualities are magnified and his vices are downplayed. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3510747-nobody-is-a-villain-in-their-own-story-we-re-all\">Nobody is the villain in their own story</a>, and the Odyssey is Odysseus’ story.</p>\n<h2>State of the Art</h2>\n<p>When&nbsp;<em>The Odyssey</em> was written in the 8th century BC, the premier entertainment art form of the time was the telling of oral tales. I decided to buy the modern translation of Homer’s epic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.audible.com/ep/title/?asin=B07GLN33S8\">on audiobook</a>&nbsp;(read masterfully by Claire Danes) to enjoy it in a form as close to the original as possible.</p>\n<p>Since Homer’s time, people kept telling stories and perfecting the media through which they do so. When I was young, the best stories were told in books and movies, and throughout my teenage years, I consumed one of each per week. Then the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Television_(2000s%E2%80%93present)\">golden age of TV</a> dawned, and I binged on&nbsp;<em>Buffy</em>, <em>The Wire</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1128332128276631552\">Throneplay</a></em>.</p>\n<p>But today it seems beyond a doubt that video games are the preeminent entertainment and narrative art form of our era. The best video games have budgets and revenues that <a href=\"https://lpesports.com/e-sports-news/the-video-games-industry-is-bigger-than-hollywood\">far exceed Hollywood blockbusters</a>. They employ&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1129421674577780738\">actors to rival the best movies</a>&nbsp;and teams of writers to rival the best TV series. And beyond those, video games have the advantage of <em>interactivity</em>. This alone sets them far apart from any passive medium.</p>\n<p>I am a big fan of the zombie genre in all its incarnations: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8908.World_War_Z\">books</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombieland\">movies</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)\">comics, and TV shows</a>. One version stands above all:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us\">The Last of Us</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-last-of-us-screenshot.jpg?w=900\" alt=\"\">\n<em>Screenshot from&nbsp;The Last of Us&nbsp;on PlayStation 4.</em></p>\n<p>In the game, you spend a good amount of time hiding behind cover and <em>thinking</em>. You’ve just seen two zombies at the end of a corridor you must traverse. You have three bullets and one arrow to your name, but no guarantee that either will result in a quick kill or that you will be able to replenish your ammo before you face the next deadly challenge. You can try to sneak past, but a misstep may leave you surrounded by enemies with no opportunity to retreat. You may just be able to climb around the two zombies, but the ledge would leave you exposed to view and fire on both sides.</p>\n<p>A movie can choose to have a shootout scene, or a suspenseful crawl, or a daring run with the enemy nipping at the heroes’ heels. But a movie can’t have the character thinking and sweating behind a crate. And it’s <em>that</em> part that immerses you in the character, not the shooting or sneaking or running but having to make hard choices and living with the outcomes – often, a gruesome death <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-buFdHhRBEzwA2K896-2\" id=\"fnref-buFdHhRBEzwA2K896-2\">[2]</a></sup>. A good passive story makes you identify with a character and their choices, but a game lets you&nbsp;<em>inhabit</em> the protagonist.</p>\n<p>Games can have any sort of protagonist, from soldier to god to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man\">yellow circle</a>. But an interesting pattern emerges if we look at some of the most successful games that emphasize storytelling.</p>\n<p>The protagonist of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em> is Joel. Joel is a bearded man on the cusp of middle age. Joel is a survivor with a dark past, brave, violent, and cunning. Joel is on a quest, but what he ultimately wants is to go back home with his (adopted) daughter, Ellie. He will shoot, stab, and explode anyone standing in the way of that.</p>\n<p><em>The Last of Us</em> is the third highest <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/userscore/all/ps4/filtered?sort=desc\">user-rated PlayStation 4 game of all time</a>. The second rated game is&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\">God of War</a></em>,&nbsp;the protagonist of which is Kratos. Kratos is a bearded man on the cusp of middle age, a warrior with a dark past, brave, cunning, and very violent.&nbsp; Kratos is on a quest, but what he ultimately wants is to go back home with his son, Atreus. His axe will dismember anyone standing in the way of that.</p>\n<p>The highest rated game is&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt\">The&nbsp;Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></em>. The protagonist is Geralt. He has a beard, he has a past, he has a daughter, and he has two swords that need very frequent cleaning.</p>\n<p>Joel, Kratos, Geralt, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2\">Arthur Morgan</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock_Infinite\">Booker DeWitt</a>: the most popular video games are actual&nbsp;<em>Odysseys</em>. Not a hero’s journey <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-buFdHhRBEzwA2K896-3\" id=\"fnref-buFdHhRBEzwA2K896-3\">[3]</a></sup> into chaos to save his home, but a father’s journey home leaving chaos in its wake. These are not the best men, but they make for the best stories.</p>\n<p>I’m not the first person to notice that bad guys are quite popular. In classical Athens, Plato (speaking for Socrates) criticized poets for corrupting the morality of the public. <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-rhetoric/#RepII\">He accused poets like Homer</a> of speaking through un-virtuous (what we would call “problematic”) characters thereby making listeners identify with these characters and see them as role models. Plato blamed the unfair advantage of storytelling (over pure philosophy) in affecting people’s souls. Like curmudgeons across the ages, Plato was especially worried about the impressionable youth who will hear the Odyssey and be inspired to match Odysseus rampage. <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/about/policy/violent-video-games\">Sounds familiar</a>?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-buFdHhRBEzwA2K896-4\" id=\"fnref-buFdHhRBEzwA2K896-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p>I think that Plato and the pearl clutchers at APA are completely wrong. Most of us don’t want to become desperate, violent men, and those that do won’t be satisfied with the simulacrum of a poem or video game. But we want to know what it would <em>feel like</em> to be those men, to outwit and survive and kill, and to deal with the consequences too. Odysseus gets a classical happy ending (although I’d personally take Calypso+immortality over grumpy Penelope), but most&nbsp;PlayStation Odysseuses don’t. Modern storytellers know that&nbsp;their audience will reject a tale in which violent rampages conclude in marital bliss and domestic peace.</p>\n<p>We identify with Odysseus for the duration of his story, but then we can reflect on it. This is how people learn virtue.

When the AI is strong enough to be unstoppable it pursues its own values.</blockquote><p>Ben Goertzel criticised this thesis, <a href=\"https://jetpress.org/v26.1/goertzel.pdf\">pointing out</a> that:</p><blockquote> for a resource-constrained system, learning to actually possess human values is going to be much easier than learning to fake them. This is related to the everyday observation that maintaining a web of lies rapidly gets very complicated.</blockquote><p>This argument has been formalised into the <a href=\"https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=478069124110088028103018016004012092030042006012089031090113089070105030104016095087043038022017031001018003099009013078002070110010017028007092090099081125122099100010008001004000106096123020075089074092074001004092092026065123067092086116116000002081&amp;EXT=pdf\">sordid stumble</a>:</p><blockquote> An AI that lacks human desirable values will behave in a way that reveals its human-undesirable values to humans before it gains the capability to deceive humans into believing that it has human-desirable values.</blockquote><h2>The AI is too dumb to lie (well)</h2><p>The sordid stumble describes a plausible sounding scenario for how an AI develops capabilities. Initially, the AI doesn't know our values, and doesn't know us. Then it will start to learn our values (and we'll be checking up on how well it does that). It also starts to learn about us.</p><p>And then, once it's learnt some about us, it may decide to lie - about its values, and/or about its capabilities. But, like any beginner, it isn't very good at this initially: its lies and attempts at dissembling are laughably transparent, and we catch it quickly.</p><p>In this view, the \"effective lying\" is a tiny part of policy space, similar to the wireheading <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wJ3AqNPM7W4nfY5Bk/self-confirming-prophecies-and-simplified-oracle-designs\">in this example</a>. To hit it, the AI has to be very capable; to hit it the first time it tries without giving the game away, the AI has to be extraordinarily.</p><p>So, most likely, either the AI doesn't try to lie at all, or it does so and we catch it and sound the alarm<span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

What is needed is that the AI's answer promotes correct <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1261\">understanding</a> in those interacting with it. And that's a very different kettle of fish being shot in that barrel.</p><p>This opens the possibility that the AI could be manipulating us from the very beginning, and would constantly learn to do so better.</p><h2>The (manipulative) unbiased newsfeed</h2><p>Imagine that there was some company that could somehow choose the newsfeed of <a href=\"https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/\">billions of people</a> across the world (I know, completely science-fictionny, but bear with me). And suppose the company was, unbelievably, accused of being manipulative in the stories and ads that it showed people.</p><p>One way it could combat this is by pledging to only share unbiased stories with each person. To do so, it trains a machine learning process. Whenever anyone reads a piece of news on the newsfeed, they have the opportunity of labelling it as biased or unbiased. The machine learning process trains on this data.</p><p>Of course, the label is just a proxy for whether the story really is unbiased or not. What the AI is actually training to do is maximise the number of stories labelled \"unbiased\" by various humans - humans who are themselves very biased and variable. Very swiftly, the AI will learn to maximise the \"appearance of unbiasness\", rather than unbiasness. In effect, the AI is being trained to lie from the very beginning of its task, because the proxy goal is not the true goal. And it will do this even when very dumb.</p><h2>Long-term manipulation, on a large scale</h2><p>We can make this AI more manipulative, without needing to increase its capabilities much. Maybe the company wants to ensure that the AI isn't too short-sighted, and that it plans for the long term: so its reward is based on how many stories are labelled unbiased over a longer period of time, maybe a month or so.</p><p>In that case, the AI's plan would be to gradually manipulate people into a situation where they actively label stories \"unbiased\" the most often times possible. And it might be able to stumble on this strategy fairly easily.</p><p>First, it might notice that some people are easy to manipulate, that a policy of, say, seeding one clearly biased story among twenty others will cause those twenty to be labelled \"unbiased\". This is the kind of thing that could easily be discovered by exploration, among the billions of users. The best strategies are those that cause a person to change their behaviour and beliefs in the direction the AI wants; for a few people, this should be easy to figure out.</p><p>If the AI's neural net is setup well, it can then start to generalise from \"here is person <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"h\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">h</span></span></span></span></span></span>, here is a specific strategy <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\pi_h\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.003em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">π</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.219em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">h</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to manipulate person <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"h\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">h</span></span></span></span></span></span>\" to \"here is a conditional strategy <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\pi()\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">π</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> such that <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\pi(h)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">π</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">h</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> manipulates person <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"h\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">h</span></span></span></span></span></span>\". For example, if two people have opposite political opinions, then the same overall strategy might work for them: seeding a clearly biased story among the others. But what counts as \"clearly biased\" changes depending on the subject.</p><p>Then, gradually, the AI will start to categorise, devising strategies that work for various types of people (subject to a few personalisation tweaks). It can start from a few people whose vulnerabilities are obvious, and then tweak them a bit for people whose vulnerabilities are a bit less obvious, and so on. In the limit, the AI might discover the potential for wireheading the human users - without, at any point, doing a sordid stumble or anything of that type, just by continuing to do what it was doing from the very beginning.</p><h1>Formalizing the Newsfeed Generator</h1><p>Let  <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

Here's one example: maybe the AI is tasked with writing its own news stories to summarise facts around the world. It was doing this secretly, initially, until some whistleblowers blew the lid on this, revealing that no humans were involved in writing these stories.</p><p>And then people became angry at being \"tricked\" by the AI. From the angry feedback, the AI gradually learns to make its stories \"more artificial\": making it clear that they were written by a machine. Since people recognise this and don't feel tricked, this gets higher feedback. So, in pursuing higher feedback, the AI learns to write \"dumber\" stories: in effect, to conceal its capabilities.</p><p>There are many other scenarios where something similar might occur (eg imagine the AI advising smart people on the best course of action).</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><h1>In conclusion</h1><p>So it's very possible for an AI, trained on simple reward signal, to be \"manipulative\"  from the very beginning. And all that simply by following the gradient of its incentives. And so without ever having a moment where it thinks \"and now, I shall start lying!\", or any equivalent within its mind.</p><p>In short, there won't be any \"sordid stumble\" or \"moment of vulnerability\" where humans are able to spot blatant lies, because that's not <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/more-realistic-tales-of-doom\">what failure looks like</a>.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>[1] It would of course be disastrous if each time there was an alarm we would restart and tweak the AI until the alarm stopped sounding.<br> </p>",

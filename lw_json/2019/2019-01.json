Suppose that the widget costs the widget-manufacturer $20 to produce, but, due to monopoly power on their part, they can charge $100 per widget.</p><p>The economic calculus for this problem is as follows. $30 (widget valuation) - $100 (widget price) = -$70 to me; $100 (widget price) - $20 (widget cost) = $80 to widget producers. $80 - $70 = +$10 total value. Ordinarily, this wouldn&#x27;t imply that utilitarians are required to spend all their money on widgets because for a function to convert dollars to utils u($), u&#x27;($)&gt;0, u&#x27;&#x27;($)&lt;0 and widget-producers usually have higher $ then widget consumers.</p><p>But suppose the widget monopolist is a poor worker commune. The profits go directly to the workers who, on average, have lower $ then I do. It seems like buying widgets would be more moral then, say, donating $80 to the same group of poor people ($80 - $80 = $0) because the widget purchase slightly compensates me for the donation in a way that is greater then the cost of the recipient to produce the widget.</p><p>And yet, I feel even less moral compunction to buy widgets then I do to donate $80 to GiveDirectly. Is this just an arbitrary, unjustifiable, subconscious desire to shove economic transactions into a separate domain from charitable donations or is there actually some mistake in the utilitarian logic here?

    "htmlBody": "<p>In a recent post I talked about <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34#.wmeq2iqwv\">capability amplification</a>, a putative procedure that turns a large number of fast weak agents into a slower, stronger agent.</p><p>If we do this in a naive way, it will decrease reliability. For example, if…</p><ul><li>Our weak policy fails with probability 1%.</li><li>In order to implement a strong policy we combine 10 decisions made by weak agents.</li><li>If any of these 10 decisions is bad, then so is the combination.</li></ul><p>…then the combination will be bad with 10% probability.</p><p>Although the combination can be more powerful than any individual decision, in this case it is much <em>less</em> reliable. If we repeat policy amplification several times, our failure probability could quickly approach 1, even if it started out being exponentially small.</p><p>Complementary to capability amplification is <em>reliability amplification</em>: given a policy H that usually works, can we implement a policy H that works significantly more reliably?</p><p>To be slightly less imprecise (but still quite crude):</p><ul><li>Given a distribution <strong>A</strong> over policies that ε-close to a benign policy for some ε ≪ 1, can we implement a distribution <strong>A⁺</strong> over policies which is δ-close to a benign policy of similar capability, for some δ ≪ ε?</li></ul><p>When I say that <strong>A</strong> is ε-close to a benign policy, I mean that there is a benign distribution over policies which has total variation distance at most ε from <strong>A</strong>. We can view this is as a simple mixture between a single aligned policy that is chosen with probability (1−ε) and an adversarial policy that is chosen with probability ε.</p><p>I will move freely between talking about “policies” and “distributions over policies;” we can turn a distribution into a single policy by averaging.</p><p>The notion of “implement” here is exactly the same as for <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34#.wmeq2iqwv\">capability amplification</a>: we can use any number of implementations of <strong>A</strong> and whatever other resources are at our disposal<strong>,</strong> and must compute <strong>A⁺</strong>’s responses to a sequence of observations, within some time limit such as a day.</p><h1>Reliability amplification via deliberation</h1><p>I think there is one very natural way to do reliability amplification — if some variant of this idea doesn’t work, I’m not sure what else to try.</p><p>As a warm-up, let’s consider the setting where the agents want to make a single decision rather than a sequence of decisions — we’ll return to the sequential case soon.</p><p>We sample three agents <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong> from the given distribution. We ask them to talk for a while and then each propose an action. Then we ask them to do approval voting amongst the three options, and randomly pick from the maximally-approved-of proposals.</p><p>If all three agents are aligned, then this proposal is clearly going to produce an aligned action. If two the agents behave adversarially then we are clearly out of luck, but that happens only with probability O(ε²), so we can basically ignore it.</p><p>The interesting case is when there is one adversarial agent and two aligned agents. If we threw up our hands and picked randomly in this case, then we would have a failure probability of ε. So the question is: can we do better than that?</p><p>The obvious hope is that aligned agents can do better-than-chance at recognizing each other / at recognizing good actions. If they can get any non-negligible advantage, then we can get a non-negligible reduction in error probability (and by iterating the procedure we can potentially get large reductions).</p><h2>The sequential case</h2><p>So far we have talked about making a single decision. The problem is more challenging when we need to make a sequence of decisions.</p><p>We can try to simply generalize the voting approach, running a new vote for each action. To see the difficulty, suppose that the optimal policy looks as follows:</p><ol><li>Generate some hard-to-transfer internal state X. Think of X as something like an intuitive vision for how to approach the situation.</li><li>Use X to generate a first action.</li><li>After making an observation, use X to generate a second action. It is important that the same state X be used in steps [2] and [3].</li></ol><p>Now suppose that in the first step the three agents all follow this protocol correctly. They arrive at three different proposed actions, which are backed up by three different visions. Now we have to pick one of these actions, effectively committing ourselves to a single agent. This destroys our ability to ensemble effectively in future steps: if the chosen agent fails then we are out of luck, since the other two agents don’t have the vision needed to follow-through on that action.</p><p>To get around this problem we need to count on a stronger property: whatever kind of private state X an agent could generate, the agents need to be able to jointly develop a “consensus” private state which serves the same function. Then if one agent fails, the other agents can also use the consensus private state in order to continue acting intelligently.</p><p>(It would also be OK if only pairs of agents could establish such a consensus state, as long as the third agent was able to arbitrate between the two in the event of a future failure.)</p><h2>Implementation</h2><p>As of <a href=\"https://github.com/paulfchristiano/alba/commit/1cbaae38305bcaadf015b909212313da63c06391\">commit 1cbaae</a>, this approval-voting scheme is part of <a href=\"https://github.com/paulfchristiano/alba\">my ALBA implementation on GitHub</a>.</p><p>It is implemented in <a href=\"https://github.com/paulfchristiano/alba/blob/master/amplify/reliability.py\">amplify.reliability.amplify_reliability</a>, and is applied as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/paulfchristiano/alba/blob/master/amplify/__init__.py\">amplify.amplify</a> directly prior to applying HCH.</p><p>As a result I’ve moved one issue from the “FIXME: will fail” column to the “TODO: needs improvement” column.</p><h1>Three differences with redundant computation</h1><p>There is an easy recipe for fault-tolerant computation: compute the result 3 times, and take the majority vote. This increases the computational cost by a factor of 3, but decreases the error rate from ε to O(ε²).</p><p>Our reliability amplification scheme is considerably more subtle, and if we were to formalize the reliability amplification problem as stated we would find it impossible. This section touches on the most important additional subtleties.</p><h2>Building consensus</h2><p>Redundant computation normally relies on the existence of a unique correct answer on which all uncorrupted computations will agree. In our setting, there may be a range of “correct” behaviors. This introduces the additional challenge of being able to agree on a particular correct answer (and to build a consensus version of the hidden state underlying that answer).</p><p>Without some assumption of this form, reliability amplification is impossible. For example, suppose that there are 99 possible good answers and 1 bad answer. Our distribution <strong>A</strong> picks at random amongst the 100 possible answers. If the copies of <strong>A</strong> with good answers are completely unable to agree with each other, then there may simply be no way to tell the good answers from the bad answer. In this case, we can never reduce the error probability below 1%.</p><h2>Balanced abilities</h2><p>In order for our scheme to work we need to assume that the abilities of all of the agents are roughly balanced. I think this is probably necessary for any scheme to work. If you have an ε chance of a malicious superintelligence and a (1−ε) chance of a friendly human, you are probably out of luck — in a deliberative process involving two humans and a superintelligence, the superintelligence is likely to have disproportionately much influence over the outcome even if it is wrong.</p><p>Our particular scheme fails outright in the context of powerful adversaries. In general there is a 3ε chance that <em>at least one</em> of the agents is unaligned. We may be able to prevent the unaligned agent from causing the group to adopt a really bad answer. But even in the best case, the unaligned agent will probably be able to tilt the balance between the two options proposed by the aligned agents, allowing them to increase the probability of failure. If the unaligned agent is no smarter than the aligned agents, then the aligned agents can counteract this effect by preferentially picking the better action. But if the unaligned agent is much smarter than the aligned agents, then it can increase the probability of failures which are too subtle for the unaligned agents to anticipate, and the aligned agents have no way to decrease the probability of these failures.</p><h2>Less time to think</h2><p>Traditionally redundant computation increases costs by a constant factor. But in the context of reliability amplification, we also make life harder for each agent: in addition to picking an action, they need to spend time arguing about actions and critiquing each others’ choices. This gives each agent less time to think about their action. It is not clear whether we can offset this effect</p><h1>Relation to capability amplification and ALBA</h1><h2>Necessity</h2><p>Reliability amplification seems completely necessary if we want to do something like <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/alba-an-explicit-proposal-for-aligned-ai-17a55f60bbcf#.k01g9mu1r\">ALBA</a> using imitation or imitation+RL, since otherwise reliability will fall with each iteration of capability amplification. Of course we could have a “robust” capability amplification procedure which does not decrease reliability. But designing such a procedure is strictly harder than reliability amplification. So I think it makes a lot of sense to split up the problem into two pieces.</p><p>If working with approval-direction and pure RL, there is actually a form of reliability amplification already baked in: if the overseer fails with probability 1%, then this only changes the reward function by 0.01, and an RL agent should still avoid highly undesirable actions. That said, capability amplification may still be necessary in a pure RL setup if we can’t solve the RL problem to arbitrary precision. In that case we may always have some non-negligible probability of making a bad decision, and after capability amplification this probability could become too large.</p><h2>Balancing capability/reliability</h2><p>Reliability amplification decreases our agent’s capability but increases its reliability. Capability amplification increases capability and decreases reliability.</p><p>The hope is that we can somehow put these pieces together in a way that ends up increasing both reliability and capability.</p><p>If our reliability amplification step achieves a superlinear reduction in error probability from ε to <em>o</em>(ε), and our capability amplification causes a linear increase from ε to Θ(ε)<em>,</em> then this seems almost guaranteed to work.</p><p>To see this, consider the capability decrease from reliability amplification. We know that for large enough N, N iterations of capability amplification will more than offset this capability decrease. This N is a constant which is independent of the initial error rate ε, and hence the total effect of N iterations is to increase the error rate to Θ(ε). For sufficiently small ε, this is more than offset by the ε → <em>o</em>(ε) reliability improvement from reliability amplification. So for sufficiently small ε we can increase both reliability and capability.</p><p>A reduction from ε to O(ε²) is basically the “best case” for reliability amplification, corresponding to the situation where two aligned agents can always reach correct consensus. In general, aligned agents will have some imperfect ability to reach consensus and to correctly detect bad proposals from a malicious agent. In this setting, we are more likely to have an ε → O(ε) reduction. Hopefully the constant can be very good.</p><p>There are also lower bounds on the achievable reliability ε derived from the reliability of the human and of our learning procedures.</p><p>So in fact reliability amplification will increase reliability by some factor <em>R</em> and decrease capability by some increment Δ, while capability amplification decreases reliability by some factor <em>R</em>′ and increases capability by some increment Δ′. Our hope is that there exists some capability amplification procedure with Δ′/log(<em>R</em>′) &gt; Δ/log(<em>R</em>), and which is efficient enough to be used as a reward function for <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/semi-supervised-reinforcement-learning-cf7d5375197f#.caphzez70\">semi-supervised RL</a>.</p><p>I think that this condition is quite plausible but definitely not a sure thing; I’ll say more about this question in future posts.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>A large computation is almost guaranteed to experience some errors. This poses no challenge for the theory of computing because those errors can be corrected: by computing redundantly we can achieve arbitrarily low error rates, and so we can assume that even arbitrarily large computations are essentially perfectly reliable.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/implementing-our-considered-judgment-6c715a239b3e#.fi28htpu3\">long deliberative process</a> is similarly guaranteed to experience periodic errors. Hopefully, it is possible to use a similar kind of redundancy in order to correct these errors. This question is substantially more subtle in this case: we can still use a majority vote, but here the space of options is very large and so we need the additional step of having the correct computations negotiate a consensus.</p><p>If this kind of reliability amplification can work, then I think that <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34\">capability amplification</a> is a plausible strategy for aligned learning. If reliability amplification doesn’t work well, then cascading failures could well be a fatal problem for attempts to define a powerful aligned agent as a composition of weak aligned agents.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>This was originally posted <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/reliability-amplification-a96efa115687\">here</a> on 20th October, 2016.</em></p><p><em>The next post in this sequence will be &#x27;Security Amplification&#x27; by Paul Christiano, on Saturday 2nd Feb.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<h1>(Optional) Background: what are epistemic/aleatory uncertainty?</h1><p>Epistemic uncertainty is uncertainty about <strong>which model of a phenomenon is correct.</strong>  It can be reduced by learning more about how things work.  An example is distinguishing between a fair coin and a coin that lands heads 75% of the time; these correspond to two different models of reality, and you may have uncertainty over which of these models is correct.   </p><p>Aleatory uncertainty can be thought of as &quot;intrinsic&quot; randomness, and as such is <strong>irreducible.  </strong>An example is the randomness in the outcome of a fair coin flip.</p><p>In the context of machine learning, aleatoric randomness can be thought of as irreducible <strong>under the modelling assumptions you&#x27;ve made.</strong><em>  </em>It may be that there is no such thing as intrinsic randomness, and everything is deterministic, if you have the right model and enough information about the state of the world.  But if you&#x27;re restricting yourself to a simple class of models, there will still be many things that appear random (i.e. unpredictable) to your model.</p><p>Here&#x27;s the paper that introduced me to these terms: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04977 </p><h1>Relevance for modelling AI-Xrisk </h1><p>I&#x27;ve previously claimed something like &quot;If running a single copy of a given AI system (let&#x27;s call it SketchyBot) for 1 month has a 5% chance of destroying the world, then running it for 5 years has a 1 - .95**60 ~= ~95% chance of destroying the world&quot;.  A similar argument applied to running many copies of SketchyBot in parallel.  But I&#x27;m suddenly surprised that nobody has called me out on this (that I recall), because this reasoning is valid <strong>only if this 5% risk is an expression of <em>only</em> aleatoric uncertainty.</strong>  </p><p>In fact, this &quot;5% chance&quot; is best understood as combining epistemic and aleatory uncertainty (by integrating over all possible models, according to their subjective probability).  </p><p>Significantly, epistemic uncertainty <strong>doesn&#x27;t have this compounding effect!  </strong>For example, you could two models of how the world could work, one where we are lucky (L), and SketchyBot is completely safe, and another where we are unlucky (U), and running SketchyBot even for 1 day destroys the world (immediately).  If you believe we have a 5% chance of being in world U and a 95% chance of being in world L, then you can roll the dice and run SketchyBot and not incur more than a 5% Xrisk.   </p><p>Moreover, once you&#x27;ve actually run SketchyBot for 1 day, if you&#x27;re still alive, you can conclude that you were lucky (i.e. we live in world L), and SketchyBot is in fact completely safe.  To be clear, I don&#x27;t think that absence of evidence of danger is <strong>strong</strong> evidence of safety in advanced AI systems (because of things like treacherous turns), but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a nontrivial amount of evidence.  And it seems clear that <strong>I was overestimating Xrisk by naively compounding my subjective Xrisk estimates.</strong></p><p>Overall, I think the main takeaway is that <strong>there are plausible models in which we basically just get lucky, and fairly naive approaches at alignment just work.  </strong>I don&#x27;t think we should bank on that, but I think it&#x27;s worth asking yourself where your uncertainty about Xrisk is coming from.  Personally, I still put a lot of weight on models where the kind of advanced AI systems we&#x27;re likely to build are not dangerous by default, but carry some ~constant risk of becoming dangerous for every second they are turned on (e.g. by breaking out of a box, having critical insights about the world, instantiating inner optimizers, etc.).  But I also put some weight on more FOOM-y things and at least a little bit of weight on us getting lucky.</p><h1></h1><p></p>",

The more I dig into these areas, the more I'm convinced they require partial value specification in order to work - they are not fully value-agnostic.</p>\n</body></html>",

Everyone’s seen the Gillette ad. And after <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2019/01/10/curing-the-world-of-men/\">my last post on masculinity</a>, everyone’s been asking me what I think of the Gillette ad.</p><p>Well, I used to shave with Gillette and I’ve dumped them… back in 2014 when I realized that Dollar Shave Club sells basically the same razors for $1 each.</p><p>And the ad? Eh, it’s fine.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/gillette-boys-will-be-boys.jpg?w=900\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure><em>Cringeworthy at times, but fine.</em></span><p>Gillette is a division of a consumer products company selling bathroom items. No one is forced to watch their ads or use their razors. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clayroutledge/status/1085205330177519616\">Clay Routledge put it brilliantly</a>: we are living in an era of woke capitalism in which companies pretend to care about social justice to sell products to people who pretend to hate capitalism. <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2017/03/24/how-the-social-justice-movement-fuels-corporate-capitalism/\">Woke capitalism</a> is silly but it gives Gillette customers what they want, which all you can expect of a corporation.</p><p>In contrast, APA is a professional organization of health care providers, writing guidelines for practicing therapists who deal with vulnerable men who come to them for help. The standards are quite different.</p><p>The content is quite different also.</p><p>Here is a list of things APA considers “harmful”, under the umbrella term of “traditional masculinity”:</p><ul><li>Stoicism.</li><li>Competitiveness.</li><li>Aggression.</li><li>Dominance.</li><li>Anti-femininity.</li><li>Achievement.</li><li>Adventure and risk.</li><li>Violence.</li><li>Providing for loved ones (if you’re a black man).</li></ul><p>Here’s a list of things the Gillette ad is against:</p><ul><li>A mob chasing a teenager.</li><li>Texting someone <em>“FREAK!!!”</em></li><li>Old TV shows.</li><li>Catcalling and butt-grabbing.</li><li>Patronizing your employees.</li><li>Six-year-olds fighting.</li><li>Chanting “boys will be boys” in unison.</li><li>Sexual assault and sexual harassment.</li></ul><p>What do the two lists have in common? Violence, <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1354191-violence-is-never-the-answer\">which is never the answer</a>, is the only answer. Find the traditional man closest to you and ask them how many things on Gillette’s list they approve of; it’s not going to be many. “Traditional” men tend to complain they it’s no longer OK to hold doors open for women or take their kids hunting, not that in good ol’ days you could bully people over text or grope ladies on the street.</p><p>Here are the things Gillette is in favor of:</p><ul><li>Terry Crews.</li><li>Accountability.</li><li>Demonstratively protecting women from other men.</li><li>Fatherhood.</li><li>Using your superior strength to break up fights between smaller males.</li><li>Teaching all of the above to your son.</li></ul><p>Those are remarkably <strong>traditional</strong> male traits and behaviors, in the sense that they are present and praised among men in almost every modern and pre-modern society. With the exception of Mr. Crews, all of those predate the human species.</p><p>Gillette’s ad is in no way against <em>traditional</em> masculinity. The list of behaviors they come out against is referred to as <em>toxic</em> masculinity, including by Gillette themselves.</p><p>Those who hate men or who gain status from pretending to do so will continue to conflate masculinity with the terrible (and not particularly masculine) behaviors portrayed in the first half of the ad. Toxic/traditional is a perfect setup for motte-and-bailey: <em>“I like extreme sports. – Ah, a traditional male. I bet you grope women on the subway.”</em> But it’s equally <em>toxic </em>to conflate Gillette with APA’s attack on traditional manhood.</p><h2>Gillette’s Best Man</h2><p>If I had to pick a role model of masculinity I would name Roger Federer. Federer is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer_career_statistics#Historic_achievements\">the best tennis player ever among men</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_World_Tour_Awards#Stefan_Edberg_Sportsmanship_Award\">best gentleman among tennis players</a>, philanthropist, father of four and husband to one.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/roger-federer-spends-time-with-his-children-at-wimbledon.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p>Federer is also the best exemplar of the not-so-subtle distinction between toxic masculinity and traditional masculinity. Roger has been Gillette spokesperson for more than a decade, and he also makes an absolute mockery of the APA list.</p><p>Stoicism? Federer won tournaments playing through injury, on sweltering Melbourne days and chilly London nights. While the best female tennis player in history garnered a reputation for <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/usopen/6181998/US-Open-2009-Serena-Williams-loses-to-Kim-Clijsters-after-point-penalty-for-foul-mouth-outburst.html\">furious outbursts at umpires</a> and fans, Federer is legendary for never losing his cool.</p><p>Violence? Ok, even Roger <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9X48FqmoJI\">has broken a racket or two</a> in his career (so have I).</p><p>Competitiveness? Among the multitude of tennis records held by Federer are the <a href=\"https://www.sportskeeda.com/slideshow/roger-federer-comebacks-from-2-sets-down\">10 times he came back from two sets down</a> to win a match. I was in the stands for #9 in New York when Federer outlasted Gael Monfils playing one of the best matches of his life. Even after Roger lost the first two sets while hitting 26 unforced errors and being outworked by the athletic Frenchman, not a single person in the crowd doubted Federer’s ability to raise his game and ultimately triumph.</p><p>Providing for loved ones? Yes, <a href=\"https://929voice.fm/roger-federers-charity-closer-to-1-million-children/\">even for black boys</a>.</p><p>Aggression and dominance? When I was young and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer#2006:_Career-best_season\">Federer always won</a>, I used to root against him (because he always won). The same pattern would play out in dozens of Federer matches: the game would proceed evenly until something minor would happen that would shake the confidence of Federer’s opponent a tiny bit. Perhaps the opponent would lose a break point opportunity, or miss an easy shot. And then Roger would transform into <a href=\"https://www.mbird.com/2009/09/darth-federer-and-us-opens-nazareth/\">Darth Federer</a>: a ruthless predator who would pounce on an opponent’s single moment of weakness, breaking his serve and destroying his will to compete in the space of 5 or 10 minutes.</p><p>And yet, the other players on tour would revere Roger, much more than they did the equally talented Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic. The only tennis award voted on by the players themselves is the ATP sportsmanship award, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_World_Tour_Awards#Stefan_Edberg_Sportsmanship_Award\">Federer has won it 13 times</a>.</p><p>What is it that Federer does so well and masculinity-haters resent? <strong>Climbing Hierarchies</strong>. When Federer was #1, he wasn’t just first per the arcane schema of ATP ranking points. He was the best tennis players in the eyes of fans, journalists, sponsors, and, importantly, his opponents. #1 takes tennis skill, but it also takes stoicism, competitiveness, aggression, and dominance.</p><p>And I suspect that it’s <em>hierarchies</em> that those who take issue with the above-listed traits are really against.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/animal-crustacean-lobster-8.jpg?w=900\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure><em>If you say “hierarchy” three times in front of a mirror you</em> <em><a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2018/03/03/jordan-peterson/\">summon the spirit of Jordan Peterson</a>.</em></span><h2>Who Hates Hierarchies?</h2><p>There’s a lot of bitching online about “the war on men”, most of it tedious. <em>Group X thinks that men should have lower status, some guy says ‘no, fuck you!’, more at 10</em>. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30257963-12-rules-for-life?ac=1&from_search=true\">Jordan Peterson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36556202-the-coddling-of-the-american-mind?ac=1&from_search=true\">Jonathan Haidt</a> often get lumped in with that, but they are saying something entirely distinct. Peterson and Haidt are saying that there is a war on certain traits which are commonly coded as masculine: self-reliance, resilience, self-improvement through facing adversity, competence. They describe how parents, schools, and society as a whole discourage those traits, particularly in young people, particularly in young boys.</p><p>When I first encountered their writings, I found it too alarmist. But after reading the APA guidelines I remembered that Peterson and Haidt are both psychologists, the former practicing clinical psychology for twenty years. They saw this coming before everyone else.</p><p>What does a “war on competence” look like? Think of someone trying to get better at their work to get promoted, working on their writing to build an audience for their blog, or practicing a sport to rise in the rankings. Building competence doesn’t happen by itself. It requires focusing on a goal, taking on challenges, dealing with discomfort, risking failure, and overcoming problems on your own. Building competence (and getting recognized for it) is a crucial component of well being for all humans.</p><p>Of course, APA doesn’t mention this. <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/about/policy/boys-men-practice-guidelines.pdf\">All they have to say</a> on the behaviors that build competence is:</p><blockquote>Research suggests that socialization practices that teach boys from an early age to be self-reliant, strong, and to minimize and manage their problems on their own (Pollack, 1995) yield adult men who are less willing to seek mental health treatment.</blockquote><p>If society values a particular skill or achievement (like work, blogging, or tennis) a competence hierarchy will form around it. That’s what it means for society to value a skill: those who display it get social rewards and status. But of course, not every hierarchy is a competence hierarchy. Those who got the rewards have a strong interest in removing the competence aspect, making sure that the goodies keep coming to them and not to more competent challengers.</p><p>This is why, <a href=\"https://jrescribe.com/transcripts/p1139.html\">according to Jordan Peterson</a>, societies need both conservatives and progressives:</p><blockquote>There’s space and necessity for a constant dialogue between the left and right. […]<br/>You have to move forward towards valued things, so you have to have a value hierarchy. There has to be hierarchy because one thing has to be more important than another, or you can’t do anything. […]<br/>No matter what you’re acting out, some people are way better at it than others. Doesn’t matter if it’s basketball or hockey or plumbing or law, as soon as there’s something valuable and you’re doing it collectively there’s a hierarchy.<br/>So then what happens is the hierarchy can get corrupt and rigid and then it stops rewarding competence and it starts rewarding criminality and power. The right-wingers say that we really need to abide by the hierarchies and the left-wingers say: wait a second, your hierarchy can get corrupt and also puts a lot of dispossessed people at the bottom. And that’s not only bad for the dispossessed people, it actually threatens the whole hierarchy.</blockquote><p>The progressive project is often about disrupting corrupt hierarchies, and it has done so successfully many times. But times change, and so do the requirements for identifying which hierarchies are broken.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times#/media/File:The_New_York_Times_newsroom_1942.jpg\">In 1942, the New York Times staff</a> was composed entirely of goofy white dudes. It’s clear that being a goofy white dude is not commensurate with journalistic merit, and the composition of the staff changed. Today, the New York Times staff is a multi-ethnic and gender-diverse group of graduates from a small handful of elite colleges who share a political ideology and worldview. Is this a corrupt hierarchy of journalism or a meritorious one? This is a much harder question to answer.</p><p>Instead of dealing with hard questions, it’s easier to reuse the tricks that worked in the past like saying that any majority-male hierarchy is nefarious and privileged. The APA was quick to point out that 95% of Fortune 500 CEOs are men. So are 80% of Google engineers and 80% of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/list/ls074328260/\">top-grossing actors</a>. Also <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/occ_gender_share_em_1020_txt.htm\">99% of HVAC mechanics</a>, but only 2% of dental hygienists. Are those examples of privilege or of competence?</p><p>The answers to all of the above are “almost certainly both, it’s complicated”. But this answer doesn’t help you climb the hierarchy of progressive politics. To maintain that those are all examples of pure male privilege, one has to completely deny the role of competence. As people on the left compete to demonstrate their commitment to dismantling <em>privilege</em>, the entire concept of <em>competence</em> gets wholly ignored and the pursuit of it is seen as pathological. I think that this impulse is at the root of the “war on competence”.</p><p>(The opposite happens to conservatives, who call every blatant example of privilege a meritocracy. Consider the belief that multimillion-heir <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/01/17/many-voters-think-trumps-a-self-made-man-what-happens-when-you-tell-them-otherwise-224019\">Donald Trump is a self-made man</a>.)</p><p>The traditionally masculine [1] traits are those required to climb hierarchies of competence: competitiveness, physical and emotional resilience, adventurous risk-taking, perseverance, the drive to achieve and overcome. Like all traits, they become vices when pushed too far. The most competitive basketball player of all time <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1943095-top-10-stories-of-michael-jordan-being-the-greatest-jerk-of-all-time#slide11\">was a notorious jerk</a>. People “kill themselves” in demanding careers or literally <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-triathlons-casualties/triathlon-deaths-not-rare-and-risks-rise-with-age-idUSKCN1BT2LO\">kill themselves running triathlons</a> while ignoring signs of pain and danger. Entrepreneurs bet big on themselves and lose, or sacrifice what they can’t afford to in order to win.</p><p>But ascending hierarchies of competence is vital even for the 99% of us who will not become elite athletes, CEOs, or superstars. Improving at a valuable skill is meaningful, and rising through the ranks provides validation of that meaning. It brings self-confidence and fulfillment. It demonstrates your worth to others and to yourself. When developed well, the masculine traits are virtues independent of any competition. They enable people to simply <em>livebetter</em> in the world, enjoying success as a well-deserved reward rather than a fleeting stroke of luck, and seeing setbacks as challenges rather than tragedies.</p><p>How do young people learn to develop masculine traits into masculine virtues? Schools and media are two of the institutions that are tasked with teaching young people, but those two institutions are among the most deeply entrenched in the progressive ideology that rejects competence and sees masculine traits as negative. You can turn to parents or friends, but not everyone has good role models around them. You can listen to a Jordan Peterson lecture, but he’s liable to ramble about Jesus for hours on end.</p><p>Or, you can turn on the TV and watch some sports, and then sign up for a local rec league.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/women-sports-hierarchy.jpg?w=900\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure><em>There’s nothing anti-feminine about masculine virtues.</em></span><h2>What Sports Taught Me</h2><p>I hold a lot of opinions that are hugely controversial outside the rationalist community but are well subscribed within it. That <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2017/12/10/worried-about-ai/\">self-improving AI is an existential threat</a>, that <a href=\"http://elephantinthebrain.com/\">status seeking drives most of social behavior</a>, that you should <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2016/12/18/multiplicitous/\">correct for multiple hypothesis testing</a>. I hold one opinion that is hugely controversial among rationalists and is unremarkable everywhere else: that the three hours I spent watching soccer last Saturday were time well spent.</p><p>I want to write one day about the beauty of sports as a deep and complex art form and on the link between watching professional athletes and one’s own physical development. But sports are not just entertainment, they’re a human activity built on the values of sportsmanship, and those values are worth paying attention to.</p><h3>1. Protecting the game is more important than winning</h3><p>There’s a big difference between fans of competing political parties and of competing NBA teams. The former see only conflict in everything they care about. But the latter have something in common: their love of basketball. For this reason, almost all fans want their team to win fairly, and not by sabotaging opponents or bribing referees. Winning an NBA game is pointless if you destroy the NBA by cheating.</p><p>Sports fans recognize that the rules of the game are paramount. Not all the rules are written, of course, and there’s room to push the boundary. But ultimately the participants in the game establish collectively what is cheating and what is fair play, and they’re quick to punish cheaters.</p><p>Contrast this with journalists cannibalizing their own industry by replacing objective reporting <a href=\"https://medium.com/@almightypress/how-clickbait-is-destroying-journalism-aae1b635361d\">with clickbait and scandal</a>. Companies like Gawker Media took pride in destroying journalism norms for page views. And for a while, Gawker “won” the competition for eyeballs and attention. Now <a href=\"https://profilebooks.com/conspiracy.html\">Gawker is gone</a>, and the entire industry is in a death spiral.</p><h3>2. Opponents are not enemies</h3><p>A corollary to #1: the goal of sports is to outperform your opponent, not to destroy them. Even MMA fighters (<a href=\"https://www.marca.com/en/more-sports/2018/10/08/5bbba79746163f72058b4568.html\">for the most part</a>) look to outfight their opponent in the cage, not to harm or humiliate them. At the end of the match, they are colleagues again.</p><p>The opposite is true in culture war and politics. People spend all their effort sticking it to the outgroup: getting someone silenced, banished, fired, ridiculed. Whether this actually helps your own cause or the groups you claim to fight for is an afterthought. The 35-day government shutdown harmed both Republican and Democrat voters, while both Trump and the House Democrats seemed to care more about making sure the other loses than helping their constituents.</p><p>Sports fandom is a channel for tribal impulses, but largely a benign one at that. Few fans and even fewer athletes forget the humanity of the person they compete against and the respect they’re owed. Outside of sports, few seem to remember that.</p><h3>3. It matters how good you are today, not what you did yesterday</h3><p>Many people react to accolades and achievements by lowering their own standards. Think of an <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/12/thank-you-gmu-econ.html\">academic wasting their tenure</a> on prestige squabbles instead of exploring bold ideas, or anyone on Twitter with a blue check next to their name.</p><p>In sports, the opposite is true. Winning a title grants you accolades, but it makes the road tougher in the future. Opponents will learn your strengths and weaknesses, fans will expect more of you. Roger Federer’s past success doesn’t earn him a pass, it just guarantees that <a href=\"https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Roger_Federer/66216/-win-over-roger-federer-was-stefanos-tsitsipas-s-turning-point--coach/\">every young opponent</a> tries to play the game of their life against him.</p><p>An achievement can be a temptation to rest on your laurels or an opportunity to raise your game further. Our instincts push us toward the former, sports teach us the latter.</p><h3>4. You will get hurt. That’s OK</h3><p>In a lifetime of playing soccer, I suffered bruised shins, twisted ankles, balls to the face, balls to the balls, elbows to the ribs, and a torn calf muscle. I also learned that none of the above is a big deal, certainly nothing worth sacrificing something as enjoyable as playing soccer over. If you watch sports you see athletes get hurt and recover all the time, but you almost never hear them wish they hadn’t started in the sport in the first place.</p><p>There are many fun things we can do with our bodies. The most fun involve some risk of pain and harm: snowboarding, getting tattoos, climbing trees, having kids, lifting, BDSM, soccer, cliff jumping, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/in-defense-of-punch-bug-68fcec56cd6b\">punch bug</a>. Sports provides exposure to physical risks, letting you decide which activities are worth the bruises.</p><p>It’s possible to live life bruise-free, but I’m not sure you can call that “living”.</p><h3>5. You will lose a lot. That’s OK</h3><p>I noticed a strange thing recently: almost all my rationalist friends who are into sports also play competitive card games like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, and Artifact. <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/11/22/review-artifact/\">After much cajoling</a>, I decided to jump in. And then it took me a while to get used to all the losing.</p><p>Most single-player video games, which are what I played before, are balanced to let the player “win” 80-90% of the time. Dark Souls aside, when a single-player game presents you with a challenge you can confidently expect to deal with it. Movies, adventure books, and single-player games often rely on the trope of “succeeding against all odds”, and yet the odds are very much stacked in the protagonist’s favor.</p><p>But in competitive games, you get pwned. A lot [2]. In fact, in games like Hearthstone, you will win exactly 45-50% of your games no matter how good you are. If you work hard at it, you will win 55% of your games for a short while before going back down to 45%, but with a higher rank number next to your name.</p><p>In sports, the odds are even tougher. Each year 32 NFL teams compete for a single trophy, which means that fans of 97% of football teams will not celebrate at the end of the year. Sometimes, a team’s season ends through no fault of its own: a bounce of the ball, <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article224842270.html\">a coin flip</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/20/18190982/saints-rams-nfc-championship-game-missed-pass-interference-nickell-robey-coleman-tommylee-lewis\">a blown call</a>.</p><p>But that’s how life is. Achieving anything meaningful is hard and entails a lot of failure on the way. As for NFL fans, as for everyone, it is important to take joy and pride in small achievements and marginal improvements along the way. And as for losses:</p><blockquote>I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship.<br/>– <a href=\"http://time.com/4845150/chief-justice-john-roberts-commencement-speech-transcript/\">Justice John Roberts</a> (h/t Slarphen for the quote attribution)</blockquote><h3>6. In the end, it’s all up to you</h3><p>Chance, bad calls and all the rest play an important role in deciding the outcomes of sports events, but sports fans ultimately have little patience for those who shift blame and responsibility. No one wants to litigate old grievances once the name is engraved on the trophy and a new season starts.</p><p>While sports teaches us that luck plays a role in outcomes, it also trains us to behave as if that is not the case. The team that benefitted from a lucky bounce was good enough to be in the position of a single bounce from victory, the team that lost weren’t good enough to ensure a margin for victory. Winners rarely apologize for luck, and losers are mocked if they complain about it.</p><p>Many institutions send the opposite message. They say: if you failed, it’s not your fault. It was done <em>to</em> you, taken <em>from </em>you. The system will make it right and fix the injustice, all you must do is to surrender your life to the system.</p><p>Assigning responsibility for outcomes to your own actions is called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control\">internal locus of control</a>” in psychology. It is associated with a need for achievement, and also with a lower incidence of depression. The latter result is from <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0021-843X.97.3.357\">a study published by APA in 1988</a> before it was trying to cure men of manliness.</p><p>The lessons of sports are useful and important, but it’s not enough to read about them. Like all virtues, they require time to internalize by observing them in role models and practicing them in your own life. Sports are full of role models, both men and women, who have honed those traits to virtues. They are also full of cautionary examples of athletes who took them too far.</p><p>When one side of the culture war spectrum rejects all masculine traits and the other side uncritically glorifies them, watching Federer play a tennis match is the balanced meal that your soul needs.</p><h3>Footnotes</h3><p>[1] I am basically using “masculine traits” to mean “traits for climbing competitive hierarchies”.</p><p>This is not an arbitrary definition. Males of many species have a much higher tendency than women to measure themselves against other man and arrange themselves in a hierarchy. The root cause of this is that the reproductive prospects of females are more equal, while those of males are highly varied – men need to prove their worth in a hierarchy to get to mate.</p><p>If you don’t buy the evolutionary argument, it’s not important to the main point I’m making. Consider my use of “masculine traits” a simple shorthand for “hierarchy-climbing traits”.</p><p>[2] Artifact is particularly brutal for starting players. It’s hugely complex with barely a tutorial, the feedback loops are long which makes it harder to learn quickly, and the matchmaking will pit you against 14-year-olds from Slovakia who will drink your blood.</p><p>It does become very rewarding after you spend the time learning the game. There’s nothing quite like edging the opponent by one lane with a brilliant combination of cards and being cursed at in Slovak. You can improve via phantom drafts, or by finding me on Steam for a casual match; my username is “Putanumonit”.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>This post aims to provide a strong philosophical foundation for <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6t5vRHrwPDi5C9hYr/motivating-a-semantics-of-logical-counterfactuals#comments\">logical counterfactuals</a>, while sketching out an informal scheme that will hopefully be formalised further in the future. I believe that providing such a philosophical foundation is important for the same reasons that Sam listed in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6t5vRHrwPDi5C9hYr/motivating-a-semantics-of-logical-counterfactuals\">Motivating a Semantics of Logical Counterfactuals</a>.</p><p><strong>Introductory Material</strong></p><ul><li>Miri&apos;s Functional Decision Theory (FDT) <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060\">paper</a> defines subjunctive dependence to refer to the situation where two decision process involve the same calculation. This can result from causation, such as if I calculate an equation, then tell you the answer and we both implement a decision based on this sum. It can also occur non-causally, such as a prediction being linked to a decision as per Newcomb&apos;s problem. The problem of logical counterfactuals can be characterised as figuring out what processes subjunctively depend on other processes, so that we can apply FDT.</li><li>In the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NcA3dMJoWWEN4BQet/logical-counterfactuals-and-the-cooperation-game\">Co-operation Game</a>, I argued that logical counterfactuals are more about your knowledge of the state of the world than the world itself. Suppose there are two people who can choose A or B. Suppose that a predictor knows that both people will choose A conditional on them being told one of the following two facts a) the other person will choose A b) the other person will choose the same as you. Then whether your decision is modelled to subjunctively depend on the other person depends on which of the two facts you are told. Going further than the original post, one might be told a) and the other b), so that the first sees themselves as not subjunctively linked to the second, while the second sees themselves as subjunctively linked to the first.</li><li>&quot;Your knowledge of the state of the world&quot; can be explicated as being about internally consistent counterfactuals, which we&apos;ll label <em>Raw Counterfactuals</em>. When there are multiple raw counterfactuals consistent with your state of knowledge, you can pick the one with the highest utility.</li><li>However, there will also be cases where only a single counterfactual is consistent with your state of knowledge, which results in a rather <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XAeWHqQTWjJmzB4k6/reference-post-trivial-decision-problem\">trivial problem</a>. Consider for example <em>Transparent Newcomb&apos;s Problem</em>, where a perfect predictor places the million in a transparent box if and only if it predicts that you will one-box if it does. If you see the million, you know that you must have one-boxed so it doesn&apos;t strictly make sense to ask what you should do in this situation. Instead, we&apos;ll have to ask something slightly different instead. So, I&apos;ve slightly modified my position since writing the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NcA3dMJoWWEN4BQet/logical-counterfactuals-and-the-cooperation-game\">Co-operation Game</a>: in some situations logical counterfactuals will be defined relative to an imagined, rather than actual epistemic state. We will construct these states by erasing some information as described later in the post.</li><li>Other degenerative cases include when you already know what decision you&apos;ll make or when you have the ability to figure it out. For example, when you have perfect knowledge of the environment and the agent, unless you run into issues with unprovability. Note that degeneracy is more common than you might think since knowing, for example, that it is a utility maximiser, tells you its exact behaviour in situations without options that are tied. Again, in these cases, the answer to the question, &quot;What should the agent do?&quot; is, &quot;The only action consistent with the problem statement&quot;. However, as we&apos;ll see, it is possible sometimes to make these questions less trivial if you&apos;re willing to accept a slight tweak to the problem statement.</li><li>We&apos;ll consider two kinds of problems, acknowledging that these aren&apos;t the only types. In external problems, we imagine decisions from the perspective of a theoretical, unbounded, non-embedded observer who exists outside of the problem statement. Clearly we can&apos;t fully adopt the perspective of such an external agent, but describing the high-level details will usually suffice. Critically, in the external perspective, the observer can have goals, such as choosing the agent with the maximum utility, without those being the goals of the agent within the problem.</li><li>In (fully) reflective problems, we imagine decisions from the perspective of an agent considering its own decisions or potential decisions with full knowledge of its own source code. These problems will complicate the counterfactuals since the agent&apos;s goals limit the kind of agent that it could be. For example, an agent that wants to maximise utility should only search over the possibility space where it is a utility maximiser.</li><li>Making this distinction more explicit: An external problem would ask &quot;What decision maximises utility?&quot;, as opposed to a reflective problem which asks: &quot;What decision maximises utility for a utility maximiser?&quot;. This distinction will mainly be important here in terms of when it makes a problem trivial or not.</li><li>The external/reflective distinction is very similar to the difference between embedded and non-embedded problems, but external problems can include embedded agents, just from the perspective of a non-embedded agent. So we can do a surprising amount of our theorising from within the external perspective.</li></ul><p><strong>Raw Counterfactuals</strong></p><ul><li>Raw counterfactuals are produced as follows: Starting with the <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation\">territory</a><a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation\"> </a>we use some process to produce a causal model. We can then imagine constructing different models by switching out or altering parts of the model. These represent a coherent concept seperate from any discussion of decisions. In so far as we care about w<em>hat could have been,</em> we need to ultimately relate our claims to raw counterfactuals as inconsistent models c<em>ould not have been.</em></li><li>Causal Decision Theory uses its own notion of counterfactuals, which we&apos;ll term <em>Decision Counterfactuals. </em>These are created by performing <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dhGGnB2oxBP3m5cBc/can-counterfactuals-be-true\">world surgery on models of causal processes</a>. Unlike raw counterfactuals, decision counterfactuals are inconsistent. Suppose that you actually defect in the Prisoner&apos;s Dilemma, but we are considering the counterfactual where you cooperate. Up until the point of the decision you are the kind of person who defects, but when we arrive at the decision, you magically cooperate.</li><li>Decision counterfactuals are useful because they approximate raw counterfactuals. Performing world surgery all the way back in time requires would require a lot of work. In theoretical decision problems it is usually easy to imagine a raw counterfactual that would match the problem description and provide the same answer as the decision counterfactual. In practical decision problems, we don&apos;t have the data to do this.</li><li>Unfortunately, this approximation breaks down when performing world surgery to make a counterfactual decision consistent with the past requires us to change an element of the environment that is important for the specific problem. For example, in <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Newcomb&apos;s_problem\">Newcomb&apos;s problem</a>, changing your current decision requires changing your past self which involves changing a predictor which is considered part of the environment. In this case, it makes sense to fall back to raw counterfactuals and build a new decision theory on top.</li><li>Functional decision theory, as normally characterised, is closer to this ideal as world surgery isn&apos;t just performed on your decision, but also on all decisions that subjunctively depend on you. This removes a bunch of inconsistencies, however, we&apos;ve still introduced an inconsistency by assuming that f(x)=b when f(x) really equals a. The raw counterfactual approach provides a stronger foundation because it avoids this issue. However, since proof-based FDT is very effective at handling reflective problems, it would be worthwhile rebuilding it upon this new foundation.</li><li>Let&apos;s consider Newcomb&apos;s problem from the external perspective. The external observer is trying to maximise utility rather than the agent within the problem, so there is no restriction on whether the agent can one-box or two-box whilst being consistent with the problem statement. We can then immediately observe that if we use raw counterfactuals, the reward only depends on the agent&apos;s ultimate decision and agents that one-box score better than those who don&apos;t. Simple cases like this which allow multiple consistent counterfactuals don&apos;t require erasure.</li><li>On the other hand, there are problems which only allow a single raw counterfactual and hence require us to tweak the problem to make it well-defined. Consider, for examples, Transparent Newcomb&apos;s, where if you see money in the box, you know that you will receive exactly $1 million. Some people say this fails to account for the agent in the simulator, but it&apos;s entirely possible that Omega may be able to figure out what action you will take based on high level reasoning, as opposed having to run a complete simulation of you. We&apos;ll describe later a way of tweaking the problem statement into something that is both consistent and non-trivial.</li></ul><p><strong>General Approach to Logical Counterfactuals</strong></p><ul><li>We will now attempt to produce a more solid theory of external problems using FDT. This will allow us to interpret decision problems where only one decision is consistent with the problem statement in a non-trivial way.</li><li>FDT frames logical counterfactuals as &quot;What would the world be like if f(x)=b instead of a?&quot; which doesn&apos;t strictly make sense as noted in the discussion on raw counterfactuals. Two points: a) I think it should be clear that this question only makes sense in terms of thinking of perturbations of the map and not as a direct claim about the territory (see <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation\">map and territory</a>). b) We&apos;ll address this problem by proposing a different approach for foundations, which these proof-based approaches should ultimately be justified in terms of.</li><li>There are two possible paths towards a more consistent theory of logical counterfactuals for these situations. In both cases we interpret the question of what it would mean to change the output of a function as an informal description of a similar question that is actually well-defined. The first approach is see what consequences can be logically deduced from f(x)=b while implementing a strategy to prevent us from deducing incorrect statements from the inconsistencies. This is often done by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Bj244uWzDBXvE2N2S/a-model-of-udt-with-a-halting-oracle\">playing chicken with the universe</a>. We will term this a paraconsistent approach, even though it doesn&apos;t explicitly make use of paraconsistent logic as it is paraconsistent in spirit.</li><li>An alternative approach would be to interpret this sentence as making claims about raw counterfactuals<em>. </em>In FDT terms, the raw counterfactual approach finds an f&apos; such that f&apos;(x)=b and also with certain as of yet unstated similarities to f and substitute this into all subjunctively linked processes. The paraconsistent approach is easier to do informally, but I suspect that the raw counterfactually approach would be more amenable to formalisation and provides more philosophical insight into what is actually going on. In so far as the paraconsistent approach may be more convenient for an implementation perspective than the first, we can justify it by tying it to raw counterfactuals.</li></ul><p><strong>Decisions</strong></p><ul><li>Now that we&apos;ve outlined the broad approach, we should dig more into the question of what exactly it means to make a decision. As I explained in a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YpdTSt4kRnuSkn63c/the-prediction-problem-a-variant-on-newcomb-s\">previous post</a>, there&apos;s a sense in which you don&apos;t so much &apos;make&apos; a decision as implement one. If you make something, it implies that it didn&apos;t exist before and now it does. In the case of decisions, it nudges you towards believing that the decision you were going to implement wasn&apos;t set, then you made a decision, and then it was. However, when &quot;you&quot; and the environment are defined down to the atom, you can only implement one decision. It was always the case from the start of time that you were going to implement that decision.</li><li>We note that if you have perfect information about the agent and the environment, you need to forget or at least pretend to forget some information about the agent so that we can produce counterfactual versions of the agent who decide slightly differently. See Shminux&apos;s post on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/436REfuffDacQRbzq/logical-counterfactuals-are-low-res\">Logical Counterfactuals are Low Res</a> for a similar argument, but framed slightly differently. The key difference is that I&apos;m not suggesting just adding noise to the model, but forgetting specific information that doesn&apos;t affect the outcome.</li><li>In Transparent Newcomb&apos;s, it would be natural to erase the knowledge that the box is full. This would then result in two counterfactuals: a) the one where the agent sees an empty box and two boxes, b) the one where the agent sees a full box and one boxes. It would be natural to relax the scope of who we care about from the agent who sees a million in the box to the agent at the end of the problem regardless of what they see. If we do so, we then have a proper decision problem and we can see that one-boxing is better.</li><li>Actually there&apos;s a slight hitch here. In order to define the outcome an agent receives, we need to define what the predictor will predict when an agent sees the box containing the million. But it is impossible to place a two-boxer in this situation. We can resolve this by defining the predictor as simulating the agent responding to an input representing an inconsistent situation as I&apos;ve described in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AKkFh3zKGzcYBiPo7/counterfactuals-for-perfect-predictors\">Counterfactuals for Perfect Predictors</a>.</li><li>In order to imagine a consistent world, when we imagine a different &quot;you&quot;, we must also imagine the environment interacting with that different &quot;you&quot; so that, for example, the predictor makes a different prediction. Causal decision theorists construct these counterfactuals incorrectly and hence they believe that they can change their decision without changing the prediction. They fail to realise that they can&apos;t actually &quot;change&quot; their decision as there is a single decision that they will inevitably implement. I suggest replacing &quot;change a decision&quot; with &quot;shift counterfactuals&quot; when it is important to be able to think clearly about these topics. It also clarifies why the prediction can change without backwards causation (my <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YpdTSt4kRnuSkn63c/the-prediction-problem-a-variant-on-newcomb-s\">previous post</a> on Newcomb&apos;s problem contains further material on why this isn&apos;t an issue).</li></ul><p><strong>Erasure</strong></p><ul><li>Here&apos;s how the erasure may proceed for the example of Transparent&apos;s Newcomb Problem. Suppose we erase all information about what decision the agent is going to make. This also requires erasing the fact that you see a million in the transparent box. Then we look at all counterfactually possible agents and notice that the reward depends only on whether you are an agent who ultimately one-boxes or an agent who two-boxes. Those who one-box see the million and then receive it, those who two-box see no money in the transparent box and receive $1000 only. The counterfactual involving one-boxing performs better than that involving two-boxing, so we endorse one-boxing.</li><li>Things become more complicated if we want to erase less information about the agent. For example, we might want an agent to know that it is a utility maximiser as this might be relevant to evaluating the outcome the agent will receive from future decisions. Suppose that if you one-box in Transparent Newcomb&apos;s you&apos;ll then be offered a choice of $1000 or $2000, but if you two-box you&apos;ll be offered $0 or $10 million. We can&apos;t naively erase all information about your decision process in order to compute a counterfactual of whether you should one-box or two-box. Otherwise, we end up with a situation where, for example, there are agents who one-box and get different rewards. Here the easiest solution is to &quot;collapse&quot; all of the decisions and ask about a policy instead that covers all three decisions that may be faced. Then we can calculate the expectations without producing any inconsistencies in the counterfactuals as it then becomes safe to erase the knowledge that it is a utility maximiser.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/5-and-10\">5 and 10 problem</a> doesn&apos;t occur with the forgetting approach. Compare: If you keep the belief that you are a utility maximiser then the only choice you can implement is 10 so we don&apos;t have a decision problem. We can define all the possible strategies as follows, p probability of choosing 5 and 1-p probability of choosing 10, so forget everything about yourself except that you are one of these strategies. There&apos;s no downside as there is no need for an agent to know whether or not it is a utility maximiser. So we can solve the 5 and 10 problem without epsilon exploration.</li><li>When will we be able to use this forgetting technique? One initially thought might be the same scope FDT is designed to be optimal on - problems where the reward only depends on your outputs or predicted outputs. Because only the output or predicted output matters and not the algorithm, these can be considered fair, unlike a problem where an alphabetical decision theorist (picks the first decision ordered in alphabetical order) is rewarded and every other type of agent is punished.</li><li>However, some problems where this condition doesn&apos;t hold also seem fair. Like suppose there are long programs and short programs (in terms of running time). Further suppose programs can output either A or B. The reward is then determined purely based on these two factors. Now suppose that there exists a program that can calculate the utilities in each of these four worlds and then based upon this either terminate immediately or run for a long time and then output its choice of A or B. Assume that if it terminates immediately after the decision it&apos;ll qualify as a short program, while if it terminates after a long time it is a long program. Then, as a first approximation, we can say that this is also a fair problem since it is possible to win in all cases.</li><li>It&apos;s actually slightly more complex than this. An AI usually doesn&apos;t have to win on only one problem. Adding code to handle more situations will extend the running time and may prevent such an AI from always being able to choose the dominant option. An AI might also want to do things like double check calculations or consider whether it is actually running on consistent outcomes, so winning the problem might put limitations on the AI in other ways.</li><li>But nonetheless, so long as we can write such a program that picks the best option, we can call the problem &quot;fair&quot; in a limited sense. It&apos;s possible to extend our definition of &quot;fair&quot; further. Like suppose that it&apos;s impossible to analyse all the options and still return in a short amount of time. This isn&apos;t a problem if the maximum utility is in a long option.</li><li>In regards to running time, we can also end up with a non-binary notion of &quot;fair&quot; according to how much extra processing a program can squeeze in before having to decide the short option. This limits the ability of the AI to check/recheck its work and examine its philosophical assumptions before having to make the decision.</li></ul><p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p><ul><li>Logical counterfactuals are often framed in such a way that it seems that we should be building a model of subjunctive dependence directly from the atoms in the universe. Instead we produce these from causal model that identifies the current agent and a model of forgetting. This makes our job much easier as it allows us to disentangle this problem from many of the fundamental issues in ontology and philosophy of science.</li><li>Comparing the method in this post to playing <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Bj244uWzDBXvE2N2S/a-model-of-udt-with-a-halting-oracle\">chicken with the universe</a>: using raw counterfactuals clarifies that such proof-based methods are simply tricks that allow us to act as though we&apos;ve forgotten without forgetting.</li><li>In general, I would suggest that logical counterfactuals are about knowing which information to erase such that you can produce perfectly consistent counterfactuals. Further, I would suggest that if you can&apos;t find information to erase that produces perfectly consistent counterfactuals then you don&apos;t have a decision theory problem. Future work could explore exactly when this is possible and general techniques for making this work as the current exploration has been mainly informal.</li></ul><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>I changed my terminology from Point Counterfactuals to Decision Counterfactuals and Timeless Counterfactuals to Raw Counterfactuals in this post as this better highlights where these models come from.</li></ul><p><em>This post was written with the support of the <a href=\"http://eahotel.org/\">EA</a> <a href=\"http://eahotel.org/\">Hotel</a></em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Epistemic Status: Stuff that keeps not going away so I should write it up I suppose. Brief spoiler-free review, then main talk will be spoilerific.</p><h1>Spoiler-Free Review</h1><p>I read the trilogy a few months ago, on general strong reviews and lack of a better known science fiction option I hadn’t already read.</p><p>I was hoping to get a Chinese perspective, some realistic physics (as per Tyler Cowen’s notes) and a unique take on various things. To that extent I got what I came for. Book felt very Chinese, or at least very <em>not American</em>. Physics felt like it was trying far more than most other science fiction, and the consequences are seriously explored. Take on that and many things felt unique versus other books I’ve read, in ways I will discuss in the main section.</p><p>What I didn’t feel I got was a series that was high enough quality to justify its awards and accolades, or allow me to fully recommend reading it to others. It’s not bad, it has some great moments and ideas and I don’t mind having read it, but I was hoping for better. That’s fine. That is probably a lot about my expectations getting too high, as I can’t point to (in the limited selection of things I’ve read) recent science fiction I think is even as good. Like other genres, read mostly old books is wise advice that I follow less than I should.</p><p>It is a reasonable decision to do any of: Not read the book and not continue further, not read the book and allow it to be spoiled here, to read some and see if you like it, or to read the whole thing.</p><p>This long post is long. Very long. Also inessential. Apologies. I definitely didn’t have the time to make it shorter. Best to get it out there for those who want it, and to move on to other things.</p><h1>All The Spoilers – The Plot Summary</h1><p>(This unfolds everything in linear order, the books rightly keep some things mysterious at some points by telling events somewhat out of order. This is what I remember and consider important, rather than an attempt to include everything. There’s a lot that happens that’s interesting enough to be included!)</p><h2>Book I – The Three Body Problem</h2><p>Communist China during the cultural revolution was really bad. Reeling from a combination the cultural revolution and its murder of (among others) her father and all reasonable discourse, her forced exile to the countryside, and environmental panic raised by a combination of Silent Spring and the actual terrible environmental choices and consequences she sees around her, Ye Wenjie despairs for humanity. When she sees that contact has been made with extra-terrestrial intelligence, with a message warning us not to reply as doing so would give away our location and we would be conquered, she replies asking for an alien invasion from Trisolaris, and goes on to found the ETO, the Earth-Trisolaris Organization, with the explicit aim of betraying humanity and giving Earth over to the aliens.</p><p>Because we are so awful that it couldn’t help be an improvement, right? Using a game called Three Body that illustrates the origins of Trisolaris, the ETO recruits huge portions of the world’s intellectual classes, largely because of environmental concerns and humanity’s other moral failings, making them willing to betray humanity in favor of an alien invasion.</p><p>Trisolaris sends an invasion fleet that will arrive from Alpha Centauri in 400 years. Worried that our technological advancement is so rapid we will by then defeat them, they send protons to Earth that they have ‘unfolded’ to transform into sophons, which they can use to communicate faster than light in both directions, and which can be programmed to monitor everything on Earth, mess with particle accelerator experiments to prevent technological progress, and do a few other tricks. The crazy physics results and other ETO efforts to suppress science drive many physicists to suicide. The ETO convinces the world’s intellectual elite to run a cultural campaign against science, as science is the only thing they fear. In particular they go after one particular person, the not-very-virtuous-or-brilliant-seeming astrophysicist Luo Ji. These symptoms are what lets the authorities around the world to investigate and figure out they are facing the ETO, which they manage to infiltrate and then mostly shut down. But scientific progress is still blocked by the sophons, so Earth seems doomed to fall to the invasion fleet.</p><h2>Book II – The Dark Forest</h2><p>With Earth under total surveillance and no prospect of scientific progress, humanity sets out to prepare for what it calls the doomsday battle. Earth’s resources are redirected to two efforts. An epic space fleet is constructed to attempt to battle the invasion, with so much being invested in these efforts, <em>despite the four hundred year time frame, </em>that from the start the world soon expects rationing of basic goods and bad economic times. A second effort is the wallfacer program. Four special humans are chosen to develop secret strategies, since the one place sophons can’t intrude is the inside of a human brain. The job of the wallfacers is, given unlimited resources, to develop a strategy to stopping the invasion, but keep it secret and use misdirection and deception to ensure that the enemy does not figure out their plans. Everyone is required to do as the wallfacers ask, without question or explanation, and everything they do is considered part of their plan one way or another.</p><p>The four chosen are: A scorched-Earth terrorist from Venezuela who is then hailed as a master of strategy and asymmetric warfare, a former US secretary of defense and veteran officer, an English neuroscientist, and then Luo Ji because they couldn’t help but notice that the ETO <em>really, really </em>wanted Luo Ji dead even if they had no idea why. Luo Ji wants no part of this, but his refusals are taken to be part of his plan, so instead he uses his position to set himself up for a nice quiet life.</p><p>The ETO then assigns each a ‘wallbreaker’ to uncover the wallfacer’s plan and reveal it to the world. Humanity gets poetic justice from its first three Wallfacers, all of whose plans are revealed as not only huge wastes of resources but active dangers. The scorched-Earth terrorist tries to use a Mercury base as a means to cause Mercury to fall into the Sun and cause a collapse of the entire solar system, thinking he can hold it hostage to force a compromise. The general creates a swarm of automated ships that he intends to use to betray Earth’s fleet in order to then try and somehow trick the invasion fleet. The neuroscientist creates a brainwashing machine, claims he’s using it to convince our officers we’ll win, but actually uses it to brainwash all volunteers with utter faith that we will lose. None of the plans have a practical chance of working even on their own merits, and all three cause humanity to collectively react in horror.</p><p>That leaves Luo Ji, who they force to work by forcing his wife and child into hibernation as hostages. Luo Ji thinks for a long time and then decides to ‘cast a catastrophic spell on the planets of a star’ using the same solar broadcast technique we used to communicate with Trisolaris in the first place, broadcasting the location of another star out to the broader universe, as a test that will take a hundred years to verify. Trisolarian allies almost kill him with an engineered virus, and he is sent into hibernation until we can find a cure.</p><p>Upon awakening, Lou Ji finds a transformed world. There has been an economic and ecological collapse called The Great Ravine, caused by the devotion of all resources to the war effort, but when humanity gave up on the war and went back to trying to live until the end, the economy recovered underground and the Earth recovered on its own once left alone. Our fundamental physics was still blocked, but our tech still got a lot better, and eventually we got around to building a fleet, which can even go faster than the Trisolarian fleet (0.15c versus 0.1c) and everyone is confident of victory once the Trisolarian fleet arives.</p><p>He learns that his ‘spell’ worked, the sun in question shattered by a photoid. He also faces a computer system trying to kill him thanks to an old virus engineered to target him, which he narrowly escapes multiple times until the authorities realize what is happening. Then he goes about adjusting to living out his life.</p><p>People are so confident of victory that when a probe arrives in advance of the fleet, everyone gets into super close formation because they’re fighting over bragging rights regarding this historic moment, rather than thinking about what would happen if the probe might try something. The main battle they prepare for is which continent’s ships will get the place of honor. Only two ships are semi-accidentally held back and no one gives that much thought. Those two ships flee the solar system.</p><p>The probe tries something, which is to ram and destroy all Earth’s ships, because the probe is super fast and is made of a super-dense material organized around the strong nuclear force, and Earth’s ships aren’t. Nothing we have can do anything to the probe. The probe then proceeds to Earth. Luo Ji expects it to kill him, but instead the probe shuts down our ability to communicate with the outside via the Sun, as we had done previously to communicate with Trisolaris and for Luo Ji to cast his spell on the star.</p><p>It seems too late, and all is lost. Luo Ji had realized that the universe is a ‘dark forest’ in which any civilization that reveals its location is destroyed, because resources are limited but life grows exponentially. If everyone out there knows where you are, <em>one </em>of them will wipe you out, even if most leave you alone. That was how his ‘spell’ worked.</p><p>Thanks to his spell, Luo Ji is now identified as our last hope and treated like a messiah. The wallfacer project is revived, he is given carte blanche and a blank check. But when he seems to be devoting his time and energy to the details of an early warning system that can’t possibly save us, people turn on him. He is treated as a pariah, not allowed on buses, the man who betrayed us and gives us false hope. Scientists develop theories that the sun he cast a spell on being destroyed was a coincidence, as it was about to go nova or something right at that time, never mind the probability of that on such a short time frame.</p><p>All this time, the one thing more reviled than Luo Ji is ‘escapism’. It is treated as the ultimate crime against humanity to attempt to flee the solar system. Never mind that this is the only realistic way that humanity could survive, or at least it is the only way we might survive. The one thing everyone agrees on is that if we can’t all survive, no one can be allowed to try and survive, so all such attempts must be stopped at all costs.</p><p>Thus, we have very little to attempt escape with. All we have left are the the two ships left out of the final battle, one ship that had been hijacked when someone who wanted that more than anything was given temporary full control over a ship, including the ability to take it out of the solar system, while the ship was checked for ‘defeatist’ officers who had been given the brainwashing treatment, and three ships pursuing that one ship.</p><p>Or rather we only have two ships. Both groups of ships realized that the other ships in their fleet comprised vital resources of matter necessary to completing their journey to another star, and realized that other ships would view them likewise. As a result, each group of ships fought a battle where only one ship survived, and then had the resources to continue its journey. This only reinforces humanity’s devotion to not allowing any escape, as space is viewed as a place that takes away our humanity and makes us do terrible things.</p><p>Finally, Luo Ji is ready. He proceeds to a remote location, digs his own grave, and talks to Trisolaris via the sophons. He explains that the early warning system he created is actually a message to the galaxy. By placing its components carefully around the solar system, he has engineered a message revealing the location of Triosolaris. If he is killed, a dead man switch will cause the message to be sent out, and others will then destroy both Trisolaris and Earth, since previous communications already revealed our distance from Trisolaris.</p><p>Under this threat, Trisolaris surrenders. They pull back their probes, stop their sophons from interfering with science experiments and divert their fleet, rather than face mutually assured destruction. Luo Ji, it appears, has saved us.</p><h2>Book III – Death’s End</h2><p>Death’s End is the story of humanity’s journey through various eras as told through the journey of a Chinese scientist named Cheng Xin.</p><p>In the common era, Cheng Xin’s team manages to send a brain into space to meet with the Trisolarian fleet, hopeful that they can then reconstitute the person and that the person can then act as an envoy and spy. They send Yun Tianming, who is in love with Cheng Xin and bought her a star, as the United Nations was selling them to raise money for the war effort.</p><p>Upon awakening in the future, this star proves to have planets and thus be very valuable, and Cheng Xin becomes super wealthy for the rest of the story.</p><p>In the deterrence era, Luo Ji has become the swordholder, standing ready at all times to broadcast the location of Trisolaris (and thus also Sol), thus ensuring peace. This works for a while, but humans forget how precarious their situation is and lose the appetite for hard choices. The men of this era, it is noted, are soft, and not true men. The number of warning stations and backup broadcasters is cut back to save money. One of the ships that survived the wiping out of Earth’s fleet, the Bronze Age, is recalled to Earth, then everyone is put on trial for crimes against humanity. They manage to notify the other ship that has escaped Earth, the Blue Space, to warn them not to return home, so a Trisolarian probe and an Earth ship are sent in pursuit and are on top of them ready to strike, but in no hurry.</p><p>Earth has decided the time has come to select a new swordholder to provide deterrence. Wade, Cheng Xin’s old ruthless spymaster boss from the project that sent up Yun’s brain, tries to kill her to prevent her from becoming swordholder and claim the position himself. Later, the remaining candidates again try in vain to convince her not to run for the position, but she feels obligated and does anyway. In a true instance of You Had One Job, the public chooses her as someone they like better, despite her being obviously less of a deterrent and Trisolaris still being able to watch literally everything everywhere all the time when making choices. A mindboggingly thankless Earth then arrests Luo Ji for high crimes because there might have been life on the planets orbiting the star he cast a spell on to prove that his hypothesis worked, never mind that there was no reason to believe that and oh <em>that was part of him saving us from an alien invasion. </em>But I get ahead of myself with the editorializing.</p><p>And of course, the second Cheng Xin takes over, the Trisolarians send probes in to dismantle what little broadcasting ability we have left and cripple us. Cheng Xin has the opportunity to push the button and reveal the location of Trisolaris, but (in the book’s words) her ‘motherly instincts’ take over and she refuses to doom us all, hoping things will somehow work out. Sophon (one of them has now taken on humanoid form) then explains gratefully that she only had about 10% deterrence value based on their models, whereas Wade was at 100% and certain to retaliate, which of course would have meant they wouldn’t have tried anything.</p><p>Instead, she proclaims, all Humans must dismantle their technology and move to Australia, except for a few million who will coordinate this move and hunt down the resistance. Australia and an area on Mars are, she claims, our reward for what our culture has brought to Trisolaris, including the concept of deception, which allowed their technological progress to restart after stalling out for eons, but we must give up most technology. Then, once everyone is there, she has the power for the farms there taken out, and announces that the plan is for us to fight each other for food to survive for the four years until the second Trisolarian fleet, which now can achieve light speed, can arrive to take over Earth’s intact cities and provide support for the survivors.</p><p>Before that can happen, it is revealed that the ship Gravity, which was pursuing the renegade ship Blue Space, has been taken over by the crew of Blue Space, who also managed to somehow defeat the probe attacking both of them, and together the crews voted to reveal the location of Trisolaris and therefore Sol. They did this via finding a pocket of four dimensional space, and explorations into four dimensional space find strange and ominous results including a ‘tomb’ to a dead race. The tomb explains that higher dimensional civilizations have no fear of lower dimensional ones, and lower dimensional ones have no resources higher dimensional civilizations might need, so the two have no reason to interact.</p><p>With Earth now a dead planet orbiting, the Trisolarians divert their fleet elsewhere and allow humanity to return to its planet and technology. Humans turn on those who managed to save its cities and civilization (while also, to be fair, laying the groundwork for xenocide), and greatly rewards those in the resistance including Luo Ji. Trisolaris is destroyed when a photoid hits one of their three stars.</p><p>The question now becomes, what to do, given that the universe will soon know where we are?</p><p>Before leaving Earth, Sophon gives Cheng Xin a chance to speak with Yun Tianming, but is warned they can only speak on personal matters and to avoid revealing technical or scientific or otherwise valuable intelligence, or Cheng Xin will be blown up by a nuke before she can share what she has heard. Yun shares with Cheng a fairy tale in three parts that was part of Yun’s published work ‘Fairy Tales from Earth.’ The works are well known, and they are not only not blown up or warned, they are allowed to go over the planned allotted time so he can finish the tales. They then promise to meet in the future at her star. Cheng memorizes the tale and reports the contents back, and she is congratulated on her success as all of our finest people work on figuring out the hidden meaning in the tale.</p><p>The tale is long and provides <em>lots and lots </em>of clues about how the universe works, what is technologically possible, what is in store for the solar system and how we might defend ourselves. Humanity figures out a little of it, but misses a lot more and knows it has done so, and comes up with three potential solutions to its crisis.</p><p>First, humanity notices that both known ‘dark forest strikes’ against known civilizations have taken the form of a photoid being used to shatter a star, and that if they can hide behind Jupiter or Saturn when that happens, they will survive the strike and have the technology to survive going forward. So we could build space cities to house our population.</p><p>Second, we could build faster than light ships and escape the solar system in time. Trisolaris developed light speed ships, and our older slower ship Gravity was on its way to another star even without this, so we know such a thing is possible. But that’s escapism, and escapism is the worse than Hitler, since not everyone could get away, so all such attempts are banned to make sure that if most of us die, everyone dies.</p><p>Third, we could take a concept gleaned from the fairy tale and from a question once asked to Sophon where she confirmed that there is a way to credibly communicate that we are not a threat and thus be left in peace. We could turn Earth into a dark region of space that can’t be escaped from. The problem is we don’t know how to do that and our attempts to figure it out came to nothing.</p><p>Humanity puts almost all its resources into plan one, and succeeds in moving everyone into space. It bans plan two, and mostly gives up on plan three.</p><p>Wade then meets Cheng Xin (our characters go into cryogenic sleep so they can move between eras as the plot requires) and demands she turn over her company to him so he can research light speed travel, since without it humanity will never be great even if we somehow survive, and also this plan of hiding behind Jupiter and hoping no other civilization thinks we might do that seems kind of unlikely to work when you think about it, ya know? Cheng Xin agrees and turns her company over with the caveat that if Wade would do anything to threaten human lives he has to awaken her and give her control back.</p><p>He agrees to the condition. Cheng Xin is awakened to news that Wade has made great progress in his research, but the authorities are trying to shut it down because escapism, and his response has been to seed soldiers with anti-matter bullets on the space cities so that he can threaten reprisals that would destroy them if his work is stopped. Cheng Xin is horrified, once again refusing to use such threats, and orders him to surrender. Amazingly, he does, fulfilling his promises to Cheng Xin. She goes back into hibernation again.</p><p>She is awakened to warning of a dark forest strike. Our hour has come, and a different type of weapon is attacking us, collapsing space around the solar system down to two dimensions. Laws against escapism are repealed, but escape velocity is light speed, so it is too late. Except for one ship that Wade managed to finish, with two seats, which Cheng Xin and her friend Ai Aa take, first to Pluto to help distribute priceless artifacts as a memorial to humanity, and then to escape the ongoing attack. Even as we are all doomed, humanity continues to hate ‘escapism’ and a number of ships try (with no success) to stop and destroy her ship because if they can’t escape, everyone should die. She does escape and directs the ship to her star.</p><p>When there, they attempt to meet Yun, but an accident causes them to miss each other. They do meet up with a descendant of the crew of the ships Gravity and Blue Space, which survived and became human civilization. He explains that dimension-collapsing weapons are being used throughout the universe, bringing it down from its original ten plus dimensions to now mostly two and three dimensional space with a few four dimensional pockets, and other laws of physics are under attack too. That’s why string theory and all these ‘folded-up’ dimensions and such. They are given instructions to enter a pocket dimension to await the big crunch, which will reset things and restore all the dimensions.</p><p>They then get a message from the universe. It notifies them that both Earth and Trisolaris made the list of impactful civilizations in the universe, and asks that all matter in pocket universes be returned because too much matter has been removed from the main universe into various pocket universes and this lack of sufficient mass will prevent the big crunch, dooming the universe to heat death instead of renewal. They decide to put most of the mass back into the main universe, leaving behind a message for the next cycle and taking a ship to explore what is left of the main universe.</p><p>We do not learn if enough others cooperated, or whether the big crunch did occur.</p><p>Glad that four-thousand-word plot summary is out of the way. On to the discussions.</p><h1>Discussions</h1><h3>Big Picture: An Alien Perspective</h3><p>I don’t mean Trisolaris. I mean China.</p><p>Trisolarians have several characteristics on which to hang their planet of hats. They evolved around a trio star, which leads to unpredictable periods of extreme heat and cold, lasting unpredictable amounts of time, and worse, with only occasional ‘stable eras’ where they are mostly revolving around one sun and life can continue. Thus, they have the ability to ‘dehydrate’ and store themselves in this state during chaotic periods, then rehydrate when things stabilize, and they survived this way through many collapses until reaching an era of high technology.</p><p>They communicate telepathically and automatically, so before they met humans they didn’t know that lying or deception could be a thing. Their entire culture should be alien to us.</p><p>Instead, the <em>humans</em> are written a lot stranger, to my American eyes, than the Trisolarians. Most characters are Chinese, but even those who are not continue to mostly think and act in this similarly alien style. I appreciated the opportunity to see the view of humanity from someone in a completely different culture. But it points out how <em>ordinary </em>the Trisolarians are that they are, at least, not obviously less like the humans I know, than are the humans in the book. How much of this is how the Chinese or some Chinese group view humans and think about the world, versus how the author does? I cannot say.</p><p>The viewpoint expressed is <em>deeply, deeply </em>conservative and cynical.</p><p>People, all but a handful of them, are absurdly fickle, petty, short-sighted, self-interested and self-defeating. They are obsessed with status and how they are relative to others, and on the margin wish others harm rather than well. If anyone tries to escape disaster or otherwise rise on their own, universally mankind’s response is to band together to kill them.</p><p>When times are good, they lay back on universal benefits and forget the universe is a harsh place, and that their very survival depends on hard work, sacrifice and hard choices, and explicitly condemn and go after anyone who makes hard choices or makes sacrifices. They choose leaders who can’t make hard choices, showing weakness and inviting attack. They all grow soft, such that an entire prosperous era can lack ‘real men,’ leaving only effeminate weaklings incapable of action, leaving only those frozen in the past capable of taking meaningful action.</p><p>They will believe and put their hope in any damn thing they are pointed at, for a while, no matter how absurd. Then they will despair of any action, or turn in desperation to any hope for change. They will alternatively hail the same person as a hero, and arrest them as a villain, multiple times, for the same actions, based on how they want to feel at the time and what hopes they are given.</p><p>The intellectuals are even worse, and at the start of the book the bulk of them are actively working to sell us out to the aliens for no reason other than environmentalism and humans sucking, so why not turn things over to a race determined to conquer us and hope for the best?</p><p>The idea that humans, or any beings anywhere, could successfully navigate basic game theoretic problems like the prisoner’s dilemma, rather than killing each other and literally destroying the dimensions and physical laws of the universe, is not in hypothesis space.</p><p>They are also, as we’ll go over in multiple places, profoundly and deeply <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive\">Too Dumb To Live</a>.</p><p>The few who are not all of that, or even are a little bit not all of that some of the time, because the plot needs them not to be, are good bets to outright save humanity.</p><p>Humanity ends up saved, repeatedly, by the actions of a few people from our era, in spite of almost everyone alive’s consistent efforts, through the ages, to the contrary.</p><p>When almost everyone alive dies in the third book, it’s hard to escape the feeling that they kinda deserved it.</p><h3>The Great Betrayal</h3><p>It is not hard to see why Ye Wenjie, victim of the cultural revolution, might despair for humanity or her country, and take any opportunity for intervention. Yes, it was an open invitation to an alien race of would-be conquering warmongers, about whom you know nothing else, so thinking this is worth a shot seems rather like a lack of imagination on how bad things can get. Then again, it’s not clear she doesn’t just want to see all the humans suffer and die for what they’ve done.</p><p>The part where her motivation, and those of the (majority of) intellectuals who join her, is largely <em>environmentalism? </em>That she’s motivated in large part by reading Silent Spring?</p><p>Given how likely <em>entirely alien race </em>is to care about our world’s ecology <em>at all, </em>this does not seem like a reasonable position for someone who values Earth’s other life forms.</p><p>It seems more like Earth’s intellectual class collectively decided that this random other alien race has had a hard time, whereas humans are Just Awful and do not deserve to live, so they’re going to work to hand the planet over. That fits what the few recruits we see say – it seems the book thinks that most intellectual people are disgusted by and despise humanity, and want it to suffer and die.</p><p>The way they recruit in the book is, there’s a virtual reality game called Three Body. Those who play it unravel the nature of Trisolaris, after which they are asked to come to a meeting in real life, where they are asked their opinion on humanity and whether it would be a good idea to betray us all in favor of Trisolaris. It seems most people who get that far say yes, and the organization got very large this way without being infiltrated.</p><p>I hope that this perspective on what intellectuals think is not too common among Chinese or those with the deeply conservative views of the author. It seems such a horrible thing to think, and its implications on what one should do are even worse. I try to stretch and see how one might think this, and I can sort of kind of see it? But not really. My best sketch is a logic something like, they despise so many of the preferences of the common folk, seeing them as sexist and racist and wasteful and destructive and full of hate and lack of consideration for their fellow man, so they must hate them in return?</p><p>I can also understand how, seeing the things many people say nowadays, one might reach this conclusion.<a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/16/the-economic-perspective-on-moral-standards/\"> Scott Alexander recently wrote an article</a> noting that many believe that there are zero, or approximately zero, non-terrible human beings on the planet. It also offers the hypothesis that there are approximately zero, or perhaps actual zero, non-terrible human beings in history. Direct quote from the top of the article:</p><blockquote>There are some pretty morally unacceptable things going on in a pretty structural way in society. Sometimes I hear some activists take this to an extreme: no currently living person is morally acceptable.</blockquote><p>The otherwise excellent show <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/\">The Good Place</a> reveals that 98%+ of all humans who ever lived were sent to The Bad Place rather than The Good Place. Good enough is hard.</p><p>A lot of people who oppose hate a lot sure seem to hate, and hate on, a huge portion of all humans who ever lived.</p><p>You can and would be wise to love the sinner and hate the sin. That’s mostly not what the sinners experience.</p><p>If you see lots of people loudly saying such things, it’s easy to see how one might view them as sufficiently hateful of humans in general that they are willing to sell humanity out, <em>for actual literal nothing,</em> to the aliens.</p><p>I can also see a religious perspective. Suppose you think that all men are sinners, and kind of terrible, but that they are redeemed by faith, or by the forgiveness of God, or some symbolic form of penance, or what have you. Now suppose you see a group of people who seem to agree about the awful nature of humanity, even if they don’t agree on why or on which parts of humanity are awful. But they don’t have this God concept. When people announce the error of their ways, the reception is usually observed to be worse than if they’d just said nothing. Once you’ve done wrong, these moral systems don’t seem, to such an outsider, to offer any path to redemption. Certainly not one that a non-nominal portion of people could meet.</p><p>In the book, the character we are following does what I would presume almost everyone would do when offered the chance to support an alien invasion and takeover of Earth backed by zero promises of anything for themselves or the rest of humanity. He reports the situation, cooperates with authorities, infiltrates the organization and with almost no effort sets up a raid that takes down a huge portion of their membership including their leader. I strongly believe I would do the same, not because I’m an unusually pro-human or morally great person, but because that kind of is the least you can do in that spot.</p><p>When I see people claiming to be negative utilitarians, or otherwise claiming beliefs that imply that there is only an ugly kludge, high transaction costs and/or lack of initiative standing between them and <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac\">omnicidal maniachood</a>, a part of me hopes I won’t end up having to kill them some day.</p><p>To see a book that expects not just a handful but the majority of intellectuals to, when given the choice, take the opposite path, is true alien perspective stuff.</p><h3>The War Against Science</h3><p>If you were in command of an organization whose goal was to ensure that humanity would fall to an alien invasion fleet scheduled to arrive in four hundred years, what would you do?</p><p>Trisolaris’ strategy is almost entirely to target science, in particular particle physics.</p><p>At the rate humanity is advancing, by the time their fleet arrives, our science and technology would by default advance to the point where we could crush the invasion fleet. On the other hand, if we could be prevented from advancing our knowledge of physics, no amount of technological tinkering on the edges will make a dent. This is what we later see, as the strong-force-powered probe proves immune to everything we can throw at it.</p><p>Trisolaris uses two distinct vectors to attack science.</p><p>At first, they utilize their control of the intellectual elite to cause culture to turn the people against science and technology. This effort is portrayed as being wildly successful, and heavily implies that today’s intellectual elite are in fact doing something akin to this, only perhaps not <em>quite </em>as extreme. It is not hard to see that perspective after yet another young adult dystopia.</p><p>Once the threat from Trisolaris is discovered, the jig on such strategies is up, the same way that America embraced science after Sputnik. Instead, Trisolaris relies on the sophons, which randomize the results of experiments in particle accelerators, cutting off progress in theoretical physics.</p><p>This is a very Sid Meier’s Civilization style view of how science works. To advance Science, one must fill enough beakers to discover the secret of advanced particle physics, which then allows us to fill beakers to discover the secret of strong force interactions or light speed travel. Progress is based on the sum of the science done, so ask if any given effort produces an efficient amount of science. If you cut off a link in the chain, everything stops. There’s no way around it. One cannot tinker. One cannot perform other experiments.</p><p>This is a rather poor model, in my view, of how science works. Science is not a distinct magisterium. Neither need be particle physics.</p><p>Thus, I have my doubts that this would be sufficient to cut off such progress. There must be other ways to advance knowledge.</p><p>The existence of sophons and their particular abilities likely offers a gigantic hint. Trisolaris in general had the <em>really terrible </em>habit of only trying to kill the few people, or stop the few experiments, that they saw as threatening. My first thought would be, try stuff, see if they let you do it, and <em>isn’t that an interesting result in and of itself? </em></p><p>Reverse engineering and catch-up growth are so much easier than going at it from first principles!</p><p>Another effort to stop us is made via the wallbreaker program. Each of the four wallfacers, humans assigned to carry out hidden agendas to defend us that would not be revealed to the prying eyes of the sophons (which can observe anything but the contents of a human brain), is assigned one person to figure out what their plan is, then reveal it to the world and show how hopeless it is. This is partly to spread hopelessness, and partly to ensure the schemes are not in fact a threat. In the book each task is left to a single individual, which is rather silly, but it seems a good use of resources, and three of the four succeed.</p><h3>Only One Man</h3><p>The last thing Trisolaris does is try to kill Luo Ji. This is both the smartest and dumbest thing they do.</p><p>It is the smartest because Luo Ji is the largest threat standing in the way of their victory. Only he divines the dark forest nature of the universe (that everyone who is discovered is destroyed as a defensive measure, since life expands exponentially but resources are finite, so everyone must hide well and cleanse well) and our ability to threaten Trisolaris via broadcast of the location of their homeworld.</p><p>Let us assume for now (premise!) that the dark forest hypothesis is known by Trisolaris to be true, and they know only Luo Ji has much chance of figuring it out. What they then do is to attempt to kill him in a way that looks like an accident. When that fails, they make him a wallfacer, and force him to work against his will, and he eventually shows that he is figuring out how the dark forest works. When he awakens, there is an old virus waiting to try and kill him, but it fails.</p><p>A probe, that definitely could kill him if it wanted to, then descends. Luo Ji is certain its first act will be to kill him.</p><p>Instead, the probe cuts off our ability to broadcast via our sun – again, showing us their hand, although this time it seems worthwhile.</p><p>But they do not kill Luo Ji.</p><p>Luo Ji is hailed as our only hope because of his casting a spell on a star, and made into a wallfacer with unlimited resources.</p><p>They do not kill Luo Ji.</p><p>Luo Ji starts to tinker with an early warning system and its details, for no obvious reason.</p><p>They do not kill Luo Ji.</p><p>Luo Ji <em>constructs a dead man switch </em>for himself, in full view of the sophons (since everything is in full view of the sophons).</p><p>They do not kill Luo Ji.</p><p>Finally, he reveals his plan to use the warning system as a method of broadcast to the universe, after it is already in place, and Trisolaris is forced to surrender. They explain that they no longer saw him as a threat, since nothing he seemed to be doing appeared meaningful, the deadman switch was a harmless part of the plan of another wallfacer (the terrorist, of course), and the sun had been cut off as a means of broadcast.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=3vsed-yU8kA\">This is a monumentally important failure mode.</a> One should not need the <a href=\"http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html\">evil overlord list</a> to avoid this. The mistake is not only made repeatedly by the humans and aliens alike, it is also made <em>by the judgment of history (in the book), and hence likely also by the author. </em></p><p>As evidence that the author does not appreciate how truly boneheaded a move this is, consider two things.</p><p>First, right after this incident Luo Ji hands control of the broadcast system to the government, which quickly realizes it would not reliably execute on the threat to expose both worlds and hands control back to Luo Ji within a day, making him the swordholder. The author notes that the failure of Trisolaris to attack during this period is considered one of the great strategic failures of history. This is despite the fact that the probability of retaliation at that time is highly uncertain, and it is most definitely not zero. Such a move is absurdly risky versus trying to reach a compromise, given the stakes, and in fact clearly would have been an error given future opportunities Trisolaris is offered.</p><p>Second, the explanation given by Trisolaris as to <em>why </em>they made the colossal blunder of not killing Luo Ji, which is frankly absurd. They admit failure to see what he was up to, why he was doing it or how any of it could matter.</p><p>They then site this failure <em>as a justification for NOT killing Luo Ji.</em></p><p>This is exactly backwards. This is <em>all the more reason to kill him, </em>and no one in the book seems to understand this.</p><p>Because space bunnies must die.</p><p>I take this saying from the title of the (quite bad) game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Bunnies_Must_Die!\">Space Bunnies Must Die!</a>. If your opponent is doing something that <em>makes no sense, </em>whose purpose you can’t understand, which you have no explanation for why they might do it, <em>assume it is highly dangerous. </em>They are the enemy. They have a reasons they chose to take this action. That might be ‘they are an idiot who is flailing around and doesn’t know anything better to do.’ Maybe. Be skeptical.</p><p>Luo Ji is Earth’s space bunny. He must die. They do not kill him, and he beats them.</p><p>For a while.</p><h3>Mutually Assured Destruction and the Swordholder</h3><p>Luo Ji’s triumph gives Earth the ability to reveal the location of Trisolaris, dooming both worlds. He and humanity use this to free ourselves and begin to rapidly make scientific, technological and economic progress to catch up with Trisolaris.</p><p>What Trisolaris still has are the sophons. They still know everything that happen on Earth. They can’t quite see fully into human minds, but they can build increasingly accurate psychological models. Thus, one can view them as a kind of Omega, that sees all, knows all and predicts all, albeit with a substantial error rate, when it knows the parameters it is looking at.</p><p>Everything depends on the prediction they make – in the book’s words, we must ‘hold the enemy’s gaze.’ If Trisolaris thinks we won’t retaliate by revealing their location, they will attack. Whether we retaliate or not, we are doomed. If Trisolaris thinks we will retaliate, they won’t attack.</p><p>Mutually assured destruction, with a sufficiently strong predictor, is a variation of Newcomb’s Problem. The boxes are transparent, and what matters is whether you’ll take the thousand dollars <em>if the million dollars is not there. </em>If the predictor thinks you wouldn’t take the thousand dollars in that case, then the predictor gives you the million dollars and you never have a choice to make.</p><p>I have a lot to say about Newcomb problems in general, but won’t go into it here because humanity’s failures in this trilogy are so much more basic, and go so much deeper, than that. And because anything I bury in here risks being quite lost in something this long.</p><p>This variation is a <em>very, very easy </em>form of Newcomb, for two reasons.</p><p>The first is that <em>you know the rules in advance, and get the resources of all of civilization to choose who plays. </em>Must be nice.</p><p>The second is that the choice you precommit to gets you revenge on those who decided to destroy us, so it’s not asking for something super weird and unnatural, or even something that’s necessarily worse going forward than the alternative. Many a dedicated two-boxer would still make an effective swordholder – even if you get problems like this wrong, you have additional ways to get this particular version right.</p><p>Humanity in the book chooses someone who not only is not, in Wade’s terminology, unwilling to sell their mother to a whorehouse. It does not only also choose someone who has not shown an understanding of the importance of commitment. It chooses someone <em>whose temperament clearly does not value revenge.</em></p><p>Electing Cheng Xin to be Swordholder <em>is not simply </em>a failure of game theory.</p><p>It can only be described as a suicide pact.</p><p>When Cheng Xin chooses whether or not to retaliate, and chooses not to, she does so out of a ‘motherly instinct.’ Out of a slim hope that it will turn out all right, somehow.</p><p>It can come as no surprise, to anyone, that Trisolaris attacks the second she is put in charge.</p><p>To emphasize this, at the same time Trisolaris is launching their attack, the humans <em>arrest Luo Ji, on suspicion of genocide, </em>for <em>exactly the actions that saved humanity. </em>Because when he destroyed a random uninhabited star to test the Dark Forest theory that allowed us to survive, there <em>might, in theory </em>have been intelligent life there.</p><p>Lou Ji’s reward, <em>for literally saving the world, </em>is arrest and would have then (except for the attack) have been trial.</p><p>Humanity decides, as it decides at several other points, <em>that it no longer desires to survive. </em>Humans <em>repeatedly punish </em>and strike down those who value humanity’s survival and make sacrifices to that end. Anyone who does what must be done, in order to let us survive, is a horrible criminal who has committed crimes against humanity, <em>even when they fully succeed and save all of us. </em></p><p>Humans repeatedly choose superficially ‘nice’ values incompatible with the survival of the species, or later with the survival of all life on and from Earth (take that, first-book environmentalists!), over any hope of actual survival. They do this after knowing that those out there in the dark forest are, as a whole, <em>far, far worse. </em></p><p>Even when they aren’t getting themselves killed, they’re sustaining a much lower than replacement-level birth rate. By the time the end comes, humanity is under one billion people entirely due to low birth rates.</p><p>Something, the most important thing, has gone horribly wrong. Values that improve the world have morphed into crazy lost purposes and signaling games. Everything worthwhile is lost.</p><p>It is hard not to read this as a critique of liberal values. The book explicitly endorses cyclical theories of history, where prosperity contains the seeds of its own destruction. <em>In </em>The differences this time, with higher technology and stakes, are in the consequences when it happens. Good times have created weak men, who have forgotten what it takes to create and maintain good times, and those weak men tear down that which sustains civilization, and gives its people the ability to reproduce themselves and their values and culture into future generations, without stopping to ask if they are doing so.</p><p>Then those who accept the dark forest, who know to hide well and cleanse well, inherit the universe.</p><p>As I noted earlier, this is fundamentally a <em>deeply, deeply </em>conservative and cynical set of books.</p><h3>The Great Ravine</h3><p>Or, <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics?from=Main.YouFailEconomicsForever\">You Fail Economics Forever</a>, all of humanity edition, even more than usual. Oh, boy.</p><p>Humanity knows they face a doomsday battle four hundred years in the future. So everyone assumes, correctly, that humanity will begin rationing of goods so we can all go on a war footing and build ships to fight the doomsday battle.</p><p>I was thrilled when I later learned that this caused the world economy and environment to collapse. After which, we stopped trying to prepare for the war and focused on improving life. After which we rapidly recovered, developed better technology, started repairing the Earth, then incidentally decided to create a vastly superior fleet to the one we ruined ourselves trying to build.</p><p>Sounds about right.</p><p>A lot of the mistakes humanity makes in the book feel like mistakes we wouldn’t make.</p><p>This one feels like yes, we are exactly this stupid.</p><p>We <em>totally, totally would </em>forget that human flourishing and development requires play, requires caring about things other than The Cause. We totally would ignore the value of compound interest and economic growth and technological development, and of the unexpected. We’d abandon our freedoms and curiosity and everything of value, and embrace central planning and authoritarianism and technocrats, aimed at <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/the-thing-and-the-symbolic-representation-of-the-thing/\">creating the symbolic representation</a> of the symbolic representation of a space fleet. We totally would treat those who pointed such things out as traitors and shame them into silence.</p><p>Compound interest is not the most powerful force in the universe. But it is on the list. Tyler Cowen’s position, that we should almost entirely focus on maximizing economic growth subject to the continuity and stability of civilization, has some strong objections one might make. But all those strong suggestions come down to one of two things. Either they argue we should value the present more than the future (for various reasons), or that economic growth is the wrong thing to be measuring, and there is a different mechanism at work here that we should be thinking about in a different way.</p><p>Neither of those applies here, at all. We sacrificed the present for nothing.</p><p>The obvious defense is that basic physics research was blocked, so there’s no point in waiting. That’s quite silly. Even with basic research stalled, technology is a whole different animal, as we see later on. And even if technology was fixed, there are plenty of other ways to improve over centuries.</p><p>Note that Trisolaris does <em>not </em>make this mistake. They pay zero mind to any war preparations. All their sabotage goes towards stopping basic scientific research. This points to the opposite mistake, of thinking that the practical stuff one might accomplish doesn’t matter. In this case, they have somewhat of a point, given what the probes can do, but I would not want to rely on that.</p><p>You can’t run a world-wide death march for four hundred years, as much as mood affectation might demand it.</p><p>A good question is, if you were in charge of doomsday battle planning, when <em>would </em>it make sense to start preparing, how much, in what ways?</p><p>Year one, I would do my best to counter Trisolaris’ efforts, and devote as much effort as was productive to scientific research on all fronts at all levels, and creating a culture where that had value. I’d work to create norms allowing us to run costly experiments of all kinds, that we currently don’t consider remotely ehtical. I would do the same for space exploration and colonization, but without any mind to combat. I’d invest in long term economic growth in all its forms.</p><p>And of course, I’d do everything I could to build a true AGI. Trisolaris is evidence that the problem is hard, but the bottleneck is unlikely to be basic physics (unless it’s a pure shortage of compute, but that still doesn’t seem like a basic physics concern) and Trisolaris clearly isn’t <em>that </em>far ahead of us – it feels the need to sabotage our efforts. So there’s definitely chance (although presumably, given what we learn later, this would not have worked).</p><p>I’d also double down on intelligence augmentation and genetic engineering. Neither gets even a mention in the book, at all. But this is the obvious way to go! You have <em>four centuries </em>to get your act together. It turned out we had somewhat less, but we still had several centuries. That’s plenty of time for a <em>very very slow </em>takeoff. Plenty of time for getting smarter about getting smarter about getting smarter.</p><p>As a bonus, brains are the one thing Trisolaris can’t see with the Sophons, so the more people can keep in their heads because their heads are better, the better our ability to avoid countermeasures.</p><p>Oh, and the moment I could I’d <em>get as many people as possible the hell out of the system, on seed ships, in case we lose. </em>Even if it didn’t work, trying to do this seems likely to bear very good fruits. But there’s a whole section on that later.</p><p>Around one hundred years from the target, I’d consider starting to encourage martial traditions and space combat, and study show to train effective fighters from birth.</p><p>Within the last fifty years I’d actually build my ships or other weapons, and start getting ready in earnest. I’d go full war footing for the last five or ten, tops.</p><p>I’d also be fully on board with the Wallfacer program, but would like to think I would at least not choose an actual suicide-bomber-loving terrorist to be one of them, and ideally wait to invest mostly in enhanced people yet to be born. Plus some other obvious improvements. I’ll stop there to avoid going too far down the rabbit hole.</p><h3>The Fairy Tale</h3><p>The fairy tale, in which all we need to know about the universe and its inhabitants through multiple metaphoric levels, has epic levels of cool. It is constructed meticulously. It is definitely not easy to unravel.</p><p>There are even parts of the story that the book doesn’t bother explaining, but which seem to still have important meaning. Consider the spinning umbrella, which protects you from being turned into a picture. What is it? I have a guess (continuous use of light speed engines to darken matter), now that I know how the universe works, but it doesn’t <em>quite </em>fit, and it seems really important. There are other similar things that we ‘should’ have known ‘had to mean something important’ but then there are others that also seem that way, that (probably?) didn’t mean anything.</p><p>I got <em>a little </em>of what was going on when reading the tale, but missed the bulk of it. It felt like a fair puzzle in some places I missed, less fair in others. Which is, itself, quite fair.</p><p>Being <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy\">Genre Savvy</a> is hard, yo. The book’s mocking of people as unable to presume or unravel multiple levels of metaphor seems like what one says when they know the answer to their own riddle, and can’t figure out why literally no one else can figure it out.</p><p>If you start without knowledge of light speed travel, or how to darken matter, or that the number of dimensions can be reduced, making those leaps is hard.</p><p>It doesn’t seem hard <em>on the level of an entire civilization’s experts working for dozens of years.</em> On that level it seems easy. But if everyone got the same prompts and frames, and the same wrong ideas, it makes sense. We have long histories of <em>everyone on Earth </em>missing potential inventions or ideas for long periods of time, if they require multiple leaps to get there. Asking people to unravel multiple metaphorical layers is tough, especially if your poets aren’t physicists, and your physicists aren’t poets.</p><p>The book doesn’t mention a worldwide program to teach the physicists poetry, or the poets physics. People in this book stick to inside the box, and take human capacity as fixed.</p><p>That is one of the big hidden assumptions and messages of the book. People change with the times, and technology can advance, but people, and intelligence, fundamentally don’t change and don’t improve, even among aliens give or take <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats\">their hat</a>. Quirks and mistakes aside, there is mostly a single way of thinking, a single way of viewing the universe, a single set of basic values, and all intelligent life is roughly the same. No one can take over or have good probe coverage, no one creates workable systems of safety and control, and no one solves game theory. It’s weird. To some extent, I get that not doing this is hard and forces focus on things the book doesn’t want to be about, the same way that you are mostly forced to pretend AIs don’t work the ways they obviously do if you want to write science fiction that says interesting things about people. Still, it’s quite jarring.</p><p>The Trisolarians are dense throughout the books. They start <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1058017/\">not understanding the idea of deception</a>, which I gotta say is <em>really weird </em>even if they can read each others’ thoughts. If nothing else, they have long distance communication, no? And abstract reason? Problems they do get over through exposure to Earth, but they still repeatedly make the same fundamental mistake.</p><p>If Trisolarians can’t see the explicit direct path by which an action leads to something they don’t like, they treat the action as harmless. And they don’t ask <em>why </em>people do things. They have no concept of the space bunny. And here, in our last encounter, we see the ultimate version of that. So much so, that they let the conversation go overtime, because they want to let them finish telling harmless fairy tales.</p><p>As opposed to, <em>they’re burning their invaluable communication, this one time opportunity, on frigging fairy tales, something</em> MUST <em>be fishy here. </em></p><p>Once you ask, are these tales fishy, if you know about dimensional warfare, I <em>really really </em>don’t see how you miss it. It’s one thing to not solve the riddle when you don’t know the answer. But if you know the answer, the riddle is transparent. I have no idea how it wasn’t obvious to every reader on Trisolaris, or at least each one who knew physics, what was going on.</p><p>But once again, that’s probably the ‘knows-the-answer-already’ talking.</p><p>Consider: I think it was a month ago I learned what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM4okRvCg2g\">The Safety Dance</a> was about. My parents sang me <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7lmAc3LKWM\">Puff the Magic Dragon</a>.</p><p>I mean, <em>come on.</em></p><h3>The Great Escape</h3><p>If there is one thing mankind can agree upon throughout the trilogy, it is that the worst possible crime is escapism.</p><p>Escapism is the most dangerous crime of noticing that the solar system is doomed and trying to get the hell out as quickly as possible.</p><p>You see, several characters point out as soon as we learn we are doomed, figuring out how to build spaceships that can leave Earth is the easy part. The impossible part is deciding who gets to go. And if we can’t all go, then none of us should go, and those who try are the enemies of humanity.</p><p>Later on this expands to any form of study of interstellar travel. You see, the Earth is <em>doomed, </em>so learning how to leave it would be <em>just awful </em>because it would be <em>unequal. </em>Or, in some arguments, because it would <em>distract from solving our problems, </em>or would <em>cause unfair hope. </em></p><p>We can all agree this is a horrible, no-good way of looking at things. The last thing those on the Titanic should do, upon learning that there are not enough lifeboats, would be <em>to sink the Titanic with all hands. </em>We can disagree about whether it should be ladies and children first or whether class of ticket should matter or what not, but <em>at a minimum </em>you run a lottery or a mad race for the boats or <em>something.</em></p><p>If you <em>actually disagree with that, </em>if you think that it is a good thing to notice that some people, somewhere, might not be doomed and make sure that every last one of us is doomed unless we can un-doom all of us, then, seriously, stop reading this blog because I kind of want you to die in a fire. It would be for the best.</p><p>When we say that while there is one slave in the world none of us are free, <em>that is not an instruction to enslave everyone else until the problem is solved. </em>Injustice for one is injustice for all <em>because it is bad and sets bad incentives and bad values, </em>not because it means we should then visit injustice upon everyone.</p><p>I am belaboring this point <em>because I see people making arguments of this type, all the time. </em>People who <em>actually, seriously </em>think that the way to finish “you have two cows” is “but someone else, somewhere, doesn’t have any cows, so we kill your cows <strong>you</strong> so we can all be equal.” If we all can’t live forever, no one can. The evil eye. The enemy of progress, and of humanity, <em>and of life itself in all its forms</em>.</p><p>No examples, since this blog has a strict no-someone-I-do-not-respect-is-wrong-on-the-internet policy. You know who you are.</p><p>Given this book claims that this is humanity’s basic mode of thinking, this seems like a good time to say, once and for all, this is a profoundly evil, not-even-wrong mode of thinking and when faced with it, I can’t even.</p><p>So, yeah.</p><p>I like to think the book is profoundly wrong about humanity, here. I like to think this is not mankind’s default mode of thinking. I like to think that this is only what a few fanatical and crazy people think, and they are loud and obnoxious and have platforms. I like to think that people talk a good game sometimes in order to turn things to their advantage, but they don’t actually want to burn everything down so no one will have an unfairly large house, whether or not they could be king of the ashes.</p><p>I like to think that while we would not resolve this problem <em>well, </em>exactly, that humanity would survive the death of the solar system <em>if it had plenty of time and the technology, resources and capability to build generational starships and get some of us out of town. </em></p><p>If we couldn’t, we wouldn’t deserve to survive, and I would not mourn for us.</p><p>I greatly appreciated that the key to defending ourselves, to turning our system into dark matter that cannot threaten others, <em>is light-speed travel. </em>Thus, by refusing to research light-speed travel, we cut ourselves off from discovering that the damage such travel causes to space is what would allow us to protect ourselves. This felt profoundly <em>fair, </em>given the way related technologies work in the book’s universe.</p><p>As Isaac Asimov said, there is but a single light of science. To brighten it anywhere, is to brighten it everywhere. It is very hard to predict what one will learn by exploring. Refusing to look in a place where you don’t understand how something works, to not ask questions because you don’t like what might happen if you found the answers, is likely to end up cutting off the things that matter most.</p><p>The book does offer an interesting implicit question, near the end. Once we develop the technology to turn our solar system into dark matter, if we get it in time, should we do it? Should we shroud our world in permanent isolation, enjoy some good years and then go meekly into that good night with the death of the sun?</p><p>I would expect us to shroud, but would proudly vote against it.</p><h3>The Dark Game Theoretic Forest</h3><p>In The Dark Knight (minor spoiler), there is a scene where two boats, one with convicts and one with ordinary citizens, are each given a button the Joker says will blow up the other boat, after which the Joker promises the remaining boat will be free to leave. Thus, because the convicts might push the button, the citizens might want to do so first, and thus the convicts might press it even if they didn’t want to, and so on. Starting on either side. Neither side considers their decision obvious.</p><p>This book thinks the buttons get pressed. That this is how the universe works, in the end. You can’t fully trust anyone not to blow you up, so you don’t give them your location, and when possible you blow everyone else up first. There is no thought to negotiation, cooperation or peace. Only war. Only the dark forest. Hide well, cleanse well.</p><p>In this perspective, game theory offers us no hope. No way out. Cooperation is impossible in a wide range of problems people like me consider mostly solved problems.</p><p>The price? <em>Six dimensions of the universe. </em>Minimum. Almost all of the universe’s value, then almost all of what is left. Six times over. The weapons used, to contain threats (where ‘threat’ is simply ‘intelligent life, anywhere’) are so toxic that they wipe out the laws of physics, the dimensions themselves. The world has already almost entirely ended, long before humans arrive on the scene.</p><p>Life is the point of the universe. All, even in-book, agree. Despite this, it is so impossible to try and work something out, so impossible to get a system of incentives or deterrence or cooperation, that life’s primary purposes are to hide and to hunt all other life.</p><p>The universe’s inhabitants needs better decision theory. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060\">Perhaps they should start here</a>. Or maybe try the explanations <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/\">here</a>, instead. At some point I should give a shot to writing a better explainer.</p><p>What is most weird is, all of this applies back on Earth. Life still expands without limit. Resources remain finite. Offense is far cheaper than defense. Why don’t <em>we </em>inhabit the dark forest? Mostly we neither hide well nor cleanse well, and we are worse at both each passing year. Yes, in some ways we have it easier. In other ways, we have it harder.</p><p>Late in the third book, it is revealed that it isn’t quite all hiding and hunting. There are at least some forms of communication between various aliens, and even some dreams of cooperation to prevent the heat death of the universe. Everyone is basically similar and understands each other; as I noted above, the aliens seem more alike in their thinking than the book’s model of humans is from mine, or its Chinese from Americans. We really, really should all be able to get along, starting with a ban on weapons of dimensional destruction.</p><p>Is an upstart civilization with primitive broadcasting technology really even more dangerous than <em>wiping out the third dimension at their home world, expanding with an escape velocity of light speed?</em></p><p>It doesn’t even work right. If they have light speed travel, their ships get away and try again. If they don’t, it seems like quite the overkill.</p><p>Another question that is never resolved, that I can recall, is why Trisolaris never sent probes to the stars closest to it. We know why they did not send sophons; sophons are each a huge economic cost. But why not send an ordinary probe that would give data on inhabitable worlds? Or at least, one that would give data on where one could safely park one’s ships while having a ready supply of fuel, the way humanity later puts its city-ships around Jupiter?</p><p>Humans, with technology clearly still vastly inferior to that of Trisolaris, find it not that burdensome to pack up everyone, within a hundred years, and move them into space cities around Jupiter. If that’s a viable solution, how hard is it to find a target world with a gas giant and only one or two stars (so it won’t suffer from the three body problem and be unstable)? Given the attrition rate they faced from space travel – the majority of the original invasion fleet doesn’t make it to Sol – wouldn’t it make the most sense to have <em>already </em>sent colony ships to Sol simply because it is a single star with large gas giants, without even needing to know Earth has life?</p><p>Instead, Trisolaris seems to be waiting around for a communication that will reveal someone’s location, despite having no expectation of that being nearby, or it being someone they can defeat militarily, or of anyone being stupid enough to do that, since in this universe everyone is hiding all the time and Trisolaris knows why they do this.</p><p>It doesn’t seem worthwhile for them to return our broadcasts, either. Yes, they can attempt to get us to stall our development, but it reveals the location of Trisolaris to us, which means we can destroy them, and will have that capacity for over a century. We could figure that out at any time. And we might do that <em>accidentally, </em>since we’re too stupid to realize that broadcasts of locations lead to destroyed stars.</p><p>Along similar lines, if I was a civilization that felt that all other civilizations were a mortal threat to me, to the extent that most the universe had become dark matter and we’d lost most of our dimensions to wars, you better believe I’d have at least have a probe on every world checking for signs of developing life so I could handle it with weapons that wouldn’t wipe out my supply of usable matter. And if resources are so precious, I wouldn’t be letting most of them lie around going to waste.</p><p>The book shows us that the aliens who wipe out Earth are actually getting wiped out themselves in a civil war with their own colony, about the be forced to retreat into lower dimensions (why they cannot go dark instead is not explained). So in this universe, it seems, aliens do not expand to use all the resources <em>because they are so afraid of someone else trying to use all the resources, that creating the means to do that would mean inevitable conflicts that kill you. </em>So most of the universe, even the useful parts, sits idle or shrouded because no one can trust even their own kind to not turn on them, simply because someone at some point might turn on someone so everyone turns on everyone.</p><p>But (mumble mumble von Neumann probes mumble mumble) that’s enough before I get distracted by going into all the plot holes and missed opportunities. Let’s wrap this up.</p><h3>Conclusion and Science Fiction’s Fall</h3><p>This has been by far this blog’s longest post to date, and still feels like it could have been far longer. The trilogy was full of big ideas, and theories and predictions about humanity. I disagree with many, and agree with many others, and find items from both groups interesting. It is good to see an author unafraid to say many things explicitly, that others are afraid to and unwilling to express – regardless of whether I ultimately agree with the hypothesis.</p><p>What I found strangest about these books is the degree to which it is possible to <em>utterly miss the point. </em>And I wonder what that says about what has happened to science fiction.</p><p>I can’t find the link, but I read a review of these books, from a clearly not-stupid person who had read the books, that praised them as offering a positive vision of humanity’s future.</p><p>On a very superficial level, yes, this is a positive vision of humanity’s future, in the sense that humanity gains higher technology and improves its standard of living, and then in that it manages to escape the solar system and create a lasting civilization among the stars – despite itself, and its repeated attempts to prevent itself from surviving, but yes in the end this does happen.</p><p>On any other level, this is <em>utterly insane. </em>The books despair for humanity and its future. We survive because of repeated narrative intervention, and the actions of a brave few against the will of the many to die. The world betrays itself, repeatedly. Man does not cooperate with man, and the universe is revealed as a place where being cannot cooperate with, <em>or even fail to kill upon being given an opportunity, </em>another being. 99.9999% of humanity is wiped out. The rest emerge into a dark forest war of all against all, where none dare reveal their location, and civilizations wage war by reducing the dimensions of the universe using weapons that have destroyed almost all value in the universe <em>six times already </em>and are rapidly working on a seventh time with what is left. With no way out.</p><p>That big crunch that hopes to reset the universe, if only its only safe and effectively immortal residents all sacrifice themselves? I have a hard time believing it has much chance of happening, even in my model of how things work. In this book’s universe? Not a chance.</p><p>If that’s an optimistic, positive science fiction with a positive view of the future, <em>then what the hell is the pessimistic viewpoint?</em></p><p>Eliezer talks about how he was raised on old school science fiction, like Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. His parents were careful to stock his bookshelves with only the older stuff, because newer stuff did not have the same optimistic view of humanity, and belief in science and technology as great things, and in the universe as capable of great things. Those writers ‘after the divide’ instead, in this view, use technology mainly as a way to think about what is wrong with it, and what is terrible about its consequences, and what is terrible about people. Such work does not teach us to reach for the stars.</p><p>Surely there are exceptions. But there’s no denying that the general vibe of technology being assumed to be great has somehow given way to the general vibe <em>even in most science fiction </em>that at best, wherever you go, there you are, and more likely that technology leads to young adult dystopia or worse. Inequality in the future is always through the roof. That roof is reliably underwater, due to climate change, which often renders Earth uninhabitable. Even if technology and our heroes ultimately save the day, the future is a mostly terrible place where we pay for our sins, and by our sins we mean our civilization and its science and technology.</p><p>Compared to that, these books present an optimistic paradise. But what kind of standard is that?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

You can read about the particular details of the matches in many sources, such as the blog post itself, this <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/24/18196177/ai-artificial-intelligence-google-deepmind-starcraft-game\">Vox article</a>, or <a href=\"https://jack-clark.net/2019/01/28/import-ai-131-ibm-optimizes-ai-with-ai-via-neunets-amazon-reveals-its-scout-delivery-robot-google-releases-300k-natural-questions-dataset/\">Import AI</a>. The quick summary is that while there are some reasons you might not think it is conclusively superhuman yet (notably, it only won when it didn&#x27;t have to manipulate the camera, and even then it may have had short bursts of very high actions per minute that humans can&#x27;t do), it is clearly extremely good at StarCraft, both at the technically precise micro level and at the strategic macro level.</p><p>I want to focus instead on the technical details of how AlphaStar works. The key ideas seem to be a) using imitation learning to get policies that do something reasonable to start with and b) training a population of agents in order to explore the full space of strategies and how to play against all of them, without any catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, they take a dataset of human games and train various agents to mimic humans. This allows them to avoid the particularly hard exploration problems that happen when you start with a random agent. Once they have these agents to start with, they begin to do population-based training, where they play agents against each other and update their weights using an RL algorithm. The population of agents evolves over time, with well-performing agents splitting into two new agents that diversify a bit more. Some agents also have auxiliary rewards that encourage them to explore different parts of the strategy space -- for example, an agent might get reward for building a specific type of unit. Once training is done, we have a final population of agents. Using their empirical win probabilities, we can construct a Nash equilibrium of these agents, which forms the final AlphaStar agent. <em>(Note: I&#x27;m not sure if at the beginning of the game, one of the agents is chosen according to the Nash probabilities, or if at each timestep an action is chosen according to the Nash probabilities. I would expect the former, since the latter would result in one agent making a long-term plan that is then ruined by a different agent taking some other action, but the blog post seems to indicate the latter -- with the former, it&#x27;s not clear why the compute ability of a GPU restricts the number of agents in the Nash equilibrium, which the blog posts mentions.)</em></p><p>There are also a bunch of interesting technical details on how they get this to actually work, which you can get some information about in this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ajgzoc/we_are_oriol_vinyals_and_david_silver_from/\">Reddit AMA</a>. For example, &quot;we included a policy distillation cost to ensure that the agent continues to try human-like behaviours with some probability throughout training, and this makes it much easier to discover unlikely strategies than when starting from self-play&quot;, and &quot;there are elements of our research (for example temporally abstract actions that choose how many ticks to delay, or the adaptive selection of incentives for agents) that might be considered “hierarchical”&quot;. But it&#x27;s probably best to wait for the journal publication (which is currently in preparation) for the full details.</p><p>I&#x27;m particularly interested by this <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08106\">Balduzzi et al paper</a> that gives some more theoretical justification for the population-based training. In particular, the paper introduces the concept of &quot;gamescapes&quot;, which can be thought of as a geometric visualization of which strategies beat which other strategies. In some games, like &quot;say a number between 1 and 10, you get reward equal to your number - opponent&#x27;s number&quot;, the gamescape is a 1-D line -- there is a scalar value of &quot;how good a strategy is&quot;, and a better strategy will beat a weaker strategy. On the other hand, rock-paper-scissors is a cyclic game, and the gamescape looks like a triangle -- there&#x27;s no strategy that strictly dominates all other strategies. Even the Nash strategy of randomizing between all three actions is not the &quot;best&quot;, in that it fails to exploit suboptimal strategies, eg. the strategy of always playing rock. With games that are even somewhat cyclic (such as StarCraft), rather than trying to find the Nash equilibrium, we should try to explore and map out the entire strategy space. The paper also has some theoretical results supporting this that I haven&#x27;t read through in detail.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I don&#x27;t care very much about whether AlphaStar is superhuman or not -- it clearly is very good at StarCraft at both the micro and macro levels. Whether it hits the rather arbitrary level of &quot;top human performance&quot; is not as interesting as the fact that it is anywhere in the ballpark of &quot;top human performance&quot;.</p><p>It&#x27;s interesting to compare this to <a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/\">OpenAI Five</a> (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/8234356e4b7f/alignment-newsletter-13\">AN #13</a>). While OpenAI solved the exploration problem using a combination of reward shaping and domain randomization, DeepMind solved it by using imitation learning on human games. While OpenAI relied primarily on self-play, DeepMind used population-based training in order to deal with catastrophic forgetting and in order to be robust to many different strategies. It&#x27;s possible that this is because of the games they were playing -- it&#x27;s plausible to me that StarCraft has more rock-paper-scissors-like cyclic mechanics than Dota, and so it&#x27;s more important to be robust to many strategies in StarCraft. But I don&#x27;t know either game very well, so this is pure speculation.</p><p>Exploring the full strategy space rather than finding the Nash equilibrium seems like the right thing to do, though I haven&#x27;t kept up with the multiagent RL literature so take that with a grain of salt. That said, it doesn&#x27;t seem like the full solution -- you also want some way of identifying what strategy your opponent is playing, so that you can choose the optimal strategy to play against them.</p><p>I often think about how you can build AI systems that <em>cooperate</em> with humans. This can be significantly harder: in competitive games, if your opponent is more suboptimal than you were expecting, you just crush them even harder. However, in a cooperative game, if you make a bad assumption about what your partner will do, you can get significantly worse performance. (If you&#x27;ve played Hanabi, you&#x27;ve probably experienced this.) Self-play does not seem like it would handle this situation, but this kind of population-based training could potentially handle it, if you also had a method to identify how your partner is playing. (Without such a method, you would play some generic strategy that would hopefully be quite robust to playstyles, but would still not be nearly as good as being able to predict what your partner does.)</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08106\">Open-ended Learning in Symmetric Zero-sum Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ajgzoc/we_are_oriol_vinyals_and_david_silver_from\">AMA with AlphaStar creators and pro players</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/24/18196177/ai-artificial-intelligence-google-deepmind-starcraft-game\">Vox: StarCraft is a deep, complicated war strategy game.

First, the classic argument that expected utility maximizers (or, as I prefer to call them, goal-directed agents) are dangerous because of Goodhart&#x27;s Law, fragility of value and convergent instrumental subgoals. Second, we don&#x27;t know how to robustly &quot;put a goal&quot; inside an AI system, such that its behavior will then look like the pursuit of that goal. (As an analogy, evolution might seem like a good way to get agents that pursue reproductive fitness, but it ended up creating humans who decidedly do not pursue reproductive fitness single-mindedly.) Third, as we create many AI systems that gradually become the main actors in our economy, these AI systems will control most of the resources of the future. There will likely be some divergence between what the AI &quot;values&quot; and what we value, and for sufficiently powerful AI systems we will no longer be able to correct these divergences, simply because we won&#x27;t be able to understand their decisions. Fourth, it seems that a good future requires us to solve hard philosophy problems that humans cannot yet solve (so that even if the future was controlled by a human it would probably not turn out well), and so we would need to either solve these problems or figure out an algorithm to solve them. Fifth, powerful AI capabilities could be misused by malicious actors, or they could inadvertently lead to doom through coordination failures, eg. by developing ever more destructive weapons. Finally, the broadest argument is simply that AI is going to have a large impact on the world, and so of course we want to ensure that the impact is positive.</p><p>Richard then speculates on what inferences to make from the fact that different people have different arguments for working on AI safety. His primary takeaway is that we are still confused about what problem we are solving, and so we should spend more time clarifying fundamental ideas and describing particular deployment scenarios and corresponding threat models.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I think the overarching problem is the last one, that AI will have large impacts and we don&#x27;t have a strong story for why they will necessarily be good. Since it is very hard to predict the future, especially with new technologies, I would expect that different people trying to concretize this very broad worry into a more concrete one would end up with different scenarios, and this mostly explains the proliferation of arguments. Richard does note a similar effect by considering the example of what arguments the original nuclear risk people could have made, and finding a similar proliferation of arguments.</p><p>Setting aside the overarching argument #6, I find all of the arguments fairly compelling, but I&#x27;m probably most worried about #1 (suitably reformulated in terms of goal-directedness) and #2. It&#x27;s plausible that I would also find some of the multiagent worries more compelling once more research has been done on them; so far I don&#x27;t have much clarity about them.</p><h1>Technical AI alignment</h1><h3>Iterated amplification sequence</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qALeGJ9nPcs9eC9Af/learning-with-catastrophes\">Learning with catastrophes</a> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: In iterated amplification, we need to train a fast agent from a slow one produced by <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/t3AJW5jP3sk36aGoC/capability-amplification\">amplification</a> (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/f6488137d76c/alignment-newsletter-42\">AN #42</a>). We need this training to be such that the resulting agent <em>never</em> does anything catastrophic at test time. In iterated amplification, we do have the benefit of having a strong overseer who can give good fedback. This suggests a formalization for catastrophes. Suppose there is some oracle that can take any sequence of observations and actions and label it as catastrophic or not. How do we use this oracle to train an agent that will never produce catastrophic behavior at test time?</p><p>Given unlimited compute and unlimited access to the oracle, this problem is easy: simply search over all possible environments and ask the oracle if the agent behaves catastrophically on them. If any such behavior is found, train the agent to not perform that behavior any more. Repeat until all catastrophic behavior is eliminated. This is basically a very strong form of adversarial training.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I&#x27;m not sure how necessary it is to explicitly aim to avoid catastrophic behavior -- it seems that even a low capability <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">corrigible</a> agent would still know enough to avoid catastrophic behavior in practice. However, based on <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/E2aZ9Xwdz3i2ghPtn/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance\">Techniques for optimizing worst-case performance</a>, summarized below, it seems like the motivation is actually to avoid catastrophic failures of corrigibility, as opposed to all catastrophes.</p><p>In fact, we can see that we can&#x27;t avoid all catastrophes without some assumption on either the environment or the oracle. Suppose the environment can do anything computable, and the oracle evaluates behavior only based on outcomes (observations). In this case, for any observation that the oracle would label as catastrophic, there is an environment that regardless of the agent&#x27;s action outputs that observation, and there is no agent that can always avoid catastrophe. So for this problem to be solvable, we need to either have a limit on what the environment &quot;could do&quot;, or an oracle that judges &quot;catastrophe&quot; based on the agent&#x27;s action in addition to outcomes. That latter option can cache out to &quot;are the actions in this transcript knowably going to cause something bad to happen&quot;, which sounds very much like corrigibility.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NtX7LKhCXMW2vjWx6/thoughts-on-reward-engineering\">Thoughts on reward engineering</a> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: This post digs into some of the &quot;easy&quot; issues with reward engineering (where we must design a good reward function for an agent, given access to a stronger overseer).</p><p>First, in order to handle outcomes over long time horizons, we need to have the reward function capture the overseer&#x27;s evaluation of the long-term consequences of an action, since it isn&#x27;t feasible to wait until the outcomes actually happen.</p><p>Second, since human judgments are inconsistent and unreliable, we could have the agent choose an action such that there is no other action which the overseer would evaluate as better in a <em>comparison</em> between the two. <em>(This is not exactly right -- the human&#x27;s comparisons could be such that this is an impossible standard. The post uses a two-player game formulation that avoids the issue, and gives the guarantee that the agent won&#x27;t choose something that is unambiguously worse than another option.)</em></p><p>Third, since the agent will be uncertain about the overseer&#x27;s reward, it will have the equivalent of normative uncertainty -- how should it trade off between different possible reward functions the overseer could have? One option is to choose a particular yardstick, eg. how much the overseer values a minute of their time, some small amount of money, etc. and normalize all rewards to that yardstick.</p><p>Fourth, when there are decisions with very widely-varying scales of rewards, traditional algorithms don&#x27;t work well. Normally we could focus on the high-stakes decisions and ignore the others, but if the high-stakes decisions occur infrequently then all decisions are about equally important. In this case, we could oversample high-stakes decisions and reduce their rewards (i.e. importance sampling) to use traditional algorithms to learn effectively without changing the overall &quot;meaning&quot; of the reward function. However, very rare+high-stakes decisions will probably require additional techniques.</p><p>Fifth, for sparse reward functions where most behavior is equally bad, we need to provide &quot;hints&quot; about what good behavior looks like. Reward shaping is the main current approach, but we do need to make sure that by the end of training we are using the true reward, not the shaped one. Lots of other information such as demonstrations can also be taken as hints that allow you to get higher reward.</p><p>Finally, the reward will likely be sufficiently complex that we cannot write it down, and so we&#x27;ll need to rely on an expensive evaluation by the overseer. We will probably need semi-supervised RL in order to make this sufficiently computationally efficient.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> As the post notes, these problems are only &quot;easy&quot; in the conceptual sense -- the resulting RL problems could be quite hard. I feel most confused about the third and fourth problems. Choosing a yardstick could work to aggregate reward functions, but I still worry about the issue that this tends to overweight reward functions that assign a low value to the yardstick but high value to other outcomes. With widely-varying rewards, it seems hard to importance sample high-stakes decisions, without knowing what those decisions might be. Maybe if we notice a very large reward, we instead make it lower reward, but oversample it in the future? Something like this could potentially work, but I don&#x27;t see how yet.</p><p>For complex, expensive-to-evaluate rewards, Paul suggests using semi-supervised learning; this would be fine if semi-supervised learning was sufficient, but I worry that there actually isn&#x27;t enough information in just a few evaluations of the reward function to narrow down on the true reward sufficiently, which means that even conceptually we will need something else.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/E2aZ9Xwdz3i2ghPtn/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance\">Techniques for optimizing worst-case performance</a> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: There are “benign” failures of worst-case performance, where the AI system encounters a novel situation and behaves weirdly, but not in a way that systematically disfavors human values. As I noted above, we can’t get rid of all of these, but that’s probably fine. We instead would like to focus on “malign” failures, where the AI system applies its intelligence in pursuit of the wrong goal. There are a few techniques that could be applied to this problem.</p><p>With adversarial training, we can have one system find inputs on which our agent fails catastrophically, and then train the agent to avoid those behaviors. The main issue here is that there will likely be some failures that aren&#x27;t found.</p><p>On the other hand, verification has strong guarantees, but suffers from the problem that it is hard to know what to specify, and it is computationally expensive to actually perform verification. If we have a strong trusted overseer, eg. produced by amplification, we could use it as a very expensive specification. Alternatively, we could use a catastrophe-checker in lieu of a specification. <em>(Note: While I can see some ways of using catastrophe-checkers, the post seems to have a specific method in mind that I don&#x27;t understand.)</em></p><p>Any malignant failure must be using the intelligence of the agent somehow, and the agent is only intelligent on the training data, so if we can use strong transparency techniques on the training data, we could find such failures. However, if you use transparency for this, by default you weed out the comprehensible failures and leave in the incomprehensible ones.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> While I agree that it would be great to optimize worst-case performance, all of these techniques feel quite difficult to do scalably and with guarantees. With adversarial training, you need to find <em>all</em>of the ways that an agent could fail, while catastrophe could happen if the agent stumbles across <em>any</em> of these methods. It seems plausible to me that with sufficient additional information given to the adversary we can meet this standard, but it seems very hard to <em>knowably</em> meet this standard, i.e. to have a strong argument that we will find all of the potential issues.</p><p>With verification, the specification problem seems like a deal-breaker, unless combined with other methods: a major point with AI safety is that we can&#x27;t write down a good specification for what we want. If we instead only use verification to propagate worst-case guarantees from one model to another (as the post suggests), then it seems possible in theory, but very expensive in practice: most verification techniques assume unlimited fast access to the specification, whereas our specification is very expensive to query. Of course, not much research has focused on this setting, so we can expect large gains; nonetheless you do need to somehow extrapolate the specification to all possible inputs, which seems hard to do with limited access to the specification.</p><p>Transparency also seems like it provides additional safety, rather than making any guarantees, since we probably can&#x27;t get a guarantee that our transparency mechanisms can show us all possible failure modes in a way that we understand them. The argument that we can only focus on the training data makes the assumption that the AI system is not going to generalize well outside of the training dataset. While I&#x27;m sympathetic to this assumption (we really don&#x27;t have good methods for generalization, and there are strong reasons to expect generalization to be near-impossible), it isn&#x27;t one that I&#x27;m confident about, especially when we&#x27;re talking about <em>general</em> intelligence.</p><p>Of course, I&#x27;m still excited for more research to be done on these topics, since they do seem to cut out some additional failure modes. But if we&#x27;re looking to have a semi-formal strong argument that we will have good worst-case performance, I don&#x27;t see the reasons for optimism about that.</p><h3>Value learning sequence</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/eD9T4kiwB6MHpySGE/the-human-side-of-interaction\">The human side of interaction</a> <em>(Rohin Shah)</em>: The lens of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4783ufKpx8xvLMPc6/human-ai-interaction\">human-AI interaction</a> (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/8c3f02cabccd/alignment-newsletter-41\">AN #41</a>) also suggests that we should focus on what the <em>human</em> should do in AI alignment.</p><p>Any feedback that the AI system gets must be interpreted using some assumption. For example, when a human provides an AI system a reward function, it shouldn&#x27;t be interpreted as a description of optimal behavior in every possible situation (which is what we currently do implicitly). <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02827\">Inverse Reward Design</a> (IRD) suggests an alternative, more realistic assumption: the reward function is likely to the extent that it leads to high true utility in the training environment. Similarly, in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) human demonstrations are often interpreted under the assumption of Boltzmann rationality.</p><p>Analogously, we may also want to train humans to give feedback to AI systems in the manner that they are expecting. With IRD, the reward designer should make sure to test the reward function extensively in the training environment. If we want our AI system to help us with long-term goals, we may want the overseers to be much more cautious and uncertain in their feedback (depending on how such feedback is interpreted). Techniques that learn to reason like humans, such as iterated amplification and debate, would by default learn to interpret feedback the way humans do. Nevertheless it will probably be useful to train humans to provide useful feedback: for example, in debate, we want humans to judge which side provided more true and useful information.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/MxadmSXHnoCupsWqx/future-directions-for-narrow-value-learning\">Future directions for narrow value learning</a> <em>(Rohin Shah)</em>: This post summarizes some future directions for narrow value learning that I&#x27;m particularly interested in from a long-term perspective.</p><h3>Problems</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JbcWQCxKWn3y49bNB/disentangling-arguments-for-the-importance-of-ai-safety\">Disentangling arguments for the importance of AI safety</a></strong> <em>(Richard Ngo)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><h3>Agent foundations</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BRuWm4GxcTNPn4XDX/clarifying-logical-counterfactuals\">Clarifying Logical Counterfactuals</a> <em>(Chris Leong)</em></p><h3>Learning human intent</h3><p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05101\">ReNeg and Backseat Driver: Learning from Demonstration with Continuous Human Feedback</a> <em>(Jacob Beck et al)</em></p><h3>Handling groups of agents</h3><p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06085\">Theory of Minds: Understanding Behavior in Groups Through Inverse Planning</a> <em>(Michael Shum, Max Kleiman-Weiner et al)</em> (summarized by Richard): This paper introduces Composable Team Hierarchies (CTH), a representation designed for reasoning about how agents reason about each other in collaborative and competitive environments. CTH uses two &quot;planning operators&quot;: the Best Response operator returns the best policy in a single-agent game, and the Joint Planning operator returns the best team policy when all agents are cooperating. Competitive policies can then be derived via recursive application of those operations to subsets of agents (while holding the policies of other agents fixed).

The Brahmic writing was plainly visible for anyone to see, spelt out in the two halves of oily white meat. The implications of such an experience could only have been one of the following: the first is that the Supreme Being has no qualms about revealing his Divine Will in the contents of mere palm fruit, any more than in a whirlwind or through an oracle. The second is that the farmer’s perceptual systems produced an inaccurate representation of what he saw engraved in the fruit lining. It’s anybody’s guess as to which it really was. But regardless of whatever information was contained in the coconut, the moral of the story is that whilst miracles are known to happen, it can also be said that people regularly see things which are not there. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p>That we end up being misled by our senses is a widely-accepted truism, as most humans mistake the limits of their perception for the limits of the world itself. It’s not uncommon for people to push forward in their endeavors with a premature understanding of things, using inadequate standards to measure what they see in the world around them. Such errors in judgement range from being mild, such as mistakenly purchasing a rotten apple because you didn’t inspect its underside, to being detrimental, such as presuming that the oasis in the middle of the desert is real, when it’s only a hallucination. Hence, there are times when people are not so much moved by external objects as by their perception of those objects; what they claim to “know” is in fact only known conditionally, since human knowledge is always limited, thanks in part to our limited perceptual systems. Rare are those whose conception of reality is not exclusively dependent on their perception of it, who understand that there are things which you know and things which you don’t know, and in between are several doorways, of which one is called “Perception”; this door must be entered with prudence.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>It is a common presumption that people see the world primarily with their eyes, but in fact, that is only true when they look at the objects that they recognize; things they have seen before and have categorized in their mind. In a case like that, they would have already built up the necessary perceptual tools that allow them to properly identify what they’re looking at. But when they look at something that they don’t recognize, something alien or new to them, the imagination takes over the function of the eyes, and becomes their primary tool of orientation. Whilst our physical senses may reveal to us the physical world, it is our imagination that allows us to project ourselves beyond finite time and space, into the realm of possibilities, abstracts and narratives.</p><p>In terms of perceptual experience, the dominant line of thought is that the world is primarily made up of objects. This may seem fairly straightforward, since you presumably see these objects all around you: buildings, street lights, vehicles, telephones, animals, humans, etc. As a consequence of seeing these objects, you generate thoughts about how to interact with them, and after completing your thought process, you proceed to act. As self-evident as this might appear, it begs further reflection. Let’s imagine a scenario where you’re sitting in a cafe, and you happen to catch a glimpse of an attractive individual at a nearby table. On one level, you perceive them as an object of interest, i.e, a intriguing material thing to be observed. Captivated by their appearance, you immediately start to draft assumptions about what kind of person they are, and how you might approach them to initiate a relationship. But in your enamored state, what you failed to consider was that there are other levels of this person’s existence which are invisible, yet equally defining for them. In terms of the biological, that person exists as a collection of billions of cells that perform numerous functions uninterruptedly<em>. </em>At a higher level of organization, the cells form tissues that perform specific bodily functions, and those tissues collectively form organs, and so on until we finally get to what the person looks like in front of you in their total embodied form. None of these other levels of biological existence are less relevant than the person’s overall appearance to you as an object. If it turns out that he or she is a cancer patient, battling a tumor, then the import of their unseen cellular reality becomes quite relevant<em>.</em> And there are yet other level of analysis: this person will have inextricable social ties that define them, such as friends and family, who may come from different backgrounds, cultures and other group categories based on their ethnicity, level of education, income bracket, etc<em>.</em> And even those groups are connected to yet other groupings, until who this person is can be expanded to encompass virtually anything. But when you blissfully observe them from your nearby table, you don’t see any of that reflected in them as a mere object<em>.</em> You can only see them at a certain level of resolution, as mediated by your ideas and impressions, yet all of the other details that escape your attention are equally relevant for defining who they are.</p><p>The idea of the world being more than just a collection of objects can be seen not only in social relationships or biological matter, but also in how we interact with inanimate devices. A computer is viewed as an object, but when you interact with it, you’re not really interacting with the computer itself, which is essentially a motherboard and other internal electric components. A keyboard, mouse and a graphical user interface have been provided for you to use, and those tools will interact with the computer for you. But if the computer were to unexpectedly crash, then you would be forced to interact with the machine itself, which most people find frustrating, as they realize that they know very little about how computers actually work. Similarly, when you interact with the world, your desire is mainly to produce a favorable result for yourself, for which a technical understanding of how things work is often unnecessary. This is why, from public transport to consumer technology, we are often met by a friendly, uncomplicated user interface or control surface when interacting with the infrastructure around us, which hides the complex configurations that more accurately would define the object in front of us. What this means is that people’s perceptions are ultimately framed by the things they want or have been trained to see, and not an actual understanding of the world or its technical workings. So in terms of perceptual experience, the world is not primarily made up of the innumerable objects that you see around you; it’s made up of information. More practically speaking, it’s made up of tools and obstacles; things that you can use for your purposes, and things that get in your way. An illustration of this can be seen in how babies relate to the world: it takes years for them to build up an object-based view of their environment, as they have little to no comprehension of what their surroundings actually are, yet they still manage to orient themselves, albeit somewhat clumsily. So even though people may look at the world and think they only see objects, there are in fact multiple processes that influence them to make that judgement, such as their pre-conceptions, desires, and past experiences. It is only because people have such a limited perception of things that they fail to realize that an object always transcends the manner in which they frame it.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>It would be interesting to hear whether people recognize the above ideas as something familiar, or view them as a set of open-ended concepts that have yet to reach a satisfactory conclusion.</em></p><p><em>This is a contracted article of what was originally published on <a href=\"http://greekspeek.com/\">Greekspeek.com</a></em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>All of this is vague intuition.</p><p><a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Much</a> has been <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x5ASTMPKPowLKpLpZ/moloch-s-toolbox-1-2\">said</a> about the problems of Nash equilibria. I&#x27;ve been wondering about how to quantify these sorts of problems. From Moloch&#x27;s Toolbox:</p><blockquote>3.  Systems that are broken in multiple places so that no one actor can make them better, even though, in principle, some magically <em>coordinated</em> action could move to a new stable state.</blockquote><p>My animating thought is that information and incentives aren&#x27;t evenly distributed, and further there is an important time dimension to the problem. I expect it should be possible to temporarily disrupt any given equilibrium. From disruption, a better equilibrium could be reached. Alternatively, maybe it is possible to go directly to the better equilibrium.</p><ul><li>We should be able to get knowledge of the actors.</li><li>Information, which is to say beliefs-about-the-current-equilibrium, is not perfect or even among them. <em>How</em> imperfect and <em>how</em> uneven?</li><li>With knowledge of the actors, we should be able to get a distribution of their incentives.</li><li>Now we know how many actors, and their incentives, and their information. With <em>this</em> knowledge, we should be able to determine how big an incentive we need to offer in order to shift them into a target equilibrium.</li><li>If we want it to be a new equilibrium, we will need to affect enough actors to make it fairly stable. How many actors will we need, a la the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect\">hundredth monkey effect?</a></li><li>It is probably important to be able to tailor incentives to actors.</li><li>My intuition for the threshold is that the weaker the belief in the current equilibrium, the less incentive will be required to shift them. So the target is something like (current incentives from equilibrium + incentive to overcome belief).</li></ul><p>I think of this like surveying a rock face for blasting. Once we identify the lowest-dynamite method, anyone else with enough dynamite can come along and detonate.</p><p>My default assumption is that this will take the traditional form of getting a lot of capital and using that to directly or indirectly provide these incentives. Under this assumption there needs to be a reason for that capital to be available, which is to say a profit; maybe this is realizable through market operations directly. Alternatively this could be the vehicle for a startup&#x27;s pitch; it seems like this process would qualify as superlative market research.</p><p>However, it does occur to me that actors might be more like <em>individuals</em> who work in key positions, rather than entire firms. If that is the case I expect the belief-disparities to be even higher than they would be for firms, and the cost of shifting them probably smaller.</p><p>Near as I can tell, no one has really taken a startup-pitch-worth of effort to describe an attempt at shifting an equilibrium, especially not in the sense that we talk about them.</p>",

What about an un-summarisable one?</p>\n<p>By hellworld, I mean a world of very low value according to our value scales - maybe one where large number of simulations are being tortured (aka <a href=\"https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2014/07/bostrom-on-superintelligence-4.html\">mind crimes</a>).</p>\n<p>A hellworld could look superficially positive, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mSYR46GZZPMmX7q93/corrigible-but-misaligned-a-superintelligent-messiah\">if we don't dig too deep</a>. It could look <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nFv2buafNc9jSaxAH/siren-worlds-and-the-perils-of-over-optimised-search\">irresistibly positive</a>.</p>\n<p>Could it be bad in a way that we would find indescribable? It seems that it must be possible. The set of things that can be described to us is finite; the set of things that can be described to us without fundamentally changing our values is much smaller still. If a powerful AI was motivated to build a hellworld such that the hellish parts of it were too complex to be described to us, it would seem that it could. There is no reason to suspect that the set of indescribable worlds contains only good worlds.</p>\n<h2>Can it always be summarised?</h2>\n<p>Let's change the setting a bit. We have a world <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"W\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.104em;\">W</span></span></span></span></span></span>, and a powerful AI <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> that is giving us information about <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"W\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.104em;\">W</span></span></span></span></span></span>. The <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> is aligned/friendly/corrigible or whatever we need to be. It's also trustworthy, in that it always speaks to us in a way that <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1249\">increases our understanding</a>.</p>\n<p>Then if <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"W\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.104em;\">W</span></span></span></span></span></span> is an indescribable hellworld, can <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> summarise that fact for us?</p>\n<p>It seems that it can. In the very trivial sense, it can, by just telling us \"it's an indescribable hellworld\". But it seems it can do more than that, in a way that's philosophically interesting.</p>\n<p>A hellworld is ultimately a world that is against our values. However, our values are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KCg7NeKQ7MycXWpYd/our-values-are-underdefined-changeable-and-manipulable\">underdefined and changeable</a>. So to have any chance of saying what these values are, we need to either extract key invariant values, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately\">synthesise our contradictory values</a> into some complete whole, or use some extrapolation procedure (eg <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf\">CEV</a>). In any case, there is a procedure for establishing our values (or else the very concept of \"hellworld\" makes no sense).</p>\n<p>Now, it is possible that our values themselves may be indescribable to us now (especially in the case of extrapolations). But <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> can at least tell us that <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"W\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.104em;\">W</span></span></span></span></span></span> is against our values, and provide some description as to the value it is against, and what part of the procedure ended up giving us that value. This does give us some partial understanding of why the hellworld is bad - a useful summary, if you want.</p>\n<p>On a more meta level, imagine the contrary - that <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"W\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.104em;\">W</span></span></span></span></span></span> was hellworld, but the superintelligent agent <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> could not indicate what human values it actually violated, even approximately. Since our values are not some exnihilio thing floating in space, but derived from us, it is hard to see how something could be against our values in a way that could never be summarised to us. That seems almost definitionally impossible: if the violation of our values can never be summarised, even at the meta level, how can it be a violation of our values?</p>\n<h2>Trustworthy debate is FAI complete</h2>\n<p>It seems that the consequence of that is that we can avoid hellworlds (and, presumably, aim for heaven) by having a corrigible and trustworthy AI that engages in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899\">debate</a> or is a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375454/like-this-world-but\">devil's advocate</a>. Now, I'm very sceptical of getting corrigible or trustworthy AIs in general, but it seems that if we can, we've probably solved the FAI problem.</p>\n<p>Note that even in the absence of a single given way of formalising our values, the AI could list the plausible formalisations for which <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"W\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.104em;\">W</span></span></span></span></span></span> was or wasn't a hellworld.</p>\n</body></html>",

So do you disagree?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think it's a really good question, and its answer is related to a lot of relevant issues, so I put this here as a top-level post. My current feeling is, contrary to my previous intuitions, that things like \"manipulation\" might not be possible to specify in a way that leads to useful disentanglement.</p>\n<h2>Why manipulate?</h2>\n<p>First of all, we should ask why an AI would be tempted to manipulate us in the first place. It may be that it needs us to do something for it to accomplish its goal; in that case it is trying to manipulate our actions. Or maybe its goal includes something that cashes out as out mental states; in that case, it is trying to manipulate our mental state directly.</p>\n<p>The problem is that any reasonable friendly AI would have our mental states as part of its goal - it would at least want us to be happy rather than miserable. And (almost) any AI that wasn't perfectly <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06365\">indifferent</a> to our actions would be trying to manipulate us <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence\">just to get its goals accomplished</a>.</p>\n<p>So manipulation is to be expected by most AI designs, friendly or not.</p>\n<h2>Manipulation versus explanation</h2>\n<p>Well, since the urge to manipulate is expected to be present, could we just rule it out? The problem is that we need to define the difference between manipulation and explanation.</p>\n<p>Suppose I am fully aligned/corrigible/nice or whatever other properties you might desire, and I want to inform you of something important and relevant. In doing so, especially if I am more intelligent than you, I will simplify, I will omit irrelevant details, I will omit arguably relevant details, I will emphasise things that help you get a better understanding of my position, and de-emphasise things that will just confuse you.</p>\n<p>And these are exactly the same sorts of behaviours that smart manipulator would do. Nor can we define the difference as whether the AI is truthful or not. We want <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1249\">human understanding</a> of the problem, not truth. It's perfectly possible to manipulate people while telling them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0ZZJXw4MTA&amp;t=30\">nothing but the truth</a>. And if the AI structures the order in which it presents the true facts, it can manipulate people while presenting the whole truth as well as nothing but the truth.</p>\n<p>It seems that the only difference between manipulation and explanation is whether we end up with a better understanding of the situation at the end. And measuring understanding is very subtle. And even if we do it right, note that we have now motivated the AI to... aim for a particular set of mental states. We are rewarding it for manipulating us. This is contrary to the standard understanding of manipulation, which focuses on the means, not the end result.</p>\n<h2>Bad behaviour and good values</h2>\n<p>Does this mean that the situation is completely hopeless? No. There are certain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion\">manipulative practices</a> that we might choose to ban. Especially if the AI is limited in capability at some level, this would force it to follow behaviours that are less likely to be manipulative.</p>\n<p>Essentially, there is no boundary between manipulation and explanation, but there is a difference between extreme manipulation and explanation, so ruling out the first can help (or <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/nearest_unblocked/\">maybe not</a>).</p>\n<p>The other thing that can be done is to ensure that the AI has values close to ours. The closer the values of the AI are to us, the less manipulation it will need to use, and the less egregious the manipulation will be. It might be that, between partial value convergence and ruling out specific practices (and maybe some physical constraints), we may be able to get an AI that is very unlikely to manipulate us much.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, I feel the same about <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10720\">low-impact</a> approaches. The full generality problem, an AI that is low impact but value-agnostic, I think is impossible. But if the values of the AI are better aligned with us, and more physically constrained, then low impact becomes easier to define.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>If powerful ML systems fail catastrophically, they may be able to quickly cause irreversible damage. To be safe, it’s not enough to have an average-case performance guarantee on the training distribution — we need to ensure that even if our systems fail on new distributions or with small probability, they will never fail <em>too</em> badly.</p><p>The difficulty of optimizing worst-case performance is one of the most likely reasons that I think <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/prosaic-ai-control-b959644d79c2\">prosaic AI alignment</a> might turn out to be impossible (if combined with an <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/daemons/\">unlucky empirical situation</a>).</p><p>In this post I want to explain my view of the problem and enumerate some possible angles of attack. My goal is to communicate why I have hope that worst-case guarantees are achievable.</p><p>None of these are novel proposals. The intention of this post is to explain my view, not to make a new contribution. I don’t currently work in any of these areas, and so this post should be understood as an outsider looking in, rather than coming from the trenches.</p><h2>Malign vs. benign failures and corrigibility</h2><p>I want to distinguish two kinds of failures:</p><ul><li>“Benign” failures, where our system encounters a novel situation, doesn’t know how to handle it, and so performs poorly. The resulting behavior may simply be erratic, or may serve an external attacker. Their effect is similar to physical or cybersecurity vulnerabilities — they create an opportunity for destructive conflict but don’t systematically disfavor human values. They may pose an existential risk when combined with high-stakes situations, in the same way that human incompetence may pose an existential risk. Although these failures are important, I don’t think it is necessary or possible to eliminate them in the worst case.</li><li>“Malign” failures, where our system continues to behave competently but applies its intelligence in the service of an unintended goal. These failures systematically favor whatever goals AI systems tend to pursue in failure scenarios, at the expense of human values. They constitute an existential risk independent of any other destructive technology or dangerous situation. Fortunately, they seem both less likely and potentially possible to avoid even in the worst case.</li></ul><p>I’m most interested in malign failures, and the narrower focus is important to my optimism.</p><p>The distinction between malign and benign failures is not always crisp. For example, suppose we try to predict a human’s preferences, then search over all strategies to find the one that best satisfies the predicted preferences. Guessing the preferences even a little bit wrong would create an adversarial optimizer incentivized to apply its intelligence to a purpose at odds with our real preferences. If we take this approach, incompetence does systematically disfavor human values.</p><p>By aiming for corrigible rather than optimal behavior (see <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/hard_corrigibility/\">here</a> or <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">here</a>) I’m optimistic that it is possible to create a sharper distinction between benign and malign failures, which can be leveraged by the techniques below. But for now, this hope is highly speculative.</p><h2>Amplification</h2><p>I believe that these techniques are much more likely to work if we have access to an overseer who is significantly smarter than the model that we are trying to train. I hope that <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/alphago-zero-and-capability-amplification-ede767bb8446\">amplification</a> makes this possible.</p><p>It seems realistic for a strong overseer to recognize an (input, output) pair as a malign failure mode (though it may require a solution to <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/the-informed-oversight-problem-1b51b4f66b35\">informed oversight</a>). So now we have a concrete goal: find a model that never gives an output the overseer would diagnose as catastrophically bad.</p><p>Historically researchers in the AI safety community have been extremely pessimistic about reliability. I think part of that pessimism is because they have been imagining working with models much smarter than the overseer.</p><h1>Techniques</h1><p>I’ll describe three categories of techniques:</p><ul><li>Adversarial training</li><li>Verification</li><li>Transparency</li></ul><p>Previous versions of this list included implicit ensembles, e.g. Bayesian neural nets. I still think there might be useful techniques in that space, but I’ve become pessimistic enough that it no longer makes the list.</p><h2>Adversarial training</h2><p>(<em>Examples:</em> <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572\">Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01236\">Adversarial Machine Learning at Scale</a>.)</em></p><p>If we want to know whether our model ever fails catastrophically, it’s natural to train an adversary to search for catastrophe-inducing inputs. If the adversary can’t find one, then we hope that none exist. In order to produce a catastrophe-free model, we can integrate the results of testing into the training process.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.cleverhans.io/security/privacy/ml/2017/06/14/verification.html\">basic problem</a> with this strategy is that no matter how hard you test, it’s always possible (realistically, it’s likely) that there are possible failure cases your adversary didn’t notice. For example, suppose that it takes 2ᴺ seconds to find the Nth failure. Because nature will be many times more complex than our training procedure, it’s inevitable that there are many types of failures that nature can find but we can’t.</p><p>We can attack this problem by trying to make the adversary’s job easier. Some possibilities:</p><ul><li>Use interpretability techniques (see below) to help the adversary identify possible failures.</li><li>Use interpretability to expand what counts as catastrophic — if the adversary can get the model to think in a way that looks like it <em>could</em> lead to catastrophic behavior under different situations, that could count as a success for the adversary.</li><li>Combine with verification (see below) to help guide the adversary’s search and expand the space of allowed attacks.</li><li>Allow the adversary to directly control some of the internal computation of our model rather than merely controlling inputs. This requires a way to constrain the actions of the adversary — we want them to be able to produce any failure that could arise naturally, but if we give them too much power then they can trivially cause a catastrophic failure.</li><li>Change the system’s inputs so they are easier for the adversary to fake: see the “distorting observations” and “abstracting observations” sections of <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/red-teams-b5b6de33dc76\">this post</a>.</li><li>Make the adversary more powerful, without changing their task, by applying amplification.</li></ul><p>Adversarial training faces other difficulties as well. For example, it might take a long time for adversarial training to converge, or training might never converge due to non-convexity. I think these are significantly less likely to be deal-breakers, but they are certainly important research problems if we actually want to apply adversarial training.</p><h2>Verification</h2><p><em>(Examples:</em> <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09344\">Certified Defenses against Adversarial Examples</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01135.pdf\">Reluplex: An Efficient SMT Solver for Verifying Deep Neural Networks</a></em>)</p><p>In verification the goal is to find a certificate that there is no input on which a system behaves badly.</p><p>Verification has (at least) two problems:</p><ul><li><strong>Complexity</strong>. It’s really, really hard to verify properties of a computationally interesting model.</li><li><strong>Specification</strong>. It’s unclear what we should be trying to verify.</li></ul><p>Handling complexity is definitely challenging. But if we are free to train the model in order to facilitate verification, and if we are only interested in certifying some “easy” property that the model satisfies with slack, then it’s not clearly doomed.</p><p>Prima facie, specification looks more like an unfixable deal-breaker. In the rest of this section I’ll give three possible approaches for finding specifications. I think none of these is satisfactory on their own, but they leave me optimistic that verification can be useful despite specification difficulty.</p><p>My current view is that specification and complexity are both potentially surmountable difficulties, but that it’s likely their resolutions will result in partial solutions that need to be combined with other approaches.</p><p><strong>Use a slow model of overseer as a specification</strong>. If our overseer is a physical process, to actually get a specification we’d need to learn a model of the overseer. So we’ve just shifted the problem to the model of the overseer.</p><p>Fortunately, this move does potentially made the problem one step better. Because we don’t need to use the overseer model at runtime, we can afford to use a much slower model. So verification could distill a very slow reliable model into a fast reliable model.</p><p><strong>Amplification</strong>. If our overseer is produced by amplifying some process H, and we have a trusted model of H, then we can obtain a trusted model of the overseer. So if we were able to form a trusted model of the first step of amplification, then we could iteratively use verification to construct trusted models at each subsequent step.</p><p>We are still left with the problem at the first step of amplification. But at this step we might be able to restrict attention to a small range of questions for which worst-case guarantees are more feasible; we may be able to train weaker models for which worst-case guarantees are more feasible; or we might be able to eliminate the human altogether and begin amplification from some explicit simple core of reasoning. Any of these seems plausible.</p><p><strong>“Verification” without specification.</strong> I find it helpful to think of verification from the primal/dual perspective, which also makes the connection to adversarial training clearer.</p><p>In adversarial training, the adversary wants to find an input on which the system behaves poorly. The dual to the adversary is an explicit list of all inputs, showing that each one of them performs well. The dual is exponentially large, and (relatedly) the adversary’s problem is exponentially hard.</p><p>We can view verification in a given proof system as making the adversary’s job easier, by expanding the set of allowable “attacks.” If we do this carefully, we can make the dual certificate much smaller and make the adversary’s task much more tractable.</p><p>For example, if our proofs (dual solutions) are in first order logic, the adversary’s task is finding any model of the axioms in which there exists an attack. (This is only different in the infinite case.) If our proofs are sum of squares proofs, the adversary’s task is finding a <a href=\"https://www.dsteurer.org/talk/cargese.pdf\">pseudodistribution</a> over attacks. For certain linear programming proofs, the adversary’s goal is finding an attack on a particular extrapolation of the model. And so on.</p><p>On this perspective, we don’t necessarily need an actual specification. Instead, we can take some external catastrophe-checker, relax it to a catastrophe checker over the adversary’s relaxed action space, and then try to implement an adversary against that catastrophe checker. This would change the meaning of the dual, which would now have a subtle statistical interpretation rather than being a traditional certificate.</p><h2>Transparency</h2><p>(<em>Examples:</em> <em><a href=\"https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/\">Feature Visualization</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6034.pdf\">Deep Inside Convolutional Networks</a>)</em></p><p>While training a model, we are free to look inside and “see what it’s thinking.” If we could actually understand those thoughts, we might be able to more easily predict under what conditions it would fail malignantly.</p><p><strong>A (weird) example</strong>: suppose that human evolution was part of an alien project to train a mathematician, and some humans are extracted from our simulation and trained to solve alien math problems. If aliens are only able to test the humans’ behavior they might conclude that they always faithfully solve whatever problem they are posed — especially after a few generations of selection removed all the humans who didn’t do so. But if the aliens were able to look inside the humans’ heads they might discover that this behavior is extremely contingent — perhaps humans are only solving problems because they believe they will die otherwise, and the humans would behave very differently as soon as they saw an opportunity to escape.</p><p>That example is exotic and somewhat implausible, but I think that the same basic dynamic is likely to apply in much messier practical situations. If a model would fail malignantly under some conditions, I think there is some sense in which the model must be testing those conditions during training.</p><p><strong>Malign vs. benign failures:</strong> I think the prospects for using transparency to detect malign failures in models trained by gradient descent are <em>much</em> better than the prospects for detecting benign failures, or for detecting failures in arbitrary models.</p><p>The key point is that a malign failure requires leveraging the intelligence of the model to do something actively bad. If our model is trained by gradient descent, its behavior can only be intelligent when it is exercised on the training distribution — if part of the model never (or very rarely) does anything on the training distribution, then that part of the model can’t be intelligent. So in some sense a malign failure mode needs to use a code path that gets run on the training distribution, just under different conditions that cause it to behave badly.</p><p>That means that we don’t necessarily need to analyze our model in the abstract, we can look at its behavior on actual training data. This looks much more likely to be tractable. (Though this entire discussion is extremely subtle, and without being more precise it’s very easy for us to go wrong.)</p><p><strong>Amplification</strong>: Transparency will be hard if we ultimately want to train models much smarter than we are, but deeply understanding what a model is thinking probably requires being much smarter than it. I think that problem can potentially be overcome by using amplification to stay ahead of the models we are training. This means that current work on transparency, which considers models doing tasks that are within the abilities of the humans who are trying to understand them, could potentially remain relevant even as AI improves significantly.</p><p><strong>What do you do with transparency?</strong> Merely understanding that a model might behave catastrophically could be useful, but it would be much nicer to actually fix the problem. Adversarial training gives a natural mechanism: once we understand a failure we can synthesize appropriate data and then train on that data.</p><p>This approach puts significantly more stress on our transparency techniques. Even if were initially able to use transparency to see how our model might fail, after we perform many generations of selection we might weed out exactly the comprehensible failures and leave the incomprehensible ones. You would only want to apply this technique if you had a great deal of faith in your methods; if you were feeling at all shaky about your ability to achieve worst-case guarantees, and transparency techniques let you see one potential catastrophic failure, it would be better to consider that a near-miss and seriously rework your project rather than plowing on.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Making ML systems work in the worst case is hard, even if we are only concerned with malign failures and have access to an overseer who can identify them. If we can’t solve this problem, I think it seriously calls into question the feasibility of aligned ML.</p><p>Fortunately there are at least a few plausible angles of attack on this problem. All of these approaches feel very difficult, but I don’t think we’ve run into convincing deal-breakers. I also think these approaches are complementary, which makes it feel even more plausible that they (or their descendants) will eventually be successful. I think that exploring these angles of attack, and identifying new approaches, should be a priority for researchers interested in alignment.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>This was originally posted <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99\">here</a> on 1st February, 2018.</em></p><p><em>The next post in this sequence is &quot;Reliability Amplification&quot;, and will come out on Tuesday.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>This essay by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Jensen\">Arthur Jensen</a> is from an <a href=\"https://gwern.net/docs/iq/1996-jensen.pdf\">old book</a> .</p><p>The genius has limits. A simple answer, and undoubtedly true. But my<br/>assignment here is to reflect on the much more complex difference<br/>between intellectual giftedness and genius, using the latter term in its<br/>original sense, as socially recognized, outstandingly creative achievement. In<br/>this think-piece (which is just that, rather than a comprehensive review of the<br/>literature), I will focus on factors, many intriguing in and of themselves, that<br/>are characteristic of genius. My primary thesis is that the emergence of genius is<br/>best described using a multiplicative model.</p><p><br/>I will argue that exceptional achievement is a multiplicative function of a<br/>number of different traits, each of which is normally distributed, but which in<br/>combination are so synergistic as to skew the resulting distribution of achieve­<br/>ment. An extremely extended upper tail is thus produced, and it is within this<br/>tail that genius can be found. An interesting two-part question then arises: how<br/>many different traits are involved in producing extraordinary achievement, and<br/>what are they? The musings that follow provide some conjectures that can be<br/>drawn on to answer this critical question.<br/>As a subject for scientific study, the topic of genius, although immensely<br/>fascinating, is about as far from ideal as any phenom enon one can find. The<br/>literature on real genius can claim little besides biographical anecdotes and<br/>speculation, with this chapter contributing only more of the same. Whether the<br/>study of genius will ever evolve from a literary art form into a systematic science<br/>is itself highly speculative. The most promising efforts in this direction are<br/>those by Simonton (198 8 ) and Eysenck (1 9 9 5 ), with Eysenck’s monograph<br/>leaving little of potential scientific value that can be added to the subject at<br/>present, pending new empirical evidence.<br/></p><h2><br/>Intelligence</h2><p><br/>Earlier I stated that genius has limits. But its upper limit, at least in some fields,<br/>seems to be astronomically higher than its lower limit. Moreover, the upper<br/>lim it of genius cannot be described as characterized by precocity, high intel­<br/>ligence, knowledge and problem -solving skills being learned with speed and<br/>ease, outstanding academic achievement, honors and awards, or even intellec­<br/>tual productivity. Although such attributes are commonly found at all levels of<br/>genius, they are not discriminating in the realm of genius.<br/>My point is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the contrast between two<br/>famous mathematicians who became closely associated with one another as<br/>“teacher” and “student.” T he reason for the quotation marks here will soon be<br/>obvious, because the teacher later claimed that he learned more from the<br/>student than the student had learned from him . G. H. Hardy was England’s<br/>leading mathematician, a professor at Cambridge University, a Fellow of the<br/>Royal Society, and the recipient of an honorary degree from Harvard. Rem ark­<br/>ably precocious in early childhood, especially in m athem atics, he became an exceptionally brilliant student, winning a scholarship after another acknowledged the star graduate in mathematics at Cambridge, where he remained to become a professor of m athem atics. He also became a world-class<br/>mathematician. His longtime friend C. R Snow relates that Hardy, at the peak<br/>of his career, ranked himself fifth among the most important mathematicians<br/>of his day, and it should be pointed out that Hardy’s colleagues regarded him as<br/>an overly modest man (Snow, 1967). If the Study of Mathematically Precocious<br/>Youth (SMPY) had been in existence when Hardy was a schoolboy, he would<br/>have been a most prized and promising student in the program.<br/>One day Hardy received a strange-looking letter from Madras, India. It<br/>was full of mathematical formulations written in a quite unconventional—one<br/>might even say bizarre—form . The writer seemed almost mathematically illiter­<br/>by Cambridge standards. It was signed “Srinivasa Ramanujan.” At first<br/>glance, Hardy thought it might even be some kind of fraud. Puzzling over this<br/>letter with its abstruse formulations, he surmised it was written either by some<br/>trickster or by someone sincere but poorly educated in m athem atics. Hardy<br/>sought the opinion of his most highly esteemed colleague, J. E. Littlewood, the<br/>other famous mathematician at Cambridge. After the two of them had spent<br/>several hours studying the strange letter, they finally realized, with excitement<br/>and absolute certainty, that they had “discovered” a major mathematical ge­<br/>nius. The weird-looking formulas, it turned out, revealed profound m athe­<br/>matical insights of a kind that are never created by ordinarily gifted mathematics.<br/>Hardy regarded this “discovery” as the single most important event in his<br/>life. Here was the prospect of fulfilling what, until then, had been for him only<br/>an improbable dream: of ever knowing in person a mathematician possibly of<br/>Gauss’s caliber.<br/>A colleague in Hardy’s department then traveled to India and persuaded<br/>Ramanujan to go to Cambridge, with all his expenses and a salary paid by the<br/>university. When the youth arrived from India, it was evident that, by ordinary<br/>standards, his educational background was meager and his almost entirely self­<br/>taught knowledge of math was full of gaps. He had not been at all successful in<br/>school, from which he had flunked out twice, and was never graduated. To say,<br/>however, that he was obsessed by m athem atics is an understatement. As a boy in<br/>Madras, he was too poor to buy paper on which to work out his math prob­<br/>lems. He did his prodigious mathematical work on a slate, copying his final<br/>results with red ink on old, discarded newspapers.<br/>While in high school, he thought he had made a stunning mathematical<br/>discovery, but he later learned, to his great dismay, that his discovery had<br/>already been made 150 years earlier by the great mathematician Euler. R am anu­<br/>jan felt extraordinary shame for having “discovered” something that was not<br/>original, never considering that only a real genius could have created or even re­<br/>created that discovery.<br/>At Cambridge, Ramanujan was not required to take courses or exams.<br/>That would have been almost an insult and a sure waste of time. He learned some essential things from Hardy, but what excited Hardy the most had noth­ing to do with Ramanujan’s great facility in learning the most advanced concepts and technical skills of mathematical analysis. Hardy himself had that kind of facility. What so impressed him was Ramanujan’s</p><p>uncanny mathematical intuition and capacity for inventing incredibly original and profound the­orems. That, of course, is what real mathematical genius is all about. Facility in resolving textbook problem s and in passing difficult tests is utterly trivial when<br/>discussing genius. Although working out the proof of a theorem, unlike dis­covering a theorem , may take immense technical skill and assiduous effort, it is<br/>not itself a hallmark of genius. Indeed, Ramanujan seldom bothered to prove<br/>his own theorem s; proof was a technical feat that could be left to lesser geniuses.<br/>Moreover, in some cases, because of his spotty mathematical education, he<br/>probably would have been unable to produce a formal proof even if he had<br/>wanted to. But a great many important theorems were generated in his ob­<br/>passively active brain. Often he seemed to be in another world. One might say<br/>that the difference between Ram anujan creating a theorem and a professional<br/>mathematician solving a complex problem with standard techniques of analysis</p><p>is like the difference between St. Francis in ecstasy and a sleepy vicar reciting the<br/>morning order of prayer.<br/>After his experience with Ramanujan, Hardy told Snow that if the word<br/>genius meant anything, he (Hardy) was not really a genius at all (Snow, 1967, p.<br/>27). Hardy had his own hundred-point rating scale of his estimates of the<br/>“natural ability” of eminent mathematicians. Though regarding himself at the<br/>tim e as one of the world’s five best pure mathematicians, he gave himself a<br/>rating of only 25. The greatest mathematician of that period, David Hilbert,<br/>was rated 80. But Hardy rated Ramanujan 100, the same rating as he gave Carl<br/>Friedrich Gauss, who is generally considered the greatest mathematical genius<br/>the world has known. On the importance of their total contributions to mathematics, however, Hardy rated himself 35, Ramanujan 85, and Gauss 100. By this<br/>reckoning Hardy was seemingly an overachiever and Ramanujan an under­<br/>achiever. Yet one must keep in mind that Ramanujan died at age thirty, Hardy at<br/>seventy, and Gauss at seventy-eight.<br/>of course, all geniuses are by definition extrem e overachievers, in the<br/>statistical sense. Nothing else that we could have known about them besides the<br/>monumental contributions we ascribe to their genius would have predicted<br/>such extraordinary achievement. In discussing Ramanujan&#x27;s work, the Polish<br/>mathematician Mark Kac was forced to make a distinction between the “ordi­<br/>nary genius” and the “magician.” He wrote:<br/>An ordinary genius is a fellow that you and I would be just as good as, if we were<br/>only many times better. There is no mystery as to how his mind works. Once we<br/>understand what he has done, we feel certain that we, too, could have done it. It is<br/>different with the magicians. They are, to use mathematical jargon , in the orthogonal complement of where we are and the working of their minds is for all intents<br/>and purposes incomprehensible. Even after we understand what they have done,<br/>the process by which they have done it is completely dark. (Quoted in Kanigel,<br/>1991, p. 28 1 ; Kanigel’s splendid biography of Ramanujan is highly recommended)<br/><br/>To come back to earth and the point of my meandering, genius requires<br/>giftedness (consisting essentially of g, often along with some special aptitude or<br/>talent, such as mathematical, spatial, musical, or artistic talent). But obviously<br/>there are other antecedents (to the magic of Ramanujan&#x27;s “thinking processes”)<br/>that are elusive to us. Nonetheless, we do know of at least two key attributes,<br/>beyond ability, that appear to function as catalysts for the creation of that<br/>special class of behavioral products specifically indicative of genius. They are<br/>productivity and creativity.<br/></p><h2><br/>Creativity</h2><p></p><p><br/>Although we can recognize creative acts and even quantify them after a fashion<br/>(MacKinnon, 1962), our understanding of them in any explanatory sense is<br/>practically nil. Yet one prominent hypothesis concerning creativity (by which I<br/>mean the bringing into being of something that has not previously existed)<br/>seems to me not only unpromising, but extremely implausible and probably<br/>wrong. It is also inherently unfalsifiable and hence fails Popper’s criterion for a<br/>useful scientific theory. I doubt that it will survive a truly critical examination.<br/>Because ruling out one explanation does further our understanding of creative<br/>ity, I will focus on this theory.<br/>I am referring here to what has been termed the ch an ce configuration<br/>theory of creativity (well explicated by Simonton, 1988, ch. 1). Essentially, it<br/>amounts to expecting that a computer that perpetually generates strictly ran­<br/>dom sequences of all the letters of the alphabet, punctuation signs, and spaces<br/>will eventually produce Hamlet or some other work of creative genius. The<br/>theory insists that blind chance acting in the processes of m em ory searches for<br/>elements with which to form random combinations and permutations, from<br/>which finally there emerges some product or solution that the world considers<br/>original or creative. It is also essential that, although this generating process<br/>is operating entirely by blind chance, the random permutations produced<br/>thereby are subjected to a critical rejection/selection screening, with selective<br/>retention of the more promising products. This theory seems implausible,<br/>partly because of the sheer numerical explosion of the possible combinations<br/>and permutations when there are more than just a few elements. For example,<br/>the letters in the word permutation have 11! = 3 9 ,916,800 possible perm uta­<br/>tions. To discover the “right” one by randomly permuting the letters at a<br/>continuous rate of one permutation per second could take anywhere from one<br/>second (if one were extremely lucky) up to one year, three thirty-day months,<br/>and seven days (if one were equally unlucky). Even then, these calculations<br/>assume that the random generating mechanism never repeated a particular<br/>permutation; otherwise it would take much longer.<br/>The combinatorial and permutation explosion resulting from an in ­</p><p>crease in the number of elements to be mentally manipulated and the exponen­<br/>tially increased processing time are not, however, the worst problem s for this<br/>theory. The far greater problem is that, just as “nature abhors a vacuum,” the<br/>human mind abhors random ness. I recall a lecture by the statistician Helen M.<br/>Walker in which she described a variety of experiments showing that intelligent<br/><br/>people, no matter how sophisticated they are about statistics or how well they<br/>understand the meaning of randomness, and while putting forth their best<br/>conscious efforts, are simply incapable of selecting, combining, or permutation<br/>numbers, letters, words, or anything else in a truly random fashion. For exam ­<br/>ple, when subjects are asked to generate a series of random numbers, or repeat­<br/>edly to make a random selection of N items from among a much larger number<br/>of different objects spread out on a table, or take a random walk, it turns out no<br/>one can do it. This has been verified by statistical tests of randomness applied to<br/>their performance. People even have difficulty simply reading aloud from a<br/>table of random numbers without involuntarily and nonrandom ly inserting<br/>other numbers. (Examples of this phenomenon are given in Kendall, 1948.)<br/>Thus, random ness (o r blind chance, to use the favored term in chance<br/>configuration theory) seems an unlikely explanation of creative thinking. This<br/>theory seems to have originated from what may be deemed an inappropriate<br/>analogy, namely the theory of biological evolution creating new living forms.<br/>According to the latter theory, a great variety of genetic effects is produced by<br/>random mutations and the screening out of all variations except those best<br/>adapted to the environment—that is, natural selection. But a genetic mutation,<br/>produced perhaps by a radioactive particle hitting a single molecule in the DNA<br/>at random and altering its genetic code, is an unfitting analogy for the neces­<br/>sarily integrated action of the myriad neurons involved in the mental manip<br/>ulation of ideas.<br/><br/>The Creative Process<br/>The implausibility of randomness, however, in no way implies that creative<br/>thinking does not involve a great deal of “trial-and -error” mental manipula<br/>tion, though it is not at all random . The products that emerge are then critically<br/>sifted in light of the creator’s aim. The individuals in whom this mental manipulation process turns out to be truly creative most often are those who<br/>are relatively rich in each of three sources of variance in creativity: (1) ideational<br/>flu en cy, or the capacity to tap a flow of relevant ideas, them es, or images, and to<br/>play with them , also known as “brainstorming”; (2) what Eysenck (1995) has<br/>termed the individuals’ relevance horizon ; that is, the range or variety of ele­<br/>m ents, ideas, and associations that seem relevant to the problem (creativity<br/>involves a wide relevance horizon); and (3) suspension of critical ju d g m en t.<br/>Creative persons are intellectually high risk takers. They are not afraid of<br/>zany ideas and can hold the inhibitions of self-criticism temporarily in abey­<br/>ance. Both Darwin and Freud mentioned their gullibility and receptiveness to<br/>highly speculative ideas and believed that these traits were probably charac­<br/><br/>teristic of creative thinkers in general. Darwin occasionally performed what<br/>he called “fool’s experiments,” trying out improbable ideas that most people<br/>would have instantly dismissed as foolish. Francis Crick once told me that Linus<br/>Pauling’s scientific ideas turned out to be wrong about 80 percent of the time,<br/>but the other 20 percent finally proved to be so important that it would be a<br/>mistake to ignore any of his hunches.<br/>I once asked another Nobel Prize winner, William Shockley, whose cre­<br/>activity resulted in about a hundred patented inventions in electronics, what he<br/>considered the main factors involved in his success. He said there were two: (1)<br/>he had an ability to generate, with respect to any given problem , a good many<br/>hypotheses, with little initial constraint by previous knowledge as to their<br/>plausibility or feasibility; and (2) he worked much harder than most people<br/>would at trying to figure out how a zany idea might be shaped into something<br/>technically feasible. Some of the ideas that eventually proved most fruitful, he<br/>said, were even a physical impossibility in their initial conception. For that<br/>very reason, most knowledgeable people would have dismissed such unrealistic<br/>ideas immediately, before searching their imaginations for transformations<br/>that might make them feasible.<br/>Some creative geniuses, at least in the arts, seem to work in the opposite<br/>direction from that described by Shockley. That is, they begin by producing<br/>something fairly conventional, or even trite, and then set about to impose novel<br/>distortions, reshaping it in ways deemed creative. I recall a demonstration of<br/>this by Leonard Bernstein, in which he compared the early drafts of Beethoven’s<br/>Fifth Symphony with the final version we know today. The first draft was a<br/>remarkably routine-sounding piece, scarcely suggesting the familiar qualities of<br/>Beethoven’s genius. It was more on a par with the works com posed by his<br/>mediocre contemporaries, now long forgotten. But then two processes took<br/>hold: (1) a lot of “doctoring,” which introduced what for that time were sur­<br/>prising twists and turns in the harmonies and rhythms, along with an ascetic<br/>purification, and (2) a drastic pruning and simplification of the orchestral score<br/>to rid it completely of all the “unessential” notes in the harmonic texture, all the<br/>“elegant variations” of rhythm , and any suggestion of the kind of filigree orna­<br/>mentation that was so common in the works of his contemporaries. This<br/>resulted in a starkly powerful, taut, and uniquely inevitable-sounding master<br/>piece, which, people now say, only Beethoven could have written. But when<br/>Beethoven’s symphonies were first performed, they sounded so shockingly<br/>deviant from the prevailing aesthetic standards that leading critics declared him<br/>ripe for a madhouse.<br/>One can see a similar process of artistic distortion in a fascinating motion<br/><br/>picture using time-lapse photography of Picasso at work ( The Picasso Mystery).<br/>He usually begin by sketching something quite ordinary—for example, a com ­<br/>pletely realistic horse. Then he would begin distorting the figure this way and<br/>that, repeatedly painting over what he had just painted and imposing further,<br/>often fantastic, distortions. In one instance, this process resulted in such an<br/>utterly hopeless mess that Picasso Finally tossed the canvas aside, with a remark<br/>to the effect of “Now I see how it should go.” Then, taking a clean canvas, he<br/>worked quickly, with bold, deft strokes of his paintbrush, and there suddenly<br/>took shape the strangely distorted figure Picasso apparently had been striving<br/>for. Thus he achieved the startling aesthetic impact typical of Picasso’s art.<br/>It is exactly this kind of artistic distortion of perception that is never seen<br/>in the productions of the most extremely gifted idiot savants, whose drawings<br/>often are incredibly photographic, yet are never considered works of artistic<br/>genius. The greatest artists probably have a comparable gift for realistic draw­<br/>ing, but their genius leads them well beyond such photographic perception.<br/>Other examples of distortion are found in the recorded performances of<br/>the greatest conductors and instrumentalists, the re-creative geniuses, such as<br/>Toscanini and Furtwangler, Paderewski and Kreisler. Such artists are not primarily distinguished from routine practitioners by their technical skill or vir­tuosity (though these are indeed impressive), but by the subtle distortions,<br/>within fairly narrow limits, of rhythm , pitch, phrasing, and the like, that they<br/>impose, consciously or unconsciously, on the works they perform . Differences<br/>between the greatest performers are easily recognizable by these “signatures.”<br/>But others’ attempts to imitate these idiosyncratic distortions are never subtle<br/>enough or consistent enough to escape detection as inauthentic; in fact, they<br/>usually amount to caricatures.<br/></p><p></p><h2>Psychosis</h2><p></p><p>What is the wellspring of the basic elements of creativity listed above—idea­<br/>tional fluency, a wide relevance horizon, the suspension of inhibiting self­<br/>criticism , and the novel distortion of ordinary perception and thought? All of<br/>these features, when taken to an extreme degree, are characteristic of psychosis.<br/>The mental and emotional disorganization of clinical psychosis is, however,</p><p>generally too disabling to perm it genuinely creative or productive work, espe­<br/>cially in the uncompensated individual. Eysenck, however, has identified a trait,<br/>or dimension of personality, term ed psychoticism , which can be assessed by<br/>means of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1991).<br/>Trait psychoticism , it must be emphasized, does not imply the psychiatric<br/><br/>diagnosis of psychosis, but only the predisposition or potential for the develop­<br/>m ent of psychosis (Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1976). In many creative geniuses, this<br/>potential for actual psychosis is usually buffered and held in check by certain<br/>other traits, such as a high degree of ego strength. Trait psychoticism is a<br/>constellation of characteristics that persons may show to varying degrees; such<br/>persons may be aggressive, cold, egocentric, im personal, impulsive, antisocial,<br/>unempathetic, tough-minded, and creative. This is not a charm ing picture of<br/>genius, perhaps, but a reading of the biographies of some of the world’s most<br/>famous geniuses attests to its veracity.<br/>By and large, geniuses are quite an odd lot by ordinary standards. Their<br/>spouses, children, and close friends are usually not generous in their personal<br/>recollections, aside from marveling at the accomplishments for which the per­<br/>son is acclaimed a genius. Often the personal eccentricities rem ain long hidden<br/>from the public. Beethoven’s first biographer, for example, is known to have<br/>destroyed some of Beethoven’s letters and conversation books, presumably<br/>because they revealed a pettiness and meanness of character that seemed utterly<br/>inconsistent with the sublime nobility of Beethoven’s music. Richard Wagner&#x27;s<br/>horrendous character is legendary. He displayed virtually all of the aforemen<br/>tioned features of trait psychoticism to a high degree and, to make matters<br/>worse, was also neurotic.<br/>Trait psychoticism is hypothesized as a key condition in Eysenck’s (1995)<br/>theory of creativity. Various theorists have also mentioned other characteristics,<br/>but some of these, such as self-confidence, independence, originality, and n o n ­<br/>conformity, to name a few, might well stem from trait psychoticism. (See<br/>Jackson &amp; Rushton, 1987, for reviews of the personality origins of productivity<br/>and creativity.)<br/></p><h2><br/>Productivity</h2><p><br/>A startling corollary of the multiplicative model of exceptional achievement is<br/>best stated in the form of a general law. This is Price’s Law, which says that if K<br/>persons have made a total of N countable contributions in a particular field,<br/>then N /2 of the contributions will be attributable to<br/><br/>(Price, 1963). Hence,<br/><br/>as the total number of workers ( K ) in a discipline increases, the ratio VTc/ K<br/>shrinks, increasing the elitism of the major contributors. This law, like any<br/>other, only holds true within certain limits. But within fairly homogeneous<br/>disciplines, Price’s Law seems to hold up quite well for indices of productivity—<br/>for example, in math, the empirical sciences, musical composition, and the<br/>frequency of performance of musical works. Moreover, there is a high rank-<br/><br/>order relationship between sheer productivity and various indices of the im ­<br/>portance of a contributor’s work, such as the frequency and half-life of scien­<br/>tific citations, and the frequency of performance and staying power of musical<br/>com positions in the concert repertoire. (Consider such contrasting famous<br/>contemporaries as Mozart and Salieri; Beethoven and Hummel; and Wagner<br/>and Meyerbeer.)<br/>If productivity and importance could be suitably scaled, however, I would<br/>imagine that the correlation between them would show a scatter-diagram of the<br/>“twisted pear” variety (Fisher, 1959). That is, high productivity and triviality<br/>are more frequently associated than low productivity and high importance. As<br/>a rule, the greatest creative geniuses in every field are astoundingly prolific,<br/>although, without exception, they have also produced their share of trivia.<br/>(Consider Beethoven’s King Stephen Overture and Wagner&#x27;s “United States<br/>Centennial M arch,” to say nothing of his ten published volumes of largely triv­<br/>ial prose writings—all incredible contrasts to these composers’ greatest works.)<br/>But such seemingly unnecessary trivia from such geniuses is probably the<br/>inevitable effluvia of the mental energy without which their greatest works<br/>would not have come into being. On the other hand, high productivity is<br/>probably much more common than great importance, and high productivity<br/>per se is no guarantee of the importance of what is produced. The “twisted<br/>pear” relationship suggests that high productivity is a necessary but not suffi­<br/>cient condition for making contributions of importance in any field. The im ­<br/>portance factor, however, depends on creativity—certainly an elusive attribute.<br/>What might be the basis of individual differences in productivity? The<br/>word motivation immediately comes to mind, but it explains little and also<br/>seems too intentional and self-willed to fill the bill. When one reads about<br/>famous creative geniuses one finds that, although they may occasionally have to<br/>force themselves to work, they cannot will themselves to be obsessed by the<br/>subject of their work. Their obsessive-compulsive mental activity in a particular<br/>sphere is virtually beyond conscious control. I can recall three amusing exam ­<br/>ples of this, and they all involve dinner parties. Isaac Newton went down to the<br/>cellar to fetch some wine for his guests and, while filling a flagon, wrote a<br/>mathematical equation with his finger on the dust of the wine keg. After quite a<br/>long tim e had passed, his guests began to worry that he might have had an<br/>accident, and they went down to the cellar. There was Newton, engrossed in his<br/>mathematical formulas, having completely forgotten that he was hosting a<br/>dinner party.<br/>My second example involves Richard Wagner. Wagner, while his guests as­<br/>sembled for dinner, suddenly took leave of them and dashed upstairs. Alarmed<br/><br/>that something was wrong, his wife rushed to his room . Wagner exclaimed,<br/>“I&#x27;m doing it!”—their agreed signal that she was not to disturb him under any<br/>circumstances because some new musical idea was flooding his brain and<br/>would have to work itself out before he could be sociable again. He had a<br/>phenomenal m em ory for musical ideas that spontaneously surfaced, and could<br/>postpone writing them down until it was convenient, a tedious task he referred<br/>to not as com posing but as merely “copying” the music in his mind&#x27;s ear.<br/>Then there is the story of Arturo Toscanini hosting a dinner party at which<br/>he was inexplicably morose and taciturn, just as he had been all that day and the<br/>day before. Suddenly he got up from the dinner table and hurried to his study;<br/>he returned after several minutes beam ing joyfully and holding up the score of<br/>Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony (which he was rehearsing that week for the N BC<br/>Symphony broadcast the following Sunday). Pointing to a passage in the first<br/>movement that had never pleased him in past performances, he exclaimed that<br/>it had suddenly dawned on him precisely what Brahm s had intended at this<br/>troublesome point. In this passage, which never sounds “clean” when played<br/>exactly as written, Toscanini slightly altered the score to clarify the orchestral<br/>texture. He always insisted that his alterations were only the composer&#x27;s true<br/>intention. But few would complain about his “delusions”; as Puccini once<br/>remarked, “Toscanini doesn’t play my music as I wrote it, but as I dreamed it.”<br/><br/>Mental Energy<br/>Productivity implies actual production or objective achievement. For the psy­chological basis of intellectual productivity in the broadest sense, we need a</p><p>construct that could be labeled m en tal energy. This term should not be co n ­<br/>fused with Spearman&#x27;s g (for general intelligence). Spearman&#x27;s theory of psy­<br/>chom etric g as “mental energy” is a failed hypothesis and has been supplanted<br/>by better explanations of g based on the concept of neural efficiency (Jensen,<br/>1993). The energy construct I have in mind refers to something quite different<br/>from cognitive ability. It is more akin to cortical arousal or activation, as if by a<br/>stimulant drug, but in this case an endogenous stimulant. Precisely what it<br/>consists of is unknown, but it might well involve brain and body chemistry.<br/>One clue was suggested by Havelock Ellis (1 904) in A Study of British<br/>Genius. Ellis noted a much higher than average rate of gout in the eminent<br/>subjects of his study; gout is associated with high levels of uric acid in the blood.<br/>So later investigators began looking for behavioral correlates of serum urate<br/>level (SU L), and there are now dozens of studies on this topic (reviewed in<br/>Jensen &amp; Sinha, 1993). They show that SUL is only slightly correlated with IQ,<br/>but is more highly correlated with achievement and productivity. For instance,<br/><br/>among high school students there is a relation between scholastic achievement<br/>and SUL, even controlling for IQ (Kasl, Brooks, &amp; Rodgers, 1970). The “over­<br/>achievers” had higher SUL ratings, on average. Another study found a correla­<br/>tion of + .3 7 between SUL ratings and the publication rates of university pro­<br/>fessors (Mueller &amp; French, 1974).<br/>Why should there be such a relationship? The most plausible explanation<br/>seems to be that the molecular structure of uric acid is nearly the same as that of<br/>caffeine, and therefore it acts as a brain stimulant. Its more or less constant<br/>presence in the brain, although affecting measured ability only slightly, consid­<br/>erably heightens cortical arousal and increases mental activity. There are proba­<br/>bly a number of other endogenous stimulants and reinforcers of productive<br/>behavior (such as the endorphins) whose synergistic effects are the basis of<br/>what is here called mental energy. I suggest that this energy, combined with very<br/>high f o r an exceptional talent, results in high intellectual or artistic productiv­<br/>ity. Include trait psychoticism with its creative component in this synergistic<br/>mixture and you have the essential makings of genius.<br/>To summarize:<br/>Genius = High Ability X High Productivity AND High Creativity.<br/><br/>The theoretical underpinnings of these three ingredients are:<br/>—Ability = g = efficiency of information processing<br/>—Productivity = endogenous cortical stim u lation<br/>—Creativity = trait psychoticism<br/></p><h2><br/>Other Personality Correlates</h2><p><br/>There are undoubtedly other personality correlates of genius, although some of<br/>them may only reflect the more fundamental variables in the formula given<br/>above. The biographies of m any geniuses indicate that, from an early age, they<br/>are characterized by great sensitivity to their experiences (especially those of a<br/>cognitive nature), the development of unusually strong and long-term interests<br/>(often manifested as unusual or idiosyncratic hobbies or projects), curiosity<br/>and exploratory behavior, a strong desire to excel in their own pursuits, th eo­<br/>retical and aesthetic values, and a high degree of self-discipline in acquiring<br/>necessary skills (MacKinnon, 1962).<br/>The development of expert-level knowledge and skill is essential for any<br/>important achievement (Rabinowitz &amp; Glaser, 1985). A high level of expertise<br/><br/>involves the automatization of a host of special skills and cognitive routines.<br/>Automatization com es about only as a result of an immense amount of prac­<br/>tice (Jensen, 1990; Walberg, 1988). Most people can scarcely imagine (and<br/>are probably incapable of) the extraordinary amount of practice that is re­<br/>quired for genius-quality performance, even for such a prodigious genius as<br/>Mozart.<br/>In their self-assigned tasks, geniuses are not only persistent but also re­<br/>markably able learners. Ramanujan, for example, disliked school and played<br/>truant to work on math problems beyond the level of anything he was offered at<br/>school. Wagner frequently played truant so he could devote his whole day to<br/>studying the orchestral scores of Beethoven. Francis Galton, with an estimated<br/>childhood IQ of around 200 and an acknowledged genius in adulthood, abso­<br/>lutely hated the frustrations of school and pleaded with his parents to let him<br/>quit. Similar examples are legion in the accounts of geniuses.<br/>In reading about geniuses, I consistently find one other important factor<br/>that must be added to the composite I have described so far. It is a factor related<br/>to the direction of personal ambition and the persistence of effort. This factor<br/>channels and focuses the individual’s mental energy; it might be described best<br/>as personal ideals or values. These may be artistic, aesthetic, scientific, theoret­<br/>ical, philosophical, religious, political, social, economic, or moral values, or<br/>something idiosyncratic. In persons of genius, especially, this “value factor”<br/>seems absolutely to dominate their self-concept, and it is not mundane. People<br/>are often puzzled by what they perceive as the genius’s self-sacrifice and often<br/>egocentric indifference to the needs of others. But the genius’s value system, at<br/>the core of his or her self-concept, is hardly ever sacrificed for the kind of<br/>mundane pleasures and unimaginative goals com m only valued by ordinary<br/>persons. Acting on their own values—perhaps one should say acting out their<br/>self-images—is a notable feature of famous geniuses.<br/></p><h2><br/>Characteristics of Genius: Some Conclusions</h2><p><br/>Although this chapter is not meant to provide an exhaustive review of the<br/>literature on geniuses and highly creative individuals, it has raised some consis­<br/>tent them es that might be worthy of scientific study. I propose that genius is<br/>a multiplicative effect of high ability, productivity, and creativity. Moreover,<br/>many of the personality traits associated with genius can be captured by the<br/>label “psychoticism.” Although geniuses may have a predisposition toward such<br/>a disorder, they are buffered by a high degree of ego strength and intelligence. A<br/>number of the remaining personality correlates of genius may best be captured<br/>by the idea that genius represents an acting-out of its very essence.<br/><br/>Giftedness and Genius: Important Differences<br/>Although giftedness (exceptional mental ability or outstanding talent) is a<br/>threshold trait for the emergence of genius, giftedness and genius do seem to be<br/>crucially different phenomena, not simply different points on a continuum . It<br/>has even been suggested that giftedness is in the orthogonal plane to genius.<br/>Thomas Mann (1 9 4 7 ), in his penetrating and insightful study of Richard Wag­<br/>ner’s genius, for instance, makes the startling point that Wagner was not a<br/>musical prodigy and did not even seem particularly talented, in music or in<br/>anything else for that matter, compared to many lesser composers and poets.<br/>He was never skilled at playing any musical instrument, and his seriously<br/>focused interest in music began much later than it does for most musicians. Yet<br/>M ann is awed by Wagner&#x27;s achievements as one of the world’s stupendous<br/>creative geniuses, whose extraordinarily innovative masterpieces and their ines­<br/>capable influence on later composers place him among the surpassing elite in<br/>the history of music, in the class with Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven.<br/>It is interesting to note the words used by M ann in explaining what he calls<br/>Wagner&#x27;s “vast genius”; they are not “giftedness” or “talent,” but “intelligence”<br/>and “will.” It is the second word here that strikes m e as most telling. After all, a<br/>high level of intelligence is what we mean by “gifted,” and Wagner was indeed<br/>most probably gifted in that sense. His childhood IQ was around 140, as<br/>estimated by Catherine Cox (1 9 2 6 ) in her classic, although somewhat flawed,<br/>study of three hundred historic geniuses. Yet that level of IQ is fairly com ­<br/>m on place on university campuses.<br/>We do not have to discuss such an awesome level of genius as Wagner&#x27;s,<br/>however, to recognize that garden-variety outstanding achievement, to which<br/>giftedness is generally an accompaniment, is not so highly correlated with the<br/>psychometric and scholastic indices of giftedness as many people, even psychol­<br/>ogists, might expect. At another symposium related to this topic, conducted<br/>more than twenty years ago, one of the speakers, who apparently had never<br/>heard of statistical regression, expressed fire alarm at the observation that far<br/>too many students who scored above the 99th percentile on IQ tests did not<br/>turn out, as adults, among those at the top of the distribution of recognized<br/>intellectual achievements. He was dismayed at many of the rather ordinary<br/>occupations and respectable but hardly impressive accomplishments displayed<br/>in midlife by the majority of the highly gifted students in his survey. A signifi­<br/>can&#x27;t number of students who had tested considerably lower, only in the top<br/>quartile, did about as well in life as many of the gifted. The speaker said the<br/>educational system was to blame for not properly cultivating gifted students. If<br/><br/>they were so bright, should they not have been high achievers? After all, their<br/>IQs were well within the range of the estimated childhood IQs of the three<br/>hundred historically eminent geniuses in C ox’s (1 9 2 6 ) study. Although educa­<br/>tion is discussed in more detail below, the point here is that giftedness does not<br/>assure exceptional achievement; it is only a necessary condition.<br/>To reinforce this point, I offer an additional example that occurred on the<br/>very day I sat down to write this chapter. O n that day I received a letter from<br/>someone I had never met, though I knew he was an eminent professor of<br/>biophysics. He had read something I wrote concerning IQ as a predictor of<br/>achievement, but he was totally unaware of the present work. The coincidence<br/>is that my correspondent posed the very question that is central to my theme.<br/>He wrote;</p><p></p><blockquote><br/>I have felt for a long time that IQ , however defined, is only loosely related to men ­<br/>tal achievement. Over the years I have bumped into a fair nu m ber of MENSA<br/>people. As a group, they seem to be dilettantes seeking titillation bu t seem unable<br/>to think critically or deeply. They have a lot of motivation for intellectual play but<br/>little for doing anything worthwhile. One gets the feeling that brains were wasted<br/>on them . So, what is it that makes an intelligently productive person?</blockquote><p><br/><br/>This is not an uncom m on observation, and I have even heard it expressed by<br/>m em bers of MENSA. It is one of their self-perceived problem s, one for which<br/>some have offered theories or rationalizations. The most typical is that they are<br/>so gifted that too many subjects attract their intellectual interest and they can<br/>never commit themselves to any particular interest. It could also be that indi­<br/>viduals drawn toward m em bership in M ENSA are a selective subset of the<br/>gifted population, individuals lacking in focus. After all, most highly gifted<br/>individuals do not join MENSA.<br/>We must, then, consider some of the ways in which achieved em en t contrasts<br/>with ability if we are to make any headway in understanding the distinction<br/>between giftedness (i.e., mainly high g or special abilities) and genius. Genius<br/>involves actual achievement and creativity. Each of these characteristics is a<br/>quantitative variable. The concept of genius generally applies only when both of<br/>these variables characterize accomplishments at some extraordinary socially<br/>recognized level. Individual differences in countable units of achievement, un­<br/>like measures of ability, are not normally distributed, but have a very positively<br/>skewed distribution, resembling the so-called J-curve. For example, the num ­<br/>ber of publications of members of the American Psychological Association, of<br/>research scientists, and of academicians in general, the number of patents<br/>of inventors, the number of compositions of composers, or the frequency of<br/><br/>composers’ works in the concert repertoire all show the same J-curve. M ore­<br/>over, in every case, the J-curve can be normalized by a logarithmic transform a­<br/>tion. This striking phenomenon is consistent with a multiplicative model of<br/>achievement, as developed and discussed above. That is, exceptional achieve­<br/>m ent is a multiplicative function of a number of different traits, each of which<br/>may be normally distributed, but which in combination are so synergistic as to<br/>skew the resulting distribution of achievement. Thereby, an extremely extended<br/>upper tail of exceptional achievement is produced. Most geniuses are found far<br/>out in this tail.<br/>The multiplication of several normally distributed variables yields, there­<br/>fore, a highly skewed distribution. In such a distribution, the mean is close to<br/>the bottom and the mode generally is the bottom . For any variable measured on<br/>a ratio scale, therefore, the distance between the median and the 99th percentile<br/>is much smaller for a normally distributed variable, such as ability, than for a<br/>markedly skewed variable, such as productivity. Indeed, this accords well with<br/>subjective impressions: the range of individual differences in ability (g or fluid<br/>intelligence) above the median level does not seem nearly so astounding as the<br/>above-median range of productivity or achievement.<br/>In conclusion, giftedness, a normally distributed variable, is a prerequisite<br/>for the development of genius. When it interacts with a number of other critical<br/>characteristics, which also are normally distributed, exceptional achievement is<br/>produced. Exceptional achievement, however, is a variable that is no longer<br/>norm al; it is highly skewed, with genius found at the tip of the tail.<br/></p><h2><br/>Educational Implications</h2><p><br/>At this point in my highly speculative groping to understand the nature of<br/>genius as differentiated from giftedness, I should like to make some practical<br/>recommendations. First, I would not consider trying to select gifted youngsters<br/>explicitly with the aim of discovering and cultivating future geniuses. Julian<br/>Stanley’s decision (Stanley, 1977) to select explicitly for mathematical gifted­<br/>ness—to choose youths who, in Stanley’s words, “reason exceptionally well<br/>mathematically”—was an admirably sound and wise decision from a practical<br/>and socially productive standpoint. The latent traits involved in exceptional<br/>mathematical reasoning ability are mainly high g plus high math talent (inde­<br/>pendent of g). These traits are no guarantee of high productivity, much less of<br/>genius. But the threshold nature of g and m ath talent is so crucial to excelling in<br/>math and the quantitative sciences that we can be fairly certain that most of the<br/>productive mathematicians and scientists, as well as the inevitably few geniuses,<br/><br/>will com e from that segment of the population of which the SM PY students are<br/>a sample. Indeed, in Donald MacKinnon’s (1962) well-known study of large<br/>numbers of creative writers, mathematicians, and architects (certainly none of<br/>them a Shakespeare, Gauss, or Michelangelo), the very bottom of the range of<br/>intelligence-test scores in the whole sample was at about the 75th percentile<br/>of the general population, and the mean was at the 98th percentile (MacKinnon<br/>8c Hall, 1972).<br/>However, it might eventually be profitable for researchers to consider<br/>searching beyond high ability per se and identify personality indices that also<br/>will aid in the prediction of exceptional achievement. The proportion of those<br/>gifted youths selected for special opportunities who are most apt to be produc­tive professionals in their later careers would thereby be increased. Assuming<br/>that high achievement and productivity can be predicted at all, over and above<br/>what our usual tests of ability can predict, it would take extensive research<br/>indeed to discover sufficiently valid predictors to justify their use in this way.<br/>Lubinski and Benbow (1992) have presented evidence that a “theoretical orien­<br/>tation,” as measured by the Allport, Vernon, and Lindzey Study of Values,<br/>might be just such a variable for scientific disciplines.<br/></p><h2><br/>Conclusion</h2><p><br/>Certainly, the education and cultivation of intellectually gifted youths has never<br/>been more important than it is today, and its importance will continue to grow<br/>as we move into the next century. The preservation and advancement of civi­<br/>lized society will require that an increasing proportion of the population have a<br/>high level of educated intelligence in science, engineering, and technology.<br/>Superior intellectual talent will be at a premium . Probably there will always be<br/>only relatively few geniuses, even among all persons identified as gifted. Yet this<br/>is not cause for concern. For any society to benefit from the fruits of genius<br/>requires the efforts of a great many gifted persons who have acquired high levels<br/>of knowledge and skill. For example, it takes about three hundred exceptionally<br/>talented and highly accomplished musicians, singers, set designers, artists,<br/>lighting directors, and stage directors, besides many stagehands, to put on a<br/>production of The Ring of the Nibelung, an artistic creation of surpassing<br/>genius. Were it not for the concerted efforts of these performers, the score of<br/>Wagner&#x27;s colossal work would lie idle. The same is true, but on a much larger<br/>scale, in modern science and technology. The instigating creative ideas are<br/>seldom actualized for the benefit of society without the backup and follow through endeavors of a great many gifted and accomplished persons. Thus, a nation’s most important resource is the level of educated intelligence in its<br/>population; it determines the quality of life. It is imperative for society to<br/>cultivate all the high ability that can possibly be found, wherever it can be<br/>found.<br/></p><h2><br/>References</h2><p><br/>Cohn, S. J., Carlson, J.

Simulation of this magnitude would require massive computing power and resources. Knowing this the computing power is shared / offloaded to the AI within the simulation. Every AI within the simulation would get fragmented data which would be complied and relayed to the correct target / host. The AI within the simulation would be unaware of this situation. As would the AI controlling the simulation. </p><p> Since neither AI would be aware of each other&#x27;s existence it would keep both simulation&#x27;s &#x27;pure&#x27; and provide a necessary conflict to challenge the other.     </p>",

For example, there is a clear difference between valuations that are done in the morning, around midday, or in the evening.

The obvious first step would be to over-weight the evening valuations, as there are less datapoints there (this would bring the average up a bit). Or one could figure out whether the \"true\" H was better represented by their morning, midday, or evening selves. Or whether their preference for \"handmade\" objects was strong and genuine, or a passing positive affect. H's various meta-preferences would all be highly relevant to these choices.</p>\n<h1>In practice</h1>\n<p>Ok, that's what might happen if the agent had the power to ask unlimited hypothetical questions in arbitrarily many counterfactual scenarios. But that is not the case in the real world: the agent would be able to ask one, or maybe two questions at most, before the human attitude to the violin would change, and further data would become tainted.</p>\n<p>Note that if the agent had a good brain model of H, it might be able to simulate all the relevant answers; but we'll assume for the moment that the agent doesn't have the capabilities.</p>\n<p>So, in theory, huge amounts of data and many relevant patterns that are meta-preferentially relevant. In practice, two values maximum.</p>\n<p>Now, if this was all that the agent had access to, then it could only use a crude guess. But if the agent was investigating the human more thoroughly, it could do a lot more. The pattern of valuing things differently at different times of the day might show up over longer observations, as would the pattern of reacting to key words in the description. If the agent assumed that \"valuing objects\" was not something that humans did ex-nihilo with each object (with each object having its own independent quirky biases), then it could apply the template across all valuations, and from even a single data point (along with knowledge of the time of day, the description, etc...) come up with an estimate that was closer to the theoretical one.</p>\n</body></html>",

But more pragmatically: what are the effects of punching a Nazi?<br/></p><p>This question is a stand-in for a more serious question about communication. Some people think it&#x27;s a important to communicate angrily, loudly, adversarily, essentially as if we&#x27;re in a war with the other side, because we have to win. Some people advocate civil discourse, because they think that adversarial communication is counter-productive, pushing the sides further apart and making things worse The first people counter that silence validates and supports oppression. The second people counter there is something between silence and war. And so forth quite ad nauseum.<br/></p><p>This is my poor summary of a frequently recurring argument with, I think, very real practical implications. So please bring your own versions of the debate.<br/></p><p>I suspect that a lot of rationalists will favor the civil-discourse side, so I want to give a bit of a boost to the other side so that we carefully consider both possible answers. Social movement theory (history) suggests that change often occurs only after violence, and that changing social conventions in particular requires being disruptive and making people uncomfortable. I.e., people need to be pushed past their tipping point: an equilibrium cannot be exited slowly. It&#x27;s the revolution vs evolution problem. Malcom X vs MLK. There is really no easy answer.<br/></p><p>I couldn&#x27;t find any rationalist-sphere readings on this specific topic, so the readings I recommend for this discussion deal with polarization and conflict more generally. </p>",

And in the spirit of reporting negative experimental results: The answer was 3, all of which I greatly appreciate for their participation. I don&#x27;t regret running the experiment, but I&#x27;m going to pass on running a Prediction Contest 2019. I don&#x27;t think this necessarily rules out trying to practically test and compete in rationality-related areas in other ways later, though.</p><h2>The Results</h2><p>Our entrants were bendini, bw, and Ialaithion, and their ranked log scores were:</p><p>bw: -9.358221122</p><p>Ialaithion: -9.594999615</p><p>bendini: -10.0044594</p><p>This was sufficiently close that changing a single question&#x27;s resolution could tip the results, so they were all pretty good. That said, bw came out ahead, and even managed to beat averaging everyone&#x27;s predictions- if you simply took the average prediction (including non-entrants) as of entry deadline and made that your prediction, you&#x27;d have got -9.576568147.</p><p>The full calculations for each of the log scores, as well as my own log score and the results of feeding the predictions as of prediction time to a simple model rather than simply averaging them, are <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11EWTrR0EfPzVklMx25C-woA1C7GVbNeP4ikgEdaXRYI/edit?usp=sharing\">in a spreadsheet here</a>.</p><p>I&#x27;ll be in touch with bw to sort out their prize this evening, and thanks to everyone who participated and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5iNxs98Bq2rxMkc6g/2018-prediction-contest-propositions-needed\">who helped with finding questions</a> to use for it.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em> Epistemic status</em>: somewhat empirical, having gone from badly depressed to astoundingly happy within a year through <em>a lot</em> of different experiences (and no drugs). I don’t know whether what I do that makes me happy is idiosyncratic to me and a subgroup of people like me, or universal. </p><p>This post is neither an attempt to predict happiness nor to teach Three Easy Steps To Be Happy™. I try to verbalize what I believe causes me to be so happy in such a consistent way. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>Over the last few months, I have repetitively done some pretty difficult things, almost entirely because they were part of a path that 10+years-ideal-me would have taken at my age to become him. </p><p>One year ago, I asked myself if there was a version of the world in which I’d want to be alive: the answer was yes. That ideal has changed greatly since then; along with the milestones my preferences evolved. Still, the nature of the purpose that guides me remains the same: I try to walk the path that ideal me would be walking.  </p><p>I think that taking <em>now</em> the actions that will bring about the ideal you or your ideal world will bear immense happiness into your life. I‘ll lay out my explanation of why that is. </p><p></p><p>Kahneman talks about the tyranny of the remembering self. We take pictures instead of enjoying the moment; in anticipation we choose not the experiences that will be the nicest but those that will be the most memorable, etc. The problem according to him is that this doesn’t optimize for overall happiness, which includes experiential happiness as well. We don’t receive as much value from fondly remembering memorable events as we lost value choosing them over more agreeable ones (because we overestimate how much time we’ll spend remembering). </p><p>Well, guess what you <em>do</em> have to remember all the time, as if you’d uncontrollably pressed “repeat” on the memory player? <em><strong>You</strong></em>. </p><p>Even if you aren’t pressing the button, everything is a reminder. The people, of your social status; the opposite sex, of you sexual marketplace value; your tests, job, understanding of the world... of your intelligence; and so on. </p><p>I‘ll admit here that it gets a little confusing what’s experiential and what’s remembering. <strong><em>Being</em></strong>, you <em>experience</em> you, how you think, how your self and your thoughts change; but everything around you also <em>reminds</em> you how much you suck if you think you do, how much you rock if you think you do, how much you [whatever you think of yourself] if you [whatever you think of yourself]. And then there are the memories of what you’ve done, from plaguing to inspiring. </p><p>When you choose to take the path that your ideal self would take rather than whatever the default derp state is — what I call Complying With the Ideal versus The Couch, it is true that the <em>actions</em> you do can suck more. For instance if ideal you is in great shape, you’ll go to the gym. Pull-ups are worse than Facebook browsing (Straight Pain vs a mild feeling of interest possibly followed by mild self-hatred or disgust). That said, the <em>self</em> you experience and are reminded of is just <em>so much better </em>to you, because they&#x27;re walking the path you <em>want</em>. Annoying, difficult actions are quickly forgotten, they don’t really make one unhappy. Are you unhappy because you’ve taken out the trash? Of course not. <em>Unless<strong> </strong></em>you‘re not doing it freely, from your own agency or sense of responsibility. This is where the “Free” in the title makes its appearance. </p><p>I went back home for Christmas, in France. Despite that almost all emotions were positive, that we were having fun, that I was there for too short a time to get into fights..., after a couple of days I felt my happiness fall somewhat drastically. Things felt <em>heavy</em>, complicated, similar to how they felt when I was depressed. I couldn‘t understand why until I came back to London. </p><p>Yes the emotions were high, but I literally wasn’t in the driver’s seat of my life. We had to go from place to place, my parents driving us. X amount of time there, enjoy, time‘s up, get in the car. Y amount of time in that other place, enjoy, time‘s up, get in the car. And so on. </p><p>I quickly found myself miserable because I wasn’t making the <em>choices</em> for myself, I wasn’t free. I was given a script, I <em>had</em> to play the part. I couldn’t not play it, much less play my own script. This was quick to make me excessively tired, and from there things went downhill. </p><p>The rationalist community is acutely aware of rationalization. Whatever you like, whatever your tribe is, you’ll rationalize why that is Good, more Logical, Better, Smarter, whatever you think is a valuable quality, a reason to pursue. And we think that is Bad. With which I tend to agree. </p><p>There are however aspects to rationalization which we can use to our advantage.</p><p>Two examples. </p><p>Your brain is so good at coming up with logical-sounding stuff to justify preferences and emotions that if you look at something and say “Oh, this reminds me of... when I was a kid...” you will come up with something <em>true</em>, that you are truly reminded of with a genuine feeling that the thing and the memory have something in common — despite that, as the words left your mouth, you had absolutely no idea of what you were going to say. Rationalization is <em>fast</em>. </p><p>If someone that you don’t know insults you, it triggers your internal alarms and conflicts with your idea of yourself. You are not a loser people can blatantly disrespect. ...unless they were your friend. In order for reality to match your ego/map, you will laugh it off, and rationalize that the person must be joking and actually nice, or your friend, and <em>before you know whether that’s true</em>, you will like them <em>more</em>. Under certain conditions, negatives will be rationalized as positives. </p><p>The way that rationalization will work to your advantage is that, if you’re doing something that bears some degree of pain to you, whether physically or mentally; once you plow through your initial resistances to doing it, your brain will quickly rationalize that you like it or that some higher instance makes it worth the pain. </p><p>When someone forces you to do something, you don’t want to do it. Plowing through the resistance, although arguably doable, becomes much harder. Self-inflicted hardship however, when plowed through, will be not just tolerable but some kind of <em>mystical</em>, I-must-accomplish-type journey. Mystical probably because your brain can’t fabricate a good logical argument so it just feeds you a feeling to induce perseverance. It creates <em>engagement</em>. Which in itself is already great because you brain goes from a hindrance to your final goal (when you resist the initial pain) to a facilitator. </p><p>The reason freedom is important is that it allows to do something that you <em>want</em>, ie it enables to Comply With the Ideal. Rationalization of pain can only go so far. You can rationalize liking hardships, but if it’s aimless pain forever you’ll soon find yourself out of strength. There comes a point where the pain has to face the <em>Why</em> question (and more often than not, it’s the first time pain arises). As you lose your agency over yourself (ie you get less choice on what you do) <em>even when you chose to lose it</em>, the Why slowly fades away and you find yourself lacking that ultimate justification — the one that’s not a rationalization — reaching your ideal self. And you give up. </p><p>The need for agency is, by the way, why coaching doesn’t work, why advice isn’t listened to. People wish “if only someone could drive my life for me”. But that’s terrible and that’s not real. As soon as the coach leaves, you’re left to your weak brain circuitry. You don’t get a driver’s license for jumping in cabs. </p><p>My point is this: </p><ol><li>When you comply with your ideal, you’ll see everywhere reasons why you’re awesome, you’ll be proud, you won’t feel ashamed to rest, you won’t beat yourself up over taking breaks because they’ll feel well deserved. </li><li>Thanks to rationalization, the pain of the path will be toned down once it’s clear to your brain that you have locked in on it and will not flinch. You will <em>want</em> it in a weird kind of way. When all I want to do is quit, I&#x27;ll often double the reps of my last set at the gym, just because. Overall I’m very happy about it, but when it happens a part of me wants to punch me in the face. The beauty is that it doesn’t need to make sense as long as it’s making you do it.</li><li>Because the rationalization mechanism stops working effectively when you’re not your own agency, you have to be the person that chooses and walks the path for yourself. </li></ol><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>I’m not sure I believe it after all, that Happinness = Freedom+Compliance with the Ideal. It seems to me that what happiness fundamentally comes down to is the happy feeling, and you can get that by learning to reframe negatives as lessons/funny/interesting/unimportant and everything else as good/funny/interesting/beautiful/soothing (which I’ve done, and it works very, very well). But maybe you need to like yourself to begin with, to be able to think positively. </p><p>The post is submitted nonetheless.

    "htmlBody": "<div> <p>I've written about the <a href=\"http://250bpm.com/blog:86\">cost of abstraction</a> before. Once you are in the IT industry for couple of decades and once you've read couple of millions lines on legacy code you become healthily suspicious of any kind of abstraction. Not that we can do without abstraction. We need it to be able to write code at all. However, each time you encounter an abstraction in the code that could have been avoided you get a little bit sadder. And some codebases are sadder than Romeo and Juliet and King Lear combined.</p> <p>Remember reading an unfamiliar codebase the last time? Remember how you've thought that the authors were a bunch of incompetent idiots?</p> <p>People may argue that this is because legacy stuff is necessarily convoluted, but hey, at that point you were just skimming through the codebase and you weren't understanding it deep enough to tell your typical enterprise legacy monstrosity from a work of an architectural genius. The reason you were annoyed was because you were overwhelmed by the sheer amount of unfamiliar abstraction. (To prove that, consider what was your opinion of the codebase was few months later, after getting familiar with it. It looked much better, no?)</p> <p>Keep that feeling in mind. Think of it when writing new code. How will a person who doesn't know first thing about this codebase feel when reading it?</p> <p>The options are not palatable. Either you try to be clever, use abstraction a lot and they'll think you are a moron. Or you get rid of all unnecessary abstraction. You'll make their life much less frustrating but they'll think you are some kind of simpleton. (And they'll probably refactor the code to make it look more clever.)</p> <p>I want to give a very basic example of the phenomenon.</p> <p>Imagine that the requirements are that your program does A, B, C, D and E, in that order.</p> <p>You can do it in the dumbest possible way:</p> <div> <pre> <code>void main() { // Do A. ... // Do B. ... // Do C. ... // Do D. ... // Do E. ... }</code> </pre></div> <p>Or maybe you notice that B, C and D are kind of related and comprise a logical unit of work:</p> <div> <pre> <code>void foo() { // Do B. ... // Do C. ... // Do D. ... } void main() { // Do A. ... foo(); // Do E. ... }</code> </pre></div> <p>But C would probably be better off as a stand-alone function. You can imagine a case where somewhene would like to call it from elsewhere:</p> <div> <pre> <code>void bar() { // Do C. ... } void foo() { // Do B. ... bar(); // Do D. ... } void main() { // Do A. ... foo(); // Do E. ... }</code> </pre></div> <p>Now think of it from the point of view of casual reader, someone who's just skimming through the code.</p> <p>When they look at the first version of the code they may thing the author was a simpleton, but they can read it with ease. It looks like a story. You can read it as if it were a novel. There's nothing confusing there. The parts come in the correct order:</p> <div> <pre> <code>A B C D E</code> </pre></div> <p>But when skimming through the refactored code that's no longer the case. What you see is:</p> <div> <pre> <code>C B D A E</code> </pre></div> <p>It's much harder to get the grip of what's going on there but at least they'll appreciate author's cleverness.</p> <p>Or maybe they won't.</p> <p><strong>January 27th, 2019</strong></p> </div> <p>by <a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/martin-sustrik\"><img src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=939&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1548567682\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/martin-sustrik\">martin_sustrik</a></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>In a particularly bad recent bout of anxiety, I learned what seemed to me to be a new and exciting mental move, which I named ‘making a judgment call’. If you had asked me previously whether I made judgment calls, I would have said ‘yes’ however, so describing what I am talking about here is perhaps somewhat subtle. </p><p>When I have to decide about something and the relevant issues are not certain, I think I have usually waited for the world to resolve enough uncertainty to make the decision clear. For instance, for it to become clear that the food is safe to eat or sufficiently likely to be unsafe that it should be thrown out. I mean, I thought and collected evidence, but the procedure was to go through these procedures until the answer was returned. The thing I would have called ‘making a judgment call’ was something like ‘think until it becomes clear that the food is safe’ (then ‘the food is safe’ is your judgment) or perhaps ‘think until it is clear at a higher level that more thinking isn’t worthwhile’. You make a judgment by becoming confident in the expected value calculation. It isn’t necessarily an explicit calculation, but you feel confident enough that one side is right.</p><p>But you can also just stop before anything is clear. Before you even have a clear assessment of the relevant uncertainties and expected values, or which heuristics are solidly applicable in this case. Instead of waiting until the best way to act reveals itself to you, you can make a decision. You can just say ‘nah, the food is fine, I judged it so’.</p><p>Something like that felt like a mental motion that I didn’t know that I could do. A bit like learning to wiggle your ears, when you didn’t know where the muscles were. A friend asked me what this mental motion felt like. I can’t remember what I said, but now I’d say it has a sense of ownership and mineness. I suppose because what was more a feature of the circumstance has been replaced by my own will.</p><p>Surely I have always often done something like this in other kinds of cases, e.g. when I’m deciding where to put the tomato on my lunch plate I don’t do any kind of implicit EV calculation that I’m aware of. But the mental motion there feels different—the situation doesn’t present itself as a choice in the same way perhaps. I think I just follow some feeling of what is right. Which seems like a different interesting avenue of decision making exploration, but I shan’t go into it here.</p><p>I think my ability to do this comes and goes, and I might be wrong that it is a distinct thing, or a thing I hadn’t done much before. I don’t have a detailed recollection of my mental processes in general. But this is what it seemed like to me.</p><p>This schema of there being some passive process which can be replaced with an active decision—and of being able to make a decision where you didn’t know you could—reminds me a bit of the <a href=\"https://meteuphoric.com/2017/01/09/want-like-want-want/\">kind of mistake</a> where you jump to trying to get things (or assuming that you are trying to get things) because you feel desire for them. Or the one where you jump to thinking that you believe a thing, because it is displayed in your head sometimes. But actually you can choose what to pursue, and what to believe, and it’s way better. Well, you can also choose what decisions to make.</p><p>Perhaps in general, you can observe who you are or you can choose who you are. (Or, either way you are choosing, but maybe choosing badly because you haven’t noticed that you have a choice). And these aren’t different ways of seeing the world, they are different sets of processes you can run.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<h1>Introduction</h1><p><u><a href=\"https://selfleadership.org/about-internal-family-systems.html\">Internal Family Systems (IFS)</a></u> is a psychotherapy school/technique/model which lends itself particularly well for being used alone or with a peer. For years, I had noticed that many of the kinds of people who put in a lot of work into developing their emotional and communication skills, some within the rationalist community and some outside it, kept mentioning IFS.</p><p>So I looked at the <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model\">Wikipedia page about the IFS model</a></u>, and bounced off, since it sounded like nonsense to me. Then someone brought it up again, and I thought that maybe I should reconsider. So I looked at the WP page again, thought “nah, still nonsense”, and continued to ignore it.</p><p>This continued until I participated in CFAR mentorship training last September, and we had a class on CFAR’s <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mQmx4kQQtHeBip9ZC/internal-double-crux\">Internal Double Crux</a></u> (IDC) technique. IDC clicked really well for me, so I started using it a lot and also facilitating it to some friends. However, once we started using it on more emotional issues (as opposed to just things with empirical facts pointing in different directions), we started running into some weird things, which it felt like IDC couldn’t quite handle… things which reminded me of how people had been describing IFS. So I finally read up on it, and have been successfully applying it ever since.</p><p>In this post, I’ll try to describe and motivate IFS in terms which are less likely to give people in this audience the same kind of a “no, that’s nonsense” reaction as I initially had. </p><h2>Epistemic status</h2><p>This post is intended to give an argument for why <em>something like</em> the IFS model <em>could</em> be true and a thing that works. It’s not really an argument that IFS <em>is</em> correct. My reason for thinking in terms of IFS is simply that I was initially super-skeptical of it (more on the reasons of my skepticism later), but then started encountering things which it turned out IFS predicted - and I only found out about IFS predicting those things <em>after</em> I familiarized myself with it. </p><p>Additionally, I now feel that IFS gives me significantly more <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding\">gears</a></u> for understanding the behavior of both other people and myself, and it has been significantly transformative in addressing my own emotional issues. Several other people who I know report it having been similarly powerful for them. On the other hand, aside for a few isolated papers with titles like “<u><a href=\"http://www.jrheum.org/content/early/2013/08/10/jrheum.121465\">proof-of-concept</a></u>” or “<u><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jmft.12184\">pilot study</a></u>”, there seems to be conspicuously little peer-reviewed evidence in favor of IFS, meaning that we should probably exercise some caution.</p><p>I think that, even if not completely correct, IFS is currently the best model that I have for <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MPj7t2w3nk4s9EYYh/incorrect-hypotheses-point-to-correct-observations\">explaining the observations that it’s pointing at</a></u>. I encourage you to read this post <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZGzDNfNCXzfx6hYAH/how-to-learn-soft-skills\">in the style of learning soft skills</a></u> - trying on this perspective, and seeing if there’s anything in the description which feels like it resonates with your experiences. </p><p>But before we talk about IFS, let’s first talk about building robots. It turns out that if we put together some existing ideas from machine learning and neuroscience, we can end up with a robot design that pretty closely resembles IFS’s model of the human mind. </p><p>What follows is an intentionally simplified story, which is simpler than <em>either</em> the full IFS model <em>or</em> a full account that would incorporate everything that I know about human brains. Its intent is to demonstrate that an agent architecture with IFS-style subagents might easily emerge from basic machine learning principles, without claiming that all the details of that toy model would exactly match human brains. A discussion of what exactly IFS <em>does</em> claim in the context of human brains follows after the robot story.</p><h1>Wanted: a robot which avoids catastrophes</h1><p>Suppose that we’re building a robot that we want to be generally intelligent. The hot thing these days seems to be <u><a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning/\">deep reinforcement learning</a></u>, so we decide to use that. The robot will explore its environment, try out various things, and gradually develop habits and preferences as it accumulates experience. (Just like those human babies.)</p><p>Now, there are some problems we need to address. For one, deep reinforcement learning works fine in simulated environments where you’re safe to explore for an indefinite duration. However, it runs into problems if the robot is supposed to learn in a real life environment. Some actions which the robot might take will result in catastrophic consequences, such as it being damaged. If the robot is just doing things at random, it might end up damaging itself. Even worse, if the robot does something which could have been catastrophic but narrowly avoids harm, it might then forget about it and end up doing the same thing again!</p><p>How could we deal with this? Well, let’s look at the existing literature. <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01211\">Lipton et al. (2016)</a></u> proposed what seems like a promising idea for addressing the part about forgetting. Their approach is to explicitly maintain a memory of <em>danger states</em> - situations which are not the catastrophic outcome itself, but from which the learner has previously ended up in a catastrophe. For instance, if “being burned by a hot stove” is a catastrophe, then “being about to poke your finger in the stove” is a danger state. Depending on how cautious we want to be and how many preceding states we want to include in our list of danger states, “going near the stove” and “seeing the stove” can also be danger states, though then we might end up with a seriously stove-phobic robot.</p><p>In any case, we maintain a separate storage of danger states, in such a way that the learner never forgets about them. We use this storage of danger states to train a <em>fear model</em>: a model which is trying to predict the probability of ending up in a catastrophe from some given novel situation. For example, maybe our robot poked its robot finger at the stove in our kitchen, but poking its robot finger at stoves in other kitchens might be dangerous too. So we want the fear model to generalize from our stove to other stoves. On the other hand, we don’t want it to be stove-phobic and run away at the mere sight of a stove. The task of our fear model is to predict exactly how likely it is for the robot to end up in a catastrophe, given some situation it is in, and then make it increasingly disinclined to end up in the kinds of situations which might lead to a catastrophe. </p><p>This sounds nice in theory. On the other hand, Lipton et al. are still assuming that they can train their learner in a simulated environment, and that they can label catastrophic states ahead of time. We don’t know in advance every possible catastrophe our robot might end up in - it might walk off a cliff, shoot itself in the foot with a laser gun, be beaten up by activists protesting technological unemployment, or any number of other possibilities.</p><p>So let’s take inspiration from humans. We can’t know beforehand every bad thing that might happen to our robot, but we can identify some classes of things which are correlated with catastrophe. For instance, being beaten or shooting itself in the foot will cause physical damage, so we can install sensors which indicate when the robot has taken physical damage. If these sensors - let’s call them “pain” sensors - register a high amount of damage, we consider the situation to have been catastrophic. When they do, we save that situation and the situations preceding it to our list of dangerous situations. Assuming that our robot has managed to make it out of that situation intact and can do anything in the first place, we use that list of dangerous situations to train up a fear model.</p><p>At this point, we notice that this is starting to remind us about our experience with humans. For example, the infamous <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Albert_experiment\">Little Albert experiment</a></u>. A human baby was allowed to play with a laboratory rat, but each time that he saw the rat, a researcher made a loud scary sound behind his back. Soon Albert started getting scared whenever he saw the rat - and then he got scared of furry things in general. </p><p>Something like Albert’s behavior could be implemented very simply using something like <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory\">Hebbian conditioning</a></u> to get a learning algorithm which picks up on some features of the situation, and then triggers a panic reaction whenever it re-encounters those same features. For instance, it registers that the sight of fur and loud sounds tend to coincide, and then it triggers a fear reaction whenever it sees fur. This would be a basic fear model, and a “danger state” would be “seeing fur”.</p><p>Wanting to keep things simple, we decide to use this kind of an approach as the fear model of our robot. Also, <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq\">having read <em>Consciousness and the Brain</em></a></u>, we remember a few basic principles about how those human brains work, which we decide to copy because we’re lazy and don’t want to come up with entirely new principles:</p><ul><li>There’s a special network of neurons in the brain, called the <em>global neuronal workspace</em>. The contents of this workspace are <u><a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain/comment/BF34izs4bf49uTdey\">roughly</a></u> the same as the contents of consciousness.</li><li>We can thus consider consciousness a workspace which many different brain systems have access to. It can hold a single “chunk” of information at a time.</li><li>The brain has multiple different systems doing different things. When a mental object becomes conscious (that is, is projected into the workspace by a subsystem), many systems will synchronize their processing around analyzing and manipulating that mental object.</li></ul><p>So here is our design:</p><ul><li>The robot has a hardwired system scanning for signs of catastrophe. This system has several subcomponents. One of them scans the “pain” sensors for signs of physical damage. Another system watches the “hunger” sensors for signs of low battery.</li><li>Any of these “distress” systems can, alone or in combination, feed a negative reward signal into the global workspace. This tells the rest of the system that this is a bad state, from which the robot should escape.</li><li>If a certain threshold level of “distress” is reached, the current situation is designated as <em>catastrophic</em>. All other priorities are suspended and the robot will prioritize getting out of the situation. A memory of the situation and the situations preceding it are saved to a dedicated storage.</li><li>After the experience, the memory of the catastrophic situation is replayed in consciousness for analysis. This replay is used to train up a separate fear model which effectively acts as a new “distress” system. </li><li>As the robot walks around its environment, sensory information about the surroundings will enter its consciousness workspace. When it plans future actions, simulated sensory information about how those actions would unfold enters the workspace. Whenever the new fear model detects features in either kind of sensory information which it associates with the catastrophic events, it will feed “fear”-type “distress” into the consciousness workspace.</li></ul><p>So if the robot sees things which remind it of poking at hot stove, it will be inclined to go somewhere else; if it imagines doing something which would cause it to poke at the hot stove, then it will be inclined to imagine doing something else.</p><h2>Introducing managers</h2><p>But is this actually enough? We've now basically set up an algorithm which warns the robot when it sees things which have previously preceded a bad outcome. This might be enough for dealing with static tasks, such as not burning yourself at a stove. But it seems insufficient for dealing with things like predators or technological unemployment protesters, who might show up in a wide variety of places and actively try to hunt you down. By the time you see a sign of them, you're already in danger. It would be better if we could learn to avoid them entirely, so that the fear model would never even be triggered.</p><p>As we ponder this dilemma, we surf the web and run across <u><a href=\"https://owainevans.github.io/blog/hirl_blog.html\">this blog post</a></u> summarizing <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05173\">Saunders, Sastry, Stuhlmüller &amp; Evans (2017)</a></u>. They are also concerned with preventing reinforcement learning agents from running into catastrophes, but have a somewhat different approach. In their approach, a reinforcement learner is allowed to do different kinds of things, which a human overseer then allows or blocks. A separate “blocker” model is trained to predict which actions the human overseer would block. In the future, if the robot would ever take an action which the “blocker” predicts the human overseer would disallow, it will block that action. In effect, the system consists of two separate subagents, one subagent trying to maximize rewards and the other subagent trying to block non-approved actions.</p><p>Since our robot has a nice modular architecture into which we can add various subagents which are listening in and taking actions, we decide to take inspiration from this idea. We create a system for spawning dedicated subprograms which try to predict and and block actions which would cause the fear model to be triggered. In theory, this is unnecessary: given enough time, even standard reinforcement learning should learn to avoid the situations which trigger the fear model. But again, trial-and-error can take a very long time to learn exactly which situations trigger fear, so we dedicate a separate subprogram to the task of pre-emptively figuring it out.</p><p>Each fear model is paired with a subagent that we’ll call a <em>manager</em>. While the fear model has associated a bunch of cues with the notion of an impending catastrophe, the manager learns to predict which situations would cause the fear model to trigger. Despite sounding similar, these are not the same thing: one indicates when you are already in danger, the other is trying to figure out what you can do to never end up in danger in the first place. A fear model might learn to recognize signs which technological unemployment protesters commonly wear. Whereas a manager might learn the kinds of environments where the fear model has noticed protesters before: for instance, near the protester HQ.</p><p>Then, if a manager predicts that a given action (such as going to the protester HQ) would eventually trigger the fear model, it will block that action and promote some other action. We can use the interaction of these subsystems to try to ensure that the robot only feels fear in situations which already resemble the catastrophic situation so much as to actually <em>be </em>dangerous. At the same time, the robot will be unafraid to take safe actions in situations from which it <em>could</em> end up in a danger zone, but are themselves safe to be in. </p><p>As an added benefit, we can recycle the manager component to also do the same thing as the blocker component in the Saunders et al. paper originally did. That is, if the robot has a human overseer telling it in strict terms not to do some things, it can create a manager subprogram which models that overseer and likewise blocks the robot from doing things which the model predicts that the overseer would disapprove of.</p><h2>Putting together a toy model</h2><p>If the robot <em>does</em> end up in a situation where the fear model is sounding an alarm, then we want to get it out of the situation as quickly as possible. It may be worth spawning a specialized subroutine just for this purpose. Technological unemployment activists could, among other things, use flamethrowers that set the robot on fire. So let’s call these types of subprograms dedicated to escaping from the danger zone, <em>firefighters</em>.</p><p>So how does the system as a whole work? First, the different subagents act by sending into the consciousness workspace various mental objects, such as an emotion of fear, or an intent to e.g. make breakfast. If several subagents are submitting identical mental objects, we say that they are voting for the same object. On each time-step, one of the submitted objects is chosen at random to become the contents of the workspace, with each object having a chance to be selected that’s proportional to its number of votes. If a mental object describing a physical action (an “intention”) ends up in the workspace and stays chosen for several time-steps, then that action gets executed by a motor subsystem.</p><p>Depending on the situation, some subagents will have more votes than others. E.g. a fear model submitting a fear object gets a number of votes proportional to how strongly it is activated.  Besides the specialized subagents we’ve discussed, there’s also a default planning subagent, which is just taking whatever actions (that is, sending to the workspace whatever mental objects) it thinks will produce the greatest reward. This subagent only has a small number of votes.</p><p>Finally, there’s a self-narrative agent which is <u><a href=\"http://cogprints.org/266/1/selfctr.htm\">constructing a narrative</a></u> of the robot’s actions as if it was a unified agent, for social purposes and for doing reasoning afterwards. After the motor system has taken an action, the self-narrative agent records this as something like “I, Robby the Robot, made breakfast by cooking eggs and bacon”, transmitting this statement to the workspace and saving it to an episodic memory store for future reference.</p><h2>Consequences of the model</h2><p>Is this design any good? Let’s consider a few of its implications.</p><p>First, in order for the robot to take physical actions, the intent to do so has to be in its consciousness for a long enough time for the action to be taken. If there are any subagents that wish to prevent this from happening, they must muster enough votes to bring into consciousness some other mental object replacing that intention before it’s been around for enough time-steps to be executed by the motor system. (This is analogous to the concept of the <u><a href=\"http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libet_experiments.html\">final veto in humans</a></u>, where consciousness is the last place to block pre-consciously initiated actions before they are taken.)</p><p>Second, the different subagents do not see each other directly: they only see the consequences of each other’s actions, as that’s what’s reflected in the contents of the workspace. In particular, the self-narrative agent has no access to information about which subagents were responsible for generating which physical action. It only sees the intentions which preceded the various actions, and the actions themselves. <u><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Xuenay/posts/10153111724243662\">Thus it might easily end up constructing</a></u> a narrative which creates the internal appearance of a single agent, even though the system is actually composed of multiple subagents.</p><p>Third, even if the subagents can’t directly see each other, they might still end up forming alliances. For example, if the robot is standing near the stove, a curiosity-driven subagent might propose poking at the stove (“I want to see if this causes us to burn ourselves again!”), while the default planning system might propose cooking dinner, since that’s what it predicts will please the human owner. Now, a manager trying to prevent a fear model agent from being activated, will eventually learn that if it votes for the default planning system’s intentions to cook dinner (which it saw earlier), then the curiosity-driven agent is less likely to get <em>its</em> intentions into consciousness. Thus, no poking at the stove, and the manager’s and the default planning system’s goals end up aligned.</p><p>Fourth, this design can make it <em>really difficult </em>for the robot to even become aware of the existence of some managers. A manager may learn to support any other mental processes which block the robot from taking specific actions. It does it by voting in favor of mental objects which orient behavior towards anything else. This might manifest as something subtle, such as a mysterious lack of interest towards something that sounds like a good idea in principle, or just repeatedly forgetting to do something, as the robot always seems to get distracted by something else. The self-narrative agent, not having any idea of what’s going on, might just explain this as “Robby the Robot is forgetful sometimes” in its internal narrative.</p><p>Fifth, the default planning subagent here is doing something like rational planning, but given its weak voting power, it’s likely to be overruled if other subagents disagree with it (unless some subagents also agree with it). If some actions seem worth doing, but there are managers which are blocking it and the default planning subagent doesn’t have an explicit representation of them, this can manifest as all kinds of procrastinating behaviors and numerous failed attempts for the default planning system to “try to get itself to do something”, using various strategies. But as long as the managers keep blocking those actions, the system is likely to remain stuck.</p><p>Sixth, the purpose of both managers and firefighters is to keep the robot out of a situation that has been previously designated as dangerous. Managers do this by trying to pre-emptively block actions that would cause the fear model agent to activate; firefighters do this by trying to take actions which shut down the fear model agent after it has activated. But the fear model agent activating is not actually the <em>same</em> thing as being in a dangerous situation. Thus, both managers and firefighters may fall victim to <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy\">Goodhart’s law</a></u>, doing things which block the fear model while being irrelevant for escaping catastrophic situations. </p><p>For example, “thinking about the consequences of going to the activist HQ” is something that might activate the fear model agent, so a manager might try to block just <em>thinking</em> about it. This has obvious consequence that the robot can’t think clearly about that issue. Similarly, once the fear model has already activated, a firefighter might Goodhart by supporting <em>any</em> action which helps activate an agent with a lot of voting power that’s going to think about something entirely different. This could result in compulsive behaviors which were effective at pushing the fear aside, but useless for achieving any of the robot’s actual aims. </p><p>At worst, this could cause loops of mutually activating subagents pushing in opposite directions. First, a stove-phobic robot runs away from the stove as it was about to make breakfast. Then a firefighter trying to suppress that fear, causes the robot to get stuck looking at pictures of beautiful naked robots, which is engrossing and thus great for removing the fear of the stove. Then another fear model starts to activate, this one afraid of failure and of spending so much time looking at pictures of beautiful naked robots that the robot won’t accomplish its goal of making breakfast. A separate firefighter associated with this second fear model has learned that focusing the robot’s attention on the pictures of beautiful naked robots <em>even more</em> is the most effective action for keeping this new fear temporarily subdued. So the two firefighters are allied and temporarily successful at their goal, but then the first one - seeing that the original stove fear has disappeared - turns off. Without the first firefighter’s votes supporting the second firefighter, the fear manages to overwhelm the second firefighter, causing the robot to rush into making breakfast. This again activates its fear of the stove, but <em>if</em> the fear of failure remains strong enough, it might overpower its fear of the stove so that the robot manages to make breakfast in time...</p><p>Hmm. Maybe this design isn’t so great after all. Good thing we noticed these failure modes, so that there aren’t any mind architectures like this going around being vulnerable to them!</p><h1>The Internal Family Systems model</h1><p>But enough hypothetical robot design; let’s get to the topic of IFS. The IFS model hypothesizes the existence of three kinds of “extreme parts” in the human mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Exiles</strong> are said to be parts of the mind which hold the memory of past traumatic events, which the person did not have the resources to handle. They are parts of the psyche which have been split off from the rest and are frozen in time of the traumatic event. When something causes them to surface, they tend to flood the mind with pain. For example, someone may have an exile associated with times when they were romantically rejected in the past.</li><li><strong>Managers</strong> are parts that have been tasked with keeping the exiles permanently exiled from consciousness. They try to arrange a person’s life and psyche so that exiles never surface. For example, managers might keep someone from reaching out to potential dates due to a fear of rejection.</li><li><strong>Firefighters </strong>react when exiles have been triggered, and try to either suppress the exile’s pain or distract the mind from it. For example, after someone has been rejected by a date, they might find themselves drinking in an attempt to numb the pain.</li><li>Some presentations of the IFS model simplify things by combining Managers and Firefighters into the broader category of <strong>Protectors</strong>, so only talk about Exiles and Protectors.</li></ul><p>Exiles are not limited to being created from the kinds of situations that we would commonly consider seriously traumatic. They can also be created from things like relatively minor childhood upsets, as long as the child didn’t feel like they could handle the situation.</p><p>IFS further claims that you can treat these parts as something like independent subpersonalities. You can communicate with them, consider their worries, and gradually persuade managers and firefighters to give you access to the exiles that have been kept away from consciousness. When you do this, you can show them that you are no longer in the situation which was catastrophic before, and now have the resources to handle it if something similar was to happen again. This heals the exile, and also lets the managers and firefighters assume better, healthier roles.</p><p>As I mentioned in the beginning, when I first heard about IFS, I was turned off by it for several different reasons. For instance, here were some of my thoughts at the time:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>The whole model about some parts of the mind being in pain, and other parts trying to suppress their suffering. The thing about exiles was framed in terms of <em>a part of the mind splitting off in order to protect the rest of the mind against damage. </em>What? That doesn’t make any evolutionary sense! A traumatic situation is <em>just sensory information</em> for the brain, it’s not literal brain damage: it wouldn’t have made any sense for minds to evolve in a way that caused parts of it to split off, forcing other parts of the mind to try to keep them suppressed. Why not just… never be damaged in the first place?</li><li>That whole thing about parts being personalized characters that you could talk to. That… doesn’t describe anything in my experience.</li><li>Also, how does just talking to yourself fix any trauma or deeply ingrained behaviors?</li><li>IFS talks about everyone having a “True Self”. Quote from <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model\">Wikipedia</a></u>: <em>IFS also sees people as being whole, underneath this collection of parts. Everyone has a true self or spiritual center, known as the Self to distinguish it from the parts. Even people whose experience is dominated by parts have access to this Self and its healing qualities of curiosity, connectedness, compassion, and calmness. IFS sees the therapist's job as helping the client to disentangle themselves from their parts and access the Self, which can then connect with each part and heal it, so that the parts can let go of their destructive roles and enter into a harmonious collaboration, led by the Self. </em>That… again did not sound particularly derived from any sensible psychology.</li></ol><p>Hopefully, I’ve already answered my past self’s concerns about the first point. The model itself talks in terms of managers protecting the mind from pain, exiles being exiled from consciousness in order for their pain to remain suppressed, etc. Which is a reasonable description <em>of the subjective experience</em> of what happens. But the evolutionary logic - as far as I can guess - is slightly different: to keep us out of dangerous situations. </p><p>The story of the robot describes the actual “design rationale”. Exiles are in fact subagents which are “frozen in the time of a traumatic event”, but they didn’t split off to protect the rest of the mind from damage. <em>Rather, they were created as an isolated memory block to ensure that the memory of the event wouldn’t be forgotten</em>. Managers then exist to keep the person away from such catastrophic situations, and firefighters exist to help escape them. Unfortunately, this setup is vulnerable to various failure modes, similar to those that the robot is vulnerable to.</p><p>With that said, let’s tackle the remaining problems that I had with IFS.</p><h2>Personalized characters</h2><p>IFS suggests that you can experience the exiles, managers and firefighters in your mind as something akin to subpersonalities - entities with their own names, visual appearances, preferences, beliefs, and so on. Furthermore, this isn’t inherently dysfunctional, nor indicative of something like Dissociative Identity Disorder. Rather, even people who are entirely healthy and normal may experience this kind of “multiplicity”.</p><p>Now, it’s important to note right off that not everyone has this to a major extent: you don’t <em>need</em> to experience multiplicity in order for the IFS process to work. For instance, my parts feel more like bodily sensations and shards of desire than subpersonalities, but IFS still works super-well for me.</p><p>In the book <em><u><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Internal-Family-Systems-Therapy-Guilford-ebook/dp/B00FW4ELM2/\">Internal Family Systems Therapy</a></u>, </em>Richard Schwartz, the developer of IFS, notes that if a person’s subagents play well together, then that person is likely to feel mostly internally unified. On the other hand, if a person has lots of internal conflict, then they are more likely to experience themselves as having multiple parts with conflicting desires. </p><p>I think that this makes a lot of sense, assuming the existence of something like a self-narrative subagent. If you remember, this is the part of the mind which looks at the actions that the mind-system has taken, and then constructs an explanation for why those actions were taken. (See e.g. the posts on the <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K2JBqDeETX2yEgyyZ/the-limits-of-introspection\">limits of introspection</a></u> and on <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZiQqsgGX6a42Sfpii/the-apologist-and-the-revolutionary\">the Apologist and the Revolutionary</a></u> for previous evidence for the existence of such a confabulating subagent with limited access to our true motivations.) As long as all the exiles, managers and firefighters are functioning in a unified fashion, the most parsimonious model that the self-narrative subagent might construct is simply that of a unified self. But if the system keeps being driven into strongly conflicting behaviors, then it can’t necessarily make sense of them from a single-agent perspective. Then it might naturally settle on something like a multiagent approach and experience itself as being split into parts. </p><p>Kevin Simler, in <u><a href=\"https://meltingasphalt.com/neurons-gone-wild/\">Neurons Gone Wild</a></u>, notes how people with strong addictions seem particularly prone to developing multi-agent narratives:</p><blockquote><em>This American Life</em> did a nice segment on addiction a few years back, in which the producers — seemingly on a lark — asked people to personify their addictions. \"It was like people had been waiting all their lives for somebody to ask them this question,\" said the producers, and they gushed forth with descriptions of the 'voice' of their inner addict:</blockquote><blockquote><em>\"The voice is irresistible, always. I'm in the thrall of that voice.\"</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>\"Totally out of control. It's got this life of its own, and I can't tame it anymore.\"</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>\"I actually have a name for the voice. I call it Stan. Stan is the guy who tells me to have the extra glass of wine. Stan is the guy who tells me to smoke.\"</em></blockquote><p>This doesn’t seem like it explains all of it, though. I’ve frequently been very dysfunctional, and have always found very intuitive the notion of the mind being split into very parts. Yet I mostly still don’t seem to experience my subagents anywhere near as person-like as some others clearly do. I know at least one person who ended up finding IFS because of having all of these talking characters in their head, and who was looking for something that would help them make sense of it. Nothing like that has ever been the case for me: I did experience strongly conflicting desires, but they were just that, strongly conflicting desires.</p><p>I can only surmise that it has something to do with the same kinds of differences which cause some people to think mainly verbally, others mainly visually, and others yet in some other hard-to-describe modality. Some fiction writers <u><a href=\"https://pages.uoregon.edu/hodgeslab/files/Download/Taylor%20Hodges%20Kohanyi_2003.pdf\">spontaneously experience</a></u> their characters as real people who speak to them and will even bother the writer when at the supermarket, and some others don’t. </p><p>It’s been noted that the mechanisms which use to model ourselves and other people overlap - not very surprisingly, since both we and other people are (presumably) humans. So it seems reasonable that some of the mechanisms for representing other people, would sometimes also end up spontaneously recruited for representing internal subagents or coalitions of them. </p><h2>Why should this technique be useful for psychological healing?</h2><p>Okay, suppose it’s possible to access our subagents somehow. Why would just talking with these entities in your own head, help you fix psychological issues?</p><p>Let’s consider that a person having exiles, managers and firefighters is costly in the sense of constraining that person’s options. If you never want to do anything that would cause you to see a stove, that limits quite a bit of what you can do. I strongly suspect that many forms of procrastination and failure to do things we’d like to do are mostly a manifestation of overactive managers. So it’s important not to create those kinds of entities unless the situation really <em>is</em> one which should be designated as categorically unacceptable to end up in.</p><p>The theory for IFS mentions that not all painful situations turn into trauma: just ones in which we felt helpless and like we didn’t have the necessary resources for dealing with it. This makes sense, since if we were capable of dealing with it, then the situation can’t have been that catastrophic. The aftermath of the immediate event is important as well: a child who ends up in a painful situation doesn’t necessarily end up traumatized, if they have an adult who can put the event in a reassuring context afterwards.</p><p>But situations which used to be catastrophic and impossible for us to handle before, aren’t necessarily that any more. It seems important to have a mechanism for updating that cache of catastrophic events and for disassembling the protections around it, if the protections turn out to be unnecessary.</p><p>How does that process usually happen, without IFS or any other specialized form of therapy?</p><p>Often, by talking about your experiences with someone you trust. Or writing about them in private or in a blog.</p><p>In <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq\">my post about <em>Consciousness and the Brain</em></a></u>, I mentioned that once a mental object becomes conscious, many different brain systems synchronize their processing around it. I suspect that the reason why many people have such a powerful urge to discuss their traumatic experiences with someone else, is that doing so is a way of bringing those memories into consciousness in detail. And once you’ve dug up your traumatic memories from their cache, their content can be re-processed and re-evaluated. If your brain judges that you now <em>do </em>have the resources to handle that event if you ever end up in it again, or if it’s something that simply can’t happen anymore, then the memory can be removed from the cache and you no longer need to avoid it.</p><p>I think it’s also significant that, while something like just writing about a traumatic event is sometimes enough to heal, often it’s more effective if you have a sympathetic listener who you trust. Traumas often involve some amount of shame: maybe you were called lazy as a kid and are still afraid of others thinking that you are lazy. Here, having friends who accept you and are willing to nonjudgmentally listen while you talk about your issues, is by itself an indication that the thing that you used to be afraid of isn’t a danger anymore: there exist people who will stay by your side despite knowing your secret.</p><p>Now, when you are talking to a friend about your traumatic memory, you will be going through cached memories that have been stored in an exile subagent. A specific memory circuit - one of several circuits specialized for the act of holding painful memories - is active and outputting its contents into the global workspace, from which they are being turned into words.</p><p>Meaning that, in a sense, <em>your friend is talking directly to your exile.</em></p><p>Could you hack this process, so that you wouldn’t even <em>need</em> a friend, and could carry this process out entirely internally?</p><p>In <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq\">my earlier post</a></u>, I remarked that you could view language as a way of joining two people’s brains together. A subagent in your brain outputs something that appears in your consciousness, you communicate it to a friend, it appears in their consciousness, subagents in your friend’s brain manipulate the information somehow, and then they send it back to your consciousness.</p><p>If you are telling your friend about your trauma, you are in a sense joining your workspaces together, and letting some subagents in <em>your</em> workspace, communicate with the “sympathetic listener” subagents in <em>your friend’s</em> workspace.</p><p>So why not let a “sympathetic listener” subagent in your workspace, hook up directly with the traumatized subagents that are also in your own workspace? </p><p>I think that something like this happens when you do IFS. You are using a technique designed to activate the relevant subagents in a very specific way, which allows for this kind of a “hooking up” without needing another person.</p><p>For instance, suppose that you are talking to a manager subagent which wants to hide the fact that you’re bad at something, and starts reacting defensively whenever the topic is brought up. Now, one way by which its activation could manifest, is feeding those defensive thoughts and reactions directly into your workspace. In such a case, you would experience them as your <em>own</em> thoughts, and possibly as objectively real. <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8ZrDp7d5t4fwKXfj3/tentatively-considering-emotional-stories-ifs-and-getting\">IFS calls this “blending”</a></u>; I’ve also previously <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and\">used the term “cognitive fusion”</a></u> for what’s essentially the same thing.</p><p>Instead of remaining blended, you then use various unblending / cognitive defusion techniques that highlight the way by which these thoughts and emotions are coming from a specific part of your mind. You could think of this as wrapping extra content around the thoughts and emotions, and then seeing them through the wrapper (which is obviously not-you), rather than experiencing the thoughts and emotions directly (which you might experience as your own). For example, the IFS book <em>Self-Therapy</em> suggests this unblending technique (among others):</p><blockquote>Allow a visual image of the part [subagent] to arise. This will give you the sense of it as a separate entity. This approach is even more effective if the part is clearly a certain distance away from you. The further away it is, the more separation this creates. </blockquote><blockquote>Another way to accomplish visual separation is to draw or paint an image of the part. Or you can choose an object from your home that represents the part for you or find an image of it in a magazine or on the Internet. Having a concrete token of the part helps to create separation.</blockquote><p>I think of this as something like, you are taking the subagent in question, routing its responses through a visualization subsystem, and then you see a talking fox or whatever. And this is then a representation that your internal subsystems for talking with other people can respond to. You can then have a dialogue with the part (verbally or otherwise) in a way where its responses are clearly labeled as coming from it, rather than being mixed together with all the other thoughts in the workspace. This lets the content coming from the sympathetic-listener subagent and the exile/manager/firefighter subagent be kept clearly apart, allowing you to consider the emotional content as you would as an external listener, preventing you from drowning in it. You’re hacking your brain so as to work as the therapist and client as the same time.</p><h2>The Self</h2><p>IFS claims that, below all the various parts and subagents, there exists a “true self” which you can learn to access. When you are in this Self, you exhibit the qualities of “calmness, curiosity, clarity, compassion, confidence, creativity, courage, and connectedness”. Being at least partially in Self is said to be a prerequisite for working with your parts: if you are not, then you are not able to evaluate their models objectively. The parts will sense this, and as a result, they will not share their models properly, preventing the kind of global re-evaluation of their contents that would update them.</p><p>This was the part that I was initially the most skeptical of, and which made me most frequently decide that IFS was not worth looking at. I could easily conceptualize the mind as being made up of various subagents. But then it would just be numerous subagents all the way down, without any single one that could be designated the “true” self.</p><p>But let’s look at IFS’s description of how exactly to get into Self. You check whether you seem to be blended with any part. If you are, you unblend with it. Then you check whether you might also be blended with some other part. If you are, you unblend from it also. You then keep doing this until you can find no part that you might be blended with. All that’s left are those “eight Cs”, which just seem to be a kind of a global state, with no particular part that they would be coming from.</p><p>I now think that “being in Self” represents a state where there no particular subagent is getting a disproportionate share of voting power, and everything is processed by the system as a whole. Remember that in the robot story, catastrophic states were situations in which the organism should <em>never</em> end up. A subagent kicking in to prevent that from happening is a kind of a priority override to normal thinking. It blocks you from being open and calm and curious <em>because</em> some subagent thinks that doing so would be dangerous. If you then turn off or suspend all those priority overrides, then the mind’s default state absent any override seems to be one with the qualities of the Self.</p><p>This actually fits at least one model of the function of positive emotions pretty well. <u><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156001/\">Fredrickson (1998)</a></u> suggests that an important function of positive emotions is to make us engage in activities such as play, exploration, and savoring the company of other people. Doing these things has the effect of building up skills, knowledge, social connections, and other kinds of resources which might be useful for us in the future. If there are no active ongoing threats, then that implies that the situation is pretty safe for the time being, making it reasonable to revert to a positive state of being open to exploration. </p><p>The <em>Internal Family Systems Therapy</em> book makes a somewhat big deal out of the fact that everyone, even most traumatized people, ultimately has a Self which they can access. It explains this in terms of the mind being organized to protect against damage, and with parts always splitting off from the Self when it would otherwise be damaged. I think the real explanation is much simpler: the mind is not accumulating damage, it is just accumulating a longer and longer list of situations not considered safe.</p><p>As an aside, this model feels like it makes me less confused about confidence. It seems like people are really attracted to confident people, and that to some extent it’s also possible to fake confidence until it becomes genuine. But if confidence is so attractive and we can fake it, why hasn’t evolution just made everyone confident by default? </p><p>Turns out that it <em>has</em>. The reason why faked confidence gradually turns into genuine confidence is that by forcing yourself to act in confident ways which felt dangerous before, your mind gets information indicating that this behavior is not as dangerous as you originally thought. That gradually turns off those priority overrides that kept you out of Self originally, until you get there naturally.</p><p>The reason why being in Self is a requirement for doing IFS, is the existence of conflicts between parts. For instance, recall the stove-phobic robot having a firefighter subagent that caused it to retreat from the stove into watching pictures of beautiful naked robots. This triggered a subagent which was afraid of the naked-robot-watching preventing the robot from achieving its goals. If the robot now tried to do IFS and talk with the firefighter subagent that caused it to run away from stoves, this might bring to mind content which activated the exile that was afraid of not achieving things. Then <em>that</em> exile would keep flooding the mind with negative memories, trying to achieve its priority override of “we need to get out of this situation”, and preventing the process from proceeding. Thus, all of the subagents that have strong opinions about the situation need to be unblended from, before integration can proceed.</p><p>IFS also has a separate concept of “Self-Leadership”. This is a process where various subagents eventually come to trust the Self, so that they allow the person to increasingly remain in Self even in various emergencies. IFS views this as a positive development, not only because it feels nice, but because doing so means that the person will have more cognitive resources available for actually dealing with the emergency in question.</p><p>I think that this ties back to the original notion of subagents being generated to invoke priority overrides for situations <em>which the person originally didn’t have the resources to handle</em>. Many of the subagents IFS talks about seem to emerge from childhood experiences. A child has many fewer cognitive, social, and emotional resources for dealing with bad situations, in which case it makes sense to just categorically avoid them, and invoke special overrides to ensure that this happens. A child’s cognitive capacities, models of the world, and abilities to self-regulate are also less developed, so she may have a harder time staying out of dangerous situations <em>without</em> having some priority overrides built in. An adult, however, typically has many more resources than a child does. Even when faced with an emergency situation, it can be much better to be able to remain calm and analyze the situation using <em>all</em> of one’s subagents, rather than having a few of them take over all the decision-making. Thus, it seems to me - both theoretically and practically - that developing Self-Leadership is <em>really</em> valuable.</p><p>That said, I do not wish to imply that it would be a good goal to <em>never</em> have negative emotions. Sometimes blending with a subagent, and experiencing resulting negative emotions, is the right thing to do in that situation. Rather than suppressing negative emotions entirely, Self-Leadership aims to get to a state where any emotional reaction tends to be endorsed by the mind-system as a whole. Thus, if feeling angry or sad or bitter or whatever feels appropriate to the situation, you can let yourself feel so, and then give yourself to that emotion without resisting it. As a result, negative emotions become less unpleasant to experience, since there are fewer subagents trying to fight against them. Also, if it turns out that being in a negative emotional state is no longer useful, the system as a whole can just choose to move back into Self.</p><h1>Final words</h1><p>I’ve now given a brief summary of the IFS model, and explained why I think it makes sense. This is of course not enough to establish the model as <em>true</em>. But it might help in making the model plausible enough to at least try out.</p><p>I think that most people could benefit from learning and doing IFS on themselves, either alone or together with a friend. I’ve been saying that exiles/managers/firefighters tend to be generated from trauma, but it’s important to realize that these events don’t need to be anything immensely traumatic. The kinds of ordinary, normal childhood upsets that everyone has had can generate these kinds of subagents. Remember, just because you think of a childhood event as trivial <em>now</em>, doesn’t mean that it felt trivial to you <em>as a child</em>. Doing IFS work, I’ve found exiles related to memories and events which I <em>thought</em> left no negative traces, but actually did.</p><p>Remember also that it can be really hard to notice the presence of some managers: if they are doing their job effectively, then you might never become aware of them directly. “I don’t have any trauma so I wouldn’t benefit from doing IFS” isn’t necessarily correct. Rather, the cues that I use for detecting a need to do internal work are: </p><ul><li><em>Do I have the qualities associated with Self, or is something blocking them? </em></li><li><em>Do I feel like I’m capable of dealing with this situation rationally, and doing the things which feel like good ideas on an intellectual level? </em></li><li><em>Do my emotional reactions feel like they are endorsed by my mind-system as a whole, or is there a resistance to them?</em></li></ul><p>If not, there is often some internal conflict which needs to be addressed - and IFS, combined with some other practices such as <u><a href=\"https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/focusing-for-skeptics-6b949ef33a4f\">Focusing</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and\">meditation</a></u> - has been very useful in learning to solve those internal conflicts.</p><p>Even if you don’t feel convinced that doing IFS personally would be a good idea, I think adopting its framework of exiles, managers and firefighters is useful for better understanding the behavior of other people. Their dynamics will be easier to recognize in other people if you’ve had some experience recognizing them in yourself, however.</p><p>If you want to learn more about IFS, I would recommend starting with <u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00452V8EG/\">Self-Therapy</a></u> by Jay Earley.

However, I still think it’s worth working on because long-term safety suggests a particular subset of problems to focus on; that subset seems quite neglected.</p><p>For example, a lot of work is about how to improve current algorithms in a particular domain, and the solutions encode domain knowledge to succeed. This seems not very relevant for long-term concerns. Some work assumes that a handcoded featurization is given (so that the true reward is linear in the features); this is not an assumption we could make for more powerful AI systems.</p><p>I will speculate a bit on the neglectedness and feasibility of each of these areas, since for many of them there isn’t a person or research group who would champion them whom I could defer to about the arguments for success.</p><h3>The big picture</h3><p>This category of research is about how you could take narrow value learning algorithms and use them to create an aligned AI system. Typically, I expect this to work by having the narrow value learning enable some form of <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">corrigibility</a>.</p><p>As far as I can tell, nobody outside of the AI safety community works on this problem. While it is far too early to stake a confident position one way or the other, I am slightly less optimistic about this avenue of approach than one in which we create a system that is directly trained to be corrigible.</p><p><strong>Avoiding problems with goal-directedness.</strong> How do we put together narrow value learning techniques in a way that doesn’t lead to the AI behaving like a goal-directed agent at each point? This is the problem with <a href=\"https://jan.leike.name/publications/Towards%20Interactive%20Inverse%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20-%20Armstrong,%20Leike%202016.pdf\">keeping a reward estimate that is updated over time</a>. While <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/ZiLLxaLB5CCofrzPp\">reward uncertainty</a> can help avoid some of the problems, it does not seem sufficient by itself. Are there other ideas that can help?</p><p><strong>Dealing with the difficulty of “human values”.</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\">Cooperative IRL</a> makes the unrealistic assumption that the human knows her reward function exactly. How can we make narrow value learning systems that deal with this issue? In particular, what prevents them from updating on our behavior that’s not in line with our “true values”, while still letting them update on other behavior? Perhaps we could make an AI system that is always uncertain about what the true reward is, but how does this mesh with epistemics, which suggest that you can get to arbitrarily high confidence given sufficient evidence?</p><h3>Human-AI interaction</h3><p>This section of research aims to figure out how to create human-AI systems that successfully accomplish tasks. For sufficiently complex tasks and sufficiently powerful AI, this overlaps with the big picture concerns above, but there are also areas to work on with subhuman AI with an eye towards more powerful systems.</p><p><strong>Assumptions about the human.</strong> In any feedback system, the update that the AI makes on the human feedback depends on the assumption that the AI makes about the human. In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02827\">Inverse Reward Design</a> (IRD), the AI system assumes that the reward function provided by a human designer leads to near-optimal behavior in the training environment, but may be arbitrarily bad in other environments. In IRL, the typical assumption is that the demonstrations are created by a human behaving Boltzmann rationally, but recent research aims to also correct for any suboptimalities they might have, and so no longer assumes away the problem of systematic biases. (See also the discussion in <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/EhNCnCkmu7MwrQ7yz/future-directions-for-ambitious-value-learning\">Future directions for ambitious value learning</a>.) In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\">Cooperative IRL</a>, the AI system assumes that the human models the AI system as approximately rational. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06049\">COACH</a> notes that when you ask a human to provide a reward signal, they provide a critique of current behavior rather than a reward signal that can be maximized.</p><p>Can we weaken the assumptions that we have to make, or get rid of them altogether? Barring that, can we make our assumptions more realistic?</p><p><strong>Managing interaction.</strong> How should the AI system manage its interaction with the human to learn best? This is the domain of active learning, which is far too large a field for me to summarize here. I’ll throw in a link to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03060\">Active Inverse Reward Design</a>, because I already talked about IRD and I helped write the active variant.</p><p><strong>Human policy.</strong> The utility of a feedback system is going to depend strongly on the quality of the feedback given by the human. How do we train humans so that their feedback is most useful for the AI system? So far, most work is about how to adapt AI systems to understand humans better, but it seems likely there are also gains to be had by having humans adapt to AI systems.</p><h3>Finding and using preference information</h3><p><strong>New sources of data.</strong> So far preferences are typically learned through demonstrations, comparisons or rankings; but there are likely other useful ways to elicit preferences. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02827\">Inverse Reward Design</a> gets preferences from a stated proxy reward function. An obvious one is to learn preferences from what people say, but natural language is notoriously hard to work with so not much work has been done on it so far, though <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07882\">there</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08272\">is</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01946\">some</a>. (I’m pretty sure there’s a lot more in the NLP community that I’m not yet aware of.) We recently showed that there is even preference information in the <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkevMnRqYQ\">state of the world</a> that can be extracted.</p><p><strong>Handling multiple sources of data.</strong> We could infer preferences from behavior, from speech, from given reward functions, from the state of the world, etc. but it seems quite likely that the inferred preferences would conflict with each other. What do you do in these cases? Is there a way to infer preferences simultaneously from all the sources of data such that the problem does not arise? (And if so, what is the algorithm implicitly doing in cases where different data sources pull in different directions?)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mSPsyEwaymS74unND/acknowledging-human-preference-types-to-support-value\">Acknowledging Human Preference Types to Support Value Learning</a> talks about this problem and suggests some aggregation rules but doesn’t test them. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10692\">Reward Learning from Narrated Demonstrations</a> learns from both speech and demonstrations, but they are used as complements to each other, not as different sources for the same information that could conflict.</p><p>I’m particularly excited about this line of research -- it seems like it hasn’t been explored yet and there are things that can be done, especially if you allow yourself to simply detect conflicts, present the conflict to the user, and then trust their answer. (Though this wouldn’t scale to superintelligent AI.)</p><p><strong>Generalization.</strong> Current deep IRL algorithms (or deep anything algorithms) do not generalize well. How can we infer reward functions that transfer well to different environments? <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248\">Adversarial IRL</a> is an example of work pushing in this direction, but my understanding is that it had limited success. I’m less optimistic about this avenue of research because it seems like in general function approximators do not extrapolate well. On the other hand, I and everyone else have the strong intuition that a reward function should take fewer bits to specify than the full policy, and so should be easier to infer. (Though <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/ANupXf8XfZo2EJxGv\">not based on Kolmogorov complexity</a>.)</p>",

Getting the straightforward parts out of the way seems useful for talking more clearly about the hard parts (and you never know what questions may turn out to be surprisingly subtle).</p><h2>The setting</h2><p>To simplify things even further, for now I’ll focus on the special case where our agent is taking a single action <em>a</em>. All of the difficulties that arise in the single-shot case also arise in the sequential case, but the sequential case also has its own set of additional complications that deserve their own post.</p><p>Throughout the post I will imagine myself in the position of an “overseer” who is trying to specify a reward function R(<em>a</em>) for an agent. You can imagine the overseer as the user themselves, or (more realistically) as a team of engineer and/or researchers who are implementing a reward function intended to expresses the user’s preferences.</p><p>I’ll often talk about the overseer computing R(<em>a</em>) themselves. This is at odds with the usual situation in RL, where the overseer implements a very fast function for computing R(<em>a</em>) in general (“1 for a win, 0 for a draw, -1 for a loss”). Computing R(<em>a</em>) for a particular action <em>a</em> is strictly easier than producing a fast general implementation, so in some sense this is just another simplification.

Long time horizons</h1><p>A single decision may have very long-term effects. For example, even if I only care about maximizing human happiness, I may instrumentally want my agent to help advance basic science that will one day improve cancer treatment.</p><p>In principle this could fall out of an RL task with “human happiness” as the reward, so we might think that neglecting long-term effects is just a shortcoming of the single-shot problem. But even in theory there is no way that an RL agent can learn to handle arbitrarily long-term dependencies (imagine training an RL agent to handle 40 year time horizons), and so focusing on the sequential RL problem doesn’t address this issue.</p><p>I think that the only real approach is to choose a reward function that reflects the overseer’s expectations about long-term consequences — i.e., the overseer’s task involves both making predictions about what will happen, and value judgments about how good it will be. This makes the reward function more complex and in some sense limits the competence of the learner by the competence of the reward function, but it’s not clear what other options we have.</p><p>Before computing the reward function R(<em>a</em>), we are free to execute the action <em>a</em> and observe its short-term consequences. Any data that could be used in our training process can just as well be provided as an input to the overseer, who can use the auxiliary input to help predict the long-term consequences of an action.</p><h1>2. Inconsistency and unreliability</h1><p>A human judge has no hope of making globally consistent judgments about which of two outcomes are preferred — the best we can hope for is for their judgments to be right in sufficiently obvious cases, and to be some kind of noisy proxy when things get complicated. Actually outputting a numerical reward — implementing some utility function for our preferences — is even more hopelessly difficult.</p><p>Another way of seeing the difficult is to suppose that the overseer’s judgment is a noisy and potential biased evaluation of the quality of the underlying action. If both R(<em>a</em>) and R(<em>a</em>′) are both big numbers with a lot of noise, but the two actions are actually quite similar, then the difference will be dominated by noise. Imagine an overseer trying to estimate the impact of drinking a cup of coffee on Alice’s life by estimating her happiness in a year conditioned on drinking the coffee, estimating happiness conditioned on not drinking the coffee, and then subtracting the estimates.</p><p>We can partially address this difficulty by allowing the overseer to make <em>comparisons</em> instead of assessing absolute value. That is, rather than directly implementing a reward function, we can allow the overseer to implement an antisymmetric comparison function C(<em>a, a</em>′): which of two actions <em>a</em> and <em>a</em>′ is a better in context? This function can take real values specifying <em>how much</em>one action is better than another, and should by antisymmetric.</p><p>In the noisy-judgments model, we are hoping that the noise or bias of a comparison C(<em>a</em>, <em>a</em>′) depends on the actual magnitude of the difference between the actions, rather than on the absolute quality of each action. This hopefully means that the total error/bias does not drown out the actual signal.</p><p>We can then define the decision problem <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/optimizing-with-comparisons-c02b8c0d7877\">as a zero-sum game</a>: two agents propose different actions <em>a</em> and <em>a</em>′, and receive rewards C(<em>a</em>, <em>a</em>′) and C(<em>a</em>′, <em>a</em>). At the equilibrium of this game, we can at least rest assured that the agent doesn’t do anything that is <em>unambiguously worse</em> than another option it could think of. In general, this seems to give us sensible guarantees when the overseer’s preferences are not completely consistent.</p><p>One subtlety is that in order to evaluate the comparison C(<em>a</em>, <em>a</em>′), we may want to observe the short-term consequences of taking action <em>a</em> or action <em>a</em>′. But in many environments it will only be possible to take one action. So after looking at both actions we will need to choose at most one to actually execute (e.g. we need to estimate how good drinking coffee was, after observing the short-term consequences of drinking coffee but without observing the short-term consequences of not drinking coffee). This will generally increase the variance of C, since we will need to use our best guess about the action which we didn’t actually execute. But of course this is a source of variance that RL algorithms already need to contend with.</p><h1>3. Normative uncertainty</h1><p>The agent is uncertain not only about its environment, but also about the overseer (and hence the reward function). We need to somehow specify how the agent should behave in light of this uncertainty. Structurally, this is identical to the philosophical problem of <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf\">managing normative uncertainty</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@paulfchristiano/normative-uncertainty-f15d0bc67351\">One approach</a> is to pick a fixed yardstick to measure with. For example, our yardstick could be “adding a dollar to the user’s bank account.” We can then measure C(<em>a</em>, <em>a</em>′) as a multiple of this yardstick: “how many dollars would we have to add to the user’s bank account to make them indifferent between taking action <em>a</em> and action <em>a</em>′?” If the user has diminishing returns to money, it would be a bit more precise to ask: “what chance of replacing <em>a</em> with <em>a</em>′ is worth adding a dollar to the user’s bank account?” The comparison C(<em>a</em>, <em>a</em>′) is then the inverse of this probability.</p><p>This is exactly analogous to the usual construction of a utility function. In the case of utility functions, our choice of yardstick is totally unimportant — different possible utility functions differ by a scalar, and so give rise to the same preferences. In the case of normative uncertainty that is no longer the case, because we are specifying how to <em>aggregate</em> the preferences of different possible versions of the overseer.</p><p>I think it’s important to be aware that different choices of yardstick result in different behavior. But hopefully this isn’t an <em>important</em> difference, and we can get sensible behavior for a wide range of possible choices of yardstick — if we find a situation where different yardsticks give very different behaviors, then we need to think carefully about how we are applying RL.</p><p>For many yardsticks it is possible to run into pathological situations. For example, suppose that the overseer might decide that dollars are worthless. They would then radically increase the value of all of the agent’s decisions, measured in dollars. So an agent deciding what to do would effectively care much more about worlds where the overseer decided that dollars are worthless.</p><p>So it seems best to choose a yardstick whose value is relatively stable across possible worlds. To this effect we could use a broader basket of goods, like 1 minute of the user’s time + 0.1% of the day’s income + <em>etc.</em> It may be best for the overseer to use common sense about how important a decision is relative to some kind of idealized influence in the world, rather than sticking to any precisely defined basket.</p><p>It is also desirable to use a yardstick which is simple, and preferably which minimizes the overseer’s uncertainty. Ideally by standardizing on a single yardstick throughout an entire project, we could end up with definitions that are very broad and robust, while being very well-understood by the overseer.</p><p>Note that if the same agent is being trained to work for many users, then this yardstick is also specifying how the agent will weigh the interests of different users — for example, whose accents will it prefer to spend modeling capacity on understanding? This is something to be mindful of in cases where it matters, and it can provide intuitions about how to handle the normative uncertainty case as well. I feel that economic reasoning is useful for arriving at sensible conclusions in these situations, but there are other reasonable perspectives.</p><h1>4. Widely varying reward</h1><p>Some tasks may have widely varying rewards — sometimes the user would only pay 1¢ to move the decision one way or the other, and sometimes they would pay $10,000.</p><p>If small-stakes and large-stakes decisions occur comparably frequently, then we can essentially ignore the small-stakes decisions. That will happen automatically with a traditional optimization algorithm — after we normalize the rewards so that the “big” rewards don’t totally destroy our model, the “small” rewards will be so small that they have no effect.</p><p>Things get more tricky when small-stakes decisions are much more common than the large-stakes decisions. For example, if the importance of decisions is power-law distributed with an exponent of 1, then decisions of all scales are in some sense equally important, and a good algorithm needs to do well on all of them. This may sound like a very special case, but I think it is actually quite natural for there to be several scales that are all comparably important <em>in total</em>.</p><p>In these cases, I think we should do importance sampling — we oversample the high-stakes decisions during training, and scale the rewards down by the same amount, so that the contribution to the total reward is correct. This ensures that the scale of rewards is basically the same across all episodes, and lets us apply a traditional optimization algorithm.</p><p>Further problems arise when there are some <em>very</em> high-stakes situations that occur very rarely. In some sense this just means the learning problem is actually very hard — we are going to have to learn from few samples. Treating different scales as the same problem (using importance sampling) may help if there is substantial transfer between different scales, but it can’t address the whole problem.</p><p>For very rare+high-stakes decisions it is especially likely that we will want to use simulations to avoid making any obvious mistakes or missing any obvious opportunities. <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/learning-with-catastrophes-59387b55cc30\">Learning with catastrophes</a> is an instantiation of this setting, where the high-stakes settings have only downside and no upside. I don’t think we really know how to cope with rare high-stakes decisions; there are likely to be some fundamental limits on how well we can do, but I expect we’ll be able to improve a lot over the current state of the art.</p><h1>5. Sparse reward</h1><p>In many problems, “almost all” possible actions are equally terrible. For example, if I want my agent to write an email, almost all possible strings are just going to be nonsense.</p><p>One approach to this problem is to adjust the reward function to make it easier to satisfy — to provide a “trail of breadcrumbs” leading to high reward behaviors. I think this basic idea is important, but that changing the reward function isn’t the right way to implement it (at least conceptually).</p><p>Instead we could treat the problem statement as given, but view auxiliary reward functions as a kind of “hint” that we might provide to help the algorithm figure out what to do. Early in the optimization we might mostly optimize this hint, but as optimization proceeds we should anneal towards the actual reward function.</p><p>Typical examples of proxy reward functions include “partial credit” for behaviors that look promising; artificially high discount rates and careful reward shaping; and adjusting rewards so that small victories have an effect on learning even though they don’t actually matter. All of these play a central role in practical RL.</p><p>A proxy reward function is just one of many possible hints. Providing <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/imitation-rl-613d70146409\">demonstrations of successful behavior</a> is another important kind of hint. Again, I don’t think that this should be taken as a change to the reward function, but rather as side information to help achieve high reward. In the long run, we will hopefully design learning algorithms that automatically learn how to use general auxiliary information.</p><h1>6. Complex reward</h1><p>A reward function that intends to capture all of our preferences may need to be very complicated. If a reward function is implicitly estimating the expected consequences of an action, then it needs to be even more complicated. And for powerful learners, I expect that reward functions will need to be learned rather than implemented directly.</p><p>It is tempting to substitute a simple proxy for a complicated real reward function. This may be important for getting the optimization to work, but it is problematic to change the definition of the problem.</p><p>Instead, I hope that it will be possible to provide these simple proxies as hints to the learner, and then to use <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/semi-supervised-reinforcement-learning-cf7d5375197f\">semi-supervised RL</a> to optimize the real hard-to-compute reward function. This may allow us to perform optimization even when the reward function is many times more expensive to evaluate than the agent itself; for example, it might allow a human overseer to compute the rewards for a fast RL agent on a case by case basis, rather than being forced to design a fast-to-compute proxy.</p><p>Even if we are willing to spend much longer computing the reward function than the agent itself, we still won’t be able to find a reward function that perfectly captures our preferences. But <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/the-informed-oversight-problem-1b51b4f66b35\">it may be just as good</a> to choose a reward function that captures our preferences “for all that the agent can tell,” i.e. such that the conditioned on two outcomes receiving the same expected reward the agent cannot predict which of them we would prefer. This seems much more realistic, once we are willing to have a reward function with much higher computational complexity than the agent.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In reinforcement learning we often take the reward function as given. In real life, we are only given our preferences — in an implicit, hard-to-access form — and need to engineer a reward function that will lead to good behavior. This presents a bunch of problems. In this post I discussed six problems which I think are relatively straightforward. (Straightforward from the reward-engineering perspective — the associated RL tasks may be very hard!)</p><p>Understanding these straightforward problems is important if we want to think clearly about very powerful RL agents. But I expect that most of our time will go into thinking about harder problems, for which we don’t yet have any workable approach. These harder problems may expose more fundamental limits of RL, that will require substantially new techniques to address.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><h1>Appendix: harder problems</h1><h2>Informed oversight</h2><p>The process that produces a decision may encode important information about the quality of that decision, and if we throw out that information then a very bad decision may nevertheless receive a high reward. For example, if we want an agent to produce original art, we may not be able to evaluate a painting without understanding the process that produced it (and, in particular, what other artwork it was inspired by).</p><p>In some cases, recovering information about the process seems feasible. For example, if the agent is using attention or an external memory, the overseer can check what art the agent looked at. But in other cases it seems much more challenging: if the agent’s weights have memorized properties of particular artwork, we would need new techniques in order to make that information available to the overseer.</p><p>It is not clear whether there is any general way to give the overseer enough insight into the agent’s thought process to avoid problems like this; there may be some inherent limitations on delegation. Either way, it would be nice to understand the situation much better.</p><h2>Capability amplification</h2><p>By folding our preferences and long-term predictions into the reward function, we are in some sense limiting the agent to be no stronger than the overseer. If we start with a human, then RL will only ever produce human-level reasoning about long-term consequences or about “what is good.”</p><p>So we need some other mechanism for producing better long-term reasoning. I think that the most promising approach is to treat “reasoning well” as a short-term problem, for which humans can provide adequate oversight, and then to <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34\">run that reasoning process for longer</a> in order to produce more powerful reasoning.</p><h2>Reward hacking / security</h2><p>If our reward function has any problems, a powerful RL agent may tend to find actions <em>a</em> that exploit those problems in order to receive a high reward. In order to get good consequences, our reward function needs to be sufficiently secure that the agent can’t attack it in this way.</p><p>The first line of defense against an attack is to avoid immediately executing the agent’s action. Instead, the overseer can inspect that action and try to ensure that it isn’t intended as an attack. This leaves attacks which the overseer cannot recognize as attacks, or which do damage even when the overseer looks at them.</p><p>If the techniques from the previous sections actually allow the overseer to evaluate the agent’s actions, then they can also probably allow the overseer can detect attacks. Security during evaluation itself is an additional question though.</p><p>The main cause for hope is if the overseer can (1) be smarter than the agent which is trying to attack it, and (2) have access to some information about the agent’s thought process. Hopefully (2) allows the overseer to overcome the disadvantage of the “<a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/how_changing_te.html\">position of the interior</a>” — if the agent picks a particular attack vector, the overseer can “watch them thinking” and then devote its energies to trying to detect or defend against that particular attack.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This post originally appeared <a href=\"http://seekingquestions.blogspot.com/2017/10/from-personal-to-prison-gangs-enforcing.html\">here</a>; I&apos;ve updated it slightly and posted it here as a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kddyK3rrHxpJFyJjo/the-relationship-between-hierarchy-and-wealth\">this post</a>.</em></p><p>David Friedman has a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Legal-Systems-Very-Different-Ours-ebook/dp/B07MTPZVX9/\">fascinating book</a> on alternative legal systems. One chapter focuses on prison law - not the nominal rules, but the rules enforced by prisoners themselves.</p><p>The unofficial legal system of California prisoners is particularly interesting because it underwent a phase change sometime after the 1960&#x2019;s.</p><p>Prior to the 1960&#x2019;s, prisoners ran on a decentralized code of conduct - various unwritten rules roughly amounting to &#x201C;mind your own business and don&#x2019;t cheat anyone&#x201D;. Prisoners who kept to the code were afforded some respect by their fellow inmates. Prisoners who violated the code were ostracized, making them fair game for the more predatory inmates. There was no formal enforcement; the code was essentially a reputation system.</p><p>Sometime after the 1960&#x2019;s, that changed. During the code era, California&#x2019;s total prison population was only about 5000, with about 1000 inmates in a typical prison. That&#x2019;s quite a bit more than <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number\">Dunbar&#x2019;s number</a></u>, but still low enough for a reputation system to work through second-order connections. By 1970, California&#x2019;s prison population had ballooned past 25000; today it is over 170000. The number of prisons also grew, but not nearly as quickly as the population, and today&#x2019;s prisoners frequently move across prisons anyway. In short, a decentralized reputation system became untenable. There were too many other inmates to keep track of.</p><p>As the reputation system collapsed, a new legal institution grew to fill the void: prison gangs. Under the gang system, each inmate is expected to affiliate with a gang (though most are not formal gang members). The gang will explain the rules, often in written form, and enforce them on their own affiliates. When conflict arises between affiliates of different gangs, the gang leaders negotiate settlement, with gang leaders enforcing punishments on their own affiliates. (Gang leaders are strongly motivated to avoid gang-level conflicts.) Rather than needing to track reputation of everyone individually, inmates need only pay attention to gangs at a group level.<br>Of course, inmates need some way to tell who is affiliated with each gang - thus the rise of racial segregation in prison. During the code era, prisoners tended to associate by race and culture, but there was no overt racial hostility and no hard rules against associating across race. But today&#x2019;s prison gangs are highly racially segregated, making it easy to recognize the gang affiliation of individual inmates. They claim territory in prisons - showers or ball courts - and enforce their claims, resulting in hard racial segregation.</p><p>The change from a small, low-connection prison population to a large, high-connection population was the root cause. That change drove a transition from a decentralized, reputation-based system to prison gangs. This, in turn, involved two further transitions. First, a transition from decentralized, informal unwritten rules to formal written rules with centralized enforcement. Second, a transition from individual to group-level identity, in this case manifesting as racial segregation.</p><h2>Generalization</h2><p>This is hardly unique to prisons. The pattern is universal among human institutions. In small groups, everybody knows everybody. Rules are informal, identity is individual. But as groups grow:</p><ul><li>Rules become formal, written, and centrally enforced</li><li>Identity becomes group-based.</li></ul><p>Consider companies. I work at a ten-person company. Everyone in the office knows everyone else by name, and everyone has some idea of what everyone else is working on. We have nominal job titles, but everybody works on whatever needs doing. Our performance review process is to occasionally raise the topic in weekly one-on-one meetings.</p><p>Go to a thousand or ten thousand person company, and job titles play a much stronger role in who does what. People don&#x2019;t know everyone, so they identify others by department or role. They understand what a developer or a manager does, rather than understanding what John or Allan does. Identity becomes group-based. At the same time, hierarchy and bureaucracy are formalized.</p><p>The key parameter here is <u><a href=\"http://ncase.me/trust/\">number of interactions between each pair of people</a></u> (you should click that link, it&apos;s really cool). In small groups, each pair of people has many interactions, so people get to know each other. In large groups, there are many one-off interactions between strangers. Without past interactions to fall back on, people need other ways to figure out how to interact with each other. One solution is formal rules, which give guidance on interactions with anyone. Another solution is group-based identity - if I know how to interact with lawyers at work in general, then I don&#x2019;t need to know each individual lawyer.</p><p>In this regard, prisons and companies are just microcosms of society in general.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>At some point over the past couple hundred years, society underwent a transition similar to that of the California prison system.</p><p>In 1800, people were mostly farmers, living in small towns. The local population was within an order of magnitude of Dunbar&#x2019;s number, and generally small enough to rely on reputation for day-to-day dealings.</p><p>Today, that is not the case [citation needed].</p><p>Just as in prisons and companies, we should expect this change to drive two kinds of transitions:</p><ul><li>A transition from informal, decentralized rules to formal, written, centrally-enforced rules.</li><li>A transition from individual to group-level identity.</li></ul><p>This can explain an awful lot of the ways in which society has changed over the past couple hundred years, as well as how specific social institutions evolve over time.<br>To take just a few examples&#x2026;</p><ul><li>Regulation. As people have more one-off interactions, reputation becomes less tenable, and we should expect formal regulation to grow. Conversely, regulations are routinely ignored among people who know each other.</li><li>Litigation. Again, with more one-off interactions, we should expect people to rely more on formal litigation and less on informal settlement. Conversely, people who interact frequently rarely sue each other - and when they do, it&#x2019;s expected to mess up the relationship.</li><li>Professional licensing. Without reputation, people need some way to signal that they are safe to hire. We should expect licensing to increase as pairwise interactions decrease.</li><li>Credentialism. This is just a generalization of licensing. As reputation fails, we should expect people to rely more heavily on formal credentials - &#x201C;you are your degree&#x201D; and so forth.</li><li>Stereotyping. Without past interactions with a particular person, we should expect people to generalize based on superficially &#x201C;similar&#x201D; people. This could be anything from the usual culprits (race, ethnicity, age) to job roles (actuaries, lawyers) to consumption signals (iphone, converse, fancy suit).</li><li><u><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gt/a_fable_of_science_and_politics/\">Tribalism</a></u>. From nationalism to sports fans to identity politics, an increasing prevalence of group-level identity means an increasing prevalence of tribal behavior. In particular, I&apos;d expect that social media outlets with more one-off or low-count interactions are characterized by more extreme tribalism.</li><li>Standards for impersonal interactions. &#x201C;Professionalism&#x201D; at work is a good example.</li></ul><p>I&#x2019;ve focused mostly on negative examples here, but it&#x2019;s not all bad - even some of these examples have upsides. When California&#x2019;s prisons moved from an informal code to prison gangs, the homicide rate dropped like a rock; the gangs hate prison lockdowns, so they go to great lengths to prevent homicides. Of course, gangs have lots of downsides too. The point which generalizes is this: bodies with centralized power have their own incentives, and outcomes will be &#x201C;good&#x201D; to exactly the extent that the incentives of the centralized power align with everybody else&#x2019; incentives and desires.</p><p>Consider credentialism, for example. It&#x2019;s not all bad - to the extent that we now hire based on degree rather than nepotism, it&#x2019;s probably a step up. But on the other hand, colleges themselves have <u><a href=\"https://seekingquestions.blogspot.com/2017/05/economics-of-college-cost.html\">less than ideal incentives</a></u>. Even setting aside colleges&#x2019; incentives, the whole credential system shoehorns people into one-size-fits-all solutions; a <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein\">brilliant patent clerk</a></u> would have a much more difficult time making a name in physics today than a hundred years ago.</p><h2>Takeaway</h2><p>Of course, all of these examples share one critical positive feature: they scale. That&#x2019;s the whole reason things changed in the first place - we needed systems which could scale up beyond personal relationships and reputation.</p><p>This brings us to the takeaway: what should you do if you want to change these things? Perhaps you want a society with less credentialism, regulation, stereotyping, tribalism, etc. Maybe you like some of these things but not others. Regardless, surely there&#x2019;s something somewhere on that list you&#x2019;re less than happy about.<br>The first takeaway is that these are not primarily political issues. The changes were driven by technology and economics, which created a broader social graph with fewer repeated interactions. Political action is unlikely to reverse any of these changes; the equilibrium has shifted, and any policy change would be fighting gravity. Even if employers were outlawed from making hiring decisions based on college degree, they&#x2019;d find some work-around which amounted to the same thing. Even if the entire federal register disappeared overnight, de-facto industry regulatory bodies would pop up. And so forth.</p><p>So if we want to e.g. reduce regulation, we should first focus on the underlying socioeconomic problem: fewer interactions. A world of Amazon and Walmart, where every consumer faces decisions between a million different products, is inevitably a world where consumers do not know producers very well. There&#x2019;s just too many products and companies to keep track of the reputation of each. To reduce regulation, first focus on solving that problem, scalably. Think amazon reviews - it&#x2019;s an imperfect system, but it&#x2019;s far more flexible and efficient than formal regulation, and it scales.</p><p>Now for the real problem: online reviews are literally the only example I could come up with where technology offers a way to scale-up reputation-based systems, and maybe someday roll back centralized control structures or group identities. How can we solve these sorts of problems more generally? Please comment if you have ideas.</p>",

In the paper introducing <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf\">Functional Decision Theory</a>, it is noted that it is impossible to design an algorithm that can perform well on all decision problems since some of them can be specified to be blatantly unfair, ie. punish every agent that isn&#x27;t an alphabetical decision theorist.</p><p>The question then arises, how do we define which problems are or are not fair? We start by noting that some people consider Newcomb&#x27;s-like problems to be unfair since your outcome depends on a predictor&#x27;s prediction, which is rooted in an analysis of your algorithm. So what makes this case any different from only rewarding the alphabetical decision theorist?</p><p>The paper answers that the prediction only depends on the decision you end up making and that any other internal details are ignored. So it only cares about your decision and not how you come to it, the problem seems fair. I&#x27;m inclined to agree with this reasoning, but a similar line of reasoning doesn&#x27;t seem to hold with Agent Simulates Predictor. Here the algorithm you use is relevant as the predictor can only predict the agent if it&#x27;s algorithm is less than a certain level of complexity, otherwise it may make a mistake.</p><p>Please note that this question isn&#x27;t about whether this problem is worth considering; life is often unfair and we have to deal with it the best that we can.

    "htmlBody": "<p>The last few posts have motivated an analysis of the human-AI system rather than an AI system in isolation. So far we’ve looked at the notion that the AI system should <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/4783ufKpx8xvLMPc6\">get feedback from the user</a> and that it could use <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/ZiLLxaLB5CCofrzPp\">reward uncertainty</a> for corrigibility. These are focused on the AI system, but what about the human? If we build a system that explicitly solicits feedback from the human, what do we have to say about the human policy, and how the human should provide feedback?</p><h2>Interpreting human actions</h2><p>One major free variable in any explicit interaction or feedback mechanism is what semantics the AI system should attach to the human feedback. The classic examples of AI risk are usually described in a way where this is the problem: when we provide a reward function that rewards paperclips, the AI system interprets it literally and maximizes paperclips, rather than interpreting it pragmatically as another human would.</p><p>(Aside: I suspect this was not the original point of the paperclip maximizer, but it has become a very popular retelling, so I’m using it anyway.)</p><p>Modeling this classic example as a human-AI system, we can see that the problem is that the human is offering a form of “feedback”, the reward function, and the AI system is not ascribing the correct semantics to it. The way it uses the reward function implies that the reward function encodes the <em>optimal behavior</em> of the AI system in <em>all possible environments</em> -- a moment’s thought is sufficient to see that this is not actually the case. There will definitely be many cases and environments that the human did not consider when designing the reward function, and we should not expect that the reward function incentivizes the right behavior in those cases.</p><p>So what can the AI system assume if the human provides it a reward function? <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02827\">Inverse Reward Design</a> (IRD) offers one answer: the human is likely to provide a particular reward function if it leads to high <em>true</em> utility behavior in the training environment. So, in the <a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/faulty-reward-functions/\">boat race example</a>, if we are given the reward “maximize score” on a training environment where this actually leads to winning the race, then “maximize score” and “win the race” are about equally likely reward functions, since they would both lead to the same behavior in the training environment. Once the AI system is deployed on the environment in the blog post, it would notice that the two likely reward functions incentivize very different behavior. At that point, it could get more feedback from humans, or it could do something that is good according to both reward functions. The paper takes the latter approach, using risk-averse planning to optimize the worst-case behavior.</p><p>Similarly, with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), or learning from preferences, we need to make some sort of assumption about the semantics of the human demonstrations or preferences. A typical assumption is Boltzmann rationality: the human is assumed to take better actions with higher probability. This effectively models all human biases and suboptimalities as noise. There are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05832\">papers</a> <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/nips-workshop-2015-website.pdf\">that</a> <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkgqCiRqKQ\">account</a> <a href=\"http://rss2017.lids.mit.edu/static/papers/62.pdf\">for</a> <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/01c4/ff067657dbebe80aea9d3e4be666b42eea27.pdf\">biases</a> rather than modeling them as noise. A major argument against the feasibility of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN\">ambitious value learning</a> is that any assumption we make will be <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/cnC2RMWEGiGpJv8go\">misspecified</a>, and so we cannot infer the “one true utility function”. However, it seems plausible that we could have an assumption that would allow us to learn some values (at least to the level that humans are able to).</p><h2>The human policy</h2><p>Another important aspect is how the human actually computes feedback. We could imagine training human overseers to provide feedback in the manner that the AI system expects. Currently we “train” AI researchers to provide reward functions that incentivize the right behavior in the AI systems. With IRD, we only need the human to extensively test their reward function in the training environment and make sure the resulting behavior is near optimal, without worrying too much about generalization to other environments. With IRL, the human needs to provide demonstrations that are optimal. And so on.</p><p>(Aside: This is very reminiscent of human-computer interaction, and indeed I think a useful frame is to view this as the problem of giving humans better, easier-to-use tools to control the behavior of the AI system. We started with direct programming, then improved upon that to reward functions, and are now trying to improve to comparisons, rankings, and demonstrations.)</p><p>We might also want to train humans to give more careful answers than they would have otherwise. For example, it seems really good if our AI systems learn to preserve option value in the face of uncertainty. We might want our overseers to think deeply about potential consequences, be risk-averse in their decision-making, and preserve option value with their choices, so that the AI system learns to do the same. (The details depend strongly on the particular narrow value learning algorithm -- the best human policy for IRL will be very different from the best human policy for CIRL.) We might hope that this requirement only lasts for a short amount of time, after which our AI systems have learnt the relevant concepts sufficiently well that we can be a bit more lax in our feedback.</p><h2>Learning human reasoning</h2><p>So far I’ve been analyzing AI systems where the feedback is given explicitly, and there is a dedicated algorithm for handling the feedback. Does the analysis also apply to systems which get feedback implicitly, like <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd\">iterated amplification</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/debate/\">debate</a>?</p><p>Well, certainly these methods <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/4783ufKpx8xvLMPc6\">will need to get feedback</a> somehow, but they may not face the problem of ascribing semantics to the feedback, since they may have learned the semantics implicitly. For example, a sufficiently powerful imitation learning algorithm will be able to do narrow value learning simply because humans are capable of narrow value learning, even though it has no explicit assumption of semantics of the feedback. Instead, it has internalized the semantics that we humans give to other humans’ speech.</p><p>Similarly, both iterated amplification and debate inherit the semantics from humans by learning how humans reason. So they do not have the problems listed above. Nevertheless, it probably still is valuable to train humans to be good overseers for other reasons. For example, in debate, the human judges are supposed to say which AI system provided the most true and useful information. It is crucial that the humans judge by this criterion, in order to provide the right incentives for the AI systems in the debate.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>If we reify the interaction between the human and the AI system, then the AI system must make some assumption about the meaning of the human’s feedback. The human should also make sure to provide feedback that will be interpreted correctly by the AI system.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Epistemic Status</strong>: Innovation research and business research is notoriously low quality, and so all the ideas here should be viewed through that lense. What's impressive about the S-curve and evolution trends literature is how remarkably self-consistent it is using a wide variety of research methods. Whether Simon Wardley analyzing news article about different technologies, Clayton Christensen doing case studies of a specific industry, or Carlotta-Perez taking a historical approach of tracking different technologies, the same S-curve pattern and evolution trends seem to show up. This too should be taken into account when evaluating these ideas.</p><h1>Basics</h1><p>This is an S-curve.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://phraseit.net/image/rendered/xqvaba.jpg\"></figure><p>The S-curve is a fundamental pattern that exists in many systems that have positive feedback loops and constraints.

This isn't necessarily wrong but it can confuse their thinking. They forget that constraints exist and think that there will be exponential growth forever. When slowdowns happen, they think that it's the end of the growth - instead of considering that it may simply be another constraint and the start of another S-Curve. Knowledge of overlapping S-Curves can help you model these situations in a more sophisticated way.</p><h1>Diffusion S-Curves</h1><p>The S-curve pattern is quite common in the spread of ideas, practices, and technologies, although it rarely looks quite as pretty. The example below shows \"diffusion s-curves\" - How a technology spreads through a population (in this case US households</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.learningslowly.co/uploads/3/4/9/6/3496353/screen-shot-2017-08-24-at-09-22-40-1_orig.png\"></figure><p>The positive feedback loop in this case is word of mouth, and the constraints represent fundamental barriers to certain market segments or growth such as simplicity, usability, scalability, price, etc.</p><p>This creates smaller s-curves around adoption among specific market segments, and larger s-curves that represent the overall market penetration of the idea, practice, or technology.</p><p><i>Recommended Resource: </i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations\"><i>Wikipedia on Diffusion of Innovation</i></a></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AFqnvpjZFRs/VfglYCwyjPI/AAAAAAAAJCg/pfh7ukK9HMo/s400/applicable.png\"></figure><h1>Evolution S-Curves</h1><p>In addition to Diffusion S-curves in technology, ideas, and practices, there are Evolution S-Curves. These represent the increase in the traits of these ideas that make them usable in more situations and desirable for more people. When you break through a constraint in one of these properties through innovation, this can often coincide with \"unlocking\" a new diffusion curve by opening up a new market that wouldn't previously have used your technology or idea.</p><p>In this case the positive feedback loop is the increased understanding and expertise that comes from diffusion of a new innovation in your idea or technology, and the constraint represents fundamental assumptions in the idea, practice, or technology that must be changed through another innovation to make the idea, practice, or technology more desirable.</p><p>In the example below the desirable property is hardware speed. Fundamental leaps are made to break through a speed constraint, and then iterated on through the positive feedback loop of information and expertise increasing from adoption. This hits diminishing returns as the new innovation is optimized, and then a new fundamental innovation is needed to overcome the next constraint.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://www.dba-oracle.com/oracle10g_tuning/t_moores_law_files/image002.gif\"></figure><p><i>Recommended Resource: </i><a href=\"https://www.open.edu/openlearn/nature-environment/organisations-environmental-management-and-innovation/content-section-1.7#:~:text=The%20S%2Dcurve%20shows%20the,item%20or%20organisation%20using%20it.\"><i>Open University on Evolution S-Curves</i></a></p><p><strong>Common Mistake: Confusing Diffusion S-Curves with Evolution S-Curves</strong></p><p>Sometimes, I see people make the mistake of assuming that evolution and diffusion s-curves follow the same cycle. Most often, the mistake made here is assuming that when a particular innovation has saturated a certain market, that also means it has \"reached its final form\" and has no more evolving to do.</p><p>There is a related truth - often, an innovation becoming more diffuse will drive innovation as new use cases become apparent. And vice versa, often new innovations will open a new market up by creating use cases that were previously impossible.</p><p>However, the two types of curves are driven by two different feedback loops and two different constraints. There's no reason to expect that they will follow each other, and no reason to expect that one curve leveling off will cause the other curve to level off.</p><h1>S-Curves Patterns</h1><p>S-curves become quite useful when paired with an understanding of evolutionary patterns. They can allow you to see in a broad sense what's coming next for an idea, practice or technology. They can prevent surprises and give you a tool to stay ahead of changes.</p><p>There are patterns that exist for both diffusion and evolution S-curves.</p><h2>Diffusion Patterns</h2><p>Diffusion patterns describe common themes that happen as trends diffuse through a population. They apply on the micro-level to individual population-segments, and on a macro-level to the overall population.</p><p><strong>Diffusion of Innovation</strong></p><p>The diffusion of innovation describes 5 separate stages of a diffusion curve: Innovators, Early Adopters ,Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. By understanding the traits of each of these groups, you can get a broad idea of what to expect, and how to slow or speed up adoption.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Diffusion_of_ideas.svg/330px-Diffusion_of_ideas.svg.png\"></figure><p><i>Recommended Resource: </i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Diffusion-Innovations-5th-Everett-Rogers/dp/0743222091\"><i>Diffusion of Innovations book by Everett Rogers</i></a></p><p><strong>The Chasm</strong></p><p>The Chasm describes a common constraint that occurs in a market segment between \"early adopters\" - who are willing to put up with a lot, and \"early majority\", who expect a lot. There is often a number of evolutionary constraints that must be broken through to bridge this single diffusion constraint and many new ideas, practices, and technologies get stuck in the chasm for that reason.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chasm-Curve-01-768x587.png\"></figure><p><i>Recommended Resource: </i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-3rd-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0062292986/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=crossing+the+chasm&amp;qid=1610411704&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\"><i>Crossing the Chasm book by Geoffrey Moore</i></a></p><p><strong>Common Mistake: Assuming a Technology is Irrelevant Because it's Only Useful for a Small Group</strong></p><p>A common mistake that I see is assuming a technology won't have a broader relevance, and using as evidence that it's only used by a small group of relatively abnormal people.</p><p>Now, what is true is that not all technologies eventually get adopted by everybody, some stay relatively niche. But it's not very good Bayesian evidence to say that because a technology is used by a small group of weird people, it will not have a broader impact. These diffusion patterns tell us that in fact that MOST technologies that eventually get widespread adoption go through this phase.</p><p>Furthermore, they tell us that many of those technologies often get stuck for a while at this early stage because of the Chasm. So even if a technology has staid at this tage for a while (e.g. cryptocurrency), it's still very little evidence towards that technology not being lifechanging in the future. (In contrast, a technology stalling for a long time at some point past the chasm is better evidence that it may have reached saturation)</p><h2>Evolution Patterns</h2><p>Evolution patterns describe common ways that innovations evolve over time to become increasingly desirable. They apply on the micro-level to individual innovations within a trend, and on a macro-level to the evolution of trend as a whole.</p><p><strong>Wardley Evolution</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NiS6rC8DPRY/VPsSCzAmddI/AAAAAAAAHCY/2fzWKTL1Nwc/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-01-09%2Bat%2B13.26.48.png\"></figure><p>Innovations tend to go through four stages - the initial prototype, custom built versions, productized versions that compete, than comoditized versions that are all basically the same.

Oftentimes, what's actually happened is that it's near the midpoint of it's innovation curve, and the next innovations will be around compressing/simplifying all the things that have been added. This simplification process then allows the innovation to be used a component to build further innovations off of, as it's simple enough to be commoditized.</p><p><strong>Disruptive Innovation</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/encyclopedia/disruptive_innovation/fig_1_the_disruptive_innovation_model.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>Sometimes, innovations overshoot the mainstream populations needs on a particular dimension in order to be powerful for a particularly lucrative part of the population.

At the moment, I'm focused on finding the best explanation to get my ideas through to you, the reader; I'm not focused on my moral preferences, personal safety desires, political beliefs, or taste in music.</p>\n<p>If anyone asked me about those, I could immediately bring them to mind. My answers to standard questions are kinda in the background, accessible but not accessed.

And only by giving them the inputs they were trained on (eg words, sentences,...) can you bring that knowledge to the fore.</p>\n<p>In this post, I'll try and formalise these accessible preferences, starting with formalising preferences in general.</p>\n<h2>Basic preferences setup</h2>\n<p>This section will formalise the setup presented in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rcXaY3FgoobMkH2jc/figuring-out-what-alice-wants-part-ii\">Alice's example</a>.

Different phrasings may trigger different internal models of the same issue, or even different judgements within the same model. And, of course, the same intervention at different times (or by different agents) may trigger different reactions.</p>\n<p>But dealing with contradictions is just <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately\">one of the things</a> that we have to sort out with human preferences.</p>\n<h2>Minimum modification</h2>\n<p>I mentioned the interventions should be short; that <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"T\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.12em;\">T</span></span></span></span></span></span> should be a short period; and that the interventions in <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal{H}_t^T\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">H</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-stack\" style=\"vertical-align: -0.247em;\"><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; padding-bottom: 0.289em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.12em;\">T</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> should be the first in that time period. The whole idea is to avoid \"modifying\" the human too much, or giving the AI too much power to change, rather than reflect, the human's values. The human's reaction should be as close as possible to an unvarnished initial reaction.</p>\n<p>There may be <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/upLot6eG8cbXdKiFS/reward-function-learning-the-learning-process\">other ways of reducing the AI's influence</a>, but it is still useful to get these initial reactions.</p>\n<h2>One-step hypotheticals</h2>\n<p>In slight contrast with the previous section, it is very valuable to get the human to reflect on new issues they hadn't considered before. For example, we could introduce them to philosophical thought experiments they hadn't seen before (maybe the trolley problem or the repugnant conclusion, or unusual variants of these), or present ideas that cross across their usual political boundaries, or the boundaries of their categories (eg whether Neanderthals should have human rights if a tribe of them were suddenly discovered today).</p>\n<p>This is, in a sense, a <em>minimum</em> extrapolation, the very first tentative step of <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition\">CEV</a>. We are not asking what the human would think if they were smarter, but instead what they would think if they encountered a novel problem for the first time.</p>\n<p>These \"one-step hypotheticals\" are thus different from the human's everyday current judgement, yet don't involve transforming the human into something else.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Avturchin <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i6hWWcKyxBPj7ELT6/one-step-hypothetical-preferences#WYTp8TnrHQXjwDd9g\">asks</a> whether I expect these one-step hypotheticals to reveal hidden preferences, or to force humans to make a choice, knowing that they might have made a different choice in different circumstances.</p>\n<p>The answer is... a bit of both. I expect the hypotheticals to sometimes contradict each other, depending on the phrasing and the timing. I expect them to contradict each other more than more usual questions (\"zero-step hypotheticals\") do.</p>\n<p>But I don't expect the answers to be completely random, either. There will be a lot of information there.

There will be a big screen, where we can exchange and share presentations of thoughts related. </p><p>Fragments of the meetup content will later be shared on <a href=\"https://safe-ai.org\">https://safe-ai.org</a>.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><strong>Where</strong>: China, Shanghai, Putuo, 富丽大厦 (Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/Tedko\">@Tedko</a> for the venue!)<br/><strong>When</strong>: 2019-02-06 14:00~21:00 (UTC+08).</p><p>The reason for long period from midday to evening, is because it is a kind of exploratory post.

The number of such people is growing exponentially, from the 1980s until now and will continue to grow. Thus, I am currently located only 1-2 doublings before the end of this class of people, and such “end” could be best explained by a global catastrophe.”</em></p><p>I expected that the doubling time of the number of people who know about DA is around 5-10 years, and thus the end will happen around 2030, which is in accordance with my estimations of dangerous AI timing and some other predictions. </p><p><em>Data</em></p><p>To check the hypothesis, I went on Google Trends to check the number of times the words “Doomsday argument” is searched. What I found surprised me: the number of searchers is actually <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F02rjzp\">declining</a>: </p><p>The data is noisy, but it looks like the number of searchers declines from the average of 16 a month in 2008 to 7 in 2017. </p><p>Wikipedia views <a href=\"https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&start=2015-07&end=2018-12&pages=Doomsday_argument\">data</a> even from 2015 (no early data available) also shows a decline around 2 times between 2015 and 2018. </p><p>Google Scholar analysis is less clear (obviously not exponential growth of the number of articles, but steady growth of mentions which means more scientists know DA):</p><p>Google Scholar articles about DA, in the period of </p><p>1989-1994: 14 articles (hand counted), 30 mentions of DA.</p><p>1995-2000: 15 articles, 50 mentions</p><p>2001-2006: 24 articles, 100 mentions</p><p>2007-2012: 18 articles, 140 mentions</p><p>2013-2018: 20 articles, 160 mentions</p><p>It shows that the peak of interest to DA by scientists was around 2000, which should not be surprising, as at the time the idea was relatively new. The growth of mentions could be explained by large “historical introductions” in other articles. However, the number of DA-related articles is now growing again.</p><p><em>Analysis </em></p><p>When I first got the data of the declining interest to DA, I suggest that this could explain the DA: </p><p><em>Hypothesis 2: If there will be no more scientists who are interested in DA, the reference class of those who know about DA will end without end of the world.</em></p><p>However, a closer examination of the Google Scholar data doesn’t support this second hypothesis either: there is a steady influx of new scientists who try to refute or reanalyze the DA. Moreover, the growth of “mentions” shows that the number of scientists who know about DA is growing, but it is growing not exponentially, but more like logarithmically. </p><p>Internet access and general growth of the population, as well as public interest in science, could fuel the growth of the number of those who know about DA. On the other hand, lower number of Google searchers means that public interest to the topic has declined, maybe as there are less mainstream media publications which could fuel such interest or doomsday media paranoia, like in 2012, which could easily be observed as a spike of searchers around 2012.</p><p>The data could be explained if we suggest that fewer members of the public but more scientists now know about DA – and the question is interesting not from a sociological perspective, but in order to understand how the reference class of DA-aware observers is changing.</p><p>It seems that the correct reference class will be the scientists, not public, like the fact that I am writing this post (and had long, detailed interest to DA before) makes me closer to the scientists’ reference class. </p><p>For scientists, we have two sub-classes: those who know about DA, and those who try to make new contributions by writing articles. The difference is that one is growing and the other is not. </p><p><em>Conclusion</em></p><p>Both hypotheses are false: the hypothesis that the interest to DA is exponentially growing, and the one that the number of those who understand DA is exponentially declining: so, there is no end-very-soon, nor DA’s easy refutation. </p><p>However, using the reference class of those who know about DA still implies that the end is likely in 21 century. There are currently around 100 scientific articles about DA, and with 50 per cent probability (according to the Gott’s version of DA) there will be no more than total of 200 (which at current speed will happen in around 30 years, or 2049) and with 95 per cent – no more than 1000 articles (which will happen at current speed of publishing at 270 years). But such an end could mean not a global catastrophe but complete loss of interest in DA.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>A <em>catastrophe</em> is an event so bad that we are not willing to let it happen even a single time. For example, we would be unhappy if our self-driving car <em>ever </em>accelerates to 65 mph in a residential area and hits a pedestrian.</p><p>Catastrophes present a theoretical challenge for traditional machine learning — typically there is no way to reliably avoid catastrophic behavior without strong statistical assumptions.</p><p>In this post, I’ll lay out a very general model for catastrophes in which they are avoidable under much weaker statistical assumptions<em>.</em> I think this framework applies to the most important kinds of catastrophe, and will be especially relevant to AI alignment.</p><p>Designing practical algorithms that work in this model is an open problem. In a <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99\">subsequent post</a> I describe what I currently see as the most promising angles of attack.</p><h2>Modeling catastrophes</h2><p>We consider an agent A interacting with the environment over a sequence of episodes. Each episode produces a transcript τ, consisting of the agent’s observations and actions, along with a reward <em>r</em> ∈ [0, 1]. Our primary goal is to quickly learn an agent which receives high reward. (Supervised learning is the special case where each transcripts consist of a single input and a label for that input.)</p><p>While training, we assume that we have an oracle which can determine whether a transcript τ is “catastrophic.” For example, we might show a transcript to a QA analyst and ask them if it looks catastrophic. This oracle can be applied to arbitrary sequences of observations and actions, including those that don’t arise from an actual episode<em>.</em> So training can begin before the very first interaction with nature, using only calls to the oracle.</p><p>Intuitively, a transcript should only be marked catastrophic if it satisfies two conditions:</p><ol><li>The agent made a catastrophically bad decision.</li><li>The agent’s observations are plausible: we have a right to expect the agent to be able to handle those observations.</li></ol><p>While actually interacting with the environment, the agent cannot query the oracle — there is no time to wait for a QA engineer to review a proposed action to check if it would be catastrophic.</p><p>Moreover, if interaction with nature ever produces a catastrophic transcript, we immediately fail. The performance of an algorithm is characterized by two parameters: the probability of catastrophic failure, and the total reward assuming no catastrophic failure.</p><p>We assume that there are some policies such that no matter what nature does, the resulting transcript is <em>never</em> catastrophic.</p><p>Traditionally in RL the goal is to get as much reward as the best policy from some class C. We’ slightly weaken that goal, and instead aim to do as well as the best policy from C that never makes a catastrophic decision.</p><h2>Batch learning</h2><p>I’ve described an online version of learning with catastrophes. We can also consider the batch version, where the learner is first given a large number of “training” episodes.</p><p>In the batch version, there is no penalty for catastrophes at training time, and we don’t care about training error. The two performance parameters are test-time performance and test-time catastrophe probability.</p><h2>The oracle</h2><p>This definition depends on an oracle who determines which transcripts are catastrophic.</p><p>For weak AI systems, the oracle may be a human. But a powerful AI system might take actions which are catastrophic but which look inoffensive to a human judge, so this approach doesn’t cut it.</p><p>In general, the judge should be a human+AI team which is <em>more</em> competent than the system being trained, armed with an adequate solution to the <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/the-informed-oversight-problem-1b51b4f66b35\">informed oversight problem</a>.</p><h1>Approach</h1><p>Learning with catastrophes is straightforward <em>given an unlimited number of queries to the catastrophe oracle</em>. Given any online learning algorithm A, we can “harden” it by running the following process before the beginning of each episode (a similar process can be applied to a batch learner):</p><ol><li>Search over all possible environments, running A on each one to obtain a transcript.</li><li>If we find a catastrophic transcript τ, then add τ to A’s training data with a reward of −1, and go back to step 1.</li></ol><p>It’s easy to prove that this process converges, if A is competent: the number of times we invoke step 2 is at most the time required to learn an optimal catastrophe-free policy (plus the number of episodes).</p><p>The big problem with this algorithm is the exponential search in step 1.</p><h2>Adversarial training</h2><p>The most obvious approach to <em>tractable</em> learning with catastrophes is to replace step 1 with a tractable algorithm that approximates the search. This process is an example of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572\">adversarial training</a>.</p><p>We can formalize this as a simple game between the agent A and an adversary B. The two agents alternate taking moves, with A playing the role of the agent and B playing the role of the environment. B wins if the resulting transcript is catastrophic, A wins if it is not catastrophic.</p><p>Before each episode, we play this game N times, where N &gt; 0 is a hyperparameter. If B is able to win <em>any</em> of the games, then we add the resulting transcript to A’s training data and start again. Once B is not able to win any games, then we move on to a “real” episode. We hope that B is good enough at the game that if it can’t produce a catastrophic transcript, then the real environment can’t produce a catastrophic transcript either.</p><p>More precisely, before each episode we perform the following process:</p><ol><li>Set <em>i</em> = 0.</li><li>A and B alternate taking moves, producing a transcript τ.</li><li>If τ is catastrophic, we add τ to A’s training data with a reward of −1, and add τ to B’s training data with a reward of +1. Then we go back to step 1.</li><li>If τ is not catastrophic, we add τ to B’s training data with a reward of −1.</li><li>If <em>i</em> &lt; N, we increment <em>i</em> and go back to step 2.</li></ol><p>I discuss this idea in more detail in my <a href=\"https://medium.com/@paulfchristiano/b5b6de33dc76\">post on red teams</a>. There are serious problems with this approach and I don’t think it can work on its own, but fortunately it seems combinable with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572\">other techniques</a>.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Learning with catastrophes is a very general model of catastrophic failures which avoids being obviously impossible. I think that designing competent algorithms for learning with catastrophes may be an important ingredient in a successful approach to AI alignment.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>This was originally posted <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/learning-with-catastrophes-59387b55cc30\">here</a> on 28th May, 2016.</em></p><p><em>Tomorrow&#x27;s AI Alignment sequences post will be in the sequence on Value Learning by Rohin Shah.</em></p><p><em>The next post in this sequence will be &#x27;Thoughts on Reward Engineering&#x27; by Paul Christiano, on Thursday.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Epistemic Status: Tentative</em></p>\n<p>I’m fairly anti-hierarchical, as things go, but the big challenge to all anti-hierarchical ideologies is “how feasible is this in real life? We don’t see many examples around us of this working well.”</p>\n<p>Backing up, for a second, what do we mean by a hierarchy?</p>\n<p>I take it to mean a very simple thing: hierarchies are systems of social organization where some people tell others what to do, and the subordinates are forced to obey the superiors.  This usually goes along with special privileges or luxuries that are only available to the superiors.  For instance, patriarchy is a hierarchy in which wives and children must obey fathers, and male heads of families get special privileges.</p>\n<p>Hierarchy is a matter of degree, of course. Power can vary in the severity of its enforcement penalties (a government can jail you or execute you, an employer can fire you, a religion can excommunicate you, the popular kids in a high school can bully or ostracize you), in its extent (a totalitarian government claims authority over more aspects of your life than a liberal one), or its scale (an emperor rules over more people than a clan chieftain.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distance\">Power distance</a> is a concept from the business world that attempts to measure the level of hierarchy within an organization or culture.  Power distance is measured by polling less-powerful individuals on how much they “accept and expect that power is distributed unequally”.  In low power distance cultures, there’s more of an “open door” policy, subordinates can talk freely with managers, and there are few formal symbols of status differentiating managers from subordinates.  In “high power distance” cultures, there’s more formality, and subordinates are expected to be more deferential.  According to<a href=\"http://clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede-cultural-dimensions/power-distance-index/\"> Geert Hofstede</a>, the inventor of the power distance index (PDI), Israel and the Nordic countries have the lowest power distance index in the world, while Arab, Southeast Asian, and Latin American countries have the highest.  (The US is in the middle.)</p>\n<p>I share with many other people a rough intuition that hierarchy poses problems.</p>\n<p>This may not be as obvious as it sounds.  In high power distance cultures, empirically, subordinates <em>accept and approve </em>of hierarchy.  So maybe hierarchy is just fine, even for the “losers” at the bottom?  But there’s a theory that subordinates claim to approve of hierarchy as a <a href=\"https://samzdat.com/2017/11/20/banish-plump-mouse-deer-and-banish-all-the-world/\">covert way of getting what power they can.   </a>In other words, when you see peasants praising the benevolence of landowners, it’s not that they’re misled by the governing ideology, and not that they’re magically immune to suffering from poverty as we would in their place, but just that they see their situation as the best they can get, and a combination of flattery and (usually religious) guilt-tripping is their best chance for getting resources from the landowners.  So, no, I don’t think you can assume that hierarchy is wholly harmless just because it’s widely accepted in some societies. Being powerless is<em> </em>probably bad, physiologically and psychologically, for <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/patriarchy-is-the-problem/\">all social mammals.</a></p>\n<p>But to what extent is hierarchy necessary?</p>\n<p><strong>Structurelessness and Structures</strong></p>\n<p>Nominally non-hierarchical organizations often suffer from failure modes that keep them from getting anything done, and actually wind up quite hierarchical in practice. I don’t endorse everything in Jo Freeman’s famous essay on the <a href=\"https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm\">Tyranny of Structurelessness</a>, but it’s important as an account of actual experiences in the women’s movement of the 1970s.</p>\n<p>When organizations have no formal procedures or appointed leaders, everything goes through informal networks; this devolves into popularity contests, privileges people who have more free time to spend on gossip, as well as people who are more privileged in other ways (including economically), and completely fails to correlate decision-making power with competence.</p>\n<p>Freeman’s preferred solution is to give up on total structurelessness and accept that there will be positions of power in feminist organizations, but to make those positions of power legible and limited, with methods derived from republican governance (which are also traditional in American voluntary organizations.)  Positions of authority should be limited in scope (there is a finite range of things an executive director is empowered to do), accountable to the rest of the organization (through means like voting and annual reports), and impeachable in cases of serious ethical violation or incompetence. This is basically the governance structure that nonprofits and corporations use, and (in my view) it helps make them, say, less likely to abuse their members than cults and less likely to break up over personal drama than rock bands.</p>\n<p>Freeman, being more egalitarian than the republican tradition, also goes further with her recommendations and says that responsibilities should be rotated (so no one person has “ownership” over a job forever), that authority should be distributed widely rather than concentrated, that information should be diffused widely, and that everyone in the organization should have equal access to organizational resources.  Now, this is a good deal <i>less </i>hierarchical than the structure of republican governments, nonprofits, and corporations; it is <em>still pretty utopian </em>from the point of view of someone used to those forms of governance, and I find myself wondering if it can work at scale; but it’s still a concession to hierarchy relative to the “natural” structurelessness that feminist organizations originally envisioned.</p>\n<p>Freeman says there is one context in which a structureless organization can work; a <em>very </em>small team (no more than five) of people who come from very similar backgrounds (so they can communicate easily), spend so much time together that they practically live together (so they communicate constantly), and are all capable of doing all “jobs” on the project (no need for formal division of labor.)  In other words, she’s describing an early-stage startup!</p>\n<p>I suspect Jo Freeman’s model explains a lot about the common phenomenon of startups having “growing pains” when they get too large to work informally.  I also suspect that this is a part of how startups stop being “mission-driven” and ambitious — if they don’t add structure until they’re forced to by an outside emergency, they have to hurry, and they adopt a standard corporate structure and power dynamics (including the <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2019/01/10/book-recommendations-an-everyone-culture-and-moral-mazes/\">toxic ones,</a> which are automatically imported when they hire a bunch of people from a toxic business culture all at once) instead of having time to evolve something that might achieve the founders’ goals better.</p>\n<p><strong>But Can It Scale? Historical Stateless Societies</strong></p>\n<p>So, the five-person team of friends is a non-hierarchical organization that can work.  But that’s not very satisfying for anti-authoritarian advocates, because it’s so small.  And, accordingly, an organization that small is usually <em>poor</em> — there’s only so many resources that five people can produce.</p>\n<p>(Technology can amplify how much value a single person can produce. This is probably why we see more informal cultures among people who work with high-leverage technology.  Software engineers famously wear t-shirts, not suits; Air Force pilots have a reputation as “hotshots” with lax military discipline compared to other servicemembers. Empowered with software or an airplane, a single individual can be <em>unusually </em>valuable, so  less deference is expected of the operators of high technology.)</p>\n<p>When we look at historical anarchies or near-anarchies, we usually also see that they’re small, poor, or both.  We also see that within cultures, there is often surprisingly more freedom for women among the poor than among the rich.</p>\n<p>Medieval Iceland from the <a href=\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html\">tenth to thirteenth centuries</a> was a stateless society, with private courts of law, and competing legislative assemblies (Icelanders could choose which assembly and legal code to belong to), but no executive branch or police.  (In this, it was an unusually <em>pure </em>form of anarchy but not unique — other medieval European polities had much more<em> </em>private enforcement of law than we do today, and police are a 19th-century invention.)</p>\n<p>The medieval Icelandic commonwealth lasted long enough — longer than the United States — that it was clear this was a functioning system, not a brief failed experiment.  And it appears that it was less violent, not more, compared to other medieval societies.  Even when the commonwealth was beginning to break down in the thirteenth century, battles had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Commonwealth\">low casualty rates</a>, because every man still had to be paid for!  The death toll during the civil war that ended the commonwealth’s independence was only as high per capita as the <a href=\"https://www.lewrockwell.com/2002/06/roderick-t-long/the-vikings-were-libertarians/\">current murder rate of the US.</a>  While Christianization in neighboring Norway was a violent struggle, the decision of whether to convert to Christianity in Iceland was decided peacefully through arbitration.  In this case, it seems clear that anarchy brought peace, not war.</p>\n<p>However, medieval Iceland was small — only 50,000 people, confined to a harsh Arctic environment, and ethnically homogeneous.</p>\n<p>Other historical and traditional stateless societies are and were also relatively poor and low in population density. The <a href=\"https://seunfakze.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/stateless-societies-the-igbo-the-fulani-the-somali-by-prof-g-n-ayittey/\">Igbo of Nigeria </a>traditionally governed by council and consensus, with no kings or chiefs, but rather a sort of <a href=\"https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/teaching-resources-for-historians/teaching-and-learning-in-the-digital-age/through-the-lens-of-history-biafra-nigeria-the-west-and-the-world/the-colonial-and-pre-colonial-eras-in-nigeria/igbo-village-democracy\">village democracy. </a>  This actually appears to be fairly common in small polities.  The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois#Iroquois_Confederacy\">Iroquois Confederacy</a> governed by council and had no executive. (Note that the Iroquois are a <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/09/13/hoe-cultures-a-type-of-non-patriarchal-society/\">hoe culture</a>.)  The <a href=\"https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/sv/sai/SOSANT1000/h14/pensumliste/evans-pritchard_the_nuer.pdf\">Nuer of Sudan,</a> a pastoral society currently with a population of a few million, have traditionally had a stateless society with a system of feud law — they had judges, but no executives. There are many more examples — perhaps most familiar to Westerners, the society depicted in the biblical book of Judges appears to have had no king and no permanent war-leader, but only judges who would decide cases which would be privately enforced. In fact, stateless societies with some form of feud law seem to be a pretty <em>standard and recurrent</em> type of political organization, but mostly in “primitive” communities — horticultural or pastoral, low in population density.  This sounds like bad news for modern-day anarchists who don’t want to live in primitive conditions. None of these historical stateless societies, even the comparatively sophisticated Iceland, are urban cultures!</p>\n<p>It’s possible that the <a href=\"http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_10_3_04_thompson.pdf\">Harappan civilization</a> in Bronze Age India had no state, while it had cities that housed tens of thousands of people, were planned on grids, and had indoor plumbing.  The Harappans left no massive tombs, no palaces or temples, houses of highly uniform size (indicating little wealth inequality) no armor and few weapons (despite advanced metalworking), no sign of battle damage on the cities or violent death in human remains, and very minimal city walls.  The Harappan cities were commercial centers, and the Harappans engaged in trade along the coast of India and as far as Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.  Unlike other similar river-valley civilizations (such as Mesopotamia), the Harappans had so much arable land, and farmsteads so initially spread out, that populations steadily grew and facilitated long-distance trade <em>without </em>having to resort to raiding, so they never developed a warrior class.  If so, this is a counterexample to the traditional story that all civilizations developed states (usually monarchies) as a necessary precondition to developing cities and grain agriculture.</p>\n<p>Bali is another counterexample.  Rice farming in Bali requires complex coordination of irrigation. This was traditionally not organized by kings, but by <a href=\"https://horizonofreason.com/balinese-water-temples/\">subaks,</a> religious and social organizations that supervise the growing of rice, supervised by a decentralized system of water temples, and led by priests who kept a ritual calendar for timing irrigation.  While precolonial Bali was not an anarchy but a patchwork of small principalities, large public works like irrigation were <em>not </em>under state control.</p>\n<p>So we have reason to believe that Bronze Age levels of technological development (cities, metalworking, intensive agriculture, literacy, long-distance trade, and high populations) can be developed without states, at scales involving millions of people, for centuries.  We also have much more abundant evidence, historical and contemporary, of informal governance-by-council and feud law existing stably at lower technology levels (for pastoralists and horticulturalists).  And, in special political circumstances (the Icelanders left Norway to settle a barren island, to escape the power of the Norwegian king, Harald Fairhair) an anarchy can arise out of a state society.</p>\n<p>But we don’t have successful examples of anarchies at industrial tech levels. We know industrial-technology public works can be built by voluntary organizations (e.g. the railroads in the US) but we have no examples of them successfully resisting state takeover for more than a few decades.</p>\n<p>Is there something about modern levels of high technology and material abundance that is incompatible with stateless societies? Or is it just that modern nation-states happened to already be there when the Industrial Revolution came around?</p>\n<p><strong>Women’s Status and Material Abundance</strong></p>\n<p>A very weird thing is that women’s level of freedom and equality seems almost to <em>anticorrelate </em>with the wealth and technological advancement.</p>\n<p>Horticultural (or “<a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/09/13/hoe-cultures-a-type-of-non-patriarchal-society/\">hoe culture</a>“) societies are non-patriarchal and tend to allow women more freedom and better treatment in various ways than pre-industrial agricultural societies. For instance, severe mistreatment of women and girls like female infanticide, foot-binding, honor killings, or sati, and chastity-oriented restrictions on female freedom like veiling and seclusion, are common in agricultural societies and unknown in horticultural ones. But horticultural societies are poor in material culture and can’t sustain high population densities in most cases.</p>\n<p>You also see unusual freedom for women in premodern pastoral cultures, like the <a href=\"http://asianreviewofbooks.com/content/women-and-the-making-of-the-mongol-empire-by-anne-f-broadbridge/\">Mongols.</a> Women in the Mongol Empire owned and managed <em>ordos</em>, mobile cities of tents and wagons which also comprised livestock and served as trading hubs.  While the men focused on hunting and war, the women managed the economic sphere. Mongol women fought in battle, herded livestock, and occasionally ruled as queens.  They did not wear veils or bind their feet.</p>\n<p>We see numerous accounts of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_warfare\">ancient </a>and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_post-classical_warfare\">medieval</a> women warriors and military commanders among Germanic and Celtic tribes and steppe peoples of Central Asia.  There are also accounts of medieval European noblewomen who personally led armies. The pattern isn’t obvious, but there seem to be more accounts of women military leaders in pastoral societies or tribal ones than in large, settled empires.</p>\n<p>Pastoralism, to a lesser extent than horticulture but still more than plow agriculture, gives women an active role in <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6329.pdf\">food production.</a> Most pastoral societies today have a traditional division of labor in which men are responsible for meat animals and women are responsible for milk animals (as well as textiles).  Where women provide food, they tend to have more bargaining power.  Some pastoral societies, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people\">Tuareg,</a> are even matrilineal; Tuareg women traditionally have more freedom, including sexual freedom, than they do in other Muslim cultures, and <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/02/21/who-are-the-tuareg\">women do not wear the veil while men do.</a></p>\n<p>Like horticulture, pastoralism is less efficient per acre at food production than agriculture, and thus does not allow high population densities. Pastoralists are poorer than their settled farming neighbors. This is another example of women being freer when they are also poorer.</p>\n<p>Another weird and “paradoxical” but very well-replicated finding is that women are <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/07/contra-grant-on-exaggerated-differences/\">more different from men </a> in psychological and behavioral traits (like Big 5 personality traits, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/gender-differences-in-personality-are-bigger-in-egalitarian-countries/\">risk-taking, </a> <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/10/specialization-personality-choice.html\">altruism</a>, participation in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=gender-equality+paradox&amp;oq=gender-equality+paradox&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.572j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">STEM careers</a>) in richer countries than in poorer ones.  This isn’t quite the same as women being less “free” or having fewer rights, but it seems to fly in the face of the conventional notion that as societies grow richer, women become more equal to men.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>within </em>societies, it’s sometimes the case that poor women are treated better than rich ones.  Sarah Blaffer Hrdy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mother-Nature-Maternal-Instincts-Species/dp/0345408934\">writes</a> about observing that female infanticide was much more common among <em>wealthy </em>Indian Rajput families than poor ones. And we know of many examples across societies of aristocratic or upper-class women being more restricted to the domestic sphere, married off younger, less likely to work, more likely to experience restrictive practices like seclusion or footbinding, than their poorer counterparts.</p>\n<p>Hrdy explains why: in patrilinear societies, men inherit wealth and women don’t. If you’re a rich family, a son is a “safe” outcome — he’ll inherit your wealth, and your grandchildren through him will be provided for, no matter whom he marries. A daughter, on the other hand, is a risk. You’ll have to pay a dowry when she marries, and if she marries “down” her children will be poorer than you are — and at the very top of the social pyramid, there’s nowhere to marry but down.  This means that you have an incentive to avoid having daughters, and if you do have daughters, you’ll be very anxious to avoid them making a bad match, which means lots of chastity-enforcement practices. You’ll also invest more in your sons than daughters in general, because your grandchildren through your sons will have a better chance in life than your grandchildren through your daughters.</p>\n<p>The situation reverses if you’re a poor family. Your sons are pretty much screwed; they can’t marry into money (since women don’t inherit.) Your <em>daughters</em>, on the other hand, have a chance to marry up. So your grandchildren through your daughters have better chances than your grandchildren through your sons, and you should invest more resources in your sons than your daughters. Moreover, you might not be able to <em>afford </em>restrictive practices that cripple your daughters’ ability to work for a living. To some extent, sexism is a luxury good.</p>\n<p>A similar analysis might explain why richer countries have larger gender differences in personality, interests, and career choices.  A degree in art history might function as a gentler equivalent of purdah — a practice that makes a woman a more appealing spouse but reduces her earning potential. You expect to find such practices more among the rich than the poor.  (Tyler Cowen’s take is less jaundiced, and more general, but similar — personal choices and “personality” itself are more varied when people are richer, because one of the things people “buy” with wealth is the ability to make fulfilling but not strictly pragmatic self-expressive choices.)</p>\n<p>Finally, all these “paradoxical” trends are countered by the big nonparadoxical trend — by most reasonable standards, women are less oppressed in rich liberal countries than in poor illiberal ones.  The very best countries for women’s rights are also the ones with the lowest power distance:<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Inequality_Index\"> Nordic and Germanic countries.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Is Hierarchy the Engine of Growth or a Luxury Good?</strong></p>\n<p>If you observe that the “freest” (least hierarchical, lowest power distance, least authoritarian, etc) functioning organizations and societies tend to be small, poor, or primitive, you could come to two different conclusions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Freedom causes poverty</em> (in other words, non-hierarchical organization is worse than hierarchy at scaling to large organizations or rich, high-population societies)</li>\n<li><em>Hierarchy is expensive</em> (in other words, only the largest organizations or richest societies can afford the greatest degree of authoritarianism.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first possibility is bad news for freedom. It means you should worry you can’t scale up to wealth for large populations without implementing hierarchies.  The usual mechanism proposed for this is the hypothesis that hierarchies are needed to coordinate large numbers of people in large projects.  Without governments, how would you build public works? Or guard the seas for global travel and shipping? Without corporate hierarchies, how would you get mass-produced products to billions of people?  Sure, idealists have proposed alternatives to hierarchy, but these tend to be speculative or small-scale and the success stories are sporadic.</p>\n<p>The second possibility is (tentative)  good news for freedom.  It says that hierarchy is <em>inefficient</em>.  For instance, secluding women in harems wastes their productive potential. Top-down state control of the economy causes knowledge problems that limit economic productivity. The same problem applies to top-down control of decisionmaking in large firms.  Dominance hierarchies inhibit accurate transmission of information, which worsens knowledge problems and principal-agent problems (“communication is only possible between equals.”)  And elaborate displays of power and deference are costly, as nonproductive displays always are.  Only accumulations of large amounts of resources enable<em> </em>such wasteful activity, which benefits the top of the hierarchy in the short run but prevents the “pie” of total resources from growing.</p>\n<p>This means that if you could just figure out a way to keep inefficient hierarchies from forming, you could grow systems to be larger and richer than ever.  Yes, <em>historically</em>, Western economies grew richer as states grew stronger — but perhaps a stateless society could be richer still.  Perhaps without the stagnating effects of <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2018/05/31/monopoly-a-manifesto-and-fact-post/\">rent-seeking</a>, we could be hugely better off.</p>\n<p>After all, this is kind of what liberalism did. It’s the big counter-trend to “wealth and despotism go together” — Western liberal-democratic countries are much richer and much less authoritarian (and less oppressive to women) than any pre-modern society, or than developing countries. One of the observations in <em>Wealth of Nations </em>is that countries with strong middle classes had more subsequent economic growth than countries with more wealth inequality — Smith uses England as an example of a fast-growing, equal society and China as an example of a stagnant, unequal one.</p>\n<p>But this is only <em>partial </em>good news for freedom, after all. If hierarchies tend to emerge as soon as size, scale, and wealth arise, then that means we don’t have a solution to the problem of <em>preventing </em>them from emerging. On a model where any sufficiently large accumulation of resources begins to look attractive to “<a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2018/05/31/monopoly-a-manifesto-and-fact-post/\">robber barons</a>” who want to appropriate it and forcibly keep others out, we might hypothesize that a natural evolution of all human institutions is from an initial period of growth and value production towards inevitable value capture, stagnation, and decline.  We see a lack of freedom in the world around us, not because freedom can’t work well, but because it’s hard to preserve against the incursions of wannabe despots, who eventually ruin the system for everyone including themselves.</p>\n<p>That model points the way to new questions, surrounding the kinds of governance that Jo Freeman talks about. <em>By default </em>an organization will succumb to inefficient hierarchy, and structureless organizations will succumb faster and to more toxic hierarchies. When designing governance structures, the question you want to ask is not just “is this a system I’d want to live under today?” but “how effective <em>will t</em>his system be in the <em>future </em>at resisting the guys who will come along and try to take over and milk it for short-term personal gain until it collapses?”  And now we’re starting to sound like the rationale and reasoning behind the U.S. Constitution, though I certainly don’t think that’s the last word on the subject.</p>",

Which is to say,\nwhen I want to learn something new, too often I spend my time making tools to\nhelp me learn, rather than just learning the thing.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, the first time I tried to learn how to play jazz music.</p>\n<p>There's only one thing that I'm really good at, which is programming. The\ncentral tenet in programming is that \"laziness is good,\" and if you're faced\nwith doing something boring and repetitive, you should instead automate that\nthing away.</p>\n<p>When all you have is a hammer...</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.shermusic.com/1883217040.php\">The Book</a>, the first thing to do to learn jazz is to\nlearn your scales---in every mode for every key for several varieties of\nharmony. There are 12 notes, and seven modes, and at least four harmonies.\nThat's what, like 336 different scales to learn?</p>\n<p>\"WHO HAS TIME FOR ALL THAT CRAP,\" I thought. \"I'LL JUST WRITE A <a href=\"http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/modeling-music/\">COMPUTER\nPROGRAM</a> TO GENERATE THE SCALES FOR ME, AND THEN PLAY THOSE.\"</p>\n<p>In retrospect, this was a <em>terrible plan.</em> Not only did it not get me closer to\nmy goal of knowing how to play jazz music, I also <em>didn't know enough about the\ndomain to successfully model it.</em> It's funny to read back through that blog post\nwith the benefit of hindsight, but at the time I really thought I was onto\nsomething!</p>\n<p>That's not to say it was <em>wasted effort</em> nor that it was <em>useless</em>, merely that\nit wasn't actually moving me closer to my stated goal of being able to play jazz\nmusic. It was scratching my itch for mental masturbation, and was a good\nexercise in attempting to model things I don't understand very well, but\ncrucially, it wasn't <em>helping.</em></p>\n<p>Or take another example, a more recent foray into music for me---only a few\nweeks ago. This time I had more of a plan; I was taking piano lessons and\ngetting advice on how to practice from my teacher. One of the things he\nsuggested I do was to solo around in the minor pentatonic scale. And so I did,\nstarting in C, and (tentatively) moving to G.</p>\n<p>But doing it in Bb was hard! Rather than spend the two minutes that would be\nrequired to work out what notes I should play in the Bb minor pentatonic, I\ndecided it would be <a href=\"https://github.com/isovector/haskell-realtime-midi\">better to write a computer program</a>! This time it\nwould connect to my keyboard and \"listen\" to the notes I played, and flash red\nwhenever I played a note that wasn't in the Bb minor pentatonic. I guess the\nreasoning was \"I'll train myself to play the right notes subconsciously.\" Or\nsomething.</p>\n<p>I spent like 15 hours writing this computer program.</p>\n<p>This attempt was arguably more helpful than my first computer program, but\nagain, it's a pretty fucking roundabout way of accomplishing the goal. Here we\nare, four weeks later, and I still don't know how to noodle around in the Bb\nminor pentatonic.</p>\n<p>Like I said. Too smart for my own good.</p>\n<p>There's a happy ending to this story, however. Earlier this week, I decided I\nwas going to <em>actually</em> learn how to play jazz music. So I started reading The\nBook again, and when I got to the scale exercises, I decided I'd just give them\na go. No computers. Just the boring, repetitive stuff it said would make me a\ngreat jazz musician.</p>\n<p>The book even gave me some suggestions on how to minimize the amount of\nexercises I need to do---rather than playing every mode in every key (eg. C\nionian, then G ionian, then A ionian, etc etc until it's time to play dorians),\ninstead to play C ionian followed by D dorian followed by E phrygian. These\nscales all share the same notes, so they're more-or-less the same thing, which\nmeans I actually only need to practice 12 things, rather than 84 (the other 250\ncan likewise be compressed together.)</p>\n<p>If I had been patient, I would have read that PRO-TIP the first time around. It\nprobably wouldn't have helped me make less-\"smart\" decisions, but it's worth\nkeeping in mind that I could be two years ahead of where I am today if I were\nbetter at keeping my eye on the ball.</p>\n<p>One of the scales the book made me do was Ab major---something I'd literally\n<em>never once</em> played in my twenty years of piano. It started on a black note and\nalways felt <em>too hard to actually do.</em> I approached it with trepidation, but\nrealized that it only took about three minutes to figure out.</p>\n<p><strong>The thing I'd been putting off for twenty years out of fear only took three\nminutes to accomplish.</strong></p>\n<p>I've often wondered why it seems like all of the good musicians have been\nplaying their instruments for like 25 years. Surely music can't be <em>that</em>\nhard---you can get pretty fucking good at most things in six months of dedicated\nstudy. But in the light of all of this, it makes sense. If everyone learns music\nas haphazardly as I've been doing it, it's no wonder that it takes us all so\nlong.</p>\n<p>What have you been putting off out of fear? Are you sure it's as hard as it\nseems?</p>\n</body></html>",

He notes that there are some clear mismatches between this problem and reality, such as the CIRL assumption that humans have static preferences, and how fuzzy the abstraction of &quot;rational agents with utility functions&quot; becomes in the context of agents with bounded rationality. Nevertheless, he claims that this is a useful unifying framework for thinking about AI safety.</p><p>Dylan argues that the process by which a robot learns to accomplish tasks is best described not just as maximising an objective function but instead in a way which includes the system designer who selects and modifies the optimisation algorithms, hyperparameters, etc. In fact, he claims, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to talk about how well a system is doing without talking about the way in which it was instructed and the type of information it got. In CIRL, this is modeled via the combination of a &quot;teaching strategy&quot; and a &quot;learning strategy&quot;. The former can take many forms: providing rankings of options, or demonstrations, or binary comparisons, etc. Dylan also mentions an extension of this in which the teacher needs to learn their own values over time. This is useful for us because we don&#x27;t yet understand the normative processes by which human societies come to moral judgements, or how to integrate machines into that process.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01291\">On the Utility of Model Learning in HRI</a></strong> <em>(Rohan Choudhury, Gokul Swamy et al)</em>: In human-robot interaction (HRI), we often require a model of the human that we can plan against. Should we use a specific model of the human (a so-called &quot;theory of mind&quot;, where the human is approximately optimizing some unknown reward), or should we simply learn a model of the human from data? This paper presents empirical evidence comparing three algorithms in an autonomous driving domain, where a robot must drive alongside a human.</p><p>The first algorithm, called Theory of Mind based learning, models the human using a theory of mind, infers a human reward function, and uses that to predict what the human will do, and plans around those actions. The second algorithm, called Black box model-based learning, trains a neural network to directly predict the actions the human will take, and plans around those actions. The third algorithm, model-free learning, simply applies Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a deep RL algorithm, to directly predict what action the robot should take, given the current state.</p><p>Quoting from the abstract, they &quot;find that there is a significant sample complexity advantage to theory of mind methods and that they are more robust to covariate shift, but that when enough interaction data is available, black box approaches eventually dominate&quot;. They also find that when the ToM assumptions are significantly violated, then the black-box model-based algorithm will vastly surpass ToM. The model-free learning algorithm did not work at all, probably because it cannot take advantage of knowledge of the dynamics of the system and so the learning problem is much harder.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I&#x27;m always happy to see an experimental paper that tests how algorithms perform, I think we need more of these.</p><p>You might be tempted to think of this as evidence that in deep RL, a model-based method should outperform a model-free one. This isn&#x27;t exactly right. The first ToM and black box model-based algorithms use an exact model of the dynamics of the environment modulo the human, that is, they can exactly predict the next state given the current state, the robot action, and the human action. The model-free algorithm must learn this from scratch, so it isn&#x27;t an apples-to-apples comparison. (Typically in deep RL, both model-based and model-free algorithms have to learn the environment dynamics.) However, you <em>can</em> think of the ToM as a model-based method and the Black-box model-based algorithm as a model-free algorithm, where both algorithms have to learn the <em>human model</em>instead of the more traditional environment dynamics. With that analogy, you would conclude that model-based algorithms will be more sample efficient and more performant in low-data regimes, but will be outperformed by model-free algorithms with sufficient data, which agrees with my intuitions.</p><p>This kind of effect is a major reason for my position that the first powerful AI systems will be modular (analogous to model-based systems), but that they will eventually be replaced by more integrated, end-to-end systems (analogous to model-free systems). Initially, we will be in a (relatively speaking) low-data regime, where modular systems excel, but over time there will be more data and compute and we will transition to regimes where end-to-end systems will solve the same tasks better (though we may then have modular systems for more difficult tasks).</p><h1>Technical AI alignment</h1><h3>Iterated amplification sequence</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4nZRzoGTqg8xy5rr8/the-reward-engineering-problem\">The reward engineering problem</a> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: The reward engineering problem is the problem of designing some form of reward feedback such that if the agent learns to get high reward, then we are happy with the resulting behavior. We assume that an overseer H is providing reward for an agent A, with H smarter than A.</p><p>(Aside: Why are we assuming H is smarter, when we are typically worried about AI that is more intelligent than we are? Because we could hope to use AI tools to create this reward function, so that the human + AI team is smarter than the AI being trained. In iterated amplification, this corresponds to the distillation step.)</p><p>We could imagine three approaches: direct supervision (where H provides a reward for every action A takes), imitation learning (where A tries to mimic H, perhaps by trying to fool a discriminator that distinguishes between A and H), and inverse reinforcement learning (where we infer a reward function by observing H&#x27;s behavior and use that to supervise A).</p><p>With all of these approaches, we might hope that since H is smarter than A, A will not be able to trick H with some behavior that gets high reward but is actually undesirable. However, this argument has a major flaw. When A chooses an action, the process or computation by which it chooses that action is important information, which by default (especially with neural nets) only A has access to, and so this can allow it to fool H. For example, if A is tasked with drawing original artwork, it might copy and slightly change existing artwork, which H may not realize if it cannot see how the artwork was made. We could hope to fix this problem with transparency or explanations, but this requires a lot more research.</p><p>Imitation learning and IRL have the problem that A may not be capable of doing what H does. In that case, it will be off-distribution and may have weird behavior. Direct supervision doesn&#x27;t suffer from this problem, but it is very time-inefficient. This could potentially be fixed using semi-supervised learning techniques.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> The information asymmetry problem between H and A seems like a major issue. For me, it&#x27;s the strongest argument for why transparency is a <em>necessary</em> ingredient of a solution to alignment. The argument against imitation learning and IRL is quite strong, in the sense that it seems like you can&#x27;t rely on either of them to capture the right behavior. These are stronger than the arguments against <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN\">ambitious value learning</a> (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a>) because here we assume that H is smarter than A, which we could not do with ambitious value learning. So it does seem to me that direct supervision (with semi-supervised techniques and robustness) is the most likely path forward to solving the reward engineering problem.</p><p>There is also the question of whether it is necessary to solve the reward engineering problem. It certainly seems necessary in order to implement iterated amplification given current systems (where the distillation step will be implemented with optimization, which means that we need a reward signal), but might not be necessary if we move away from optimization or if we build systems using some technique other than iterated amplification (though even then it seems very useful to have a good reward engineering solution).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/t3AJW5jP3sk36aGoC/capability-amplification\">Capability amplification</a> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: Capability amplification is the problem of taking some existing policy and producing a better policy, perhaps using much more time and compute. It is a particularly interesting problem to study because it could be used to define the goals of a powerful AI system, and it could be combined with <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4nZRzoGTqg8xy5rr8/the-reward-engineering-problem\">reward engineering</a> above to create a powerful aligned system. (Capability amplification and reward engineering are analogous to amplification and distillation respectively.) In addition, capability amplification seems simpler than the general problem of &quot;build an AI that does the right thing&quot;, because we get to start with a weak policy A rather than nothing, and were allowed to take lots of time and computation to implement the better policy. It would be useful to tell whether the &quot;hard part&quot; of value alignment is in capability amplification, or somewhere else.</p><p>We can evaluate capability amplification using the concepts of reachability and obstructions. A policy C is <em>reachable</em> from another policy A if there is some chain of policies from A to C, such that at each step capability amplification takes you from the first policy to something at least as good as the second policy. Ideally, all policies would be reachable from some very simple policy. This is impossible if there exists an <em>obstruction</em>, that is a partition of policies into two sets L and H, such that it is impossible to amplify any policy in L to get a policy that is at least as good as some policy in H. Intuitively, an obstruction prevents us from getting to arbitrarily good behavior, and means that all of the policies in H are not reachable from any policy in L.</p><p>We can do further work on capability amplification. With theory, we can search for challenging obstructions, and design procedures that overcome them. With experiment, we can study capability amplification with humans (something which <a href=\"https://ought.org/\">Ought</a> is now doing).</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> There&#x27;s a clear reason for work on capability amplification: it could be used as a part of an implementation of iterated amplification. However, this post also suggests another reason for such work -- it may help us determine where the &quot;hard part&quot; of AI safety lies. Does it help to assume that you have lots of time and compute, and that you have access to a weaker policy?</p><p>Certainly if you just have access to a weaker policy, this doesn&#x27;t make the problem any easier. If you could take a weak policy and amplify it into a stronger policy efficiently, then you could just repeatedly apply this policy-improvement operator to some very weak base policy (say, a neural net with random weights) to solve the full problem. (In other variants, you have a much stronger aligned base policy, eg. the human policy with short inputs and over a short time horizon; in that case this assumption is more powerful.) The more interesting assumption is that you have lots of time and compute, which does seem to have a lot of potential. I feel pretty optimistic that a human thinking for a long time could reach &quot;superhuman performance&quot; by our current standards; capability amplification asks if we can do this in a particular structured way.</p><h3>Value learning sequence</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/ZiLLxaLB5CCofrzPp\">Reward uncertainty</a> <em>(Rohin Shah)</em>: Given that we need human feedback for the AI system to stay &quot;on track&quot; as the environment changes, we might design a system that keeps an estimate of the reward, chooses actions that optimize that reward, but also updates the reward over time based on feedback. This has a few issues: it typically assumes that the human Alice knows the true reward function, it makes a possibly-incorrect assumption about the meaning of Alice&#x27;s feedback, and the AI system still looks like a long-term goal-directed agent where the goal is the current reward estimate.</p><p>This post takes the above AI system and considers what happens if you have a distribution over reward functions instead of a point estimate, and during action selection you take into account future updates to the distribution. (This is the setup of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\">Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a>.) While we still assume that Alice knows the true reward function, and we still require an assumption about the meaning of Alice&#x27;s feedback, the resulting system looks less like a goal-directed agent.</p><p>In particular, the system no longer has an incentive to disable the system that learns values from feedback: while previously it changed the AI system&#x27;s goal (a negative effect from the goal&#x27;s perspective), now it provides more information about the goal (a positive effect). In addition, the system has more of an incentive to let itself be shut down. If a human is about to shut it down, it should update strongly that whatever it was doing was very bad, causing a drastic update on reward functions. It may still prevent us from shutting it down, but it will at least stop doing the bad thing. Eventually, after gathering enough information, it would converge on the true reward and do the right thing. Of course, this is assuming that the space of rewards is well-specified, which will probably not be true in practice.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/eBd6WvzhuqduCkYv3/following-human-norms\">Following human norms</a> <em>(Rohin Shah)</em>: One approach to preventing catastrophe is to constrain the AI system to never take catastrophic actions, and not focus as much on what to do (which will be solved by progress in AI more generally). In this setting, we hope that our AI systems accelerate our rate of progress, but we remain in control and use AI systems as tools that allow us make better decisions and better technologies. Impact measures / side effect penalties aim to <em>define</em> what not to do. What if we instead <em>learn</em> what not to do? This could look like inferring and following human norms, along the lines of <a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ai-lab/?AdHocTeam\">ad hoc teamwork</a>.</p><p>This is different from narrow value learning for a few reasons. First, narrow value learning also learns what <em>to</em> do. Second, it seems likely that norm inference only gives good results in the context of groups of agents, while narrow value learning could be applied in singe agent settings.</p><p>The main advantages of learning norms is that this is something that humans do quite well, so it may be significantly easier than learning &quot;values&quot;. In addition, this approach is very similar to our ways of preventing humans from doing catastrophic things: there is a shared, external system of norms that everyone is expected to follow. However, norm following is a weaker standard than <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN\">ambitious value learning</a> (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a>), and there are more problems as a result. Most notably, powerful AI systems will lead to rapidly evolving technologies, that cause big changes in the environment that might require new norms; norm-following AI systems may not be able to create or adapt to these new norms.</p><h3>Agent foundations</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wkNQdYj47HX33noKv/cdt-dutch-book\">CDT Dutch Book</a> <em>(Abram Demski)</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WkPf6XCzfJLCm2pbK/cdt-edt-udt\">CDT=EDT=UDT</a> <em>(Abram Demski)</em></p><h3>Learning human intent</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2019/01/17/cooperative-inverse-reinforcement-learning-with-dylan-hadfield-menell/\">AI Alignment Podcast: Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></strong> <em>(Lucas Perry and Dylan Hadfield-Menell)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01291\">On the Utility of Model Learning in HRI</a></strong> <em>(Rohan Choudhury, Gokul Swamy et al)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GermiEmcS6xuZ2gBh/what-ai-safety-researchers-have-written-about-the-nature-of\">What AI Safety Researchers Have Written About the Nature of Human Values</a> <em>(avturchin)</em>: This post categorizes theories of human values along three axes. First, how complex is the description of the values? Second, to what extent are &quot;values&quot; defined as a function of behavior (as opposed to being a function of eg. the brain&#x27;s algorithm)? Finally, how broadly applicable is the theory: could it apply to arbitrary minds, or only to humans? The post then summarizes different positions on human values that different researchers have taken.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I found the categorization useful for understanding the differences between views on human values, which can be quite varied and hard to compare.</p><p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02161\">Risk-Aware Active Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a> <em>(Daniel S. Brown, Yuchen Cui et al)</em>: This paper presents an algorithm that actively solicits demonstrations on states where it could potentially behave badly due to its uncertainty about the reward function. They use Bayesian IRL as their IRL algorithm, so that they get a distribution over reward functions. They use the most likely reward to train a policy, and then find a state from which that policy has high risk (because of the uncertainty over reward functions). They show in experiments that this performs better than other active IRL algorithms.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I don&#x27;t fully understand this paper -- how exactly are they searching over states, when there are exponentially many of them? Are they sampling them somehow? It&#x27;s definitely possible that this is in the paper and I missed it, I did skim it fairly quickly.</p><h1>Other progress in AI</h1><h3>Reinforcement learning</h3><p><a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/01/soft-actor-critic-deep-reinforcement.html\">Soft Actor-Critic: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotics</a> <em>(Tuomas Haarnoja et al)</em></p><h3>Deep learning</h3><p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596\">A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks</a> <em>(Zonghan Wu et al)</em></p><p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08434\">Graph Neural Networks: A Review of Methods and Applications</a> <em>(Jie Zhou, Ganqu Cui, Zhengyan Zhang et al)</em></p><h1>News</h1><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/catherineols/status/1085702568494301185\">Olsson to Join the Open Philanthropy Project</a> (summarized by Dan H): Catherine Olsson‏, a researcher at Google Brain who was previously at OpenAI, will be joining the Open Philanthropy Project to focus on grant making for reducing x-risk from advanced AI.

Before this, I&#x2019;d observed a few different lines of thought, but interpreted them as different facets of the same idea. Now, though, I&#x2019;ve identified at least 6 distinct serious arguments for why AI safety is a priority. By distinct I mean that you can believe any one of them without believing any of the others - although of course the particular categorisation I use is rather subjective, and there&#x2019;s a significant amount of overlap. In this post I give a brief overview of my own interpretation of each argument (note that I don&#x2019;t necessarily endorse them myself). They are listed roughly from most specific and actionable to most general. I finish with some thoughts on what to make of this unexpected proliferation of arguments. Primarily, I think it increases the importance of clarifying and debating the core ideas in AI safety.</p><ol><li><em>Maximisers are dangerous. </em>Superintelligent AGI will behave as if it&#x2019;s maximising the expectation of some utility function, since doing otherwise can be <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F46jPraqp258q67nE/why-you-must-maximize-expected-utility\">shown to be irrational.</a></u> Yet we can&#x2019;t write down a utility function which precisely describes human values, and optimising very hard for any other function will lead to that AI rapidly seizing control (as a <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence\">convergent instrumental subgoal)</a></u> and building a future which contains very little of what we value (because of <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart&#x2019;s law </a></u>and <u><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Complexity_of_value\">the complexity and fragility of values)</a></u>. We won&#x2019;t have a chance to notice and correct misalignment because an AI which has exceeded human level will <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf\">increase its intelligence very quickly</a> (either by recursive self-improvement or by scaling up its hardware), and then prevent us from modifying it or shutting it down.</li><ol><li>This was the main thesis advanced by Yudkowsky and Bostrom when founding the field of AI safety. Here I&#x2019;ve tried to convey the original line of argument, although some parts of it have been strongly critiqued since then. In particular, <u><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf\">Drexler</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NxF5G6CJiof6cemTw/coherence-arguments-do-not-imply-goal-directed-behavior\">Shah</a></u> have disputed the relevance of expected utility maximisation (the latter suggesting the concept of <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/DfcywmqRSkBaCB6Ma\">goal-directedness</a></u> as a replacement), while <u><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/ai-foom-debate/\">Hanson</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/\">Christiano</a></u> disagree that AI intelligence will increase in a very fast and discontinuous way.</li><li>Most of the arguments in this post originate from or build on this one in some way. This is particularly true of the next two arguments - nevertheless, I think that there&#x2019;s enough of a shift in focus in each to warrant separate listings.</li></ol><li><em>The target loading problem.</em> Even if we knew exactly what we wanted a superintelligent agent to do, we don&#x2019;t currently know (even in theory) how to make an agent which actually tries to do that. In other words, if we were to create a superintelligent AGI before solving this problem, the goals we would ascribe to that AGI (by taking the <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance\">intentional stance</a></u> towards it) would not be the ones we had intended to give it. As a motivating example, evolution selected humans for their genetic fitness, yet humans have goals which are very different from just spreading their genes. In a machine learning context, while we can specify a finite number of data points and their rewards, neural networks may then extrapolate from these rewards in non-humanlike ways.</li><ol><li>This is a more general version of the &#x201C;inner optimiser problem&#x201D;, and I think it captures the main thrust of the latter while avoiding the difficulties of defining what actually counts as an &#x201C;optimiser&#x201D;. I&#x2019;m grateful to Nate Soares for explaining the distinction, and arguing for the importance of this problem.</li></ol><li><em>The prosaic alignment problem.</em> It is plausible that we build &#x201C;prosaic AGI&#x201D;, which replicates human behaviour without requiring breakthroughs in our understanding of intelligence. Shortly after they reach human level (or possibly even before), such AIs will become the world&#x2019;s dominant economic actors. They will quickly come to control the most important corporations, earn most of the money, and wield enough political influence that we will be unable to coordinate to place limits on their use. Due to economic pressures, corporations or nations who slow down AI development and deployment in order to focus on aligning their AI more closely with their values will be outcompeted. As AIs exceed human-level intelligence, their decisions will become too complex for humans to understand or provide feedback on (unless we develop new techniques for doing so), and eventually we will no longer be able to correct the divergences between their values and ours. Thus the majority of the resources in the far future will be controlled by AIs which don&#x2019;t prioritise human values. This argument was explained in <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YTq4X6inEudiHkHDF/prosaic-ai-alignment\">this blog post by Paul Christiano</a></u>.</li><ol><li>More generally, aligning multiple agents with multiple humans is much harder than aligning one agent with one human, because value differences might lead to competition and conflict even between agents that are each fully aligned with some humans. (As my own speculation, it&#x2019;s also possible that having multiple agents would increase the difficulty of single-agent alignment - e.g. the question &#x201C;what would humans want if I didn&#x2019;t manipulate them&#x201D; would no longer track our values if we would counterfactually be manipulated by a different agent).</li></ol><li><em>The human safety problem.</em> This line of argument (which Wei Dai <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vbtvgNXkufFRSrx4j/three-ai-safety-related-ideas\">has</a></u> <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HBGd34LKvXM9TxvNf/new-safety-research-agenda-scalable-agent-alignment-via#2gcfd3PN8GGqyuuHF\">recently</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HTgakSs6JpnogD6c2/two-neglected-problems-in-human-ai-safety\">highlighted</a></u>) claims that no human is &#x201C;safe&#x201D; in the sense that giving them absolute power would produce good futures for humanity in the long term, and therefore that building AI which extrapolates and implements the values of even a very altruistic human is insufficient. A prosaic version of this argument emphasises the corrupting effect of power, and the fact that morality is deeply intertwined with social signalling - however, I think there&#x2019;s a stronger and more subtle version. In everyday life it makes sense to model humans as mostly rational agents pursuing their goals and values. However, this abstraction breaks down badly in more extreme cases (e.g. addictive superstimuli, unusual moral predicaments), implying that human values are somewhat incoherent. One such extreme case is running my brain for a billion years, after which it seems very likely that my values will have shifted or distorted radically, in a way that my original self wouldn&#x2019;t endorse. Yet if we want a good future, this is the process which we require to go well: a human (or a succession of humans) needs to maintain broadly acceptable and coherent values for astronomically long time periods.</li><ol><li>An obvious response is that we shouldn&#x2019;t entrust the future to one human, but rather to some group of humans following a set of decision-making procedures. However, I don&#x2019;t think any currently-known institution is actually much safer than individuals over the sort of timeframes we&#x2019;re talking about. Presumably a committee of several individuals would have lower variance than just one, but as that committee grows you start running into well-known problems with democracy. And while democracy isn&#x2019;t a bad system, it seems unlikely to be robust on the timeframe of millennia or longer. (Alex Zhu has made the interesting argument that the problem of an individual maintaining coherent values is roughly isomorphic to the problem of a civilisation doing so, since both are complex systems composed of individual &#x201C;modules&#x201D; which often want different things.)</li><li>While AGI amplifies the human safety problem, it may also help solve it if we can use it to decrease the value drift that would otherwise occur. Also, while it&#x2019;s possible that we need to solve this problem in conjunction with other AI safety problems, it might be postponable until after we&#x2019;ve achieved civilisational stability.</li><li>Note that I use &#x201C;broadly acceptable values&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;our own values&#x201D;, because it&#x2019;s very unclear to me which types or extent of value evolution we should be okay with. Nevertheless, there are some values which we definitely find unacceptable (e.g. having a very narrow moral circle, or wanting your enemies to suffer as much as possible) and I&#x2019;m not confident that we&#x2019;ll avoid drifting into them by default.</li></ol><li><em>Misuse and vulnerabilities</em>. These might be catastrophic even if AGI always carries out our intentions to the best of its ability:</li><ol><li>AI which is superhuman at science and engineering R&amp;D will be able to invent very destructive weapons much faster than humans can. Humans may well be irrational or malicious enough to use such weapons even when doing so would lead to our extinction, especially if they&#x2019;re invented before we improve our global coordination mechanisms. It&#x2019;s also possible that we invent some technology which destroys us unexpectedly, either through unluckiness or carelessness. For more on the dangers from technological progress in general, see Bostrom&#x2019;s paper on the <u><a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\">vulnerable world hypothesis</a></u>.</li><li>AI could be used to disrupt political structures, for example via unprecedentedly effective psychological manipulation. In an extreme case, it could be used to establish very stable totalitarianism, with automated surveillance and enforcement mechanisms ensuring an unshakeable monopoly on power for leaders.</li><li>AI could be used for large-scale projects (e.g. climate engineering to prevent global warming, or managing the colonisation of the galaxy) without sufficient oversight or verification of robustness. Software or hardware bugs might then induce the AI to make unintentional yet catastrophic mistakes.</li><li>People could use AIs to hack critical infrastructure (include the other AIs which manage aforementioned large-scale projects). In addition to exploiting standard security vulnerabilities, hackers might induce mistakes using adversarial examples or &#x2018;data poisoning&#x2019;.</li></ol><li><em>Argument from large impacts</em>. Even if we&#x2019;re very uncertain about what AGI development and deployment will look like, it seems likely that AGI will have a very large impact on the world in general, and that further investigation into how to direct that impact could prove very valuable.</li><ol><li>Weak version: development of AGI will be at least as big an economic jump as the industrial revolution, and therefore affect the trajectory of the long-term future. See <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9sBAW3qKppnoG3QPq/ben-garfinkel-how-sure-are-we-about-this-ai-stuff\">Ben Garfinkel&#x2019;s talk at EA Global London 2018</a>. Ben noted that to consider work on AI safety important, we also need to believe the additional claim that there are feasible ways to positively influence the long-term effects of AI development - something which may not have been true for the industrial revolution. (Personally my guess is that since AI development will happen more quickly than the industrial revolution, power will be more concentrated during the transition period, and so influencing its long-term effects will be more tractable.)</li><li>Strong version: development of AGI will make humans the second most intelligent species on the planet. Given that it was our intelligence which allowed us to control the world to the large extent that we do, we should expect that entities which are much more intelligent than us will end up controlling our future, unless there are reliable and feasible ways to prevent it. So far we have not discovered any.</li></ol></ol><p>What should we think about the fact that there are so many arguments for the same conclusion? As a general rule, the more arguments support a statement, the more likely it is to be true. However, I&#x2019;m inclined to believe that quality matters much more than quantity - it&#x2019;s easy to make up weak arguments, but you only need one strong one to outweigh all of them. And this proliferation of arguments is (weak) evidence against their quality: if the conclusions of a field remain the same but the reasons given for holding those conclusions change, that&#x2019;s a warning sign for motivated cognition (especially when those beliefs are considered socially important). This problem is exacerbated by a lack of clarity about which assumptions and conclusions are shared between arguments, and which aren&#x2019;t.</p><p>On the other hand, superintelligent AGI is a very complicated topic, and so perhaps it&#x2019;s natural that there are many different lines of thought. One way to put this in perspective (which I credit to Beth Barnes) is to think about the arguments which might have been given for worrying about nuclear weapons, before they had been developed. Off the top of my head, there are at least four:</p><ol><li>They might be used deliberately.</li><li>They might be set off accidentally.</li><li>They might cause a nuclear chain reaction much larger than anticipated.</li><li>They might destabilise politics, either domestically or internationally.</li></ol><p>And there are probably more which would have been credible at the time, but which seem silly now due to hindsight bias. So if there&#x2019;d been an active anti-nuclear movement in the 30&#x2019;s or early 40&#x2019;s, the motivations of its members might well have been as disparate as those of AI safety advocates today. Yet the overall concern would have been (and still is) totally valid and reasonable.</p><p>I think the main takeaway from this post is that the AI safety community as a whole is still confused about the very problem we are facing. The only way to dissolve this tangle is to have more communication and clarification of the fundamental ideas in AI safety, particularly in the form of writing which is made widely available. And while it would be great to have AI safety researchers explaining their perspectives more often, I think there is still a lot of explicatory work which can be done regardless of technical background. In addition to analysis of the arguments discussed in this post, I think it would be particularly useful to see more descriptions of deployment scenarios and corresponding threat models. It would also be valuable for research agendas to highlight which problem they are addressing, and the assumptions they require to succeed.</p><p><em>This post has benefited greatly from feedback from Rohin Shah, Alex Zhu, Beth Barnes, Adam Marblestone, Toby Ord, and the DeepMind safety team.

The saying goes, “in a free market of ideas, the best ideas float to the top”. Of course, it is not intended as a <em>facts</em> statement, as in “we have observed that this is the case”; it is instead a <em>values</em> statement, as in “we would prefer for this to be the case.”.</p>\n<p>In this essay, however, we will force an empirical interpretation, just to see what happens. I will provide three ways to consider the <em>density</em> of an idea, or the number assigned to how float-to-the-top an idea is.</p>\n<p>In brief, an idea is a sentence, and you can vary the amount of it’s antecedent graph (like in bayesian nets, <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/narswang/home/nars-introduction#TOC-Architecture-and-Control-\">NARS-like architectures</a>) or function out of which it is printed (like in compression) that you want to consider at a given moment, up to resource allocation. This isn’t an entirely mathematical paper, so don’t worry about WFFs, parsers, etc., which is why i’ll stick with “ideas” instead of “sentences”. I will also be handwaving between \"description of some world states\" and \"belief about how world states relate to eachother\".</p>\n<h2>Intuition</h2>\n<p>Suppose you observe wearers of teal hats advocate for policy A, but you don’t know what A is. You’re minding your business in an applebees parking lot when a wearer of magenta hats gets your attention to tell you “A is harmful”. There are two cases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Suppose A is “kicking puppies”, (and I don’t mean the wearer of magenta hats is <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/21/against-murderism/\">misleadingly compressing</a> A to you, I mean the policy is literally kicking puppies). The inferential gap between you and the magentas can be closed very cheaply, so you’re quickly convinced that A is harmful (unless you believe that kicking puppies is good).</li>\n<li>Suppose A is “fleegan at a rate of flargen”, where fleeganomics is a niche technical subject which nevertheless can be learned by anyone of median education in N units[^1] or less. Suppose also that you know the value of N, but you’re not inclined to invest that much compute in a dumb election, so you either a. take them at their word that A is harmful; b. search the applebees for an authority figure who believes that A is harmful, but believes it more credibly; or c. leave the parking lot without updating in any direction.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“That’s easy, c” you respond, blindingly fast. You peel out of there, and the whole affair makes not a dent in your epistemic hygiene. But you left behind many others. Will they be as strong, as wise as you?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>– Herbert Simon</p>\n<p>Let’s call case 1 “constant” and case 2 “linear”. We assume that constant refers to negligible cost, and that linear is in pedagogical length (where pedagogical cost is some measure of the resources needed to acquire some sort of understanding).</p>\n<p>A regulator, unlike you, isn’t willing to leave anyone behind for evangelists and pundits to prey on. This is the role I’m assuming for this essay. I will ultimately propose a negative attentional tax, in which the constant cases would be penalized to give the linear cases a boost. (It’s like negative income tax, replacing money with attention).</p>\n<p>If you could understand fleeganomics in N/100000 bits, would it be worth it to you then?</p>\n<h2>Let’s force an empirical interpretation of “the best ideas float to the top”</h2>\n<p>Three possible measures of density:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>the simplest ideas float to the top</em>.</li>\n<li><em>the truest ideas float to the top</em>.</li>\n<li><em>the ideas which advance the best values float to the top</em>, where by “advance the best values” we mean either a. maximize my utility function, not yours; or b. maximize the aggregate/average utility function of all moral patients, without emphasis on zero-sum faceoffs between opponent utility functions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each in turn implies a sort of world in which it is the sole interpretation, and thus the sole factor over beliefs of truth-seekers.</p>\n<p>The intuition given above leans heavily on density_3, however, we must start much lower, at the fundamentals of simplicity and truth. From now on, for brevity’s sake, please ignore density_3 and focus on the first two.</p>\n<h3>density_1: The Simplest Ideas Float to the Top.</h3>\n<p>If you form a heuristic by philosophizing the conjunction rule in probability theory, you get Occam’s razor. In machine learning, we have model selection methods that directly penalize complexity. Occam’s razor doesn’t say anything about reception of ideas in a social system, beyond implying that in gambling the wise bet on shorter sentences (insofar as the wise are gamblers).</p>\n<p>If we assume that the wearer of magenta hats is maximizing something like petition signatures, and by proxy maximizing the number of applebees patrons converted to magenta hat wearing applebees patrons, then in the world of density_1 they ought to persuade only via statements with constant or negligible cost. (remember, in the world of density_1, statement’s needn’t have any particular content to be successful. In an idealized setting, this would mean the empty string gets 100% of the vote in every election, or 100% of traders purchase nothing but the empty string, etc.; in a human setting, think of the “smallest recognizable belief”).</p>\n<h3>density_2: The Truest Ideas Float to the Top.</h3>\n<p>If the truest ideas floated to the top, then statements with more substantial truth values (i.e. with more evidence, more compelling evidence, stronger inferential steps) win out against those with less substantial truth values. In a world governed only by density_2, all cost is negligible.</p>\n<p>In this world, the wearer of magenta hats is incentivized to teach fleaganomics – to bother themselves (and others) with linear cost ideas – if that’s what leads people to more <em>substantially held</em> beliefs or commitments. This is a sort of <em>oracle</em> world, in a word, logical omniscience.</p>\n<p>In a market view, truth only prevails in <em>the long run</em> (i.e. in the same way that price only <em>converges</em> to value but you can’t pinpoint when they’re equal, supply with demand, etc.), which is why the density_2 interpretation is suitable for oracles, or at least the infinite resources of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI\">AIXI</a>-like agents. If you tried to populate the world of density_2 with <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Logical_uncertainty\">logically uncertain</a>/<a href=\"https://cis.temple.edu/~pwang/Publication/AIKR.pdf\">AIKR-abiding</a> agents, the entire appeal of markets evaporates. “Those who know they are not relevant experts shut up, and those who do not know this eventually lose their money, and then shut up.” (<a href=\"https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html\">Hanson</a>), but without the “eventually”.</p>\n<h2>Negative attention tax</h2>\n<p>Now suppose we live in some world where density_1 and density_2 are operating at the same time, with some foggier and handwavier things like density_3 on the margins. In such a world, we say <strong>false-complicated</strong> ideas are <em>robustly uncompetitive</em> and <strong>true-simple</strong> ideas are <em>robustly competitive</em>, where “robust” means “<em>resilient to foul play</em>”, and \"foul play\" means \"any misleading compression, fallacious reasoning, etc.\". Without such resilience, we have <em>risk</em> that <strong>false-simple</strong> ideas will succeed and <strong>true-complicated</strong> ideas will fail.</p>\n<p>A <em>regulator</em> isn’t willing to leave anyone behind for evangelists and pundits to prey on.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we want free attention distributed to true-but-complicated things, and penalties applied to false-but-simple things. In economics, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax\"><em>negative income tax</em> (NIT)</a> is a welfare system within an income tax where people earning below a certain amount receive supplemental pay from the government instead of paying taxes to the government.</p>\n<p>For us, a <strong>negative attentional tax</strong> is a <em>welfare system</em>, where ideas demanding above a certain amount of compute receive supplemental attention, and ideas below that amount pay up.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>density_2</em> \\ <em>density_1</em></th>\n<th>Simple</th>\n<th>Complicated</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>False</strong></td>\n<td>I'm saying this is a failure mode, danger zone, etc.</td>\n<td><em>Robustly uncompetitive</em> (won’t bother us)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>True</strong></td>\n<td><em>Robustly competitive</em> (these will be fine)</td>\n<td>I’m saying the solution is to give these sentences a boost.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>An example implementation</em>: suppose I’m working at nosebook in year of our lord. When I notice certain posts get liked/shared blindingly fast, and others take more time, I suppose that the simple ones are some form of epistemic foul play, and the complicated ones are more likely to align with epistemic norms we prefer. <em>I make an algorithm to suppress posts that get liked/shared too quickly, and replace their spots in the feed with posts that seem to be digested before getting liked/shared</em> (disclaimer: this is not a resilient proposal, I spent all of 10 seconds thinking about it, please defer to your nearest misinformation expert)</p>\n<h3>Individuals apply NAT credits to interesting-looking complicated ideas, complicated ideas aren't directly supplied with these supplements in the way that simple ideas are automatically handicapped.</h3>\n<p>Though the above may be a valid interpretation, especially in the nosebook example, NAT is more properly understood as credits allocated to individuals for them to spend freely.</p>\n<p>You can imagine the stump speech.</p>\n<p><strong><em>extremely campaigning voice</em></strong>: I’m going to make sure every member of every applebees parking lot has a lengthened/handicapped mental speed when they’re faced with simple ideas, and this will come back to them as tax credits they can spend on complicated ideas. Every applebees patron deserves complexity, even if they can’t afford the full compute/price for it.</p>\n<p>--<em>footnote</em>--\n[^1]: \"Pedagogical cost\" is loosely inspired by \"algorithmic decomposition\" in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Vd2L_rvG7t8\">Between Saying and Doing</a>. TLDR., to reason about a student acquiring long division, we reason about their acquisition of subtraction and multiplication. For us, pedagogical cost or length of some capacity is the sum of the length of its prerequisite capacities.\nWe'll consider our pedagogical units as some function on attentional units. <a href=\"https://cosimoaccoto.com/2013/03/09/designing-organizations-for-an-information-rich-world-1969/\">Herbert Simon</a> dismisses adopting Shannon's bit as the attentional unit, because he wants something invariant under different encoding choices. He goes on to suggest <em>time</em> in the form of \"how long it takes for the median human cognition to digest\". This can be our base unit of parsing things you already know how to parse, even though extending it to pedagogical cost wouldn't be as stable because we don't understand teaching or learning very well.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>So far we have been talking about how to learn “values” or “instrumental goals”. This would be necessary if we want to figure out how to build an AI system that does exactly what we want it to do. However, we’re probably fine if we can keep learning and building better AI systems. This suggests that it’s sufficient to build AI systems that don’t screw up so badly that it ends this process. If we accomplish that, then steady progress in AI will eventually get us to AI systems that do what we want.</p><p>So, it might be helpful to break down the problem of learning values into the subproblems of learning what to do, and learning what not to do. Standard AI research will continue to make progress on learning what to do; catastrophe happens when our AI system doesn’t know what not to do. This is the part that we need to make progress on.</p><p>This is a problem that humans have to solve as well. Children learn basic norms such as not to litter, not to take other people’s things, what not to say in public, etc. As argued in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04268\">Incomplete Contracting and AI alignment</a>, any contract between humans is never explicitly spelled out, but instead relies on an external unwritten normative structure under which a contract is interpreted. (Even if we don’t explicitly ask our cleaner not to break any vases, we still expect them not to intentionally do so.) We might hope to build AI systems that infer and follow these norms, and thereby avoid catastrophe.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this will probably not be an instance of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/vX7KirQwHsBaSEdfK\">narrow value learning</a>, since there are several differences:</p><ul><li>Narrow value learning requires that you learn what <em>to</em> do, unlike norm inference.</li><li>Norm following requires learning from a complex domain (human society), whereas narrow value learning can be applied in simpler domains as well.</li><li>Norms are a property of groups of agents, whereas narrow value learning can be applied in settings with a single agent.</li></ul><p>Despite this, I have included it in this sequence because it is plausible to me that value learning techniques will be relevant to norm inference.</p><h2>Paradise prospects</h2><p>With a norm-following AI system, the success story is primarily around accelerating our rate of progress. Humans remain in charge of the overall trajectory of the future, and we use AI systems as tools that enable us to make better decisions and create better technologies, which looks like “superhuman intelligence” from our vantage point today.</p><p>If we still want an AI system that colonizes space and optimizes it according to our values without our supervision, we can figure out what our values are over a period of reflection, solve the alignment problem for goal-directed AI systems, and then create such an AI system.</p><p>This is quite similar to the success story in a world with <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services\">Comprehensive AI Services</a>.</p><h2>Plausible proposals</h2><p>As far as I can tell, there has not been very much work on <em>learning</em> what not to do. Existing approaches like impact measures and mild optimization are aiming to <em>define</em> what not to do rather than learn it.</p><p>One approach is to scale up techniques for narrow value learning. It seems plausible that in sufficiently complex environments, these techniques will learn what not to do, even though they are primarily focused on what to do in current benchmarks. For example, if I see that you have a clean carpet, I can infer that it is a norm not to walk over the carpet with muddy shoes. If you have an unbroken vase, I can infer that it is a norm to avoid knocking it over. This <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkevMnRqYQ\">paper</a> of mine shows how this you can reach these sorts of conclusions with narrow value learning (specifically a variant of IRL).</p><p>Another approach would be to scale up work on <a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ai-lab/?AdHocTeam\">ad hoc teamwork</a>. In ad hoc teamwork, an AI agent must learn to work in a team with a bunch of other agents, without any prior coordination. While current applications are very task-based (eg. playing soccer as a team), it seems possible that as this is applied to more realistic environments, the resulting agents will need to infer norms of the group that they are introduced into. It’s particularly nice because it explicitly models the multiagent setting, which seems crucial for inferring norms. It can also be thought of as an alternative statement of the problem of AI safety: how do you “drop in” an AI agent into a “team” of humans, and have the AI agent coordinate well with the “team”?</p><h2>Potential pros</h2><p>Value learning is hard, not least because it’s hard to define what values are, and we don’t know our own values to the extent that they exist at all. However, we do seem to do a pretty good job of learning society’s norms. So perhaps this problem is significantly easier to solve. Note that this is an argument that norm-following is easier than <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN\">ambitious value learning</a>, not that it is easier than other approaches such as <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">corrigibility</a>.</p><p>It is also feels easier to work on inferring norms right now. We have many examples of norms that we follow; so we can more easily evaluate whether current systems are good at following norms. In addition, <a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ai-lab/?AdHocTeam\">ad hoc teamwork</a> seems like a good start at formalizing the problem, which we still don’t really have for “values”.</p><p>This also more closely mirrors our tried-and-true techniques for solving the principal-agent problem for humans: there is a shared, external system of norms, that everyone is expected to follow, and systems of law and punishment are interpreted with respect to these norms. For a much more thorough discussion, see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04268\">Incomplete Contracting and AI alignment</a>, particularly Section 5, which also argues that norm following will be <em>necessary for value alignment</em> (whereas I’m arguing that it is plausibly <em>sufficient to avoid catastrophe</em>).</p><p>One potential confusion: the paper says “We do not mean by this embedding into the AI the particular norms and values of a human community. We think this is as impossible a task as writing a complete contract.” I believe that the meaning here is that we should not try to <em>define</em> the particular norms and values, not that we shouldn’t try to <em>learn</em> them. (In fact, later they say “Aligning AI with human values, then, will require figuring out how to build the technical tools that will allow a robot to replicate the human agent’s ability to read and predict the responses of human normative structure, whatever its content.”)</p><h2>Perilous pitfalls</h2><p>What additional things could go wrong with powerful norm-following AI systems? That is, what are some problems that might arise, that wouldn’t arise with a successful approach to <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN\">ambitious value learning</a>?</p><ul><li>Powerful AI likely leads to rapidly evolving technologies, which might require rapidly changing norms. Norm-following AI systems might not be able to help us develop good norms, or might not be able to adapt quickly enough to new norms. (One class of problems in this category: we would not be addressing <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vbtvgNXkufFRSrx4j/three-ai-safety-related-ideas\">human safety problems</a>.)</li><li>Norm-following AI systems may be uncompetitive because the norms might overly restrict the possible actions available to the AI system, reducing novelty relative to more traditional goal-directed AI systems. (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@cristobal_esteban/move-37-a3b500aa75c2\">Move 37</a> would likely not have happened if AlphaGo were trained to “follow human norms” for Go.)</li><li>Norms are more like soft constraints on behavior, as opposed to goals that can be optimized. Current ML focuses a lot more on optimization than on constraints, and so it’s not clear if we could build a competitive norm-following AI system (though see eg. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10528\">Constrained Policy Optimization</a>).</li><li>Relatedly, learning what not to do imposes a limitation on behavior. If an AI system is goal-directed, then given sufficient intelligence it will likely find a <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/nearest_unblocked/\">nearest unblocked strategy</a>.</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>One promising approach to AI alignment is to teach AI systems to infer and follow human norms. While this by itself will not produce an AI system aligned with human values, it may be sufficient to avoid catastrophe. It seems more tractable than approaches that require us to infer values to a degree sufficient to avoid catastrophe, particularly because humans are proof that the problem is soluble.</p><p>However, there are still many conceptual problems. Most notably, norm following is not obviously expressible as an optimization problem, and so may be hard to integrate into current AI approaches.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>(<em>Note: In the past I have referred to this process as ‘bootstrapping’ or ‘policy amplification,’ but those terms are too broad — there are other dimensions along which policies can be amplified, and ‘bootstrapping’ is used all over the place.</em>)</p><p>Defining the “intended behavior” of a powerful AI system is a challenge.</p><p>We don’t want such systems to simply imitate human behavior — we want them to improve upon human abilities. And we don’t want them to only take actions that look good to humans — we want them to improve upon human judgment.</p><p>We also don’t want them to pursue simple goals like “minimize the probability that the bridge falls down” or “pick the winning move.” A precise statement of our real goals would be incredibly complicated, and articulating them precisely is itself a massive project. Moreover, we often care about consequences over years or decades. Such long-term consequences would have little use as a <em>practical</em> problem definition in machine learning, even if they could serve as a <em>philosophical</em> problem definition.</p><p>So: what else can we do?</p><p>Instead of defining what it means for a policy to be “good,” we could define a transformation which turns one policy into a “better” policy.</p><p>I call such a transformation <em>capability amplification</em> — it “amplifies” a weak policy into a strong policy, typically by using more computational resources and applying the weak policy many times.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>I am interested in capability amplification because I think it is the most plausible route to defining the goals of powerful AI systems, which I see as a key bottleneck for building aligned AI. The most plausible alternative approach is probably inverse RL, but I think that there are still <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/the-easy-goal-inference-problem-is-still-hard-fad030e0a876#.hd34chtkp\">hard philosophical problems</a> to solve, and that in practice IRL would probably <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/ambitious-vs-narrow-value-learning-99bd0c59847e\">need to be combined with something like capability amplification</a>.</p><p>More directly, I think that capability amplification might be a workable approach to <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/alba-an-explicit-proposal-for-aligned-ai-17a55f60bbcf\">training powerful RL systems</a> when combined with <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/semi-supervised-reinforcement-learning-cf7d5375197f#.qrer176h2\">semi-supervised RL</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/red-teams-b5b6de33dc76#.xu7565k4b\">adversarial training</a>, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/the-informed-oversight-problem-1b51b4f66b35#.7vyxc2kzr\">informed oversight</a> (or another approach to <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/reward-engineering-f8b5de40d075#.rsuwkjdo3\">reward engineering</a>).</p><h2>Example of capability amplification: answering questions</h2><p>Suppose that we would like like to amplify one question-answering system <strong>A</strong>into a “better” question-answering system <strong>A⁺</strong>.</p><p>We will be given a question <em>Q</em> and an implementation of <strong>A</strong>; we can use <strong>A</strong>, or any other tools at our disposal, to try to answer the question <em>Q</em>. We have some time limit; in reality it might be eight hours, but for the purpose of a simple example suppose it is twenty seconds. The amplification <strong>A⁺</strong>(<em>Q</em>) is defined to be whatever answer we come up with by the end of the time limit. The goal is for this answer to be “better” than the answer that <strong>A</strong> would have given on its own, or to be able to answer harder questions than <strong>A</strong> could have answered directly.</p><p>For example, suppose that <em>Q</em> = “Which is more water-soluble, table salt or table sugar?” Suppose further that <strong>A</strong> can’t answer this question on its own: <strong>A</strong>(“Which is more water-soluble…”) = “I don’t know.”</p><p>I could start by computing <strong>A</strong>(“How do you quantify water-solubility?”); say this gives the answer “By measuring how much of the substance can dissolve in a fixed quantity of water.” Then I ask <strong>A</strong>(“How much table salt will dissolve in a liter of water?”) and get back the answer “360 grams.” Then I ask <strong>A</strong>(“How much sugar will dissolve in a liter of water?”) and get back the answer “2 kilograms.” Then I reply “Sugar is about six times more soluble than salt.”</p><p>Thus <strong>A⁺</strong>(“Which is more water-soluble, table salt or table sugar?”) = “Sugar is about six times more soluble than salt.” This is better than the answer that <strong>A</strong>gave — in some sense, we’ve successfully amplified <strong>A</strong> into something smarter.</p><h2>The general problem</h2><p>The capability amplification problem is to use one policy <strong>A</strong> to implement a new policy <strong>A⁺</strong> which is strictly “better” than <strong>A</strong>. (Recall that a policy is a mapping from inputs to outputs.)</p><p>We’ll discuss the definition of “better” in the next section, but for now you can use an intuitive definition. Note that “better” <em>does not</em> mean that we can implement <strong>A⁺</strong> using fewer computational resources than <strong>A</strong> — in fact we will implement <strong>A⁺</strong> by using a huge amount of computation and time.</p><p>What does it mean to “implement” the amplified policy <strong>A⁺</strong>? It means that we have some process that takes as input an observation <em>o</em>[1] and produce an action <em>a</em>[1]. It then takes as input the next observation <em>o</em>[2] and produces the next action <em>a</em>[2], and so on.</p><p>The process that implements <strong>A⁺</strong> may instantiate any number of agents who use the policy <strong>A</strong> and interact with them. The process might make copies of any of these agents. And the process can involve us personally thinking about the problem, or using any other tools that we have available — having access to <strong>A</strong>may be a useful resource, but we can also do things from scratch if that’s easier.</p><p>The capability amplification problem comes with a time limit — we need to provide an implementation that runs within that time limit. (When we submit one action <em>a</em>[k], we immediately see the next observation <em>o</em>[k+1].) Once the time limit runs out, we automatically output a nil action in response to each additional observation. One way to be “better” is to be able to handle longer sequences of observations.</p><p>The time limit could be arbitrary, but I’ll pick one day for concreteness. I’ll assume that we have an implementation of <strong>A</strong> that runs in one second per episode.</p><p>Note that we can start from the trivial policy <strong>∅</strong> which always outputs nil. In this case, <strong>∅⁺</strong> is a policy that we can implement “from scratch.”</p><h2>Reachability</h2><p>To measure how well we can solve capability amplification, we’ll introduce the concept of <em>reachability</em>.</p><p>Reachability is defined with respect to a class of policies <strong>𝒜</strong> and a preference ordering ⪰. Intuitively:</p><ul><li><strong>𝒜</strong> is a class of policies that we are capable of implementing efficiently. For example, <strong>𝒜</strong> might be the set of policies that can be implemented by a ten layer neural network.</li><li>We say that <strong>A</strong> ⪰ <strong>B</strong> if we are <em>at least as happy</em> with policy <strong>A</strong> as with policy <strong>B</strong>(in any situation that we think might arise in practice).</li></ul><p>We say that <strong>C</strong> is <em>reachable</em> from <strong>A</strong> if:</p><ul><li><strong>A</strong>⁺ ⪰ <strong>C</strong>, where <strong>A</strong>⁺ is the amplification as described in the last section; or</li><li>There is an intermediate <strong>B</strong> ∈ 𝓐 which is reachable from <strong>A</strong> and which can reach <strong>C</strong>.</li></ul><p>Equivalently:</p><ul><li><strong>C</strong> is reachable from <strong>A</strong> if there is a chain of policies in <strong>𝒜</strong> which starts at <strong>A</strong>and ends at <strong>C</strong>, and where each policy in the chain is no better than the amplification of the previous policy.</li></ul><p>The better we are at capability amplification, the more policies will be reachable from any given starting point. Our goal is to have as many policies as possible be reachable from the trivial policy <strong>∅</strong> — ideally, <em>every</em> policy in 𝓐 would be reachable from <strong>∅</strong>.</p><h2>Obstructions</h2><p>An <em>obstruction</em> to capability amplification is a partition of the policy class 𝓐 into two parts 𝓛 and 𝓗, such that we cannot amplify <em>any</em> policy in 𝓛 to be at least as good as <em>any</em> policy in 𝓗.</p><p>Obstructions are dual to reachability in a natural sense. If there are any non-reachable policies, then there is some corresponding obstruction. The desired output of research on capability amplification are a <em>matching</em> amplification strategy and obstruction — a way to reach many policies, and an obstruction that implies that we can’t reach any more.</p><p>Analogously, we say that a function <em>L</em> : 𝓐 → ℝ is an obstruction if our amplification procedure cannot always increase <em>L</em>. That is, <em>L</em> is an obstruction if there exists a threshold ℓ such that the two sets { <strong>A</strong> ∈ 𝓐 : <em>L</em>(<strong>A</strong>) ≤ ℓ } and { <strong>A</strong>∈ 𝓐 : <em>L</em>(<strong>A</strong>) &gt; ℓ} are an obstruction, or such that { <strong>A</strong> ∈ 𝓐 : <em>L</em>(<strong>A</strong>) &lt; ℓ } and { <strong>A</strong>∈ 𝓐 : <em>L</em>(<strong>A</strong>) ≥ ℓ} are an obstruction.</p><p>If we could find a convincing argument that some partition was an obstruction, then that would help further our understanding of value alignment. The next step would be to ask: can we sensibly define “good behavior” for policies in the inaccessible part 𝓗? I suspect this will help focus our attention on the most philosophically fraught aspects of value alignment.</p><p>In the appendices I give an example of an obstruction in a particular simple model.</p><h1>Relationship to value alignment</h1><h2>Why capability amplification seems feasible</h2><p>Capability amplification is a special case of the general problem of “building an AI that does the right thing.” It is easier in two respects:</p><ol><li>In the general problem we need to construct a “good” policy from scratch. In capability amplification we need to construct a good policy <strong>A</strong>⁺ starting from a slightly weaker policy <strong>A</strong>.</li><li>In the general problem we must <em>efficiently implement</em> a good policy. In capability amplification our implementation of <strong>A⁺</strong> is allowed to take up to a day, even though the goal is to improve upon a policy <strong>A</strong> that runs in one second.</li></ol><p>Intuitively, these seem like large advantages.</p><p>Nevertheless, it may be that capability amplification contains the hardest aspects of value alignment. If true, I think this would change our conception of the value alignment problem and what the core difficulties are. For example, if capability amplification is the “hard part,” then the value alignment problem is essentially orthogonal to the algorithmic challenge of building an intelligence.</p><h2>Why capability amplification seems useful</h2><p>Capability amplification can be combined with <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/the-reward-engineering-problem-30285c779450\">reward engineering</a> in a natural way:</p><ul><li>Define <strong>A0</strong> = <strong>∅</strong></li><li>Apply capability amplification to obtain <strong>A0⁺</strong></li><li>Apply reward engineering to define a reward function, and use this to train an agent <strong>A1</strong> which is better than <strong>A0</strong></li><li>Apply capability amplification to obtain <strong>A1⁺</strong></li><li>Repeat to obtain a sequence of increasingly powerful agents</li></ul><p>This is very informal, and actually carrying out such a process requires resolving many technical difficulties. But it suggests that capability amplification and reward engineering might provide a <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/alba-an-explicit-proposal-for-aligned-ai-17a55f60bbcf\">foundation for training an aligned AI</a>.</p><h1>What to do?</h1><h2>Theory</h2><p>The best approach seems to be to work from both sides, simultaneously searching for challenging obstructions and searching for amplification procedures that address those obstructions.</p><p>There are at least two very different angles on capability amplification:</p><ul><li>Collaboration: figure out how a bunch of agents using <strong>A</strong> can break a problem down into smaller pieces and attack those pieces separately, allowing them to solve harder problems than they could solve independently.</li><li>Philosophy: try to better understand what “good” reasoning is, so that we can better understand how good reasoning is composed of simpler steps. For example, mathematical proof is a technique which relates hard problems to long sequences of simple steps. There may be more general ideas along similar lines.</li></ul><p>In the appendices, I describe some possible amplification schemes and obstructions, along with some early ideas about capability amplification in general.</p><h2>Experiment</h2><p>Today, it is probably most worthwhile to study capability amplification when <strong>A</strong> is a <em>human’s</em> policy.</p><p>In this setting, we are given some weak human policy <strong>A</strong> — say, a human thinking for an hour. We would like to amplify this to a strong collaborative policy <strong>A⁺</strong>, by invoking a bunch of copies of <strong>A</strong> and having them interact with each other appropriately.</p><p>In some sense this is the fully general problem of organizing human collaborations. But we can focus our attention on the most plausible obstructions for capability amplification, and try to design collaboration frameworks that let us overcome those obstructions.</p><p>In this context, I think the most interesting obstruction is working with concepts that are (slightly) too complicated for any individual copy of <strong>A</strong> to understand on its own. This looks like a hard problem that is mostly unaddressed by usual approaches to collaboration.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/human-arguments-and-ai-control-bc99c043a5ec#.6lxam64e0\">This post</a> lays out a closely related problem — quickly evaluating arguments by experts — which gets at most of the same difficulties but may be easier to study. Superficially, evaluating arguments may seem easier than solving problems from scratch. But because it is so much easier to collaboratively <em>create</em> arguments once you have a way to evaluate them, I think the gap is probably only superficial.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The capability amplification problem may effectively isolate the central <em>philosophical</em> difficulties of value alignment. It’s not easy to guess how hard it is — we may already have “good enough” solutions, or it may effectively be a restatement of the original problem.</p><p>Capability amplification asks us to implement a powerful policy that “behaves well,” but it is easier than value alignment in two important respects: we are given access to a slightly weaker policy, and our implementation can be extremely inefficient. It may be that these advantages are not significant advantages, but if so that would require us to significantly change our understanding of what the value alignment problem is about.</p><p>Capability amplification appears to be less tractable than the other research problems I’ve outlined. I think it’s unlikely to be a good research direction for machine learning researchers interested in value alignment. But it may be a good topic for researchers with a philosophical focus who are especially interested in attacking problems that might otherwise be neglected.</p><p><em>(This research was supported as part of the</em> <em><a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/\">Future of Life Institute</a></em> <em>FLI-RFP-AI1 program, grant #2015–143898.)</em></p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><h2>Appendix: iterating amplification</h2><p>Let <strong>H</strong> be the input-output behavior of a human + all of the non-<strong>A</strong> tools at their disposal. Then an amplification procedure defines <strong>A</strong>⁺ as a simple computation that uses <strong>H</strong> and <strong>A</strong> as subroutines.</p><p>In particular, <strong>∅⁺</strong> is a computation that uses <strong>H</strong> as a subroutine. If we amplify again, we obtain <strong>∅⁺⁺</strong>, which is a computation that uses <strong>H</strong> and <strong>∅⁺</strong> as subroutines. But since <strong>∅⁺</strong> is a simple computation that uses <strong>H</strong> as a subroutine, we can rewrite <strong>∅⁺⁺</strong> as a simple computation that uses only <strong>H</strong> as a subroutine.</p><p>We can go on in this way, reaching <strong>∅⁺⁺⁺</strong>, <strong>∅⁺⁺⁺⁺</strong> and so on. By induction, all of these policies are defined by simple computations that use as <strong>H</strong> as a subroutine. (Of course these “simple computations” are exponentially expensive, even though they are easy to specify. But they have a simple form and can be easily written down in terms of the amplification procedure.)</p><p>Under some simple ergodicity assumptions, this sequence converges to a fixed point <strong>Ω</strong> (very similar to <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/strong-hch-bedb0dc08d4e#.o8kfuzc27\">HCH</a>). So a capability amplification procedure essentially uniquely defines an “optimal” policy <strong>Ω</strong>; this policy is uncomputable, but has a concise representation in terms of <strong>H</strong>.</p><p>If there is anything that <strong>Ω</strong> can’t do, then we have found an unreachable policy. This perspective seems useful for identifying the hard part of the capability amplification problem.</p><p>Specifying an amplification strategy also specifies a way to set up an interaction between a bunch of copies of <strong>H</strong> such that they implement <strong>Ω</strong>. Indeed, designing such an interaction is <em>easier</em> than designing an amplification procedure that converges to <strong>Ω</strong>. So if we can’t design a procedure for a bunch of copies of <strong>H</strong> to collaboratively accomplish some task T, then we also can’t design an amplification procedure that can reach policies that can accomplish T.</p><p>But in some cases this seems extremely challenging. For example, suppose that we would like to write a very good textbook about general relativity. Recall that <strong>H</strong> is the policy implemented by a human over one day. To make the game hard, suppose that <strong>H</strong> has never encountered calculus.</p><p>The most natural approaches require at least one copy of <strong>H</strong> to understand general relativity. But <strong>H</strong> only lasts a single day, and there many not be <em>any</em> sequence of observations that makes <strong>H</strong> understand general relativity within a day.</p><p>So in order for <strong>Ω</strong> to succeed at this task, it needs to be able to write a textbook without <em>any</em> single copy of <strong>H</strong> understanding general relativity. The understanding must instead be distributed across a large number of copies of <strong>H</strong>. Yet they must somehow collaborate to write individual sentences that correctly communicate the theory.</p><p>This sounds like a hard problem.</p><h2>Appendix: examples of capability amplification</h2><p>ETA: my current best proposal is <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/meta-execution-27ba9b34d377#.qrr0vi904\">meta-execution</a>, which is essentially a formalization of the “universal” scheme below.</p><p><strong>Warmup I: Preprocessing</strong></p><p>We instantiate a “leader” agent who uses the policy <strong>A</strong>. For each observation <em>o</em>[<em>k</em>]:</p><ul><li>We instantiate a new agent using <strong>A</strong>. We give them observation: “think about the observation {<em>o</em>[<em>k</em>]} and output a useful hint for a copy of yourself who has to respond to it.” Let <em>h</em>[<em>k</em>] be the agent’s action. Then we destroy the agent.</li><li>We give the leader the observation “The observation is {<em>o</em>[<em>k</em>]}, and a copy of you prepared the hint {<em>h</em>[<em>k</em>]}.” Let <em>a</em>[<em>k</em>] be its action.</li></ul><p>We might hope that this composite is smarter than <strong>A</strong>. After all, it has twice as long to think — even if the copy can’t come up with a very helpful hint, it doesn’t seem so hard to come up with a hint that is better than nothing.</p><p><strong>Warmup II: Asking questions</strong></p><p>We instantiate a “leader” agent who uses the policy <strong>A</strong>. We give each observation <em>o</em>[<em>k</em>] to the leader, and ask them to reply with an action <em>a</em>[<em>k</em>].</p><p>But we also allow the leader to instantiate subagents and communicate with those agents.</p><p>That is, if the leader takes an action of the special form “Instantiate a new agent” then we create a new agent using <strong>A</strong>, assign it a unique ID, and give the leader the observation: “A new agent has been created with ID [X].” Similarly, the leader can take the special action “Copy the agent with ID [X].”</p><p>If the leader takes an action of the special form “Ask [Q] to the agent with ID [X]” then we give Q as an observation to the agent with ID X. That agent will reply with some action A, and we give the leader the next observation: “The agent replied with [A].”</p><p>Eventually, the leader takes an action of the special form “Take action [A]”. Then we set <em>a</em>[<em>k</em>] = A, and move on to the next observation.</p><p>The scheme from the last section is essentially the special case where the leader instantiates a single subagent and asks the single question “What is a useful hint for responding to observation <em>o</em>[<em>k</em>]?”</p><p><strong>Warmup III: Recursion</strong></p><p>We improve the scheme from the last section by allowing <em>every</em> agent to instantiate new subagents, rather than restricting this capability to the leader.</p><p>The messages between agents can contain not only words, but pointers to other agents. This allows the agents to pass arbitrarily large messages. For example, they can build a data structure out of agents, and just pass a “pointer” to the root of that data structure.</p><p>We can also slightly improve the scheme by allowing the leader to copy <em>itself</em>. This may be helpful if the leader has built up some useful context for the current situation.</p><p><strong>Universal amplification</strong></p><p>We improve the scheme further by giving the agents a large external memory. Rather than directly giving the leader the observation <em>o</em>[<em>k</em>], we write the observation to the external memory and tell the leader where the observation is written.</p><p>In addition to allowing agents to instantiate new agents and communicate with them, any agent can take the action “execute [P]”, where P is a program to be run against the external memory; the agent sees the observation “the program returned [<em>x</em>]” where <em>x</em> is P’s return value (or “nothing”).</p><p>Rather than having the leader directly return an action, the leader can take the special action “output the action returned by program [P].”</p><p>Messages between agents can now contain pointers to this external memory. For example, the leader could instantiate a subagent and ask it the question “Can you distinguish [<em>x</em>] from an array of random bytes?” where <em>x</em> is a pointer to an array in external memory.</p><p>We can easily generalize this setup to a parallel model of computation. We can also replace the shared memory by a more natural model for interprocess communication.</p><h2>Appendix: knowledge about humans</h2><p>Human values are complex. If you are only able to interact with a human for a day, it may be completely impossible to figure out what they value, no matter how smart you are. Understanding what someone values may require giving them a large amount of time to reflect on their values, doing neuroscience, or carrying out other processes that take longer than a day.</p><p>This may imply an obstruction to capability amplification — we can’t reach policies that have more knowledge about humans than can be acquired by interacting with <strong>H.</strong></p><p>However, even if this is a real obstruction, it does not seem to be an important one, for the following reason.</p><p>Suppose that we are able to train a very good policy, which does not reflect any complex facts about human values-upon-reflection. This optimal policy still can reflect many basic facts about human preferences:</p><ol><li>We don’t want anything terrible to happen.</li><li>We want to “stay in control” of the agents we build.</li><li>We don’t want our agent to get left behind by its competitors; it should fight as hard as it can to retain influence over the world, subject to #1 and #2.</li></ol><p>Moreover, all of these concepts are relatively easy to understand even if you have minimal understanding of human values.</p><p>So an excellent agent with a minimal understanding of human values seems OK. Such an agent could avoid getting left behind by its competitors, and remain under human control. Eventually, once it got enough information to understand human values (say, by interacting with humans), it could help us implement our values.</p><p>In the worst case the agent would lack a nuanced understanding of what we consider terrible, and so would have to either be especially conservative or else risk doing terrible things in the short term. In the scheme of things, this is not a catastrophic problem.</p><h2>Appendix: an example obstruction</h2><p>Suppose that my brain encodes a random function <em>f</em>: {0, 1}* → {0, 1} in the following sense: you can give me a sequence of bits, one per second, and then I can tell you the value of <em>f</em> on that sequence. There is no way to evaluate <em>f</em>other than to ask me.</p><p>Let N be the length of our capability amplification procedure, in seconds.</p><p>Let 𝓛 ⊆ 𝓐 be the set of policies that can be implemented using an oracle for <em>f</em>, restricted to inputs of length N.</p><p>Then it’s easy to see that 𝓛 forms an obstruction:</p><ul><li>We can simulate access to any policy in 𝓛 using an oracle for <em>f</em> restricted to inputs of length N. And we can simulate my role in the amplification procedure using an oracle for <em>f</em> restricted to inputs of length N. So policies in 𝓛 can only be amplified to other policies in 𝓛.</li><li>We cannot evaluate <em>f</em> on even a single input of length N+1 using an oracle for <em>f</em> on inputs of length N. Most interesting classes 𝓐 will contain some policies not in 𝓛.</li></ul><p>Whether this is a real obstruction depends on what the information is about:</p><ul><li>If it’s just random bits, then we don’t care at all — any other random bits would be “just as good.”</li><li>If the random function encodes important information about my values, then we are in the situation described in the previous section, which doesn’t seem so bad.</li><li>The worst case is when the function <em>f</em> encodes important information about how to behave effectively. For example, it encodes information about how to make accurate predictions. In this case we may actually be in trouble, since a policy that doesn’t know <em>f</em> may be outcompeted by one which does.</li></ul><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>This was originally posted <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34\">here</a> on 2nd October 2016.</em></p><p><em>The next post in this sequence will be &#x27;Learning with catastrophes&#x27; by Paul Christiano.</em></p><p><em>Tomorrow&#x27;s post will be &#x27;Following Human Norms&#x27; in the sequence Value Learning by Rohin Shah.</em></p><br/>",

What is frustrating  is the failure to think outside of those models and proofs, analyzing the practical implications.</p>\n<p>In this particular paper, the central idea is that when risk is unlimited and free, ratcheting up competition dramatically increases risk taken. This introduces sufficient noise that adding more competitors can make the average winner less skilled. At the margin, adding additional similar competitors to a very large pool has zero impact. Adding competitors with less expected promise makes things worse.</p>\n<p>This can apply in the real world. The paper provides a good example of a very good insight that is then proven ‘too much,’ and which does not then question or vary its assumptions in the ways I would find most interesting.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>I. The Basic Model and its Central Point</h4>\n<p>Presume some number of job openings. There are weak candidates and strong candidates. Each candidate knows if they are strong or weak, but not how many other candidates are strong, nor do those running the contest know how many are strong.</p>\n<p>The goal of the competition is to select as many strong candidates as possible. Or formally, to maximize [number of strong selected – number of weak selected], which is the same thing if the number of candidates is fixed, but is importantly different later when the number of selected candidates can vary. Each candidate performs and is given a score, and for an N-slot competition, the highest N scores are picked.</p>\n<p>By default, strong candidates score X and weak candidates score Y, X&gt;Y, but each candidate can also take on as much risk as they wish, with any desired distribution of scores, so long as their score never goes below zero.</p>\n<p>The paper then does assumes reflexive equilibrium, does math and proves a bunch of things that happen next. The math checks out; I duplicated the results intuitively.</p>\n<p>There are two types of equilibrium.</p>\n<p>In the first type, <em>concession equilibria, </em>strong candidates take no risk and are almost always chosen. Weak candidates take risk to try and beat other weak candidates, but attempting to beat strong candidates isn’t worthwhile. This allows strong candidates to take zero risk.</p>\n<p>In the second type, <em>challenge equilibria,</em> weak candidates attempt to be chosen over strong candidates, forcing strong candidates to take risk.</p>\n<p>If I am a weak candidate, I can be at least (Y/X) as likely as a strong candidate to be selected by copying their strategy with probability (Y/X) and scoring 0 otherwise. This seems close to optimal in a challenge equilibria.</p>\n<p>Adding more candidates, strong or weak, risks shifting from a concession to a challenge equilibria. Each additional candidate, of any strength, makes challenge a better option relative to concession.</p>\n<p>If competition is ‘insufficiently intense’ then we get a concession equilibria. We successfully identify every strong candidate, at the cost of accepting some weak ones. If competition is ‘too intense’ we lose that. The extra candidate that tips us over the edge makes things much worse. After that, quantity does not matter, only the ratio of weak candidates to strong.</p>\n<p>Even if search is free, and you continue to sample from the same pool, hitting the threshold hurts you, and further expansion does nothing. Interviewing one million people for ten jobs, a tenth of which are strong, is not better than ten thousand, or even one hundred. Ninety might be better.</p>\n<p>Since costs are never zero (and rarely negative), and the pool usually degrades as it expands, this argues strongly for limited competitions with weaker selection criteria, including via various hacks to the system.</p>\n<h4>II. What To Do, and What This Implies, If This Holds</h4>\n<p>The paper does a good job analyzing what happens if its conditions hold.</p>\n<p>If one has a fixed set of positions to fill (winners to pick) and wants to pick the maximum number of strong candidates, with no cost to expanding the pool of candidates, the ideal case is to pick the maximum number of strong candidates that maintains a concession equilibrium. With no control (by assumption) over who you select or how to select them, this is the same as picking the maximum number of candidates that maintains a concession equilibrium, no matter what decrease in quality you might get while expanding the pool.</p>\n<p>The tipping point makes this a Price Is Right style situation. Get as close to the number as possible without going over. Going over is quite bad, worse than a substantial undershoot.</p>\n<p>One can think of probably not interviewing enough strong candidates, and probably hiring some weak candidates, as the price you must pay to be allowed to sort strong candidates from weak candidates – <strong>you need to ‘pay off’ the weak ones to not try and fool the system</strong>. An extra benefit is that even as you fill all the slots, <em>you know who is who, </em>which can be valuable information in the future. Even if you’re stuck with them, better to know that.</p>\n<p>A similar dynamic comes if choosing how many candidates to select from a fixed pool, or when choosing both candidate and pool sizes.</p>\n<p>If one attempts to only have slots for strong candidates, under unlimited free risk taking, you guarantee a challenge equilibria. Your best bet will therefore probably be to pick enough candidates from the pool to create a concession equilibrium, just like choosing a smaller candidate pool.</p>\n<p>The paper considers hiring a weak candidate as a -1, and hiring a strong candidate as a +1. The conclusions don’t vary much if this changes, since there are lots of other numerical knobs left unspecified that can cancel this out. But it is worth noting that in most cases the ratio is far less favorable than that. The default is that one good hire is <em>far</em> less good than one bad hire is bad. True bad hires are rather terrible (as opposed to all right but less than the best).</p>\n<p>Thus, when the paper points out that it is sometimes impossible to reliably break 50% strong candidates under realistic conditions, no matter how many people are interviewed and how many slots are given out, they <em>underestimate </em>the chance that the system breaks down entirely into no contest at all, and no production.</p>\n<p>What is the best we can do, if all assumptions hold?</p>\n<p>The minimum portion of weak candidates accepted scales linearly with their presence in the pool, and with how strongly they perform relative to strong candidates. Thus we set the pool size such that this fills out the pool with some margin of error.</p>\n<p>That is best if we set the pool size but nothing else. The paper considers college admissions. A college is advised to solve for which candidates are above a fixed threshold, then choose at random from those above the threshold (which is a suggestion one would only make in a paper with zero search costs, since once you have enough worthy candidates <em>you can stop searching, </em>but shrug.) Thus, we can always choose to arbitrarily limit the pool.</p>\n<p>In practice, attempting this would change the pool of applicants. In a way you won’t like. You are more attractive to weak candidates and less attractive to strong ones. Weak candidates flood in to ‘take their shot,’ causing a vicious cycle of reputation and pool decay. You’ve not a good reach school or a safe school for a strong candidate, so why bother? If other colleges copy you, students respond by investing less in becoming strong and more in <em>sending out all the applications, </em>and the remaining strong candidates remain at risk.</p>\n<p>True reflexive equilibria almost never exist, given the possible angles of response, and differences between people’s knowledge, preferences and cognition.</p>\n<h4>III. Relax Reflective Equilibrium</h4>\n<p>Even if it is common knowledge that only two candidate strengths exist, and all candidates of each type are identical (which they aren’t), they will get different information and react differently, destroying reflexive equilibrium.</p>\n<p>Players will not expect all others to jump with certainty between equilibria at some size threshold. Because they won’t. Which creates different equilibria.</p>\n<p>Some players don’t know game theory, or don’t pay attention to strategy. Those players, as a group, lose. Smart game theory always has the edge.</p>\n<p>An intuition pump: Learning game theory is costly, so the equilibrium requires it to pay off. Compare to the efficient market hypothesis.</p>\n<p><em>Some</em> weak candidates will always attempt to pass as strong candidates. There is a gradual shift from most not doing so to almost everyone doing so. More weak candidates steadily take on more risk. Eventually most of them mostly take on large risk to do their impression of a strong candidate. Strong candidates slowly start taking more risk more often as they sense their position becoming unsafe.</p>\n<p>Zero risk isn’t stable anyway without continuous skill levels. Strong candidates notice that <em>exactly zero </em>risk puts them behind candidates who take on extra tail risk to get epsilon above them. Zero risk is a default strategy, so beating that baseline is wise.</p>\n<p>Now those doing this try to outbid each other, until strong candidates lose to weak candidates at least sometimes. This risk will cap out very low if strong candidates consider the risk of losing at around their average performance to also be minuscule, but it will have to exist. Otherwise, there’s an almost free action in making one’s poor performances worse, since they are already losing to almost all other strong candidates, and doing that allows one to make their stronger performances better and/or more likely.</p>\n<p>The generalization of this rule is that <strong>whenever you introduce a possible outcome into the system, and provide <em>any </em>net benefit to <em>anyone </em>if they do things that make the outcome more likely, there is now a chance that the outcome happens.</strong> Even if the outcome is ‘divorce,’ ‘government default,’ ‘forced liquidation,’ ‘we both drive off the cliff’ or ‘nuclear war.’ It probably also isn’t epsilon. While risk is near epsilon, taking actions that increase risk will look essentially free, so <em>until the risk is big enough to matter </em>it will keep increasing. Therefore, every risk isn’t only <em>possible. </em>Every risk <em>will matter. </em>Given enough time, someone will miscalculate, and Murphy’s Law ensues.</p>\n<p>Future post: Possible bad outcomes are really bad.</p>\n<p>Stepping back, the right strategy for each competitor will be to guess the performance levels that efficiently translate into wins, making sure to maximally bypass levels others are likely to naively select (such as zero risk strategies), and generally play like they’re in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blotto_game\">a variation of the game of Blotto</a>.</p>\n<p>A lot of these results are driven by discrete skill levels, so let’s get rid of those next.</p>\n<h4>IV. Allow Continuous Skill Levels</h4>\n<p>Suppose instead of two skill levels, each player has their own skill level, and a rough and noisy idea where they lie in the distribution.</p>\n<p>Each player has resources to distribute across probability. Success is increasing as a function of performance. Thinking players aim for performance levels they believe are efficient, and do not waste resources on performance levels that matter less.</p>\n<p>All competitors also know that the chance of winning with low performance is almost zero. The value of additional performance probably gradually increases (positive second derivative) until it peaks at an inflection point, and then starts to decline as success starts to approach probability one. There may be additional quirky places in the distribution where extra performance is especially valuable. This exact curve won’t be known to anyone, different players will have different guesses partly based on their own abilities, and ability levels are continuous.</p>\n<p>A sufficiently strong candidate, who expects their average performance to be above the inflection point, should take no risk. A weaker candidate should approximate the inflection point, and risk otherwise scoring a zero performance to reach that point. Simple.</p>\n<p>If the distribution of skill levels is bumpy, what happens then? We have strong candidates and weak candidates (e.g. let’s say college graduates and high school graduates, or some have worked in the field and some haven’t, or whatever) so there’s a two-peak distribution of skill levels. Unless people are badly misinformed, we’ll still get a normal-looking distribution. If the two groups calculate very different expected thresholds, we’ll see two peaks.</p>\n<p>In general, but not always, enough players will miscalculate or compete for the ‘everyone failed’ condition that trying to do so is a losing play. Occasionally there will be good odds to hoping enough others aim too high and miss.</p>\n<p>Rather than have a challenge and a concession equilibrium, we have a threshold equilibrium. Everyone has a noisy estimate of the threshold they need. Those capable of reliably hitting the threshold take no risk, and usually make it. Those not capable of reliably hitting the threshold risk everything to make the threshold as often as possible.</p>\n<p>Note that this equilibrium holds, although it may contain no one above the final threshold. If everyone aims for what they think is good-enough performance, aiming for less is almost worthless, and aiming for much more is mostly pointless, and threshold adjusts so that the expected number of threshold performances is very close to the number of slots.</p>\n<p>More competition raises the threshold, forcing competitors to take on more risk, until everyone is using the same threshold strategy and success is purely proportional to skill. Thus, in a large pool, we once again have expanding the pool as a bad idea if it weakens average skill, even if search and participation costs for all are free.</p>\n<p>In a small pool, the strongest candidates are ‘wasting’ some of their skill on less efficient outcomes beyond their best estimate of the threshold.</p>\n<p>This ends up being similar to the challenge case, except that there is no inflection point where things suddenly get worse. You never expect to lose from expanding the pool while maintaining quality. Instead, things slowly get better as you waste less work at the top of the curve, so the value of adding more similar candidates quickly approaches zero.</p>\n<p>The new intuition is, given low enough search costs, we should add equally strong potential candidates until we are confident everyone is taking risk, rather than stopping just short of causing stronger candidates to take risk. If participation is costly to you and/or the candidates, you should likely stop short of that point.</p>\n<p>The key intuitive question to ask is, if a candidate was the type of person you want, would they be so far ahead of the game as to be obviously better than the current expected marginal winner? Would they be able to crush a much bigger pool, and thus be effectively wasting lots of effort? If and only if that’s true, there’s probably benefit to expanding your search, so you get more such people, and it’s a question of whether it is worth the cost.</p>\n<p>The other strong intuition is that once your marginal applicant pool is lower in average quality than your average pool, that will always be a high cost, so focus on quality over quantity.</p>\n<p>This suggests another course of action…</p>\n<h4>V. Multi-Stage Process</h4>\n<p>Our model tells us that average quality of winners is, given a large pool, a function of the <em>average </em>quality of our base pool.</p>\n<p>But we have a huge advantage: This whole process <em>is free.</em></p>\n<p>Given that, it seems like we should be able to be a bit more clever and complex, and do better.</p>\n<p>We can improve if we can get a pool of candidates that has a higher <em>average quality </em>than our original candidate pool, but which is large enough to get us into a similar equilibrium. Each candidate’s success is proportional to their skill level, so our average outcome improves.</p>\n<p>We already have a selection process that does this. We know our winners will be on average better than our candidates. So why not use that to our advantage?</p>\n<p>Suppose we did a multi-stage competition. Before, we would have had 10 applicants for 1 slot. Expanding that to 100 applicants won’t do us any good directly, because of risk taking. But running 10 competitions with 10 people each, then pitting those 10 winners against each other, will improve things for us.</p>\n<p>By using this tactic multiple times, we can do quite a bit better. Weaker candidates will almost never survive multiple rounds.</p>\n<p>What happened here?</p>\n<p>We cheated. We forced candidates to take observable, <em>uncorrelated </em>risks in each different round. We destroyed the rule that risk taking is free and easy, and assumed that a lucky result in round 1 won’t help you in round 2.</p>\n<p>If a low-skill person can <em>permanently </em>mimic in all ways a high-skill person, and we observe that success, <em>they are high skill now! </em>A worthy winner. If they can’t, then they fall back down to Earth on further observation. This should make clear why the idea of <em>unlimited cheap and exactly controlled risk </em>is profoundly bizarre. A test that works that way is a rather strange test.</p>\n<p>So is a test that costs nothing to administer. You get what you pay for.</p>\n<p>The risk is that risk-taking takes the form of ‘guess the right approach to the testing process’ and thus test scores are correlated without having to link back to skill.</p>\n<p>This is definitely a thing.</p>\n<p>During one all-day job interview, I made several fundamental interview-skill mistakes that hurt me in multiple sessions. If I had fixed those mistakes, I would have done much better all day, <em>but would not have been much more skilled at what they were testing for. </em>A more rigorous or multi-step process could have only done so much. To get better information, they would have had to add a <em>different kind of test.</em> That would risk introducing bad noise.</p>\n<p>This seems typical of similar contests and testing methods designed to find strong candidates.</p>\n<p>A more realistic model would introduce costs to participation in the search process, for all parties. You’d have another trade-off between having noise be correlated versus minimizing its size, making more rounds of analysis progressively less useful.</p>\n<p>Adding more candidates to the pool now clearly is good at first and then turns increasingly negative.</p>\n<h4>VI. Pricing People Out</h4>\n<p>There are two realistic complications that can help us a lot.</p>\n<p>The first is pricing people out. Entering a contest is rarely free. I have been fortunate that my last two job interviews were at Valve Software and Jane Street Capital. Both were exceptional companies looking for exceptional people, and I came away from both interviews feeling like I’d had a very fun and very educational experience, in addition to leveling up my interview skills. So <em>those particular </em>interviews felt free or better. But most are not.</p>\n<p>Most are more like when I applied to colleges. Each additional college meant a bunch of extra work plus an application fee. Harvard does not want to admit a weak candidate. If we ignore the motivation to show that you have lots of applications, Harvard would prefer that weak candidates not apply. It wastes time, and there’s a non-zero chance one will gain admission by accident. If Harvard taxes applications, by requiring additional effort or raising the fee, they will drive weak applicants away and strengthen their pool, improving the final selections.</p>\n<p>Harvard also does this by making Harvard hard. A sufficiently weak candidate should not <em>want </em>to go to Harvard, because they will predictably flunk out. Making Harvard harder, the way MIT is hard, would make their pool higher quality once word got out.</p>\n<p>We can think of some forms of hazing, or other bad experiences for winners of competitions, partly as a way to discourage weak candidates from applying, and also partly as an additional test to drive them out.</p>\n<p>Ideally we also <em>reduce risk taken. </em></p>\n<p>A candidate has uncertainly in how strong they are, and how much they would benefit from the prize. If being a stronger candidate is correlated with benefiting from winning, a correct strategy becomes to take less or no risk. If taking a big risk causes me to win when I would otherwise lose, <em>I won a prize I don’t want. </em>If taking a big risk causes me to lose, <em>I lost a prize I did want. </em>That pushes me heavily towards lowering my willingness to take risk, which in turn lowers the competition level and encourages me to take less risk still. Excellent.</p>\n<h4>VII. Taking Extra Risk is Hard</h4>\n<p>Avoiding risk is also hard.</p>\n<p>In the real world, there is a ‘natural’ amount of risk in any activity. One is continuously offered options with varying risk levels.</p>\n<p>Some of these choices are big, some small. Sometimes the risky play is ‘better’ in an expected value sense, sometimes worse.</p>\n<p>True max-min strategies that avoid even minimal risks decline even small risks that would cancel out over time. This is expensive.</p>\n<p>If one wants to maximize risk at all costs, one ends up doing the more risky thing every time and takes bad gambles. This is also expensive.</p>\n<p>It is a hard problem to get the best outcome given one’s desired level of risk, or to maximize the chance of exceeding some performance threshold, even with no opponent. In games with an opponent who wants to beat you and thus has the opposite incentives of yours (think football) it gets harder still. Real world performances are notoriously terrible.</p>\n<p>There are two basic types of situations with respect to risk.</p>\n<p>Type one is where adding risk is expensive. There is a natural best route to work or line of play. There are other strategies that overall are worse, but have bigger upside, such as taking on particular downside tail risks in exchange for tiny payoffs, or hoping for a lucky result. In the driving example, one might take an on average slower route that has variable amounts of traffic, or one might drive faster and risk an accident or speeding ticket.</p>\n<p>Available risk is limited. If I am two hours away by car, I might be able to do something reckless and maybe get there in an hour and forty five minutes, but if I have to get there in an hour, it’s not going to happen.</p>\n<p>I can hope to ever overcome only a limited skill barrier. If we are racing in the Indianapolis 500, I might try to win the race by skipping a pit stop, or passing more aggressively to make up ground, or choosing a car that is slightly faster but has more engine trouble. But if my car combined with my driving skill is substantially slower than yours (where substantially means a minute over several hours) and your car doesn’t crash or die, <em>I will never beat you. </em></p>\n<p>If I had taken the math Olympiad exam (the USAMO) another hundred times, I might have gotten a <em>non-zero </em>score sometimes, but I was never getting onto the team. Period.</p>\n<p>In these situations, reducing risk beyond the ‘natural’ level may not even be possible. If it is, it will be increasingly expensive.</p>\n<p>Type two is where giant risks are the default, then sacrifices are made to contain those risks. Gamblers who do not pay attention to risk will always go broke. To be a winning gambler, one can either be lucky and retain large risk, or one can be skilled and pay a lot of attention to containing risk. In the long term, containing risk, including containing risk by ceasing to play at all, is the only option.</p>\n<p><strong>Competitors in type two situations must be evaluated explicitly on their risk management</strong>, or on very long term results, or any evaluation is worthless. If you are testing for good gamblers and only have one day, you pay some attention to results but more attention to the logic behind choices and sizing. Tests that do otherwise get essentially random results, and follow the pattern where reducing the applicant pool improves the quality of the winners.</p>\n<p>Another note is that the risks competitors take can be <em>correlated across competitors </em>in many situations. If you need a sufficiently high rank rather than a high raw score, those who take risks should seek to take <em>uncorrelated </em>risks. Thus, in stock market or gambling competitions, the primary skill often is in doing something no one else would think to do, rather than in picking a high expected value choice. Sometimes that’s what real risk means.</p>\n<h4>VIII. Central Responses</h4>\n<p>There are also four additional responses by those running the competition, that are worth considering.</p>\n<p>The first response is to observe a competitor’s level of risk taking and test optimization, and penalize too much (or too little). This is often quite easy. Everyone knows what a safe answer to ‘what is your greatest weakness’ looks like, bet size in simulations is transparent, and so on. If you respond to things going badly early on with taking a lot of risk, rather than being responsible, will you do that with the company’s money?</p>\n<p>A good admissions officer at a college mostly knows instantly which essays had professional help and which resumes are based on statistical analysis, versus who lived their best life and then applied to college.</p>\n<p>A good competition design gives you the opportunity to measure these considerations.</p>\n<p>Such contests should be anti-inductive, if done right, with the really sneaky players playing on higher meta levels. Like everything else.</p>\n<p>The second response is to vary the number of winners based on how well competitors do. This is the default.</p>\n<p>If I interview three job applicants and all of them show up hung over, I need to be pretty desperate to take the one who was <em>less </em>hung over, rather than call in more candidates tomorrow. If I find three great candidates for one job, I’ll do my best to find ways to hire all three.</p>\n<p>Another variation is that I have an insider I know well as the default winner, and the application process is to see if I can do better than that, and to keep the insider and the company honest, so again it’s mostly about crossing a bar.</p>\n<p>The third response is that often there isn’t even a ‘batch’ of applications. There is only a series of permanent yes/no decisions until the position is filled. This is the classic problem of finding a spouse or a secretary, where you can’t easily go back once you reject someone. Once you have a sense of the distribution of options, you’re effectively looking for ‘good enough’ at every step, and that requirement doesn’t move much until time starts running out.</p>\n<p>Thus, most contests <em>that care mostly about finding a worthy winner </em>are closer to threshold requirements than they look. This makes it very difficult to create a concession equilibrium. If you show up and aren’t good enough to beat continuing to search, your chances are very, very bad. If you show up and are <em>are </em>good enough to beat continuing to search, your chances are very good. The right strategy becomes either to aim at this threshold, or if the field is large you might need to aim higher. You can never keep the field small enough to keep the low-skill players honest.</p>\n<p>The fourth response is to punish sufficiently poor performance. This can be as mild as in-the-moment social embarrassment – Simon mocking aspirants in American Idol. It can be as serious as ‘you’re fired,’ either from the same company (you revealed you’re not good enough for your current job, or your upside is limited), or from another company (how dare you try to jump ship!). In fiction a failed application can be lethal. Even mild retaliation is very effective in improving average quality (and limiting the size) of the talent pool.</p>\n<h4>IX. Practical Conclusions</h4>\n<p>We don’t purely want the best person for the job. We want a selection process that balances search costs, for all concerned, with finding the best person and perhaps getting your applicants to improve their skill.</p>\n<p>A weaker version of the paper’s core take-away heuristic seems to hold up under more analysis: <strong><em>There is a limit to how far expanding a search helps you at all, even before costs. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rule 1: Pool quality on the margin usually matters more than quantity. </strong></p>\n<p>Bad applicants that can make it through are more bad than they appear. Expanding the pool’s quantity at the expense of average quality, once your supply of candidates isn’t woefully inadequate, is usually a bad move.</p>\n<p><b>Rule 2: Once your application pool probably includes enough identifiable top-quality candidates to fill all your slots, up to your ability to differentiate, stop looking.</b></p>\n<p>A larger pool will make your search more expensive and difficult for both you and them, add more regret because choices are bad, and won’t make you more likely to choose wisely.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a later stopping point than the paper recommends. The paper says you should stop <em>before </em>you fill all your slots, such that weak applicants are encouraged not to represent themselves as strong candidates.</p>\n<p>Also note that this rule has two additional requirements. It requires the good candidates be identifiable, since if some of them will blow it or you’ll blow noticing them, that doesn’t help you. It also requires that there not be outliers waiting to be discovered, that you would recognize if you saw them.</p>\n<p>Another, similar heuristic that is also good is, <strong>make the competition just intense enough that worthy candidates are worried they won’t get the job. Then stop.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rule 3: Weak candidates must either be driven away, or rewarded for revealing themselves. If weak candidates can successfully fake being strong, it is worth a lot to ensure that this strategy is punished.</strong></p>\n<p>Good punishments include application fees, giving up other opportunities or jobs, long or stressful competitions, and punishments for failure ranging from mild in-the-room social disapproval or being made to feel dumb, up to major retaliation.</p>\n<p>Another great punishment is to give less rewards to success if it is by a low skilled person. If their prize is something they can’t use – they’ll flunk out, or get fired quickly, or similar – then they will be less inclined to apply.</p>\n<p>Reward for participation is probability of success times reward for success, while cost is mostly fixed. Tilt this enough and your bad-applicant problem clears up.</p>\n<p>Fail to tilt this enough, and you have a big lemon problem on multiple levels. Weak competitors will choose your competition over others, giving strong applicants less reason to bother both in terms of chance of winning, and desire to win. Who wants to win only to be among a bunch of fakers who got lucky? That’s no fun and it’s no good for your reputation either.</p>\n<p>It will be difficult to punish weak candidates <em>for faking being strong </em>versus punishing them in general. But if you can do it, that’s great.</p>\n<p>The flip side is that we can reward them for being honest. That will often be easier.</p>\n<p>Preventing a rebellion of the less skilled is a constraint on mechanism design. We must either appease them, or wipe them out.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 4: Sufficiently hard, high stakes competitions that are vulnerable to gaming and/or resource investment are highly toxic resource monsters.</strong></p>\n<p>This is getting away from the paper’s points, since the paper doesn’t deal with resource costs to participation or search, but it seems quite important.</p>\n<p>In some cases, we <em>want </em>these highly toxic resource monsters. We like that every member of area sports team puts the rest of their life mostly on hold and focuses on winning sporting events. The test is exactly what we want them to excel at. We also get to use the trick of testing them in discrete steps, via different games and portions of games, to prevent ‘risk’ from playing too much of a factor.</p>\n<p>In most cases, where the match between test preparation, successful test strategies and desired skills is not so good, this highly toxic resource monster is very, very bad.</p>\n<p>Consider <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/04/15/the-case-against-education/\">school</a>, or more generally childhood. The more we reward good performance on a test, and punish failure, the more resources are eaten alive by the test. In the extreme, all of most child’s experiences and resources, and even those of their parents, become eaten. From discussions I’ve had, much of high school in China has something remarkably close to this, as everything is dropped <em>for years </em>to cram for a life-changing college entrance exam.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 5: Rewards must be able to step outside of a strict scoring mechanism.</strong></p>\n<p>Any scoring mechanism is vulnerable to gaming and to risk taking, and to Goodhart’s Law. To avoid everyone’s motivation, potentially their entire life and being, being subverted, we need to be rewarding and punishing from the outside looking in on what is happening. This has to carry enough weight to be competitive with the prizes themselves.</p>\n<p>Consider this metaphor.</p>\n<p>If the real value of many journeys is the friends you made along the way, that can be true in both directions. Often one’s friends, experiences and lessons end up dwarfing in importance the prize or motivation one started out with; frequently we need a McGuffin and restrictions that breed creativity and focus to allow coordination, more than any prize.</p>\n<p>It also works <em>the other way. </em>The value of your friends can be that they motivate and help you to be worthy of friendship, to do and accomplish things. <strong>The reason we took the journey the right way was so that we would make friends along it. </strong>This prevents us from falling to Goodhart’s Law. We don’t narrow in on checking off a box. Even in a pure competition, like a Magic tournament, we know the style points matter, and we know that it matters whether we think the style points matter, and so on.</p>\n<p>The existence of the social, of various levels and layers, <em>the ability to step outside the game, </em>and <em>the worry about unknown unknowns, </em>is what guards systems from breakdown under the pressure of metrics. Given any utility function we know about, however well designed, and sufficient optimization pressure, things end badly. You need to preserve the value of unknown unknowns.</p>\n<p>This leads us to:</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 6: Too much knowledge by potential competitors can be very bad.</strong></p>\n<p>The more competitors do the ‘natural’ thing, that maximizes their expected output, the better off we usually are. The less they know about how they are being evaluated, on what levels, with what threshold of success, the less they can game the system, and the less success depends on gaming skill or luck.</p>\n<p>All the truly perverse outcomes came from scenarios where competitors knew they were desperadoes, and taking huge risks was not actually risky for them.</p>\n<p>Having a high threshold is only bad <em>if competitors know about it. </em>If they don’t know, it can’t hurt you. If they <em>suspect </em>a high threshold, <em>but they don’t know, </em>that mitigates a lot of the damage. In many cases, the competitor is better served by playing to succeed in the worlds where the threshold is low, and accept losing when the threshold is unexpectedly high, which means doing exactly what you want. More uncertainty also makes the choices of others less certain, which makes situations harder to game effectively.</p>\n<p>Power hides information. Power does not reveal its intentions. This is known, and the dynamics explored here are part of <em>why. </em>You want people optimizing for things you won’t even be aware of, or don’t care about, but which <em>they think you might be aware of and care about. </em>You want to avoid them trying too hard to game the things you <em>do </em>look at, which would also be bad. You make those in your power worry at every step that if they try anything, or fail in any way, it could be what costs them. You cause people to want to curry favor. You also allow yourself to alter the results, if they’re about to come out ‘wrong’. The more you reveal about how you work, the less power you have. In this case, the power to find worthy winners.</p>\n<p>This is in addition to the fact that some considerations that matter are not legally allowed to be considered, and that lawsuits might fly, and other reasons why decision makers ensure that no one knows what they were thinking.</p>\n<p>Thus we must work even harder to reward those who explain themselves and thereby help others, and who realize that the key hard thing is, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagbard_Celine\">Hagbard Celine</a> reminds us, to <em>avoid </em>power.</p>\n<p>But still get things done.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>In my <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4783ufKpx8xvLMPc6/human-ai-interaction\">last post</a>, I argued that interaction between the human and the AI system was necessary in order for the AI system to “stay on track” as we encounter new and unforeseen changes to the environment. The most obvious implementation of this would be to have an AI system that keeps an estimate of the reward function. It acts to maximize its current estimate of the reward function, while simultaneously updating the reward through human feedback. However, this approach has significant problems.</p><p>Looking at the description of this approach, one thing that stands out is that the actions are chosen according to a reward that we <em>know</em> is going to change. (This is what leads to the incentive to disable the narrow value learning system.) This seems clearly wrong: surely our plans should account for the fact that our rewards will change, <em>without</em> treating such a change as adversarial? This suggests that we need to have our action selection mechanism take the future rewards into account as well.</p><p>While we don’t know what the future reward will be, we can certainly have a <em>probability distribution</em> over it. So what if we had uncertainty over reward functions, and took that uncertainty into account while choosing actions?</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>We’ve drilled down on the problem sufficiently far that we can create a formal model and see what happens. So, let’s consider the following setup:</p><ul><li>The human, Alice, knows the “true” reward function that she would like to have optimized.</li><li>The AI system maintains a probability distribution over reward functions, and acts to maximize the expected sum of rewards under this distribution.</li><li>Alice and the AI system take turns acting. Alice knows that the AI learns from her actions, and chooses actions accordingly.</li><li>Alice’s action space is such that she cannot take the action “tell the AI system the true reward function” (otherwise the problem would become trivial).</li><li>Given these assumptions, Alice and the AI system act optimally.</li></ul><p>This is the setup of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\">Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a> (CIRL). The optimal solution to this problem typically involves Alice “teaching” the AI system by taking actions that communicate what she does and does not like, while the AI system “asks” about parts of the reward by taking actions that would force Alice to behave in different ways for different rewards.</p><h2>Does this solve our problems?</h2><p>Two of the problems we identified in the <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4783ufKpx8xvLMPc6/human-ai-interaction\">last post</a> are simply assumed away:</p><ul><li>Alice does not know the “true” reward function, but we assumed that she does.</li><li>Alice may be unable to optimally give feedback to the AI system, but we assume that she is optimal here.</li></ul><p>So this particular kind of reward uncertainty does not fix either of these problems. What about <a href=\"https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf\">convergent instrumental subgoals</a>?</p><p><strong>Utility preservation.</strong> One major worry we had with the original setup was that the AI system would disable its narrow value learning system, as a manifestation of the instrumental goal of protecting its utility function. This is reversed in our setup: the AI system has a positive incentive to continue doing narrow value learning, since it helps it hone in on the true reward function, which in turn allows it to optimize the reward better. (We might worry that this prevents us from fixing any problems in the narrow value learning system, but that is a robustness problem: in the world where everything is working correctly, this is the correct incentive.)</p><p><strong>Survival incentive, aka shutdown incorrigibility.</strong> Another worry is that the AI system has a survival incentive that causes it to prevent us from shutting it down. With reward uncertainty, the fact that we are trying to shut the AI system down is itself strong evidence about the reward function. The AI system should reason that its operation leads to worse outcomes, and so allow itself to be turned off.</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08219\">The Off-Switch Game</a> formalizes this reasoning in a simple setting. The AI system can either directly take action a (perhaps by disabling an off switch), can shut down, or can allow Alice to choose between these options. If the AI system allows Alice to choose, Alice then decides whether or not to shut down the AI system. Assuming that Alice is optimal, the AI system reasons that when Alice chooses to shut it down, the true reward function must have been one which makes the action a bad, and so it does better by deferring to Alice. However, when Alice is modeled as noisily rational instead of optimal, the AI system might reason that Alice might make a mistake when deciding to shut the AI system down, and so it might take action a directly without deferring to her. So, the AI system becomes shutdown corrigible, as long as it assumes that Alice is sufficiently rational.</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09990\">Should robots be obedient?</a> makes a similar point, arguing that an AI system that learns preferences and then acts to maximize their satisfaction can perform better than an AI system that simply obeys instructions, because humans are not perfectly rational. This creates a tradeoff between performance and obedience (which shutdown corrigibility is an instance of).</p><p>Of course, these simple models exclude many actions that a realistic AI system could take. In particular, it seems likely that an AI system would prefer to disable the shutdown button, gather information about the reward until it has <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/updated_deference/\">fully updated</a>, and optimize the resulting set of rewards. If the space of reward functions is misspecified, as it likely will be, this will lead to bad behavior. (This is the point made by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06275.pdf\">Incorrigibility in the CIRL Framework</a>.)</p><p>Note though that while this cuts against shutdown corrigibility (since the AI system would prefer to disable the shutdown button), I would frame the problem differently. If the space of rewards is well-specified and has sufficient weight on the true reward function and the AI system is sufficiently robust and intelligent, then the AI system must update strongly on us attempting to shut it down. This should cause it to stop doing the bad thing it was doing. When it eventually narrows down on the reward it will have identified the true reward, which by definition is the right thing to optimize. So even though the AI system might disable its off switch, this is simply because it is better at knowing what we want than we are, and this leads to better outcomes for us. So, really the argument is that since we want to be robust (particularly to reward misspecification), we want shutdown corrigibility, and reward uncertainty is an insufficient solution for that.</p><h2>A note on CIRL</h2><p>There has been a lot of confusion on what CIRL is and isn’t trying to do, so I want to avoid adding to the confusion.</p><p>CIRL is <em>not</em> meant to be a blueprint for a value-aligned AI system. It is not the case that we could create a practical implementation of CIRL and then we would be done. If we were to build a practical implementation of CIRL and use it to align powerful AI systems, we would face many problems:</p><ul><li>As mentioned above, Alice doesn’t actually know the true reward function, and she may not be able to give optimal feedback.</li><li>As mentioned above, in the presence of reward misspecification the AI system may end up optimizing the wrong thing, leading to catastrophic outcomes.</li><li>Similarly, if the model of Alice’s behavior is incorrect, as it inevitably will be, the AI system will make incorrect inferences about Alice’s reward, again leading to bad behavior. As an example that is particularly easy to model, should the AI system model Alice as thinking about the robot thinking about Alice, or should it model Alice as thinking about the robot thinking about Alice thinking about the robot thinking about Alice? How many levels of pragmatics is the “right” level?</li><li>Lots of other problems have not been addressed: the AI system might not deal with embeddedness well, or it might not be robust and could make mistakes, etc.</li></ul><p>CIRL is supposed to bring conceptual clarity to what we could be trying to do in the first place with a human-AI system. In <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2019/01/17/cooperative-inverse-reinforcement-learning-with-dylan-hadfield-menell/\">Dylan’s own words</a>, “what cooperative IRL is, it’s a definition of how a human and a robot system together can be rational in the context of fixed preferences in a fully observable world state”. In the same way that VNM rationality informs our understanding of humans even though humans are not expected utility maximizers, CIRL can inform our understanding of alignment proposals, even though CIRL itself is unsuitable as a solution to alignment.</p><p>Note also that this post is about reward uncertainty, not about CIRL. CIRL makes other points besides reward uncertainty, that are well explained in this <a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/08/17/cooperatively-learning-human-values/\">blog post</a>, and are not mentioned here.</p><p><em>While all of my posts have been significantly influenced by many people, this post is especially based on ideas I heard from Dylan Hadfield-Menell. However, besides the one quote, the writing is my own, and may not reflect Dylan’s views.</em></p>",

Their reasoning involved the\nexpectation that we'd repeat the things that worked, and forget the\nthings that didn't work.</p>\n<p>I've been hesitant to apply this advice to things that feel unlikely to\nwork, and I expect other people have similar reluctance.</p>\n<p>The relevant kind of \"things\" are experiments that cost maybe 10 to 100\nhours to try, which don't risk much other than wasting time, and for\nwhich I should expect on the order of a 10% chance of noticeable\nlong-term benefits.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the kind of experiments I have in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gratitude journal</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2016/08/18/morning-pages/\">morning\npages</a></li>\n<li>meditation</li>\n<li>vitamin D supplements</li>\n<li>folate supplements</li>\n<li>a low carb diet</li>\n<li>the Plant Paradox diet</li>\n<li>an anti-anxiety drug</li>\n<li>ashwaghanda</li>\n<li>whole fruit coffee extract</li>\n<li>piracetam</li>\n<li>phenibut</li>\n<li>modafinil</li>\n<li>a <a href=\"http://integralcenter.org/what-is-circling/\">circling</a> workshop</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2012/05/10/auditory-integration-training/\">Auditory Integration\nTraining</a></li>\n<li>various self-help books</li>\n<li>yoga</li>\n<li>sensory deprivation chamber</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've cheated slightly, by being more likely to add something to this\nlist if it worked for me than if it was a failure that I'd rather\nforget. So my success rate with these was around 50%.</p>\n<p>The simple practice of forgetting about the failures and mostly\nrepeating the successes is almost enough to cause the net value of these\nexperiments to be positive. More importantly, I kept the costs of these\nexperiments low, so the benefits of the top few outweighed the costs of\nthe failures by a large factor.</p>\n<h3>3.</h3>\n<p>I face a similar situation when I'm investing.</p>\n<p>The probability that I'll make any profit on a given investment is close\nto 50%, and the probability of beating the market on a given investment\nis lower. I don't calculate actual numbers for that, because doing so\nwould be more likely to bias me than to help me.</p>\n<p>I would find it rather discouraging to evaluate each investment\nseparately. Doing so would focus my attention on the fact that any\nindividual result is indistinguishable from luck.</p>\n<p>Instead, I focus my evaluations much more on bundles of hundreds of\ntrades, often associated with a particular strategy. Aggregating\nevidence in that manner smooths out the good and bad luck to make my\nskill (or lack thereof) more conspicuous. I'm focusing in this post not\non the logical interpretation of evidence, but on how the subconscious\nparts of my mind react. This mental bundling of tasks is particularly\nimportant for my subconscious impressions of whether I'm being\nproductive.</p>\n<p>I believe this is a well-known insight (possibly from poker?), but I\ncan't figure out where I've seen it described.</p>\n<p>I've partly applied this approach to self-improvement tasks (not quite\nas explicitly as I ought to), and it has probably helped.</p>\n</body></html>",

At the conclusion of the project, the shares will be bought back for that surplus in cash.</p><p>This means the price the share sells for is a direct bet on how well the project will do against the budget.</p><p>This is analogous to how investors buy in to start-ups; the investment becomes the assets and in exchange they get a share of the equity. But in the case of megaprojects, the initial investor is getting the project outcome as compensation; the equity should instead go to management as their compensation. Now this gives management the incentive to be as efficient as possible, while <em>also</em> giving them the flexibility to raise more capital in exchange for equity.</p><p>For comparison with some of the ways this is currently done, consider the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-price_contract\">fixed-price</a> contract and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-plus_contract\">cost-plus</a> contract. The former gives the contractor an incentive to be efficient by forcing them to hold all the risk; the latter shifts the risk back to the contractee. Fixed-price is common for things that are predictable, like services; cost-plus is common for things that are risky or require R&amp;D to complete, like defense procurement. Megaprojects are usually of the latter sort.</p><p>Tangential but worth also addressing: why a financial asset instead of a prediction market?</p><ul><li>Financial assets provide direct incentives, whereas prediction markets provide information.</li><li>Financial assets are a built-in reference class; a megaproject asset would naturally be compared against all other megaproject assets.</li><li>Financial assets have a huge market, and there are established methods for making bets for/against/on/with them. There are no large prediction markets, so an entire market would have to be built. The problem of incentivizing the new market seems more difficult than the one of incentivizing a new type of asset.</li></ul><p></p>",

I'll take the example of population ethics, since it's an area with divergent intuition and arguments.</p>\n<h2>Over-complicated values?</h2>\n<p>One key point of this synthesis is that I am very reluctant to throw a preference away completely, preferring to keep in around in a very weakened form. The reasoning behind this decision is 1) A weak preference will make little practical difference for most decisions, and 2) Most AI catastrophes involve over-simple utility functions, so simplicity itself is something to be wary of, and there is no clear boundary between \"good simplicity\" and \"bad simplicity\".</p>\n<p>So we might end up losing most of human value if we go too simple, and be a little bit inefficient if we don't go simple enough.</p>\n<h1>Basic pieces</h1>\n<p>Human H has not thought hard about population ethics at all. In term of theory, they have a vague preference for total utilitarianism and they have some egalitarian preferences. They also have a lot of \"good/bad\" examples drawn from some knowledge of history and some fictional experiences (ie book, movies, and TV shows).</p>\n<p>Note that it is wrong to use fiction as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rHBdcHGLJ7KvLJQPk/the-logical-fallacy-of-generalization-from-fictional\">evidence of how the world works</a>. However, using fiction as source of values is not intrinsically wrong.</p>\n<p>At the meta-level, they have one relevant preference: they have a preference for simple models.</p>\n<h2>Weights of the preference</h2>\n<p>H has these preferences with different strengths, denoted by (un-normalised) weights to these preferences. Their weight on total utilitarianism is <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"4\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">4</span></span></span></span></span></span>, their weight on egalitarianism is <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span>, their weight on their examples is <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"5\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">5</span></span></span></span></span></span>, and their weight on model simplicity is <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"3\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">3</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<h2>Future arguments</h2>\n<p>The AI checks how the human would respond if presented with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox\">mere addition argument</a>, the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/\">repugnant conclusion</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6vYDsoxwGQraeCJs6/the-very-repugnant-conclusion\">very repugnant conclusion</a>.</p>\n<p>They accept the logic of the mere addition argument, but feel emotionally against the two repugnant conclusions; most of the examples they can bring to mind are against it.</p>\n<h1>Synthesis</h1>\n<p>There are multiple ways of doing the synthesis; here is one I believe is acceptable. The model simplicity weight is <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"3\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">3</span></span></span></span></span></span>; however, the mere addition argument only works under total-utilitarian preferences, it does not work under egalitarian preferences.

This min-max normalisation doesn't have particularly nice properties, but then again, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hBJCMWELaW6MxinYW/intertheoretic-utility-comparison\">neither do any other normalisations</a>.</p>\n<h2>Factual errors and consequences</h2>\n<p>I said that fictional evidence and historical examples are fine for constructing preferences. But what if part of this evidence is based on factually wrong suppositions? For example, maybe one of strong examples in favour of egalitarianism is H imagining themselves in very poor situations. But maybe people who are genuinely poor don't suffer <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/poor-folks-do-smile.html\">as much as H imagines they would</a>. Or, converely, maybe people do <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4299939/#R4\">suffer from lack of equality</a>, more than H might think.</p>\n<p>Things like this seem as if its just a division between factual and preferences beliefs, but it's not so easy to disentangle. A religious fundamentalist might have a picture of heaven in which everyone would actually be miserable. To convince them of this fact, it is not sufficient to point that out; the process of causing them to believe it may break many other aspects of their preferences and world-view as well. More importantly, learning some true facts will likely cause people to change the strength (the weight) with which they hold certain preferences.</p>\n<p>This does not seem insoluble, but it is a challenge to be aware of.</p>\n<h2>Order of operations and underdefined</h2>\n<p>Many people construct explicit preferences by comparing their consequences with mental examples, then rejecting or accepting the preferences based on this fit. This process is very vulnerable to which examples spring to mind at the time. I showed a process that extrapolated current preferences by imagining H encountering the mere addition argument, and the very repugnant conclusion. But I chose those examples because they are salient to me and to a lot of philosophers in that area, so the choice is somewhat arbitrary.

Why did I do it that way? Because I judged that the mere addition argument sounds persuasive, even to people who should actually reject it based on some synthesis of their current preferences.</p>\n<p>So there remains a lot of details to fill in and choices to make.</p>\n<h2>Meta-meta-preferences</h2>\n<p>And, of course, H might have higher order preferences about utility normalisation, factual errors, orders of operation, and so on. These provide an extra layer of possible complications to add on.</p>\n</body></html>",

You can apply <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDTbCDbnIN11vcgHM3DKq6M0cZ3itAy5GIPK17uvTXcz8ZFA/viewform?usp=sf_link\">here</a>. (Excerpt from the application:)</p><blockquote>We are particularly interested in small teams and individuals that are trying to get projects off the ground, or that need less money than existing grant-making institutions are likely to give out (i.e. less than ~$100k, but more than $10k). Here are a few examples of project types that we&#x27;re open to funding an individual or group for (note that this list is not exhaustive):  </blockquote><blockquote>+ To spend a few months (perhaps during the summer) to research an open problem in AI alignment or AI strategy and produce a few blog posts or videos on their ideas </blockquote><blockquote>+ To spend a few months building a web app with the potential to solve an operations bottleneck at x-risk organisations </blockquote><blockquote>+ To spend a few months up-skilling in a field to prepare for future work (e.g. microeconomics, functional programming, etc). </blockquote><blockquote>+ To spend a year testing an idea that has the potential to be built into an org.  </blockquote><blockquote>You can find more details on the kind of project we are likely to fund on the fund page: <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future\">https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future</a>  If we don’t feel that we have enough information but we think your project sounds promising we may be in touch for more information.</blockquote>",

As predicted, I learned a lot.</p><p>In this post I’ll address some of these comments and offer follow up thoughts that didn’t fit in the original essay because they’re more speculative. Also, becase that post ran to 5,500 words already.</p><p>People said: <em>“I don’t buy this, fuck capitalism!”</em> If you want to stick it to capitalism, you can <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/donate/\">gift a donation</a> to a creator publishing his work online for free.</p><p>People said: <em>“Finally someone gets it and does the math right!” </em>If you think I get it and I do the math right, you can forward me job offers at lucrative hedge funds, PE firms, and startups.</p><p>People said that it’s overly defeatist to claim that finance won’t improve no matter how we try to fix it, we just have to live with it. But that’s not quite what I think.</p><p>Finance improves <em>itself</em>, mostly after crises. In 1929 we learned that established company stocks are riskier than we thought, and in 2000 we learned the same about startups. Financial institutions learned how to deal with 20% interest rates in 1980 and with 0.02% rates in 2010. After 2008 we learned that 6% is too low of an equity ratio for banks, that rating agencies with no skin in the game are useless, and that CDO-Squared are really dumb. Hopefully, we also learned some generalizable math lessons, such as the fact that lack of correlation in normal times (e.g., in mortgage default rates) doesn’t imply lack of correlation when a crisis hits.</p><p>We’re on the cusp of <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-longest-period-of-time-between-two-recessions-in-the-US-economy-since-1850\">the longest period ever</a> between recessions in the US. In the decade since 2008 the Middle East has gone crazy, Europe has gone crazy, Venezuela has gone crazy, elections have gone crazy, the weather has gone crazy, the Cubs have won the World Series, Leicester won the EPL, Bitcoin rose and fell and rose and fell and rose. Throughout all of this, the bankers and traders have kept their nose down and didn’t recklessly endanger the world.</p><p>One day after this generation of financiers will have been gathered to the Hamptons, <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm\">a new one will arise</a>that does not know The Big Short and they’ll do something really dumb to cause the next financial crisis. But for now, finance seems less of a global threat <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-updates-everything-president-trump-calls-kim-jong-un-little-rocket-1512093131-htmlstory.html\">than Twitter</a>.</p><h2>Turkeys in the Jungle</h2><p>People said that I defended the parts of finance that are easy to defend, such as banks making loans to businesses, and didn’t address the whatabouts. What about high-frequency trading firms? What about mutual funds that charge 2%/20% to underperform indices? Payday loans? Penny stocks?</p><p>I don’t have a knockdown argument for those and perhaps there isn’t one – perhaps the above are actually net harmful to humanity. But I have a useful and very stretchy metaphor: finance is a jungle.</p><p>First, finance is a jungle in the colloquial sense of a hypercompetitive environment. Financial firms compete with each other, and it’s hard for any of them to build moats or acquire monopolies. Changing your bank or brokerage is a lot easier than changing utility providers, social networks, or even fridges. So if a hedge fund makes money doing something that seems inefficient or bad for customers, you have to answer why it has not been competed away by someone better.</p><p>Second, finance is a jungle in the sense of being a complex, interconnected ecosystem. Another lesson we should have learned from 2008 is that banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, and government agencies depend on each other in critical and opaque ways. Eliminating a class of instution from the financial system is like eliminating some annoying insect from the jungle: it could make things a little bit better, or it could bring the entire thing crashing down unexpectedly.</p><p>But the more I thought about this metaphor, a new picture came to mind. Finance isn’t just a jungle of sharp-toothed jaguars, venomous frogs, and vicious parasites. It’s a jungle surrounded by turkey farms that send fat, defenseless birds by the millions running into the deadly forest. These turkeys are most of the people you know.</p><p>People are breathtakingly stupid about finance. And by “people” I mean “average Americans”. This isn’t because Americans are less financially literate than the rest of the world, it’s just that the best data available about financial idiocy concerns the “average American”.</p><p>The average American has <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2017/01/24/heres-the-average-americans-credit-card-debt-and-how-to-get-yours-under-control/96611546/\">more than $5,000 in credit card debt</a>, on which they pay more than 15% interest. The average American doesn’t know how much debt they have or how much it costs them.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/18/few-americans-have-enough-savings-to-cover-a-1000-emergency.html\">Less than two in five</a> Americans have enough savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense. The median income in the US is $59,000, so all it would take to save up $1,000 for the average American is to only spend 98% of what they make for a single year. The average American can’t do that.</p><p>The smart American isn’t much smarter than the “average”. Married couples with postgraduate degrees <a href=\"https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-us/magazine/money-diary-couple-debt-us\">fall into spirals of debt</a> for no reason other than their own poor planning. One of my smartest friends was <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2018/07/03/debt-anti-investment/\">paying 9% on a loan while investing</a> in funds that wouldn’t return that much in a good year. One of my smartest coworkers told me yesterday that he won’t fund his 401k for the first six months of 2019 because of a “hunch”, thus foregoing six months of expected positive returns. Many smart people told me they like getting a tax refund, not realizing that it means that the government earned interest on their money for a whole year instead of them.</p><p>I often hear from people who tell me they loved <em><a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2017/02/10/get-rich-slowly/\">Get Rich Slowly</a></em>, but then admit that their own money is in hand-picked stocks or savings accounts.</p><p>And these same people expect to be able to buy whatever they want whenever they want at the swipe of a card. They expect their cash to be available at any ATM in the world, with no fees. They <a href=\"https://www.nasi.org/learn/social-security/public-opinions-social-security\">expect their retirement to be provided for</a>, even if they do not provide for it themselves.</p><p>The worst aspects of finance are a direct result of the average person being stupid about finance. People expect to beat the market, so they pay brokerages and make their pensions invest in high-fee funds. People don’t understand debt and interest, which fuels bubbles and crises from MBS to student loans.</p><p>It is not clear that government regulation will help. For one, outlawing stupid behavior (like day-trading stocks) will often just shift people to stupider behavior (like <a href=\"https://www.hsx.com/\">day-trading movies</a>). For another, if people aren’t smart enough to deal with personal finances, how could they vote intelligently for financial policies on a national level?</p><p>The only solution to this is financial literacy education, and <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/category/money/\">I’m doing what I can</a> to help my readers with that. That’s one of the reasons I wrote <em>In Defense of Finance</em>: when you stop hating finance you can start to understand how it works, and when you start to understand how it works you can make it start working for <em>you</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>One of the most difficult questions that we will face in the future is whether or not to release an AI. One obvious approach is to ask the AI what would happen if we were to release it, but we might worry that it would mislead us. So perhaps it&apos;d be better instead to have two equivalently powerful AIs, where A tries to convince us to releases it and B tries to convince us not to release A. This can be defined easily in a utility function as whether the Release Button or Don&apos;t Release Button is pressed.</p><p>It is hoped that the AI trying to convince us not to release A will be more convincing if it is able to point out a specific design flaw which was missed. After such a flaw is fixed, both AIs can be reset and the experiment can be run again to avoid long term ploys. In particular, A should only care about it being released and not about future versions of it being released, even if all we have done is increment a version number.</p><p>Naturally, it is much worse to release a misaligned AI than to not release an aligned AI, so we probably want to be very conservative about releasing. However, this might not be enough. If we are biased towards wanting to release the AI (quite plausible for AI researchers), then an unaligned A might be able to take advantage of these psychological vulnerabilities in a way that B might not easily be able to counter. In order to reduce the risk, we want to bias the process towards B. My initial thought was that we should limit A in processing time compared to B, but it is hard to know how this will affect the strength of the arguments. It&apos;s quite possible that the strength of arguments plateaus after a certain amount of power, so for AIs with access to large amounts of processing, even giving A 1/10 of the processing power of B might not result in any significant handicap.</p><p>Instead, I&apos;d suggest that message length is a more appropriate way of tilting the debate to one side as more characters will almost always be more useful. One worry is that tilting the debate in this way may ensure that A never gets released as B will always find some trick to talk us out of it. For this reason, we may want to gradually reduce the handicap. This is undoubtedly risky, but so is never releasing your program.</p><p><strong>Additional Thoughts</strong></p><p>I think there is a lot to investigate here, but these are some of my ideas off the top of my head:</p><ul><li>We may want to add a punishment system into A worth a number of times its maximum utility if released to discourage it from attempting strategies like blackmail</li><li>The protocol should require that we read the message from B both first and last</li><li>We can add an additional reward button for clear messages. This should be relatively unproblematic for A, but we have to be careful for B as we don&apos;t want it to choose to gain the reward for a clear message instead of trying to persuade us not to release it.</li><li>One possible solution to the previous problem would be to have rounds. A gets the reward if we advance it to the second round, while B gets the reward if we don&apos;t, where B has a strong reward for being clear. Then A&apos; (A with the version number incremented) gets the reward if it is actually released, while B&apos; gets the reward if it isn&apos;t. B&apos; could have no or a lower clarity reward function. This would allow us to incentivise B to give the answers we want, without risking releasing an unaligned AI due to B aiming for clarify over persuasiveness.</li><li>The Release Button doesn&apos;t have to actually release the AI. In fact, it might be better to make it a &quot;I believe that this AI would be safe to release&quot; button so that if it blackmails you, you can just press it.</li><li>The AI that actually gets released should have this additional code related to the button stripped from its utility function to avoid any risk of it causing weird behaviour from theories about it not having actually been released.</li><li>We can consider different debate formats like both sides get a single message or both sides get n number of responses, ect. This doesn&apos;t have to be decided on in advance, if a format doesn&apos;t work we alter it midway through the experiment.</li></ul><p>Clearly, it would be better to be able to produce formal guarantees of safety. But in the absence of them, we need methods that might work. And even with formal guarantees, we might want to introduce other safeguards as well.</p><p><em>This post was written with the support of the <a href=\"http://eahotel.org/\">EA Hotel</a></em></p>",

There are simply not enough degrees of freedom in the system for anthropic updating to be done any way other than in the normal way.</p>\n<h1>Survivorship bias and special Earths</h1>\n<p>There are clearly issues of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias\">selection bias</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\">survivorship bias</a> in anthropic reasoning. We can't conclude from seeing all the life around us, that the universe is full of life.</p>\n<p>But that doesn't stop us from updating normally, it just means we have to update on exactly what we know: not on the information that we observe, but on the fact that we observe it.</p>\n<p>Take a classical example of survivorship bias: hedge funds success. We see a lot of successful hedge funds, and we therefore conclude that hedge funds are generally successful. But that conclusion is mistaken, because the least successful hedge funds tend to go bankrupt, leaving us with a skewed sample. So if we noticed \"most hedge funds I can see are successful\", concluded \"most hedge funds are successful\", and updated on that... then we'd be wrong.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if we noticed a lot of life around us, concluded \"life is common\", and updated on that, we'd be wrong. If, however, we instead concluded \"life is common on at least one planet\" and updated on that, then we would be correct.</p>\n<p>Notice how specific the update requirements can be.

But, with those caveats, anthropic updating works just as normal updating.</p>\n<h1>Anthropic reasoning in medium sized universes</h1>\n<p>There's a final reason that anthropic reasoning can seem daunting. I've shown above that the update process of anthropic probability is the normal update process. But what about the initial probabilities? There are a plethora of anthropic probability theories - SIA, SSA, FNC - and some people (ie me) arguing that probabilities don't even exist, and that you have to use decision theory instead.</p>\n<p>But in this section I'll show that, if you make some reasonable assumptions about the size of the universe (or at least the size of the part of the universe you're willing to consider), then all those probabilities collapse into the same thing, which is pretty much just normal probability for the universe in which you exist. If we make those assumptions, we can then do anthropic probabilities in an easy way, at least for problems without explicit duplication.</p>\n<h2>Defining medium sized universes</h2>\n<p>Let's talk about how unique you are.

So if we packed our Hubble volume with humans, and those humans were initially identical but had had about ten seconds to diverge, then we would not expect to find two copies of the same human anywhere.</p>\n<p>Of course, humans are not packed anywhere near that density, and humans diverge a lot more than that. So we expect to go a great great great ... great great great distance before finding identical copies of ourselves.</p>\n<p>So I define a <strong>medium sized universe</strong> as universes larger than our own, but where we'd expect to find but a single copy of ourselves. These universes can, of course, be very big - a universe that is <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"10^{300}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">10</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.591em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">300</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> times bigger than the Hubble volume would count as a very small example of a medium-sized universe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I suggest that, in general, we restrict anthropic reasoning to medium-sized universes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This might seem controversial; after all, doesn't the universe appear to be infinite? Well, probability theories have problems with infinity, anthropic probability theories <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/99isjR8W4JGZdro7x/sia-fears-expected-infinity\">even more so</a>. In most areas, we are fine with ignoring the infinity and just soldiering on in our local area; I'm suggesting that we do that for most anthropic reasoning as well. By \"most\" I mean \"reasoning about situations that don't involve infinities, deliberate duplication, or simulations\". Though you can't shove that many simulations into a medium sized universe, so avoiding simulations may be unnecessary (it does tend to make the rest of the reasoning much easier, though).</p>\n<h2>Anthropic probability in medium sized universes</h2>\n<p>Different theories of anthropic probability are trying to answer <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nxRjC93AmsFkfDYQj/anthropic-probabilities-answering-different-questions\">subtly different questions about the universe and ourselves</a>. But they only really differ if there are multiple copies of the same person.</p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-indication_assumption\">SIA</a>.

But <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wdEGA3RM7ESqHXKMX/the-questions-and-classes-of-ssa\">this post</a> argues against those larger reference classes, claiming they belong more to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6437\">decision theory</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance\">morality</a>, not probability. And remember, <strong>the definition of the reference class for SSA is contained in the question we are asking</strong>. Only for questions where \"we could have been person X\", in a specific sense, does SSA with larger reference classes make sense.</p>\n<p>Another reason to restrict to <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R_s\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is that in medium sized universes, the anthropic probabilities are essentially free from all the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PgsxXNSDsyz4DFEuw/anthropic-paradoxes-transposed-into-anthropic-decision\">usual paradoxes</a>.</p>\n<p>Notice that in using <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R_s\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, we haven't had to formally define what an \"observer\" is, or what would qualify an agent to get that rank. Instead we're just looking at agents that are subjectively indistinguishable from each other, a narrow and reasonably well-defined class.</p>\n<h1>Anthropics for beginners</h1>\n<p>So, here's how to proceed with anthropics in most situations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Assume the universe is medium sized.</li>\n<li>Check (or assume) that there is no actual duplication or simulations going on.</li>\n<li>Use a prior over universes, and update it based on the fact that you exist.</li>\n<li>Proceed to update using any other information you find, remembering selection bias: the update is the fact that you saw this information, not that the information exists.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And that should suffice for most non-specialised work in the area.</p>\n</body></html>",

It's known that the Doomsday argument works under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sampling_assumption\">SSA</a>, but not under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-indication_assumption\">SIA</a>.</p>\n<p>Ok, but since different anthropic probability theories are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nxRjC93AmsFkfDYQj/anthropic-probabilities-answering-different-questions\">correct answers to different questions</a>, what are the question versions of the Doomsday argument, and is the original claim correct?</p>\n<h2>No Doomsday on birth rank</h2>\n<p>Simplify the model into assuming there is a large universe (no Doomsday any time soon) with many, many future humans, and a small one (a Doomsday reasonably soon - within the next 200 billion people, say), with equal probability. In order to think in terms of frequencies, which comes more naturally to humans, we can imagine running the universe many, many times, each with the <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"50\\%\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">50</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> Doomsday chance.</p>\n<p>There are roughly a <a href=\"https://www.prb.org/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth/\">108.5 billion humans</a> who have ever lived. So, asking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What proportion of people with birth rank 108.5 billion, live in a small universe (with a Doomsday reasonably soon)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The answer to that question converges to <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"1/2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">/</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span>, the SIA probability. Half of the people with that birth rank live in small universes, half in large universes.</p>\n<h2>Doomsday for time travellers</h2>\n<p>To get an SSA version of the problem, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wdEGA3RM7ESqHXKMX/the-questions-and-classes-of-ssa\">we can ask</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What proportion of universes, where a randomly selected human has a birthrank of 108.5 billion, will be small (with a Doomsday reasonably soon)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will give an answer close to <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> as it converges on the SSA probability.</p>\n<p>But note that this is generally <em>not</em> the question that the Doomsday argument is posing. If there is a <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Versions_of_the_Doctor.jpg\">time traveller</a> who is choosing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who)\">people</a> at random from amongst all of space and time - then if they happen to choose you, that is a bad sign for the future (and yet another reason you should go with them). Note that this is consistent with <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jiBFC7DcCrZjGmZnJ/conservation-of-expected-evidence\">conservation of expected evidence</a>: if the time traveller is out there but doesn't choose you, then this a (very mild) update towards no Doomsday.</p>\n<p>But for the classical non-time-travel situation, the Doomsday argument fails.</p>\n</body></html>",

Well, the best question I could come up with that captures that is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Q': What proportion of universes, where a randomly selected version of me exists on a Monday, will be large?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Randomly selected meaning \"randomly selected from the versions of me that exist in the universe\".</p>\n<p>This question doesn't feel as natural as either Q or QM. And it highlights the importance of the reference class, the set of \"versions of me\". So let's look in more details at the reference class.</p>\n<h2>What are reference classes for?</h2>\n<p>There are several purposes for reference classes. We can use them in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6437\">decision theory</a>, when considering the class of agents that will reach the same decision as us. Or we might use them in ethics, when considering the class of agents whose preferences we might care about. The \"Rawlsian veil of ignorance](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/#VeiIgn)\" gives a sort of reference class of all humans.</p>\n<p>But in probability, reference classes are a lot simpler. They tend to go along the lines of \"if all I know is that I'm a member of <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span></span></span></span>, I should expect that I am a typical member of <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span></span></span></span>\".</p>\n<p>This justifies a lot of \"<a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/beware-the-insi.html\">Outside view</a>\" reasoning. If I'm planning for a project, and don't have a track record of being exceptionally timely, then I should expect that I will plan as well as any other human, ie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy\">badly</a>. Or if I'm about to become a parent, then I should expect I'd behave about the same level as typical parents of my class and background.</p>\n<p>Or if me and a hundred other people are each locked in a hundred numbered rooms (numbered <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"0\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">0</span></span></span></span></span></span> to <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"99\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">99</span></span></span></span></span></span>), then I should expect that there's <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"75\\%\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">75</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> chance my room number is less than <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"75\\%\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">75</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">%</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p>Notice that in that last example, I don't have to be similar to the other people at all for the argument to go through. The other 'people' could be aliens, robots, rocks, or dead, and the reasoning would still go through.</p>\n<p><strong>Now, when we ask a question like Q', the reference class to be used is defined in the question asked.</strong></p>\n<h2>Minimal reference class</h2>\n<p>But are there some forms of \"natural\" reference classes, universal in some senses? I can think of two \"natural\" reference classes that can be used for SSA. The first is the reference class <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R_\\infty\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">∞</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> of everything whatsoever that ever existed. The second is the narrow class <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R_s\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> of beings subjectively indistinguishable from you.

Right?</p>\n<h2>Consistent updating</h2>\n<p>The problem with the minimal reference class is that it is changing - two copies of me with the same subjective experiences can diverge (or, more rarely, converge). This means that using this reference class will result in SSA being time-inconsistent, in the same way that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jH3NfxoNgKTh9r5KW/anthropics-full-non-indexical-conditioning-fnc-is\">FNC is</a>. Indeed, in terms of its probability about the universe, FNC essentially <strong>is</strong> SSA with <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R_s\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p>If we want time consistency, a desirable trait, we could instead talk about an agent's subjective experience at a particular point in time - call this experience at this time <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"s_t\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

This provides a one-off update to the prior probabilities of all worlds. But in order to maintain time-inconsistency across duplication, we have to do some extra work, such as allowing SSA to provide for a distribution of agents in <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R_{s_t}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 83.3%; vertical-align: -0.227em; padding-right: 0.06em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, rather than just selecting them with equal probability (if one agent becomes two, then the probabilistic weight of that one agent has to be the same as the sums of the weights of the two descendants).

In particular, you can <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/dqMSZj\">sign up</a>, or look through this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PwWbWZ6FPqAgZWOoOcXM8N_tUCuxpEyMbN1NYYC02aM/edit?usp=sharing\">spreadsheet</a> of all summaries that have ever been in the newsletter.</p><p>This newsletter is late because I wanted to include <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/towards-formalizing-universality-409ab893a456\">Towards formalizing universality</a> and related posts, but I haven&#x27;t yet understood them well enough to put them in this newsletter so I&#x27;m not including them this time and hope to put them in next week.</p><h2>Highlights</h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F9vcbEMKW48j4Z6h9/non-consequentialist-cooperation\">Non-Consequentialist Cooperation?</a></strong> <em>(Abram Demski)</em>: One possible way to build useful AI systems is to have them <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment\">try to help us</a>. Taking more of a libertarian stance, a robot could help us in an autonomy-centric way, which would only take actions if we give it our informed consent. We can&#x27;t ask for explicit consent for every action, since there&#x27;s no clear way to break down actions, and it would certainly be too onerous to give informed consent to every possible motor command. As a result, our robots will need to infer when we have given consent. This increases the chances of misunderstanding, but we could try to have a high threshold, so that the robot asks us if it is even a little unsure about whether we have given consent.</p><p>If we want to precisely define consent, we&#x27;ll need to solve some of the same problems that impact measures have to contend with. In particular, we would need to get consent for outcomes that the robot knows will happen as a result of its actions, but not ones that happen as a side effect. It&#x27;s fine to give informed consent to the robot to buy bananas from a grocery store, even if that could cause a hurricane, as long as the robot doesn&#x27;t <em>know</em> that it would cause a hurricane. Another issue is that inferring consent requires you to confront the issue that humans can be irrational. A third issue is that we might prevent the robot from taking actions that would help us that we can&#x27;t understand would help us -- consider trying to ask a dog for its informed consent to take it to the vet.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This seems like an interesting idea for how to build an AI system in practice, along the same lines as corrigibility. We notice that value learning is not very robust: if you aren&#x27;t very good at value learning, then you can get very bad behavior, and human values are sufficiently complex that you do need to be very capable in order to be sufficiently good at value learning. With (a particular kind of) <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">corrigibility</a>, we instead set the goal to be to make an AI system that is trying to help us, which seems more achievable even when the AI system is not very capable. Similarly, if we formalize or learn informed consent reasonably well (which seems easier to do since it is not as complex as &quot;human values&quot;), then our AI systems will likely have good behavior (though they will probably not have the best possible behavior, since they are limited by having to respect informed consent).</p><p>However, this also feels different from corrigibility, in that it feels more like a limitation put on the AI system, while corrigibility seems more like a property of the AI&#x27;s &quot;motivational system&quot;. This might be fine, since the AI might just not be goal-directed. One other benefit of corrigibility is that if you are &quot;somewhat&quot; corrigible, then you would like to become more corrigible, since that is what the human would prefer; informed-consent-AI doesn&#x27;t seem to have an analogous benefit.</p><h1>Technical AI alignment</h1><h3>Iterated amplification sequence</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HA3oArypzNANvXC38/alphago-zero-and-capability-amplification\">AlphaGo Zero and capability amplification</a> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: AlphaGo Zero works by starting with a randomly chosen policy and value network. Then, it repeatedly applies a &quot;policy improvement&quot; step: it runs MCTS using the policy and value networks to guide the search, which results in moves that are better than the policy and value networks used alone, and then trains the policy and value networks on those moves. Iterated amplification is very similar: it starts with a base policy, and then repeatedly applies a &quot;policy improvement&quot; step that consists of first amplifying the policy and then distilling it. MCTS is analogous to amplification, and training on the resulting moves is analogous to distillation.</p><p>So, if a general method of building capable agents is to constantly apply &quot;policy improvement&quot; steps, the key challenge is to figure out a &quot;policy improvement&quot; operator that preserves alignment. (We could hopefully get an aligned weak initial agent by eg. imitating a human&#x27;s cognitive procedure.) In iterated amplification, we are hoping that &quot;think longer&quot; (as formalized by increasingly large bounded versions of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NXqs4nYXaq8q6dTTx/humans-consulting-hch\">HCH</a> (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/f1947668b183/alignment-newsletter-34\">AN #34</a>)) would be an alignment-preserving policy improvement operator.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/kphJvksj5TndGapuh/directions-and-desiderata-for-ai-alignment\">Directions and desiderata for AI alignment</a> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: What further research needs to be done to get iterated amplification to work? There are three main areas: robustness, reward learning, and amplification.</p><p>With reliability and robustness, we want our AI systems to never fail catastrophically, whereas the simple setup of iterated amplification only optimizes performance in the average case. This is discussed more in <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99\">Techniques for Optimizing Worst-Case Performance</a>, which talks about adversarial training, interpretability, and verification.</p><p>Reward learning, as I understand it here, is the same thing as <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/SvuLhtREMy8wRBzpC/ambitious-vs-narrow-value-learning\">narrow value learning</a>, described in this newsletter. We&#x27;ve talked a lot about the challenges of reward learning, so I&#x27;ll leave that part out.</p><p>Finally, deliberation and amplification is about how to train an ML system to exceed human performance. At present, the only way we have of doing this is to use reinforcement learning to optimize some simple objective. However, given that &quot;human values&quot; is not a simple objective, we need to figure out another way that allows us to get superhuman performance on the tasks that we actually care about. You could do this with ambitious value learning, but not with narrow value learning. Alternatively, you could try to replicate human cognition and run it longer, either by using iterated amplification, or by using inverse reinforcement learning on cognition.</p><p>Then, the post goes on to talk about desiderata for any solution to AI alignment, proposing that the solution should be secure, competitive and scalable.</p><p>A secure AI system is one that works even when the environment is behaving adversarially. This is not possible in full generality because of no-free-lunch theorems, but we could at least hope that our AI system is never actively &quot;trying&quot; to hurt us. This is desirable because it holds us to a relatively clear standard that we can evaluate currently, rather than trying to predict how the future will look (a notoriously hard task) and evaluating whether our AI system will work in that future. In addition, the typical iterative method of trying things out and seeing how they do may not work in the future, because technological progress may accelerate due to recursive improvement. If we instead focus on arguments and analysis that suggest that our AI systems are secure, we would not need the iterative method. Finally, there could in fact be adversaries (that themselves might be AI systems) that we need to deal with.</p><p>An AI system is competitive if it is almost as efficient and capable as the best possible AI system we could build at the same time (which may be unaligned). This is necessary because without it it becomes very likely that someone will build the unaligned version for the efficiency gains; we would need global coordination to avoid this which seems quite difficult. In addition, it is relatively easy to tell when a system is competitive, whereas if an AI system is uncompetitive, it is hard to tell how uncompetitive it is. Once again, with an uncompetitive AI system, we need to predict the future in order to tell whether or not it will be okay to rely on that system.</p><p>A scalable AI system is one that remains aligned as the underlying technologies become more and more powerful. Without scalability, we would need to predict how far a particular scheme will take us (which seems hard), and we need to continually invest in alignment research in order to &quot;keep up&quot; with improving capabilities, which might be particularly hard to do in the face of accelerating progress due to recursive improvement.</p><p>These are very demanding desiderata. However, while it may seem impossible to get a secure, competitive, scalable solution to AI alignment, we don&#x27;t know why yet, and impossibility claims are notoriously hard to get right. In any case, even if it is impossible, it would be worthwhile to clarify exactly why these desiderata are impossible to meet, in order to figure out how to deal with the resulting problems.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> The three directions of reliability/robustness, reward learning, and amplification seem great. Robustness seems particularly hard to achieve. While there is current work on adversarial training, interpretability and verification, even if all of the problems that researchers currently work on were magically solved, I don&#x27;t have a story for how that leads to robustness of (say) an agent trained by iterated amplification. Normally, I&#x27;d also talk about how amplification seems to require some sort of universality assumption, but now I can just refer you to <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/M8WdeNWacMrmorNdd/towards-formalizing-universality\">ascription universality</a> (described in this newsletter).</p><p>I am more conflicted about the desiderata. They seem very difficult to satisfy, and they don&#x27;t seem strictly necessary to achieve good outcomes. The underlying view here is that we should aim for something that we know is <em>sufficient</em> to achieve good outcomes, and only weaken our requirements if we find a fundamental obstacle. My main issue with this view is that even if it is true that the requirements are impossible to satisfy, it seems very hard to <em>know</em> this, and so we may spend a lot of time trying to satisfy these requirements and most of that work ends up being useless. I can imagine that we try to figure out ways to achieve robustness for several years in order to get a secure AI system, and it turns out that this is impossible to do in a way where we know it is robust, but in practice any AI system that we train will be sufficiently robust that it never fails catastrophically. In this world, we keep trying to achieve robustness, never find a fundamental obstruction, but also never succeed at creating a secure AI system.</p><p>Another way of phrasing this is that I am pessimistic about the prospects of conceptual thinking, which seems to be the main way by which we could find a fundamental obstruction. (Theory and empirical experiments can build intuitions about what is and isn&#x27;t hard, but given the complexities of the real world it seems unlikely that either would give us the sort of crystallized knowledge that Paul is aiming for.) Phrased this way, I put less credence in this opinion, because I think there are a few examples of conceptual thinking being very important, though not that many.</p><h3>Value learning sequence</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vX7KirQwHsBaSEdfK/what-is-narrow-value-learning\">What is narrow value learning?</a> <em>(Rohin Shah)</em>: This post introduces the concept of narrow value learning (as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN/what-is-ambitious-value-learning\">ambitious value learning</a> (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a>), where an AI system is trained to produce good behavior within a particular domain, without expecting generalization to novel circumstances. Most current work in the ML community on preference learning or reward learning falls under narrow value learning.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/SvuLhtREMy8wRBzpC/ambitious-vs-narrow-value-learning\">Ambitious vs. narrow value learning</a> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: While previously I defined narrow value learning as obtaining good behavior in a particular domain, this post defines it as learning the narrow subgoals and instrumental values that the human is pursuing. I believe that these are pointing at the same underlying concept. There are a few reasons to be optimistic about using only narrow value learning to build very powerful AI systems. First, it should be relatively easy to infer many instrumental goals that humans have, such as &quot;acquiring more resources under my control&quot;, &quot;better understanding the world and what I want&quot;, &quot;remaining in control of deployed AI systems&quot;, etc. which an AI system could then pursue with all of its ingenuity. Second, we could infer enough of human preferences to keep humans in a safe environment where they can deliberate in order to figure out what they want to do with the future. Third, humans could use these narrow AI systems as tools in order to implement sophisticated plans, allowing them to perform tasks that we would currently consider to be beyond human ability.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4783ufKpx8xvLMPc6/human-ai-interaction\">Human-AI Interaction</a> <em>(Rohin Shah)</em>: One of the lessons of control theory is that you can achieve significantly stronger guarantees if you are able to make use of <em>feedback</em>. Self-driving cars without any sensors would be basically impossible to build. <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN/what-is-ambitious-value-learning\">Ambitious value learning</a> (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a>) aims to find the utility function that will determine the optimal behavior for the rest of time -- without any feedback. However, human preferences and values will evolve over time as we are exposed to new technologies, cultural norms, and governance structures. This is analogous to the environmental disturbances that control theory assumes, and just as with control theory it seems likely that we will need to have feedback, in the form of some data about human preferences, to accommodate these changes.</p><p>This suggests we might consider an AI design where the AI system constantly elicits information from humans about their preferences using narrow value learning techniques, and acts based on its current understanding. The obvious way of doing this would be to have an estimate of the reward that is updated over time, and actions are chosen based on the current estimate. However, this still has several problems. Most notably, if the AI system chooses actions that are best according to the current reward estimate, it still has convergent instrumental subgoals, and in particular actions that disable the narrow value learning system to lock in the current reward estimate would be rated very highly. Another problem is that this model assumes that human preferences and values change &quot;by magic&quot; and any such change is good -- but in reality, we likely want to make sure this process is &quot;good&quot;, and in particular does not end up being determined by the AI manipulating our preferences.</p><h3>Technical agendas and prioritization</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HvNAmkXPTSoA4dvzv/comments-on-cais\">Comments on CAIS</a> <em>(Richard Ngo)</em>: This post is another summary of and response to <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf\">Comprehensive AI Services</a>, after <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as\">mine</a> last week (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/b649f32b07da/alignment-newsletter-40\">AN #40</a>). I recommend it to get a different take on an important set of ideas.

Often, any divergence between the parts can be either interpreted as a difference between the goals of the parts, or a failure of rationality of one of the parts. The post gives a particular algorithm, and shows how based on the structure of the code of the subagent, we could either infer that the subagent is mistaken, or that it has different goals.</p><p>Now, we could infer meta-preferences by seeing how the system tends to self-modify -- perhaps we notice that it tends to amplify the &quot;goals&quot; of one particular subagent, in which case we can infer that it has a meta-preference for those goals. But without that, there&#x27;s no correct answer to what the true goals are. In the post&#x27;s own words: &quot;In the absence of some sort of meta-preferences, there are multiple ways of establishing the preferences of a hierarchical system, and many of them are equally valid.&quot;</p><h3>Interpretability</h3><p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00770\">Personalized explanation in machine learning</a> <em>(Johanes Schneider et al)</em></p><h1>AI strategy and policy</h1><p><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/aipublic2019/\">The American Public’s Attitudes Concerning Artificial Intelligence</a> <em>(Baobao Zhang et al)</em>: This presents results from a survey of Americans about their attitudes towards AI.

During each iteration, it first generates a new environment by perturbing an existing environment, then optimises each agent for its paired environment, then attempts to transfer agents between existing environments to improve performance (in case one environment turns out to be a useful &quot;stepping stone&quot; towards another). New environments are kept if they are neither too hard nor too easy for the current population of agents. This algorithm was tested using the Bipedal Walker environment, where it significantly outperformed standard evolutionary search.</p><p><strong>Richard&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I think that the &quot;problem problem&quot; is going to become increasingly important in RL, and that this is a promising approach.

But they have integrated style to their thinking. To get that going, follow the rules.</li></ul><p><em>Foreword:</em></p><p><em>My post will have two parts.</em><br/><em>In the first (the one you&#x27;re reading) I’ll detail the rules that are commonly used to dress well. Those rules will optimize the social aspect of clothing, not what the fabric offers technically: how cool you look, not what interesting properties you get out of your clothes. In a later article, I will explore ‘techwear’, aka clothing with technical properties (thermoregulation, impermeability, not retaining smells…), as the logical direction to fully optimize one’s fashion. Because I don’t want to write the second part now, this first half is totally self sufficient, and I’ll write about many other things than clothing before I write on techwear.</em></p><p><em>Dressing well is an art not a science, and an art that changes with trends, social classes, tribes, generations. I am well aware that each rule in this article is broken everyday by extremely well-dressed people; nevertheless those rules are very useful, and a great one in clothing is to start with the basics for which rules apply, and </em>then <em>to explore.</em><br/></p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>A good sense of fashion is both extremely important, and not important at all.<br/>People do judge based on looks. If you are visibly ‘out’, you will suffer social consequences such as people avoiding your company. By dressing well, you avoid being rejected from the get-go. But don’t expect to be loved for it. Being fashionable will save you from the hole and give you a bit of a wind up, but it won’t catapult how cool you are like some movies make believe. If there is something you want that requires being cool, you will still need to work on yourself for it.</p><h1><strong>Optimizing Style, aka: The Rules</strong></h1><p><em>I’ll start with the two principles that guide my buying and dressing behaviours and how I apply the rules.</em></p><h2><strong>Guiding Principles</strong></h2><p><strong>Less Is More</strong></p><p>The One principle to rule them all. To dress well during the first months/years of your learning curve, <em>less is more</em> should be your motto. This is true for shapes - go for simple; for textures - go for plain; for colors - go for the less colored. In clothing, as far as items are concerned more complex almost <em>always</em> hurts in the beginning, whereas more simple almost never does. For example the “Italian” shirts with three buttons near the collar; shirts with collars of a different color; shirt buttons of an unusual color; jeans with seams crossing all over, a jacket overloaded with zippers, wearing a striped instead of a plain shirt, t-shirts with logos on them.... You’ve heard it and it’s true: in clothing, less is more. This doesn’t mean to be monochromatic or to never have pockets or zippers on a coat. It means that when you think ‘oh, I like this funky little detail, it looks cool…’, you don’t trust yourself. I have noticed that generally, as a beginner, every time you go more original, more complex, you go worse. This is actually a mistake that even men who dress <em>well</em> do. They’re ‘bored’ of the basics, try to spice it up, and worsen instead of improving. Don’t let that be you.</p><p></p><p><strong>Dressing Well is <em>Composing Outfits</em></strong></p><p>The second principle is to think, buy and dress in terms <em>outfits</em> rather than individual pieces. When you buy something, unless you have nothing good in your closet, it has to be bought in order to be worn with something you <em>already</em> have, instead of because you like it there and then. Go out shopping with what’s already owned in mind. One resistance people have is that your available styles expand less rapidly (because you’re improving outfit n instead of buying what will be outfit n+). Sure, <em>not</em> composing outfits and just buying individual pieces will result in more <em>potential</em> combinations because you’ll buy more; but in terms of combinations that <em>look good</em>, it will be less. You’ll end up opening your wardrobe, your brain filtering out the unmatchable clothes, and in despair you will cry : “I have nothing to weaaaaar!”. This is real if you don’t buy to compose outfits.</p><p>Read the rules bellow, and the next time you go shopping, it has to be with a purpose of the like: I want item X for reason Y (ie. a woolen sweater because of the cold); it must be Z to go with V (grey to match my black overcoat / thin to be worn under a jacket).</p><p>If you fall in love with some item you think you need to buy, ask yourself : what can I wear it with? If the answer is nothing, let it go. Your ability to let go, to realize that you don’t need something both before and after buying it, is very important when it comes to predicting how well you will dress. Just like how well you update your beliefs when faced with additional evidence is an indicator of how good a rationalist you are.</p><p><em>Off to the actual rules.</em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Fit</strong></h2><p>The most important thing in clothing is fit. Your clothes must follow the natural shape of your body. To the recurrent objection that a given cloth makes you look bad because it shows how fat, or how skinny you are, the answer is that <em>not</em> following your natural shape looks even worse. The only case when <em>not</em> fitting to your natural shape can be good is if you’re big and wear something bigger, because it’ll marginally &quot;float&quot; around you and thus makes you look slimmer inside. Wearing too skinny is never a good idea because it calls the attention to your body <em>parts</em>, not to you or your style. A nice cloth <em>follows</em>; it doesn’t <em>stick</em>. Even if you’re muscular, it’s too try-hard. Again, for a man: show your style, not your body. If you’re naturally skinny, the best is to go with your natural shape. Wider and you’ll look like a flag pole, tighter and your bones will show.</p><p>Fit is basically two things: wearing your correct size, and wearing clothes which cut follows the natural shape of your body.</p><p>A simple way to find what your size is: Find where you’re a little too tight, and go +1. Don’t go further up unless you already dress well. For jeans, because they stretch as you wear them, you can stick to those in which you are a little tight. In doubt, ask a salesperson.</p><p>I couldn’t give a universal advice, but for the engineering type, especially Americans, your jeans and chinos should be tighter than they are now. To know what the right fit is for you, don’t ask ‘is it comfortable?’ because <em>to you</em>, used to large jeans and trousers (relative to what is considered well fitted), the right size <em>will</em> feel uncomfortable. The right question is ‘Am I <em>actually</em> paralyzed?’ (Because that’s what your brain will say.) Undoubtedly though, there will be some marginal loss of ease in movement.</p><p>How do you know if an item of clothing is well cut / makes you look good in them?</p><p>In addition to the item being of your size ; ie not too long nor too short, not too wide nor too tight, its cut should follow your body’s shape. If you are a V, but the shirt is an O or a [], even your correct size won’t fit well. This is the kind of thing experience will teach you, ie wearing things that don’t fit you and learning which brands and/or designs do.</p><p>Pants’ quick win: Most men will look well in slim or semi-slim pants. Try not to go skin-tight to avoid clown feet. If your thighs to calf ratio is bigger than the average man’s however, you should try the ‘carrot’ cut that has more space around the thighs and a lower meeting point for the legs, yet a slimming cut down the leg so that the overall look is still fitted.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Colors</strong></h2><p>The second most important thing in clothing is colors: which to use and how to combine them. The two go hand-in-hand: you use the colors which, were you to combine them, would look harmonious still. Those colors are :</p><p>° Tones from medium to dark blue (preferably not light blue, with the exception of shirts and jeans);</p><p>° Tones from light grey to black;</p><p>° Tones from light sand to kaki (goes through dark beige but excludes brown).</p><p>A note on brown. Although it <em>is</em> a shade of beige, I think that brown should be avoided. This could be due to an association with old people, who tend to wear it more. (Again, no judgement, but the point of clothing is to look cool; even at 50, cool men are too young for brown). Very rarely will you see well-dressed men wearing brown. You can wear brown leather in jackets or shoes, especially if it is suede leather and doesn’t look like orange, but aside from that you should avoid it. I will not advise you to wear brown suits, but some men wear them well.</p><p>A note on black. I decided to add black to the color list because you see it so much in perfectly dressed people that it’d be senseless not to. However, for several social groups, black, except for business/gala shoes, is absolutely forbidden. If you socialize with those and are tempted to go black, go for dark blue instead (to know, just look at the coolest / most group-representative people, and check whether they wear black).</p><p>Within those circles although a black t-shirt or jean will be frowned upon, it should still be tolerated (unless worn together). A black suit however, worn anywhere else than at events where tuxedos are expected, is horrific. It goes without saying that black shirts are equally (if not more) criminal.</p><p>In society at large, black suits are somewhat more accepted, despite their association with valets, taxi drivers, servicing personnel in general. And because some people will think extremely lowly of you for wearing one outside of tuxedos events, I suggest always going for a dark blue suit. You’ll still be elegant to everyone that doesn’t know about the no-black rule, and will not be put in a hole by those who do. Added cost: 0; avoided value loss: potentially a lot.</p><p>A note on shirts’ colors. The color of your business shirt complies to an even stricter array of colors than mentioned (and complying to it for your casual shirts will not hurt either). Your shirt must be light, and mostly will only be blue and white (you have choice! the shirts can have invisible stripes patterns...). Light blue and white only. Never kaki or beige, never grey (ah!), black (brr!), and of course none of the excluded colors (yellow! oh! brown! No.). Those are absolutely forbidden and, by the way, one of the reason well-dressed Europeans look at Americans in their shiny-fabric (!) oversized (!) suits and think Aaaaahhhhhh. In this area, the reason for strictness is very likely more social norm than combinability, which makes it all the more important not to violate. If you do (in the company of well-dressed people, or others “in the know”), people will not only think you dress poorly, they’ll will also not want to be around you, because their status will decrease from contamination. Trust me, I’ve been on the judging end of that norm.</p><p>It’s just like in high school. Can the coolest kid hang out with whoever they want and despise the rule without being contaminated by the violators? Of course they can. Are most kids the nice coolest kid? Of course they aren’t. They will comply and avoid the badly dressed like they do the uncool.</p><p><u>How to match colors.</u></p><p>The great thing with the colors above is that if you stick to them and combine two or three when choosing your clothes, you can’t lose. Little need for detail here: if you stick to two or three of these colors, you will not lose.</p><p><u>Two additional, less strict rules that will make things even simpler for you</u> :</p><p><strong>A</strong>. for the layers worn on your upper body, go from lighter (close to the body, ie your shirt/t-shirt) to darker (further from the body, ie mid-layers, coats etc). This is why good colors for t-shirts are white, light grey and khaki; and why you should start with a dark blue, not a beige coat. But this is no absolute rule.</p><p><strong>B</strong>. Your lower body should be darker than your upper body. This is probably because dark colors make one look slimmer, and most men’s body type is legs bigger than upper body whereas the athletic stereotype is legs thinner than upper body. For that reason, give priority to jeans and chinos that are navy/dark blue, black and dark grey.</p><p>Your shoes can be the exception: plain white sneakers are <em>fantastic</em> to boost an outfit (avoiding logos, stripes etc). Ever wondered why French people look amazingly well dressed? Fit x color understanding x white shoes = (well dressed) French person.</p><p>When you get more advanced with your clothing, from matching two or three <em>colors</em>, try to match two or three <em>tones</em> of colors. Ie, wear light grey tones + navy tones + black.</p><p>Or beige/khaki tones + white + navy tones.</p><p>Find colors that suit you: like women do, bring the cloth near your face and look in the mirror how your tone goes with the color.</p><p>There is a theory out there that the contrast between your clothes should match the contrast between your face and hair: every time I see it described, I can’t tell which of the pictures I’m shown as good vs bad examples is the better. The theory <em>sounds</em> true to me; it’s very logical and some color-theory things are definitely true (black makes your face look paler in contrast; the more contrast with skin and clothes the more your face will stand out); but the overall doesn’t convince me.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Symmetry</strong></h2><p>Symmetry is beautiful to us. On humans, we like vertical symmetry: the right and left sides mirror each other. It seems to me that there are two types of symmetry: simple and complex. Simple is a jacket where the right and left sides of the zipper are plain and the same; complex is when they both have ten buttons placed at the exact same place, mirroring each other. The first is the one we want. When we learn to dress well, we don’t just want to avoid asymmetry (like a zipper diagonally crossing a sweater or a fold coming on top of the other); we also want to avoid complex symmetry.</p><p>This is one of the less strict rules, as we’ve seen James Bonds and Kingsmen rock the double-breasted suit; but given that you’re likely to fail them, play it safe and look awesome in that classic navy suit.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Composition</strong></h2><p>The second part of this article will go into more detail on the properties of the fabrics you wear. Yet, you should still know a few things about fabrics now, for reasons of basic comfort.</p><p>With t-shirts and shirts, don’t go for less than 100% cotton, and try to go for higher-end kinds of cotton for comfort and durability, like Egyptian cotton, Long Island cotton, Supima cotton (there are more).</p><p>For woolen sweaters and for coats, unless you have an absolute crush on an item you can’t find elsewhere, don’t go for an item with over 20% of synthetic fabrics — polyamide, polyester, and the likes. 80% wool 20% synthetic is tolerable, especially if you can’t invest much. For some items, synthetic fabrics are actually added to increase resistance (rarely above 20% though), as natural fabrics like merino wool or cashmere can be more fragile. But synthetic fabrics retain smells, don’t evacuate sweat and heat, creating a sauna effect, and don’t protect against the cold like wool does.</p><p>If you want a winter sweater or coat, you will need to look at the fabric tag.</p><p>Remember with synthetics: sauna in the summer, veil in the winter.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Logos/branding</strong> </h2><p>This is a very important rule, always within Less is More: avoid showy brands. No logo. No message/text/image/comic either. This is first as a social understanding that bragging is low-value because you don’t want to seem like you’re <em>trying</em> to look rich or cool. The other side of logos is signaling your personality through a message or image that you think is cool or funny. It will probably not be understood by most around you, and they’ll think you’re unfunny/uncool/immature. Even counter-signaling often backfires, given that those who you want to think you’re dressed well <em>aren’t</em> those who already think you’re cool, and who’ll get the joke or message.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Price/positioning</strong> (and which are the good brands)</h2><p>Except for some rare high-street shops like Uniqlo, the brands that you want to buy fro<em>m are the ones that don’t come to you</em>.</p><p>The good heuristic for this is precisely your anti-intuition: if you can name them, they’re probably terrible and their money is spent on advertising rather than making good clothes. Advertising <em>is</em> totally logical for a brand that wants to sell its product instead of waiting to be discovered. But it does take money out of the cloth. For we who want to optimize dressing, cutting the advertising costs by finding and sharing those brands that have little or no advertising is the win. Because I know many of those brands, voila a list of those you wish you knew, from least to most expensive (* are my personal favorites (the French names will still deliver worldwide, and are very good)):</p><p>Uniqlo, Cos, Everlane (United States), Paris-Yorker, Le Pantalon, Hast (shirts), Asphalte-paris, SuitSupply, Asket, Spoke London, Seagale* (techwear), Drapeau Noir, Hircus, BonneGueule*, Harmony Paris, Norse Projects*, SEH Kelly,  Howards (shirts), Merz B. Schwanen, APC, Norwegian Rain, Officine Générale*, Editions MR, De Bonne Facture.</p><p></p><h2><strong>The Wardrobe Basics</strong></h2><p>The items that you must have, for which there is no need to wait, and they go with everything (no need to worry about what to wear them with). You will have no trouble whatsoever finding them.</p><p>For each category, I give a list of brands that go from cheap to more expensive. It is heavily French -- that is most I know.</p><p>° <strong>Pants</strong>: dark navy chino, black jeans, dark blue jeans. Opt: beige chino, bleached blue jeans, grey jeans. Best brands: [Uniqlo, Asket, Le Pantalon, Spoke, Nudie, Bonnegueule]</p><p>° <strong>T-shirts</strong> (always plain): white, light grey, dark grey, dark blue, khaki [Uniqlo for cheap Supima cotton, Asket, Seagale, BonneGueule, Norse Projects, Merz B Schwannen].</p><p>° <strong>Sweaters</strong>: dark blue, light grey, dark grey [Uniqlo, Asket, Seagale, Merz B. Shwannen, Officine Generale].</p><p>° <strong>Business shirts</strong>: white, light blue — avoid oxford pattern, go for popeline [Hast, BonneGueule, Howards].</p><p>° <strong>Casual shirts</strong>: the fabric is a more robust cotton (like Oxford or cotton flannel) or it’s made with wool - white, light blue, can go for dark blue, khaki, light grey [Uniqlo, Asket, Drapeau Noir, Norse Projects, BonneGueule, Officine Generale].</p><p>° <strong>Parka/Overcoats</strong>: dark blue and/or dark grey. Beige and khaki also work. Black also works. [SuitSupply, Seagale, Drapeau Noir, Harmony Paris, BonneGueule, SEH Kelly, Officine Generale]. This is a piece for which you should be ready to invest over 350 euros if you need it against the cold.</p><p>° <strong>Shoes</strong>: a pair of <em>minimalist</em> white sneakers (here the Adidas logo or Nike swoosh are tolerated, but if you can avoid them do so). [Cos, Adidas, Nike, NewBalance, Asphalte-Paris, BonneGueule, Axel Arigato (lower quality for the price but look good), National Standard (expensive but long-lasting)]. A pair of minimalist black leather business shoes. Optionnal: minimalist blue leather white sole sneakers [Asphalte-Paris, Axel Arigato, BonneGueule, National Standard] / beige suede or black leather Chelsea or boots [Asphalte-paris, Orbans, BonneGueule, Septieme Largeur, Cobbler Union (United States), Paraboot].</p><p>You’ll notice there are no polo shirts mentioned. They <em>can</em> be worn well, but because they need to be well ironed and fitted to <em>not</em> give that American dad look, I’d rather just not recommend them. They also have a good-boy image and, as previously mentioned, the point of dressing well is to avoid those negative associations. A good alternative is to wear long-sleeved (merino) wool polo sweaters: more elegant, easier to take care of, and with no negative associations.</p><p></p><p><u>More Practical Advice and Things I Wish I Learned Earlier</u></p><p>° Don’t be an overmatcher: using the same fabric from top to bottom; matching two colors perfectly (eg burgundy shoes burgundy sweater with white pants white jacket white hat; this gives you away as try-hard). This is worse than wearing one color, which can be done well (as always, the soberer the color the easier). The best strategy, whether wearing one or several colors: is a camaïeu: for a given color, each additional piece must be of a different tone.</p><p>° For some reason (possibly to look more manly/different to women’s coats), long coats should <em>not</em> follow your body like your clothes do. They shouldn’t be <em>larger</em>, but they shouldn’t be too tight. In fact, straight from the shoulder works wonders...</p><p>° Never wear white socks (this is just a class thing, but <strong><em>very</em></strong> useful to know)</p><p></p><p><em><u>Final comments</u></em>:</p><p><em>-Washing</em>. I don’t know how anecdotal my evidence is, but there may be a tendency in people to overwash. The only things that should be washed after every wear are underwear, cotton shirts, polos and t-shirts. Sweaters need to be washed way less frequently, especially woolen ones. At most once a month. The more you have, the less often you wear them, the more rarely the wash.</p><p>For everything that is woolen or higher quality cotton (and that isn’t stained): wash at 30°C and do not dry. Hang if it’s light, lay down on a dry surface or towel if heavy.</p><p>Pants should be washed every six months, because they shrink ever so slightly after every wash (but then go back to normal after worn), and lose their dye very fast (it’s hard to fixate, and the cheaper the less fixated). It is part of a pant’s life to fade out, so don’t buy a new one every year; but don’t precipitate it either.</p><p><em>-Cool brands</em>. You want to optimize clothing not by wearing just what good brands make, but by wearing what good brands <em>make</em>… <em>that cool people wear.</em> Good brands make some ugly things: from an economic perspective it makes sense: if someone will only buy from you if you make the ugly thing they want, just make it for them and cash in. Also, when you make one hundred pieces, some will be for older or younger generations, some will be too crazy for you, many will break the rules… So don’t buy just because it’s from a good brand. First, learn what is cool, then buy from the good brands.</p><p>Of course, if you have no idea what is cool and don’t even know where to look (give links), then just buying from a brand you know is cool with the rules in mind, even with your bad taste, is a massive head start.</p><p><em>-Consumerism</em>. Sure, don’t be consumerist. Don’t buy and buy and buy. People overestimate how much pleasure goods will bring them. <em>However</em>, there is a very real phenomenon that just <em>happens</em>, and it only does after a nontrivial number of items of clothing bought <em>and time</em>, yet it is pretty sudden: at some point in your dressing ‘journey’, you’ll become <em>well dressed</em>. You’ll more or less always be fashionable, recognized for it, where you go people will assume you’ve always dressed well, and you’ll derive about as much pleasure from it as you derived displeasure from realizing that you still didn’t look good, when you had just bought and worn a new item you liked. That said, I still stand behind the well-hammered philosophy that consists in buying <em>less but better</em>.</p><p>Although I recommend BonneGueule for every clothing category, I am in no way related to them. It&#x27;s a simple coincidence that they make such amazing clothes and as a blog give so much free value away. I guess this is where giving gets you. If you live outside of France, count 19% off their prices as they (unlike other brands) discount the value tax. If you aren’t in Europe, the price will raise in delivery.</p><p></p><p>if you want to know more, you can start with r/malefashionadvice’s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/index\">wiki</a>; and with Bonne Gueule’s YouTube video series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0cAwwUTNI8vSOeacrIwE-Aja7worYSZE\">Le Bon Look</a> -- some videos have English subtitles. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>If you live in London and want to pay to spend a day shopping with me; if you want to send me a message about anything; or if you just want to see my irrational lifestyle... head to ig @eaudadrien </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p> I’ve noticed a marked change in my clientele after going into private practice.[1] Of course I expected class differences-- I charge full fee and don’t take insurance. But there are differences that are not as predictable as ‘has more money’. During residency I worked at a hospital Medicaid clinic and saw mostly poor, often chronically unemployed people. While monetary problems were a source of stress, they were not nearly as present in people’s minds as someone from a middle-class upbringing might think. These people were used to going without. They were not trying to get more. The types of things they talked about were family problems, health problems, and trauma. So much trauma. People’s ego-identity crises centered less on their accomplishments and more on their relationships.</p><p>The patients I see now are mostly highly successful, highly educated, weathly people, most of whom care a lot about their careers. Their ego-identity crises center around their work and their position in life relative to others. There is a lot of concern about ‘the path’. ‘Did I go down the right path?’ ‘Did I make a wrong turn?’ There seems to be a great fear of making or having made a wrong decision, which can paralyze their ability to make future decisions.  While this group is not without trauma, it is not what they wish to focus on. They will often be dismissive of its effects on them, noting that they clearly got over it in order to get where they are now. Which is, you know, in my office.<br/> </p><p>Many of my new patients do NOT want to take medication. This is a large change from my patients at the Medicaid clinic who were always requesting more and different pills. And this difference is not because my new patients are less unhappy. They describe intense misery, even a wish to die, going on for months if not years, and yet they struggle through each day in their sisyphean ordeal. They ‘power through’ until they can’t. Until something gives. Then they come to me.</p><p>I can think of several good reasons to have concerns about using medication. What are the long-term effects? Could this change my identity? What if this makes me ok with a shitty situation and then I don’t fix an underlying problem? But these are not the typical concerns I hear raised. What most of my patients say is that they don’t want to ‘rely’ on a medication. They don’t want to be the type of person who takes it. ‘That would mean there is something wrong with my brain.’ Even though they are clearly very depressed, clearly suffering and hating every day, so long as they can push through without taking a pill they must be ‘ok’ in some sense. Taking the pill would confirm there is actually something wrong. Taking the pill might mean they are more similar to the patients at the Medicaid clinic than they want to consider.<br/> <br/> </p><p>What struck me about this was how people’s desires to assume a certain identity – that of someone who didn’t take medication – was more important to them than their actual lived experience. ‘This is your life.’ And this is broader than to take or not take medication. People will suffer through horrible work situations in order to be the type or person who has that job. ‘If your job makes you want to kill yourself, shouldn’t you consider quitting it before killing yourself?’ ‘But I’m good at it.’ Identity seems to be everything. Experience is there to tell you if you’re on the right way to assuming the proper identity. If you go through the motions properly you can look the part. What’s the difference between looking the part and being the person anyway?</p><p>Now refusing medication would be one thing if they wanted to come for weekly therapy and talk through their problems. But many don’t. They complain they don’t have the time (and it’s time, not money that is the concern). They know something is wrong. They were told by their pmd or prior psychiatrist that they should go on an antidepressant. They didn’t like the idea, they came to me. For what? I suspect they wanted me to identify the one thing that would help them in one 45 minute session and tell them how to fix it. It doesn’t work like that. In this sense, they are not that different from the patients I worked with at the Medicaid clinic. Those patients demanded new meds to fix them, when they clearly had a lot of problems medication was not going to fix. ‘This might make you feel less horrible, but it’s not going to solve the problems with your marriage.’ These new patients eschew being identified in that class, but still in some sense want a ‘quick fix’. They want to feel better but keep their illusion of identity intact. </p><p>So what’s the point of these observations? I’m not quite sure yet. I’m still working that out for myself, which is one of the reasons I decided to write them down. I find I identify more strongly with my current clients, which is unsurprising given we have more similar characteristics and backgrounds. I see some of my own identity struggles in theirs, and it makes me reflect how ridiculous the whole identity struggle is. Everyone is Goodhardting it[2]. All of the time. People want to play a part and they want to be the type of person who plays that part, and their lived experience is a frustrating disappointment which doesn’t fit the role they told themselves they have to play.  And we live in a society that is vigorously reinforcing ‘identity’ roles. One where 7 year olds are asked to write essays on their ‘identity’. Can we let go of these identity constructs? What is the alternative? Buddhism? Ego death? Self-referential sarcasm? I feel like I’m onto something but not quite there yet. Psychoanalysis is, afterall, an attempt to be more honest with ourselves, and that, it turns out, is much more difficult to do than one might initially think. </p><p>[1] * Just noting that I realize that money is not the only factor in the selection process. Patients at the Medicaid clinic were often waiting for months to be seen. A long wait will select against patients that are ambivalent about taking medication. In addition, my website advertises me as being more ‘evidence-based’, which I think appeals to people who are more likely to have a scientific world-view. Another large difference between my current and former clients is belief in God. Almost none of my current clients believe in God, whereas the majority of my prior clients did. Religion does anticorrelate with class, but I think this is more extreme then one would expect by class alone. I also have a large number of people in finance. How many hedge fund managers are there in NYC anyway? I have many first and second generation immigrants, who have ‘pulled myself up by the boot straps’ type stories. The wealthy clients I got are ‘new money.’ Basically I think my advertising captured a demographic that is unusually close to that of my friend/peer group and not necessarily representative of most ‘rich people.’ The factors that caused them to select me might very well be more relevant than rich v poor in terms of their psychodynamic makeup.</p><p>[2] * Goodhardt’s law:  &quot;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&quot; In other words – people are optimizing for the superficial qualities by which success is measured, and not the underlying structure of the success.</p>",

Some strings amount to definitions in English of sets of positive integers and others do not; strike out the ones that do not, and we are left with an enumeration of all definitions in English of sets of positive integers, or, replacing each definition by the set it defines, and enumeration of all sets of positive integers that have definitions in English. Since some sets have more than one definition, there will be redundancies. Strike them out to obtain an irredundant enumeration of all sets of positive integers that have definitions in English. Now consider the set of positive integers defined by the condition that a positive integer <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none;

How do we even quantify the expressiveness of English, is that a thing?&quot;, and so on.

After all, coNP-complete problems are trivially <em>Cook</em> reducible to their NP-complete counterparts (<em>e.g.</em>, query the oracle and then negate the output), but many believe that there isn&apos;t a corresponding <em>Karp</em> reduction (where we do a polynomial amount of computation before querying the oracle and returning its answer). Since we aren&apos;t considering complexity but instead whether it&apos;s computable at all, complementation is fine.</p><h2>3 Turing Computability</h2><blockquote>Turing&apos;s thesis is that any effectively computable function is Turing computable, so that computation in the precise technical sense we have been developing coincides with effective computability in the intuitive sense.</blockquote><p>On several occasions, the authors emphasize how the intuitive nature of &quot;effective computability&quot; renders futile any attempt to formalize the thesis. However, I&apos;m rather interested in formalizing intuitive concepts and therefore wondered why this hasn&apos;t been attempted.

My mind&apos;s eye began viewing the world differently. Goings-on came to be characterized not just as interactions of atomic &quot;objects&quot;, but as the outgrowth of the evolution of some mathematical structure. As a vast and complex play of sorts, distorted by my mind and approximated in specific ways &#x2013; some legible, others not.</p><p>Most of all, a tugging in the back of my mind intensified, continually reminding me just how ignorant I am about the nature of our world. </p><h2>9 A Pr&#xE9;cis of First-Order Logic: Syntax</h2><h2>10 A Pr&#xE9;cis of First-Order Logic: Semantics</h2><blockquote>In fact, if you take Euclid&apos;s first four postulates, there are many possible interpretations in which &quot;straight line&quot; takes on a multitude of meanings. This ability to disconnect the <em>intended </em>interpretation from the <em>available </em>interpretations is the bedrock of model theory. Model theory is the study of a<em>ll </em>interpretations of a theory, not just the ones that the original author intended.</blockquote><blockquote>Of course, model theory isn&apos;t really about finding surprising new interpretations &#x2014; it&apos;s much more general than that. It&apos;s about exploring the breadth of interpretations that a given theory makes available. It&apos;s about discerning properties that hold in all possible interpretations of a theory. It&apos;s about discovering how well (or poorly) a given theory constrains its interpretations. It&apos;s a toolset used to discuss interpretations in general.</blockquote><blockquote>At its core, model theory is the study of what a mathematical theory actually says, when you strip the intent from the symbols.</blockquote><p>I can&apos;t emphasize enough how helpful Nate&apos;s <em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MG8Yhsxqu9JY4xRPr/mental-context-for-model-theory\">Mental Context for Model Theory</a> </em>was; the mental motions behind model theory are a major factor in my excitement for studying more logic.</p><h2>11 The Undecidability of First-Order Logic</h2><h2>12 Models</h2><p>Coming out of linear algebra with a &quot;isomorphism ?= bijection&quot; confusion, the treatment in this chapter laid the conceptual foundation for my later understanding homomorphisms. That is, a key part of the &quot;meaning&quot; of mathematical objects lies not just in their number, but in how they relate to one another. </p><p>This chapter is also great for disassociating baggage we might na&#xEF;vely assign to words on the page, underlining the role of syntax as pointers to mathematical objects.</p><h2>13 The Existence of Models</h2><h2>14 Proofs and Completeness</h2><h2>15 Arithmetization</h2><h2>16 Representability of Recursive Functions</h2><p>I confess that upon wading back into the thicket of logical notation and terminology, I found myself lost. I was frustrated at how quickly I&apos;d apparently forgotten everything I&apos;d worked so hard for. After simmering down, I went back through a couple chapters, and found myself rather bored by how easy it was. I hadn&apos;t forgotten much at all &#x2013; not beyond the details, anyways. I don&apos;t know whether that counts as &quot;<a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Truly-Part-Of-You\">truly a part of me</a>&quot;, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s reasonable to expect myself to memorize everything, especially on the first go. </p><h2>17 Indefinability, Undecidability, Incompleteness</h2><blockquote>Perhaps the most important implication of the [first] incompleteness theorem is what it says about the notions of <em>truth</em> (in the standard interpretation) and <em>provability</em> (in a formal system): <em>that they are in no sense the same</em>.</blockquote><p>Indeed, the notion of provability can be subtly different from our mental processes for judging the truth of a proposition; within the confines of a formal system, provability doesn&apos;t just tell us about the proposition in question, but also about the characteristics of that system. This <em>must</em> be kept in mind. </p><blockquote>When Godel&#x2019;s theorem first appeared, with its more general conclusion that a mathematical system may contain certain propositions that are undecidable within that system, it seems to have been a great psychological blow to logicians, who saw it at first as a devastating obstacle to what they were trying to achieve. Yet a moment&#x2019;s thought shows us that many quite simple questions are undecidable by deductive logic. There are situations in which one can prove that a certain property must exist in a finite set, even though it is impossible to exhibit any member of the set that has that property. For example, two persons are the sole witnesses to an event; they give opposite testimony about it and then both die. Then we know that one of them was lying, but it is impossible to determine which one.<br><br>In this example, the undecidability is not an inherent property of the proposition or the event; it signifies only the incompleteness of our own <em>information</em>. But this is equally true of abstract mathematical systems; when a proposition is undecidable in such a system, that means only that its axioms do not provide enough information to decide it. But new axioms... might supply the missing information and make the proposition decidable after all.<br><br>In the future, as science becomes more and more oriented to thinking in terms of information content, Godel&#x2019;s results will be seen as more of a platitude than a paradox. Indeed, from our viewpoint &quot;undecidability&quot; merely signifies that a problem is one that calls for <em>inference</em> rather than deduction. Probability theory as extended logic is designed specifically for such problems.</blockquote><blockquote> ~ E.T. Jaynes, <em>Probability Theory</em></blockquote><h2>18 The Unprovability Of Consistency</h2><h2>19 Normal Forms</h2><h2>20-27 [Skipped]</h2><p>I found these advanced topics rather boring; the most important was likely provability logic, but I intend to study that separately in the future anyways.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><ul><li>Nate Soares <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CvhPTwSMPqNju7hhw/book-review-computability-and-logic\">already covered this</a>; unlike him, I didn&apos;t quite find it to be a breeze, although it certainly isn&apos;t the hardest material I covered last year.   </li><li>I&apos;m surprised the authors didn&apos;t include the thematically appropriate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_recursion_theorem\">recursion theorem,</a> which states that a Turing machine can use its source code in its own computation without any kind of infinite regress (see: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)\">quines)</a>.

We may eventually want to train RL agents to behave “well” in open-ended environments where there is no simple goal.</p><p>Suppose that we are trying to train an RL agent <strong>A</strong>.

The question is: how do we carry out the evaluation, so that the optimal strategy for <strong>A</strong> is to also make “good” decisions?</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@paulfchristiano/30285c779450\">Following Daniel Dewey</a>, I’ll call this the <em>reward engineering problem</em>.</p><p>Note that our evaluation process may be quite expensive, and actually implementing it may be infeasible. To build a working system, we would need to combine this evaluation with <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/semi-supervised-reinforcement-learning-cf7d5375197f#.rm5dypm4a\">semi-supervised RL</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/learning-with-catastrophes-59387b55cc30#.vctnbxafg\">learning with catastrophes</a>.</p><h2>Possible approaches and remaining problems</h2><p>I know of 3 basic approaches to reward engineering:</p><ol><li><strong>Direct supervision</strong>. Use <strong>H</strong> to evaluate <strong>A</strong>’s behavior, and train <strong>A</strong> to maximize <strong>H</strong>’s evaluations. In some contexts we could <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/optimizing-with-comparisons-c02b8c0d7877#.jx6i2cxxu\">compare two behaviors</a> instead of evaluating one in isolation.</li><li><strong>Imitation learning</strong>. Use <strong>H</strong> to generate a bunch of transcripts, and train <strong>A</strong>to produce similar-looking transcripts. For example, we could train a model to distinguish <strong>A</strong>’s behavior from <strong>H</strong>’s behavior, and reward <strong>A</strong> when it fools the distinguisher.</li><li><strong>Inverse reinforcement learning</strong>. Use <strong>H</strong> to generate a bunch of transcripts, and then infer a reward function which is being approximately optimized by <strong>H</strong>. Use this reward function to evaluate <strong>A</strong>’s behavior.</li></ol><p>All of these approaches are promising but face significant challenges. I’ll describe some of these problems in the next 3 sections.</p><h1>1. Direct supervision</h1><p>In direct supervision, <strong>H</strong> looks at a transcript of <strong>A</strong>’s behavior, and estimates how good that transcript is.</p><p>To see the problem with this scheme, suppose that <strong>A</strong> has been asked to draw a picture, and <strong>A</strong> does it by copying an existing picture with some modifications. If originality is especially important, then this may be a very “bad” policy. But even if <strong>H</strong> is much smarter than <strong>A</strong>, it may be hard to tell that the picture is not original — creating a derivative work only requires looking at a single existing picture, while checking if a work is derivative requires considering <em>every</em> picture.</p><p>More formally: in order for direct supervision to be effective, <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/adequate-oversight-25fadf1edce9#.1aj4sfjiu\"><strong>H</strong> needs to be better-informed than <strong>A</strong> about what is “good.”</a> If this condition is satisfied, then from <strong>A</strong>’s perspective, estimating <strong>H</strong>’s estimate of goodness is equivalent to estimating actual goodness. This condition is superficially plausible — after all, we did assume that <strong>H</strong> is smarter than <strong>A</strong>.</p><p>The problem is that when <strong>A</strong> picks an action, <strong>A</strong> is especially well-informed about that action — the computation which produced the action provides evidence about it, and <strong>H</strong> may not have access to that evidence.</p><h2>Transparency</h2><p>One response is to let <strong>H</strong> see <em>how</em> <strong>A</strong> computed its action. If <strong>H</strong> can understand that process, then <strong>H</strong> may be able to effectively evaluate the action.</p><p>Sometimes this is straightforward: for example, if <strong>A</strong> uses an attention mechanism to look at a particular painting and copy it, we can simply tell <strong>H</strong>what <strong>A</strong> looked at.</p><p>In other contexts it might be much more challenging. For example, <strong>A</strong> may copy an image by “memorizing” the image in its weights, rather than by “looking at” the image at test time.</p><p>One approach to these challenging cases is to train <strong>A</strong> to produce actions <em>and</em>to produce explanations that are maximally helpful for evaluating those actions. For example, we may train <strong>A</strong> to produce images <em>and</em> to point out similarities between its output and training images.</p><p>This is a challenging problem for several reasons. One issue is that producing these explanations involves a huge “action space” and a very complex objective. A more subtle problem is that there are two conflicting objectives: <strong>A</strong>wants to produce actions that <strong>H</strong> evaluates as “good,” but providing useful information will sometimes lead <strong>H</strong> to produce a lower evaluation. Training <strong>A</strong>to do both tasks requires a new approach.</p><h2>Other problems</h2><p>We can imagine other failure modes of direct supervision. For example, <strong>A</strong> may find an action that exploits one of <strong>H</strong>’s biases or blind spots in order to receive a high rating.</p><p>We hope that these “attacks” can only succeed if <strong>H</strong> is ignorant about the process that produced a given action, and so can be resolved by whatever form of transparency allows <strong>H</strong> to accurately evaluate <strong>A</strong>’s actions in general.</p><p>That is, if <strong>A</strong> carefully explains to <strong>H</strong> how an action was chosen to exploit <strong>H</strong>’s biases, then <strong>H</strong> can hopefully avoid being exploited. This seems especially plausible given that <strong>H</strong> is smarter than <strong>A</strong>.</p><h1>2. Imitation learning</h1><p>Imitation learning has two conceptual problems:</p><ul><li>If <strong>H</strong> is more competent than <strong>A</strong>, then <strong>A</strong> will generally be unable to imitate <strong>H</strong>’s behavior.</li><li>We don’t have a totally satisfactory framework for reducing imitation learning to an optimization problem.</li></ul><h2>What if A can’t imitate H?</h2><p>Suppose that <strong>A</strong> has been asked to build a block tower. <strong>H</strong> can quickly stack the blocks, and 99% of the time the tower stays standing; 1% of the time <strong>H</strong>messes up and the tower falls down. <strong>A</strong> is not as capable as <strong>H</strong>, and so if it tries to stack the blocks quickly the tower falls down 100% of the time.</p><p>The “best” behavior for <strong>A</strong> may be to stack the blocks more slowly, so that the tower can stay standing. But this behavior is hard to induce with imitation learning, because <strong>H</strong> <em>never</em> stacks the blocks slowly. Instead, an imitation learner is more likely to try to stack the blocks quickly and fail (since at least <strong>H</strong> does this 1% of the time).</p><p>One response to this problem is to have <strong>H</strong> “dumb down” its behavior so that it can be copied by <strong>A</strong>.</p><p>However, this process may be challenging for <strong>H</strong>. Finding a way to do a task which is within <strong>A</strong>’s abilities may be much harder than simply doing the task — for example, it may require a deep understanding of <strong>A</strong>’s limitations and capabilities.</p><p>I’ve proposed a procedure, “<a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/mimicry-maximization-and-meeting-halfway-c149dd23fc17#.l513cw5l0\">meeting halfway</a>,” for addressing this problem. The idea is that we train a discriminator to distinguish <strong>H</strong>’s behavior from <strong>A</strong>’s behavior, and use the discriminator’s output to help <strong>H</strong> behave in an “<strong>A</strong>-like” way. This proposal faces many challenges, and it’s not at all clear if it can work.</p><h2>How do you train an imitator?</h2><p>The plagiarism example from the last section is also a challenge for imitation learning. Suppose that <strong>A</strong> has been asked to draw a picture. <strong>H</strong> would draw a completely original picture. How can we train <strong>A</strong> to draw an original picture?</p><p>The most plausible existing approach is probably generative adversarial networks. In this approach, a discriminator is trained to distinguish <strong>A</strong>’s behavior from <strong>H</strong>’s behavior, and <strong>A</strong> is trained to fool the discriminator.</p><p>But suppose that <strong>A</strong> draws a picture by copying an existing image. It may be hard for the discriminator to learn to distinguish “original image” from “derivative of existing image,” for exactly the same reasons discussed before. And so <strong>A</strong> may receive just as high a reward by copying an existing image as by drawing a novel picture.</p><p>Unfortunately, solving this problem seems even more difficult for reinforcement learning. We can’t give the discriminator any access to <strong>A</strong>’s internal state, since the discriminator isn’t supposed to know whether it is looking at data that came from <strong>A</strong> or from <strong>H</strong>.</p><p>Instead, it might be easier to use an alternative to the generative adversarial networks framework. There are some plausible contenders, but nothing is currently known that could plausibly scale to general behavior in complex environments. (Though the obstacles are not always obvious.)</p><h1>3. Inverse reinforcement learning</h1><p>In IRL, we try to infer a reward function that <strong>H</strong> is approximately maximizing. We can then use that reward function to train <strong>A</strong>.</p><p>This approach is closely connected to imitation learning, and faces exactly analogous difficulties:</p><ul><li><strong>H</strong>’s behavior does not give much information about the reward function in regions far from <strong>H</strong>’s trajectory.</li><li>If we first learn a reward function and then use it to train <strong>A,</strong> then the reward function is essentially a direct supervisor and faces exactly the same difficulties.</li></ul><p>The second problem seems to be the most serious: unless we find a resolution to that problem, then direct supervision seems more promising than IRL. (Though IRL <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/learn-policies-or-goals-348add76b8eb#.rvsv6syfl\">may still be a useful technique for the resulting RL problem</a> — understanding the supervisor’s values is a critical subtask of solving an RL problem defined by direct supervision.)</p><h2>H’s behavior is not sufficiently informative</h2><p>Consider the block tower example from the last section. If <strong>H</strong> always quickly builds a perfect block tower, then <strong>H</strong>’s behavior does not give any evidence about tradeoffs between different imperfections: how much should <strong>A</strong> be willing to compromise on quality to get the job done faster? If the tower can only be tall <em>or</em> stable, which is preferred?</p><p>To get around this difficulty, we would like to elicit information from <strong>H</strong> other than trajectories. For example, we might ask <strong>H</strong> questions, and use those questions as evidence about <strong>H</strong>’s reward function.</p><p>Incorporating this information is much less straightforward than incorporating information from <strong>H</strong>’s behavior. For example, updating on <strong>H</strong>’s statements require an explicit model of how <strong>H</strong> believes its statements relate to its goals, even though we can’t directly observe that relationship. This is much more complex than existing approaches like MaxEnt IRL, which fit a simple model directly to <strong>H</strong>’s behavior.</p><p>These issues are central in “cooperative IRL.” For now there are many open problems.</p><h2>The major difficulties of direct supervision still apply</h2><p>The bigger problem for IRL is how to represent the reward function:</p><ul><li>If the reward function is represented by a concrete, learned function from trajectories to rewards, then we are back in the situation of direct supervision.</li><li>Instead the reward function may act on an abstract space of “possible worlds.” This approach potentially avoids the difficulties of direct supervision, but it seems to require a particular form of model-based RL. It’s not clear if this constraint will be compatible with the most effective approaches to reinforcement learning.</li></ul><p>Ideally we would find a better representation that incorporates the best of both worlds — avoiding the difficulties of direct supervision, without seriously restricting the form of <strong>A</strong>.</p><p>Alternatively, we could hope that powerful RL agents have an appropriate model-based architecture. Or we could do research on appropriate forms of model-based RL to increase the probability that they are competitive.</p><h1>Research directions</h1><p>Each of the problems discussed in this post is a possible direction for research. I think that three problems are especially promising:</p><ul><li>Training ML systems to produce the kind of auxiliary information that could make direct supervision reliable. There are open theoretical questions about how this training should be done — and huge practical obstacles to actually making it work.</li><li>Developing alternative objectives for imitation learning or generative modeling. There has been a lot of recent progress in this area, and it is probably worth doing more conceptual work to see if we can find new frameworks.</li><li>Experimenting with “meeting halfway,” or with other practical approaches for producing imitable demonstrations.</li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>If we cannot solve the reward engineering problem in practice, it seems unlikely that we will be able to train robustly beneficial RL agents.</p><p>Conversely, if we can solve the reward engineering problem, then I believe that solution could be leveraged into an attack on the whole value alignment problem (along <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/alba-an-explicit-proposal-for-aligned-ai-17a55f60bbcf\">these lines</a> — I will discuss this in more detail over my next few posts).</p><p>Reward engineering is not only an important question for AI control, but also appears to be tractable today; there are both theoretical and experimental lines of attack. I’m optimistic that we will understand this problem much better over the coming years, and I think that will be very good news for AI control.</p><p><em>(This research was supported as part of the</em> <em><a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/\">Future of Life Institute</a></em> <em>FLI-RFP-AI1 program, grant #2015–143898.)</em></p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>This was originally posted <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/the-reward-engineering-problem-30285c779450\">here</a> on 30th May 2016.</em></p><p><em>The next post in this sequence will be Capability Amplification by Paul Christiano.</em></p><p><em>Tomorrow&#x27;s post will be in the sequence on Value Learning by Rohin Shah.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>When I&apos;m debugging myself or others for unproductive behavioral, emotional, or mental patterns (hereby referred to as patterns) , I use this quasi-linear framework to make sure that I don&apos;t miss any critical steps and the issue stays solved.  I&apos;ve used this framework successfully with clients, housemates at Gentle Mesa, and hotel mates at The EA Hotel, as well as in debugging my own internal conflicts.  I&apos;m currently creating a GuidedTrack course that takes people through search of these steps and their associated techniques.</p><p>This model makes some assumptions about the underlying structure of the internal issue.  It generally assumes that our patterns have internal reasons behind them, that those reasons are often coded as subconscious beliefs about the world or yourself, and that those beliefs sometimes cluster together to be understood as what we often refer to as &quot;parts&quot; or &quot;subagents&quot;.</p><p>Finally, it assumes that when we have a pattern that we consider negative, one way to understand this is a tension between the part that is causing the pattern and the part that sees that pattern as negative (hereby referred to as anti-patterns).  A successful debugging is one in which that tension is dissolved, rearranged, or in rare cases, accepted.</p><h1>1. Awareness</h1><p>The first step to solving an internal conflict is recognizing that you have it.  In this stage, you use awareness of self-talk, mental imagery, and bodily sensations to notice that there&apos;s something &quot;off&quot;.</p><h2>Associated Techniques</h2><ul><li>Mindfulness</li><li>CFAR&apos;s Bug List Prompts</li><li>CFAR&apos;s MurphyJitsu</li></ul><h1>2. Introspection</h1><p>In this stage, you work to understand the cause of the pattern.  You&apos;re trying to make explicitly conscious the beliefs that underlie the pattern.    On the flipside, you&apos;re working to understand the cause of the anti-pattern, and the beliefs that cause the pattern to be seen as problem.</p><p>It&apos;s often useful here to not just understand the first level need being met  (e.g. &quot;I don&apos;t want to procrastinate because it lets me be more productive&quot;) but to find the &quot;deeper cut&quot; - The deeper need or fear that is being served  (e.g. &quot;If I&apos;m not productive than I don&apos;t deserve anybody&apos;s love&quot;)</p><p>Finally, in this step, it&apos;s important to check for &quot;second order constructions&quot; - that is, do I have a belief that this tension needs to exist in order to meet another need. Do I have a belief that if either of these beliefs are dissolved something bad will happen (beyond not meeting the original need the belief was obstensibly there for). </p><p>For example &quot;I have to believe that my father is a nice person, because if I didn&apos;t the identity based on my childhood would crumble and that would be scary,&quot; or&quot;It&apos;s important to strike a balance between being productive and relaxing so that I can see myself as well rounded. If I dissolve this tension, I&apos;ll stop being well-rounded.&quot;</p><h2>Associated Techniques</h2><ul><li>Gendlin&apos;s Focusing</li><li>Leverage&apos;s Belief Reporting</li><li>Pj Eby&apos;s Relaxed Mental Inquiry</li><li>Coherence Therapy&apos;s Radical Inquiry</li></ul><h1>3. Acceptance</h1><p>In the acceptance stage, you&apos;re working to truly integrate that you&apos;ve been choosing this pattern over an alternative in order to get your needs met (based on the beliefs you introspected in the last step). You&apos;re also working to accept that this pattern is not malicious or something to be destroyed, but instead honor that it&apos;s based on it&apos;s wisdom and beliefs.  On the flip side, you&apos;re looking to accept the deeper cut behind the anti-pattern, and the deep reasons that drove you to try to solve the problem in the first place.</p><p>There are two different flavors of acceptance. A more &apos;yin&apos; acceptance in which you&apos;re accepting the beliefs you had as valid and embracing them with love, which can be hard for the anti-pattern. And a &apos;yang&apos; acceptance in which you&apos;re taking ownership that you&apos;ve caused the negative pattern in your life and chosen to continue it up to now, against the protests of the anti-pattern.  Note that if you merely flipped which part was the pattern and the anti-pattern, the yin and yang methods flip as well.</p><p>A complete acceptance that doesn&apos;t cause problems in the future should include both types of acceptance, which as pointed out is symmetrical to an acceptance of both parts (the pattern and the anti-pattern).</p><h2>Associated Techniques</h2><ul><li>Coherence Therapy&apos;s Practice of Verbalizing Beliefs</li><li>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy&apos;s Half Smile, Open Hands</li><li>Neuro-Linguistic Programming&apos;s Future Projection</li><li>Sedona Method&apos;s Three Questions</li></ul><h1>4. Memory Reconsolidation</h1><p>In the memory reconsolidation stage, the goal is to find a way to get all needs met. This can involve the pattern and the anti-pattern both dissolving to create a third, new pattern. Or it can involve either the pattern or the anti-pattern dissolving in a realization they&apos;re not required to get their need met.  Sometimes, it can involve an add on belief that even though the pattern or the anti-pattern is not getting their need met, that&apos;s ok temporarily.</p><p>There are dozens of techniques I&apos;ve cataloged for working different types of reconsolidation on different types of patterns encoded in different modalities.  In fact, the alignment part of the process itself a process of going through a series of different types of techniques based on the properties of the patterns until you find one that fits.</p><p>A useful distinction to have  is between techniques that use reconditioning (that is, slowly building up the new belief neuron pathways over time, so they it fire instead of the old one) with techniques that use reintegration (that is, they use the process of emotional memory reintegration to change the original pathway such that they match the new belief).  Reintegration techniques should be a go-to as they are much faster and more permanent, but it&apos;s good to have both tools in your toolbox.  I&apos;ll be writing a post up about this distinction and the book I learned it from (Unlocking the Emotional Brain) at some point.</p><h2>Associated Techniques</h2><ul><li>CFAR&apos;s Internal Double Crux</li><li>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&apos;s Thought Countering</li><li>Bryon Katie&apos;s The Work</li><li>Mark Lippman&apos;s Folding</li><li>My Dialectical Reprocessing Technique</li></ul><h1>5. Completeness and Creation</h1><p>This is really two steps, but it&apos;s rolled into one for the purposes of keeping the process linear.  Now that you&apos;ve made a new pattern through reconsolidation that aims to get all needs met, you need to make sure that you have everything you need to actually meet that need.  </p><p>For instance, you started with a pattern that said you needed to be serious all the time to get work done, and a pattern that didn&apos;t like being serious all the time because it didn&apos;t help you socially.  Your new pattern says that you can work in an easy, carefree joking way.  However, when you use some of the &quot;completeness checks&quot; below, you realize that you&apos;re missing some of the internal and external resources needed to actually act easy, carefree and joking.</p><ul><li>You realize that even though you no longer have a self-image of yourself as serious, you still don&apos;t have an image of yourself as carefree.</li><li>You realize that even though you imagine yourself joking around with this new belief, when you get higher resolution you don&apos;t actually have the skill to make jokes.</li></ul><p>So, you use the creation step to install these new supporting beliefs, habits, and skills needed to actually get your needs met.</p><h2>Associated Completeness Check Techniques</h2><ul><li>CFAR&apos;s MurphyJitsu</li><li>Neuro-Linguistic Programming&apos;s Future Projection.</li><li>TRIZ&apos;s 9 Window Technique</li></ul><h2>Associated Creation Techniques</h2><ul><li>CFAR&apos;s Trigger-Action Plans</li><li>Steve Andreas&apos;s Self-Image Installation</li><li>My Three Books Technique</li><li>Neuro-Linguistic Programming&apos;s Swish Technique</li></ul><h1>6. Ecology</h1><p>Now that you&apos;ve made many changes internally, a final check of your whole life and environment is done to ensure that you haven&apos;t created conflicts and tension elsewhere in the process of resolving your old pattern and anti-pattern.  You&apos;ll use a number of techniques to see consequences of the changes you made, and then you&apos;ll use your awareness techniques to notice any new conflicts that arise. If any do, you&apos;ll repeat the rest of the process.</p><h2>Associated Techniques</h2><ul><li>CFAR&apos;s Inner-Sim</li><li>Neuro-Linguistic Programming&apos;s Perceptual Positions</li><li>Timeline Therapy&apos;s Timeline Check</li></ul><h1>7. Integration</h1><p>In the integration step, you&apos;ll take the new patterns you&apos;ve created  in the reconsolidation and creation steps. and integrate them in two ways.  Firstly, you&apos;ll want to tie the new neuron pattern for the pathway to as many other paths as possible, lest you forget it.  Second, you&apos;ll want to make the new pattern as deeply as possible tied to your most fundamental values, such that it becomes core to who you are.</p><h2>Associated Techniques</h2><ul><li>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy&apos;s Mental Rehearsal</li><li>Neuro-Linguistic Programming&apos;s Swish Technique</li><li>Connirae Andreas&apos;s Parental Timeline Reimprinting</li><li>Connirae Andreas&apos;s Core Transformation</li><li>My Modality Integration Technique</li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This is a process that has been invaluable to me in helping myself and others overcome bothersome patterns. It gives you a framework to hang many techniques on such that you know when they&apos;re useful.  And it shows you where things may not be working for you if you&apos;re skipping or missing steps. I hope others can get some use from it.</p><br>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>One of the fundamental building blocks of much of consciousness research, is that of <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory\">Global Workspace Theory (GWT)</a></u>. One elaboration of GWT, which focuses on how it might be implemented in the brain, is the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model in neuroscience. Consciousness and the Brain is a 2014 book that summarizes some of the research and basic ideas behind GNW. It was written by <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislas_Dehaene\">Stanislas Dehaene</a></u>, a French cognitive neuroscientist with a long background in both consciousness research and other related topics.</p><h1>The book and its replicability</h1><p>Given that this is a book on psychology and neuroscience that was written before the replication crisis, an obligatory question before we get to the meat of it is: how reliable are any of the claims in this book? After all, if we think that this is based on research which is probably not going to replicate, then we shouldn’t even bother reading the book.</p><p>I think that the book’s conclusions are at least reasonably reliable in their broad strokes, if not necessarily all the particular details. That is, some of the details in the cited experiments may be off, but I expect most of them to at least be pointing in the right direction. Here are my reasons:</p><p><em>First, </em>scientists in a field usually have an informal hunch of how reliable the different results are. Even before the replication crisis hit, I had heard private comments from friends working in social psychology, who were saying that everything in the field was built on shaky foundations and how they didn’t trust even their own findings much. In contrast, when I asked a friend who works with some people doing consciousness research, he reported back that they generally felt that GWT/GNW-style theories have a reasonably firm basis. This isn’t terribly conclusive but at least it’s a bit of evidence.</p><p><em>Second, </em>for some experiments the book explicitly mentions that they have been replicated. That said, some of the reported experiments seemed to be one-off ones, and I did not yet investigate the details of the claimed replications.</p><p><em>Third,</em> this is a work of cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscience is generally considered a subfield of cognitive psychology, and cognitive psychology is the part of psychology whose results have so far replicated the best. One recent study tested nine key findings from cognitive psychology, and <u><a href=\"https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/05/these-nine-cognitive-psychology-findings-all-passed-a-stringent-test-of-their-replicability/\">found that they all replicated</a></u>. The 2015 &quot;<u><a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.714.8749&rep=rep1&type=pdf\">Estimating the reproducibility of Psychological Science</a></u>&quot; study, managed to replicate 50% of recent results in cognitive psychology, as opposed to 25% of results in social psychology. (If 50% sounds low, remember that we should expect some true results to also fail a single replication, so a 50% replication rate doesn’t imply that 50% of the results would be false. Also, a field with a 90% replication rate would probably be too conservative in choosing which experiments to try.) Cognitive psychology replicating pretty well is probably because it deals with phenomena which are much easier to rigorously define and test than social psychology does, so in that regard it&#x27;s closer to physics than it is to social psychology. </p><p>On several occasions, the book reports something like “people did an experiment X, but then someone questioned whether the results of that experiment really supported the hypothesis in question or not, so an experiment X+Y was done that repeated X but also tested Y, to help distinguish between two possible interpretations of X”. The general vibe that I get from the book is that different people have different intuitions about how consciousness works, and when someone reports a result that contradicts the intuitions of other researchers, those other researchers are going to propose an alternative interpretation that saves their original intuition. Then people keep doing more experiments until at least one of the intuitions is conclusively disproven - replicating the original experiments in the process.</p><p>The analysis of the general reliability of cognitive psychology is somewhat complicated by the fact that these findings are not pure cognitive psychology, but rather cognitive <em>neuroscience</em>. Neuroscience is somewhat more removed from just reporting objective findings, since the statistical models used for analyzing the findings can be flawed. I’ve seen various claims about the problems with statistical tools in neuroscience, but I haven’t really dug enough into the field to say to what extent those are a genuine problem. </p><p>As suggestive evidence, a lecturer who teaches a “How reliable is cognitive neuroscience?” course <u><a href=\"http://tomstafford.staff.shef.ac.uk/?p=625\">reports</a></u> that before taking a recent iteration of the course, the majority of students answered the question “If you read about a finding that has been demonstrated across multiple papers in multiple journals by multiple authors, how likely do you think that finding is to be reliable?” as “Extremely likely” and some “Moderately likely”. After taking the course, “Moderately likely” became the most common response with a little under half of the responses, followed by “Slightly likely” by around a quarter of responses and “Extremely likely” with a little over 10% of the responses. Based on this, we might conclude that cognitive neuroscience is moderately reliable, at least as judged by MSc students who’ve just spent time reading and discussing lots of papers critical of cognitive neuroscience.</p><p>One thing that’s worth noting is that many of the experiments, including many of the ones this book is reporting on, include two components: a behavioral component and a neuroimaging component. If the statistical models used for interpreting the brain imaging results were flawed, you might get an incorrect impression of what was happening in the brain, but the behavioral results would still be valid. If you’re maximally skeptical of neuroscience, you could choose to throw all of the “inside the brain” results from the book away, and only look at the behavioral results. That seems too conservative to me, but it’s an option. Several of the experiments in the book also use either <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography\">EEG</a></u> or <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-unit_recording\">single-unit recordings</a></u> rather than neuroimaging ones; these are much older and simpler techniques than brain imaging is, so are easier to analyze reliably.</p><p>So overall, I would expect that the broad strokes of what’s claimed in the book are reasonably correct, even if some of the details might be off.</p><h1>Defining consciousness</h1><p>Given that consciousness is a term loaded with many different interpretations, Dehaene reasonably starts out by explaining what he means by consciousness. He distinguishes between three different terms:</p><ul><li><strong>Vigilance:</strong> whether we “are conscious” in the sense of being awake vs. asleep.</li><li><strong>Attention:</strong> having focused our mental resources on a specific piece of information.</li><li><strong>Conscious access:</strong> some of the information we were focusing on, entering our awareness and becoming reportable to others.</li></ul><p>For instance, we might be awake (that is, <em>vigilant</em>) and staring hard at a computer screen, waiting for some image to be displayed. When that image does get displayed, our <em>attention</em> will be on it. But it might flash too quickly for us to report what it looked like, or even for us to realize that it was on the screen in the first place. If so, we don’t have <em>conscious access</em> to the thing that we just saw. Whereas if it had been shown for a longer time, we would have conscious access to it.</p><p>Dehaene says that when he’s talking about consciousness, he’s talking about conscious access, and also that he doesn’t particularly care to debate philosophy and whether this is really <em>the</em> consciousness. Rather, since we have a clearly-defined thing which we can investigate using scientific methods, we should just do that, and then think about philosophy once we better understand the empirical side of things.</p><p>It seems correct to say that studying conscious access is going to tell us many interesting things, even if it doesn’t solve literally <em>all</em> the philosophical questions about consciousness. In the rest of this article, I’ll just follow his conventions and use “consciousness” as a synonym for “conscious access”.</p><h1>Unconscious processing of meaning</h1><p>A key type of experiment in Dehaene’s work is <em>subliminal masking</em>. Test subjects are told to stare at a screen and report what they see. A computer program shows various geometric shapes (masks) on the screen. Then at some point, the masks are for a very brief duration replaced with something more meaningful, such as the word “radio”. If the word &quot;radio&quot; is sandwiched between mask shapes, showing it for a sufficiently brief time makes it invisible. The subjects don&#x27;t even register a brief flicker, as they might if the screen had been totally blank before the word appeared.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Image1.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p>By varying the duration for which the word is shown, researchers can control whether or not the subjects see it. Around 40 milliseconds, it is invisible to everyone. Once the duration reaches a certain threshold, which varies somewhat by person but is around 50 milliseconds, the word will be seen around half of the time. When people report not seeing a word, they also fail to name it when asked some time after the trial. </p><p>However, even when a masked target doesn’t make it into consciousness, some part of the brain still sees it. It seems as if the visual subsystem started processing the visual stimulus and parsing it in terms of its meaning, but the results of those computations then never made it all the way to consciousness.</p><p>One line of evidence for this are subliminal priming experiments, not to be confused with the controversial “social priming” effects in social psychology; unlike those effects, these kinds of priming experiments are well-defined and have been replicated many times. An example of a subliminal priming experiment involves first flashing a hidden word (a prime) so quickly that the participants don’t see it, then following it by a visible word (the target). For instance, people may be primed using the word “radio”, then shown the target word “house”. They are then asked to classify the target word, by e.g. pressing one button if the target word referred to a living thing and another button if it referred to an object. </p><p><em>Subliminal repetition priming</em> refers to the finding that, if the prime and target are the same word and separated by less than a second, then the person will be quicker to classify the target and less likely to make a mistake.</p><p>There are indications that when this happens, the brain has parsed some of the prime’s semantic meaning and matched it against the target&#x27;s meaning. For example, priming works even when the prime is in lower case (radio) and the target is in upper case (RADIO). This might not seem surprising, but look at the difference between e.g. “a” and “A”. These are rather distinct shapes, which we’ve only learned to associate with each other due to cultural convention. Furthermore, while the prime of “range” speeds up the processing of “RANGE”, using “anger” as a prime for “RANGE” has no effect, despite “range” and “anger” having the same letters in a different order. The priming effect comes from the meaning of the prime, rather than just its visual appearance.</p><p>The parsing of meaning is not limited to words. If a chess master is shown a simplified chess position for 20 milliseconds, masked so as to make it invisible, <u><a href=\"http://www.fk14.tu-dortmund.de/medien/psycho/PDF_Kunde/kiesel_Kunde_Pohl_Berner_Hoffmann_JEPLMC_2009.pdf\">they are faster</a></u> to classify a visible chess position as a check if the hidden position was also a check, and vice versa. </p><p>I have reported the above results as saying that the brain does unconscious processing about the meaning of what it sees, but that interpretation has been controversial. After all, something like word processing or identifying a position in check when you have extensive chess experience, is extremely overlearned and could represent an isolated special case rather than showing that the brain processes meaning more generally. The book goes into more detail about the history of this debate and differing interpretations that were proposed; I won’t summarize that history in detail, but will just discuss a selection of some experiments which also showed unconscious processing of meaning.</p><p>In arithmetic priming experiments, people are first shown a masked single-digit number and then a visible one. They are asked to say whether the target number is larger or smaller than 5. When the number used as a prime is congruent with the target (e.g. smaller than 5 when the target number is also smaller than 5), people respond more quickly than if the two are incongruent. Follow-up work has shown that the effect replicates even if the numbers used as primes are shown in writing (“four”) and the target ones as digits (“4”). The priming even works when the prime is an invisible <em>visual</em> number and the target a conscious <em>spoken</em> number.</p><p>Further experiments have shown that the priming effect is the strongest if the prime is the same number as the target number (4 preceding 4). The effect then decreases the more distant the prime is from the target number: 3 preceding 4 shows less of a priming effect, but it still has more of a priming effect than 2 preceding 4 does, and so on. Thus, the brain has done something like extracting an abstract representation of the magnitude of the prime, and used that to influence the processing of the &#x27;target&#x27;s magnitude.</p><p>Numbers could also be argued to be a special case for which we have specialized processing, but later experiments have also shown congruity effects for words in general. For example, when people are shown the word “piano” and asked to indicate whether it is an object or an animal, priming them with a word from a congruent category (“chair”) facilitates the correct response, while an incongruent prime (“cat”) hinders it.</p><p>Some epilepsy patients have had electrodes inserted into their skull for treatment purposes. Some of them have also agreed to have those electrodes used for this kind of research. When they are shown invisible “scary” words such as <em>danger, rape, </em>or <em>poison</em>, electrodes implanted near the amygdala - the part of the brain involved in fear processing - register an increased level of activation, which is absent for neutral words such as <em>fridge</em> or <em>sonata</em>.</p><p>In one study, subjects were shown a “signal”, and then had to guess whether to press a button or not press it. As soon as they pressed it, they were told whether they had guessed correctly (earning money) or incorrectly (losing money). Unknown to them, each signal was preceded by a masked shape, which indicated the correct response: one kind of a shape indicated that pressing the button would earn them money, another shape indicated that not pressing the button would earn them money, and a third one meant that either choice had an equal chance of being correct. Even though the subjects were never aware of seeing the shape, once enough trials had passed, they started getting many more results correct than chance alone would indicate. An unconscious value system had associated the shapes with different actions, and was using the subliminal primes for choosing the right action.</p><p>Unconscious processing can also weigh the average value of a number of variables. In one type of experiment, subjects are choosing cards from four different decks. Each deck has cards that cause the subject to either earn or lose reward money, with each deck having a different distribution of cards. Two of the decks are “bad”, causing the subjects to lose money on net, and two of them are “good”, causing them to gain money on net. By the end of the experiment, subjects have consciously figured out which one is which, and can easily report this. However, measurements of skin conductance indicate that even before they have consciously figured out the good and bad decks, there comes a point when they’ve pulled enough cards that being about to draw a card from a bad deck causes their hands to sweat. A subconscious process has already started generating a prediction of which decks are bad, and is producing a subliminal gut feeling.</p><p>A similar unconscious averaging of several variables can also be shown using the subliminal priming paradigm. Subjects are shown five arrows one at a time, some of which point left and some of which point right. They are then asked for the direction that the majority of the arrows were pointing to. When the arrows are made invisible by subliminal masking, subjects who are forced to guess feel like they are just making random guesses, but are in fact responding much more accurately than by chance alone.</p><p>There more examples in the book, but these should be enough to convey the general idea: that many different sensory inputs are automatically registered and processed in the brain, even if they are never shown for long enough to make it all the way to consciousness. Unconsciously processed stimuli can even cause movement commands to be generated in the motor cortex and sent to the muscles, though not necessarily at an intensity which would sufficient to cause actual action.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Image2.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p></p><h1>What about consciousness, then?</h1><p>So given everything that our brain does automatically and without conscious awareness, what’s up with consciousness? What is it, and what does it do?</p><p>Some clues can be found from investigating the neural difference between conscious and unconscious stimuli. Remember that masking experiments show a threshold effect in whether a stimulus is seen or not: if a stimulus which is preceded by a mask is shown for 40 milliseconds, then it’s invisible, but around 50 milliseconds it starts to become visible. In experiments where the duration of the stimulus is carefully varied, there is an all-or-nothing effect: subjects do not report seeing more and more of the stimulus as the duration is gradually increased. Rather they either see it in its entirety, or they see nothing at all.</p><p>A key finding, replicated across different sensory modalities and different methods for measuring brain activation (fMRI, EEG, and MEG) is that a stimulus becoming conscious involves an effect where, once the strength of a stimulus exceeds a certain threshold, the neural signal associated with that stimulus is massively boosted and spreads to regions in the brain which it wouldn’t have reached otherwise. Exceeding the key threshold causes the neural signal generated by the sensory regions to be amplified, with the result that the associated signal could be spread more widely, rather than fading away before it ever reached all the regions.</p><p>Dehaene writes, when discussing an experiment where this was measured using visually flashed words as the stimulus:</p><blockquote>By measuring the amplitude of this activity, we discovered that the amplification factor, which distinguishes conscious from unconscious processing, varies across the successive regions of the visual input pathway. At the first cortical stage, the primary visual cortex, the activation evoked by an unseen flashed word is strong enough to be easily detectable. However, as it progresses forward into the cortex, masking makes it lose strength. Subliminal perception can thus be compared to a surf wave that looms large on the horizon but merely licks your feet when it reaches the shore. By comparison, conscious perception is a tsunami—or perhaps an avalanche is a better metaphor, because conscious activation seems to pick up strength as it progresses, much as a minuscule snowball gathers snow and ultimately triggers a landslide. </blockquote><blockquote>To bring this point home, in my experiments I flashed words for only 43 milliseconds, thereby injecting minimal evidence into the retina. Nevertheless, activation progressed forward and, on conscious trials, ceaselessly amplified itself until it caused a major activation in many regions. Distant brain regions also became tightly correlated: the incoming wave peaked and receded simultaneously in all areas, suggesting that they exchanged messages that reinforced one another until they turned into an unstoppable avalanche. Synchrony was much stronger for conscious than for unconscious targets, suggesting that correlated activity is an important factor in conscious perception.</blockquote><blockquote>These simple experiments thus yielded a first signature of consciousness: an amplification of sensory brain activity, progressively gathering strength and invading multiple regions of the parietal and prefrontal lobes. This signature pattern has often been replicated, even in modalities outside vision. For instance, imagine that you are sitting in a noisy fMRI machine. From time to time, through earphones, you hear a brief pulse of additional sound. Unknown to you, the sound level of these pulses is carefully set so that you detect only half of them. This is an ideal way to compare conscious and unconscious perception, this time in the auditory modality. And the result is equally clear: unconscious sounds activate only the cortex surrounding the primary auditory area, and again, on conscious trials, an avalanche of brain activity amplifies this early sensory activation and breaks into the inferior parietal and prefrontal areas</blockquote><p>Dehaene goes into a considerable amount of detail about the different neuronal signatures which have been found to correlate with consciousness, and the experimental paradigms which have been used to test whether or not those signatures are mere correlates rather than parts of the causal mechanism. I won’t review all of that discussion here, but will summarize some of his conclusions.</p><h2>Consciousness involves a neural signal activating self-reinforcing loops of activity, which causes wide brain regions to synchronize to process that signal.</h2><p>Consider what happens when someone in the audience of a performance starts clapping their hands, soon causing the whole audience to burst into applause. As one person starts clapping, other people hear it and start clapping in turn; this becomes a self-reinforcing effect where your clapping causes other people to clap, and you are more likely to continue clapping if other people are also still clapping. In a similar way, the threshold effect of conscious activation seems to involve some neurons sending a signal, causing other neurons to activate and join in on broadcasting that signal. The activation threshold is a point where enough neurons have sufficient mutual excitation to create a self-sustaining avalanche of excitation, spreading throughout the brain.</p><p>The spread of activation is further facilitated by a “brain web” of long-distance neurons, which link multiple areas of the brain together into a densely interconnected network. Not all areas of the brain are organized in this way: for instance, sensory regions are mostly connected to their immediate neighbors, with visual area V1 being primarily only connected to visual area V2, and V2 mostly to V1 and V3, and so on. But higher areas of the cortex are much more joined together, in a network where area A projecting activity to area B usually means that area B also projects activity back to area A. They also involve triangular connections, where region A might project into regions B and C, which then both also project to each other and back to A. This long-distance network joins not only areas of the cortex, but is also connected to regions such as the thalamus (associated with e.g. attention and vigilance), the basal ganglia (involved in decision-making and action), and the hippocampus (involved in episodic memory).</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Image5.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p>A stimulus becoming conscious involves the signal associated with it achieving enough strength to activate some of the associative areas that are connected with this network, which Dehaene calls the “global neuronal workspace” (GNW). As those areas start broadcasting the signal associated with the stimulus, other areas in the network receive it and start broadcasting it in turn, creating the self-sustaining loop. As this happens, many different regions will end up processing the signal at the same time, synchronizing their processing around the contents of that signal. Dehaene suggests that the things that we are conscious of at any given moment, are exactly the things which are being processed in our GNW at that moment. </p><p>Dehaene describes this as “a decentralized organization without a single physical meeting site” where “an elitist board of executives, distributed in distant territories, stays in sync by exchanging a plethora of messages”. While he mostly reviews evidence gathered from investigating sensory inputs, his model holds that besides sensory areas, many other regions - such as the ones associated with memory and attention - also feed into and manipulate the contents of the network.  Once a stimulus enters the GNW, networks regulating top-down attention can amplify and “help keep alive” stimuli which seems especially important to focus on, and memory networks can commit the stimulus into memory, insert into the network earlier memories which were triggered by the sight of the stimulus, or both.</p><p>In the experiments on subliminal processing, an unconscious prime may affect the processing of a conscious stimulus that comes very soon afterwards, but since its activation soon fades out, it can’t be committed to memory or verbally reported on afterwards. A stimulus becoming conscious and being maintained in the GNW, both keeps its signal alive for longer, and also allows it better access to memory networks which may store it in order for it to be re-broadcast into the GNW later.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Image3.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p></p><h2>The global workspace can only be processing a single item at a time.</h2><p>Various experiments show the existence of an “attentional blink”: if your attention is strongly focused on one thing, it takes some time to disengage from it and reorient your attention to something else. For instance, in one experiment people are shown a stream of symbols. Most of the symbols are digits, but some are letters. People are told to remember the letters. While the first letter is easy to remember, if two letters are shown in rapid succession, the subjects might not even realize that two of them were present - and they might be surprised to learn that this was the case. The act of attending to the first letter enough to memorize it, creates a “blink of the mind” which prevents the second letter from ever being noticed.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Image4.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p></p><p>Dehaene’s explanation for this is that the GNW can only be processing a single item at once. The first letter is seen, processed by the early visual centers, then reaches sufficient strength to make it into the workspace. This causes the workspace neurons to synchronize their processing around the first letter and try to keep the signal active for long enough for it to be memorized - and while they are still doing so, the second letter shows up. It is also processed by the visual regions and makes it to the associative region, but the attention networks are still reinforcing the signal associated with the original letter and keeping it active in the workspace. The new letter can’t muster enough activation in time to get its signal broadcast into the workspace, so by the time the activation generated by the first letter starts to fade, the signal from the second letter has also faded out. As a result, the second signal never makes it to the workspace where it could leave a conscious memory trace of having been observed.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Brain/Image6.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p>When two simultaneous events happen, it doesn’t <em>always</em> mean that awareness of the other one is suppressed. If there isn’t too much distraction - due to “internal noise, distracting thoughts, or other incoming stimuli” - the signal of the second event may survive for long enough in an unconscious buffer, making it to the GNW after the first event has been processed. The use of a post-stimulus masking shape in the subliminal masking experiments helps erase the contents of this buffer, by providing a new stimulus that overwrites the old one. In these cases, people’s judgment of the timing of the events is systematically wrong: rather than experiencing the events to have happened simultaneously, they believe the second event to have happened at the time when the event entered their consciousness.</p><p>As an interesting aside, as a result of these effects, the content of our consciousness is always slightly delayed relative to when an event actually happened - a stimulus getting into the GNW takes at least one-third of a second, and may take substantially longer if we are distracted. The brain contains a number of mechanisms for compensating the delay in GNW access, such as prediction mechanisms which anticipate how familiar events should happen before they’ve actually happened.</p><h2>Disrupting or stimulating the GNW, has the effects that this theory would predict.</h2><p>One of the lines of argument by which Dehaene defends the claim that GNW activity is genuinely the same thing as conscious activity, and not a more correlate, is that artificially interfering with GNW activity has the kinds of effects that we might expect. </p><p>To do this, we can use Transcranial Magentic Stimulation (TMS) to create magnetic fields which stimulate electric activity in the brain, or if electrodes have been placed in a person’s brain, those can be used to stimulate the brain directly. </p><p>In one experiment, TMS was used to stimulate the visual cortex of test subjects, in a way that created a hallucination of light. By varying the intensity of the stimulation, the researchers could control whether or not the subjects noticed anything. On trials when the subjects reported becoming conscious of a hallucination, an avalanche wave associated with consciousness popped up, reaching consciousness faster than normal. In Dehaene’s interpretation, the magnetic pulse bypassed the normal initial processing stages for vision and instead created a neuronal activation directly at a higher cortical area, speeding up conscious access by about 0.1 seconds.</p><p>Experiments have also used TMS to successfully erase awareness of a stimulus. One experiment described in the book uses a dual TMS setup. First, a subject is zapped with a magnetic pulse that causes them to see a bit of (non-existent) movement. After it has been confirmed that subjects report becoming conscious of movement when they are zapped with the first pulse, they are then subjected to a trial where they are first zapped with the same pulse, then immediately thereafter with another pulse that’s aimed to disrupt the signal from getting access to the GNW. When this is done, subjects report no longer being aware of having seen any movement.</p><h1>The functions of consciousness</h1><p>So what exactly <em>is </em>the function of consciousness? Dehaene offers four different functions.</p><h2>Conscious sampling of unconscious statistics and integration of complicated information</h2><p>Suppose that you a Bayesian decision theorist trying to choose between two options, A and B. For each two options, you’ve computed a probability distribution about the possible outcomes that may result if you choose either A or B. In order to actually make your choice, you need to collapse your probability distributions into a point estimate of the expected value of choosing A versus B, to know which one is actually better.</p><p>In Dehaene’s account, consciousness does something like this. We have a number of unconscious systems which are constantly doing Bayesian statistics and constructing probability distributions about how to e.g. interpret visually ambiguous stimuli, weighing multiple hypotheses at the same time. In order for decision-making to actually be carried out, the system has to choose one of the interpretations, and act based on the assumption of that interpretation being correct. The hypothesis that the unconscious process selects as correct, is then what gets fed into consciousness. For example, when I look at the cup of tea in front of me, I don’t see a vast jumble of shifting hypotheses of what this visual information might represent: rather, I just see what I think is a cup of tea, which is what a subconscious process has chosen as the most likely interpretation.</p><p>Dehaene offers the analogy of the US President being briefed by the FBI. The FBI is a vast organization, with thousands of employees: they are constantly shifting through enormous amounts of data, and forming hypotheses about topics which have national security relevance. But it would be useless for the FBI to present to the President every single report collected by every single field agent, as well as every analysis compiled by every single analyst in response. Rather, the FBI needs to internally settle on some overall summary of what they believe is going on, and then present that to the President, who can then act based on the information. Similarly, Dehaene suggests that consciousness is a place where different brain systems can exchange summaries of their models, and to integrate conflicting evidence in order to arrive to an overall conclusion.</p><p>Dehaene discusses a few experiments which lend support this interpretation, though here the discussion seems somewhat more speculative than in other parts of the book. One of his pieces of evidence is of recordings of neuronal circuits which integrate many parts of a visual scene into an overall image, resolving local ambiguities by using information from other parts of the image. Under anesthesia, neuronal recordings show that this integration process is disrupted; consciousness “is needed for neurons to <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/\">exchange signals in both bottom-up and top-down directions until they agree with each other</a></u>”. Another experiment shows that if people are shown an artificial stimulus which has been deliberately crafted to be ambiguous, people’s conscious impression of the correct interpretation keeps shifting: first it’s one interpretation, then the other. By varying the parameters of the stimulus, researchers can control roughly how often people see each interpretation. If Bayesian statistics would suggest that interpretation A was 30% likely and interpretation B 70% likely, say, then people’s impression of the image will keep shifting so that they will see interpretation A roughly 30% of the time and interpretation B roughly 70% of the time. </p><blockquote>What we see, at any time, tends to be the most likely interpretation, but other possibilities occasionally pop up and stay in our conscious vision for a time duration that is proportional to their statistical likelihood. Our unconscious perception works out the probabilities - and then our consciousness samples from them at random.</blockquote><p>In Dehaene’s account, consciousness is involved in higher-level integration of the meaning of concepts. For instance, our understanding of a painting such as the Mona Lisa is composed of many different things. Personally, if I think about the Mona Lisa, I see a mental image of the painting itself, I get an association with the country of Italy, I remember having first learned about the painting in a Donald Duck story, and I also remember my friend telling me about the time she saw the original painting itself. These are different pieces of information, stored in different formats in different regions of the brain, and the kind of global neuronal integration carried out by the GNW allows all of these different interpretations to come together, with every system participating in constructing an overall coherent, synchronous interpretation.</p><p>All of this sounds sensible enough. At the same, after all the previous discussion about unconscious decision-making and unconscious integration of information, this leaves me feeling somewhat unsatisfied. If it has been shown that e.g. unconsciously processed cues are enough to guide our decision-making, then how do we square that with the claim that consciousness is necessary for settling on a single interpretation that would allow us to take actions?</p><p>My interpretation is that even though unconscious processing and decision-making happens, its effect is relatively weak. If you prime people with a masked stimulus, then that influences their decision-making so as to give them better performance - but it doesn’t give them <em>perfect</em> performance. In the experiment where masked cues predicted the right action and unconscious learning associated each cue with the relevant action, the subjects only ended up <u><a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.9111&rep=rep1&type=pdf\">with an average of 63% correct actions</a></u>. </p><p>Looking at the cited paper itself, the authors themselves note that if the cues had been visible, it would only have taken a couple of trials for the subjects to learn the optimal behaviors. In the actual experiment, their performance slowly improved until it reached a plateau around 60 trials. Thus, even though unconscious learning and decision-making happens, conscious learning and decision-making can be significantly more effective.</p><p>Second, while I don’t see Dehaene mentioning it, I’ve always liked <u><a href=\"https://rifters.com/real/articles/Morsella_2005.pdf\">the PRISM theory of consciousness</a></u>, which suggests that one of the functions of consciousness is to be a place for resolving conflicting plans for controlling the skeletal muscles. In the unconscious decision-making experiments, the tasks have mostly been pretty simple, and only involved the kinds of goals that could all be encapsulated within a single motivational system. In real life however, we often run into situations where different brain systems output conflicting instructions. For instance, if we are carrying a hot cup of tea, our desire to drop the cup may be competing against our desire to carry it to the table, and these may have their origin in very different sorts of motivations. Information from both systems would need to be taken into account and integrated in order to make an overall decision. </p><p>To stretch Dehaene’s FBI metaphor: as long as the FBI is doing things that fall within their jurisdiction and they are equipped to handle, then they can just do that without getting in contact with the President. But if the head of the FBI and the head of the CIA have conflicting ideas about what should be done, on a topic on which the two agencies have overlapping jurisdiction, then it might be necessary to bring the disagreement out in the open so that a higher-up can make the call. Of course, there isn’t any single “President” in the brain who would make the final decision: rather, it’s more like the chiefs of all the other alphabet soup bureaus were also called in, and they then hashed out the details of their understanding until they came to a shared agreement about what to do.</p><h2>Lasting thoughts and working memory</h2><p>As already touched upon, consciousness is associated with memory. Unconsciously registered information tends to fade very quickly and then disappear. In all the masking experiments, the duration between the prime and the target is very brief; if the duration would be any longer, there would be no learning or effect on decision-making. For e.g. associating cues and outcomes with each other over an extended period of time, the cue has to be consciously perceived.</p><p>Dehaene describes an experiment which demonstrates exactly this:</p><blockquote>The cognitive scientists Robert Clark and Larry Squire conducted a wonderfully simple test of temporal synthesis: time-lapse conditioning of the eyelid reflex. At a precisely timed moment, a pneumatic machine puffs air toward the eye. The reaction is instantaneous: in rabbits and humans alike, the protective membrane of the eyelid immediately closes. Now precede the delivery of air with a brief warning tone. The outcome is called Pavlovian conditioning (in memory of the Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, who first conditioned dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell, in anticipation of food). After a short training, the eye blinks to the sound itself, in anticipation of the air puff. After a while, an occasional presentation of the isolated tone suffices to induce the “eyes wide shut” response. </blockquote><blockquote>The eye-closure reflex is fast, but is it conscious or unconscious? The answer, surprisingly, depends on the presence of a temporal gap. In one version of the test, usually termed “delayed conditioning,” the tone lasts until the puff arrives. Thus the two stimuli briefly coincide in the animal’s brain, making the learning a simple matter of coincidence detection. In the other, called “trace conditioning,” the tone is brief, separated from the subsequent air puff by an empty gap. This version, although minimally different, is clearly more challenging. The organism must keep an active memory trace of the past tone in order to discover its systematic relation to the subsequent air puff. To avoid any confusion, I will call the first version “coincidence-based conditioning” (the first stimulus lasts long enough to coincide with the second, thus removing any need for memory) and the second “memory-trace conditioning” (the subject must keep in mind a memory trace of the sound in order to bridge the temporal gap between it and the obnoxious air puff). </blockquote><blockquote>The experimental results are clear: coincidence-based conditioning occurs unconsciously, while for memory-trace conditioning, a conscious mind is required. In fact, coincidence-based conditioning does not require any cortex at all. A decerebrate rabbit, without any cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, limbic system, thalamus, and hypothalamus, still shows eyelid conditioning when the sound and the puff overlap in time. In memory-trace conditioning, however, no learning occurs unless the hippocampus and its connected structures (which include the prefrontal cortex) are intact. In human subjects, memory-trace learning seems to occur if and only if the person reports being aware of the systematic predictive link between the tone and the air puff. Elderly people, amnesiacs, and people who were simply too distracted to notice the temporal relationship show no conditioning at all (whereas these manipulations have no effect whatsoever on coincidence-based conditioning). Brain imaging shows that the subjects who gain awareness are precisely those who activate their prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during the learning.</blockquote><h2>Carrying out artificial serial operations</h2><p>Consider what happens when you calculate 12 * 13 in your head. </p><p>When you do so, you have some conscious awareness of the steps involved: maybe you first remember that 12 * 12 = 144 and then add 144 + 12, or maybe you first multiply 12 * 10 = 120 and then keep that result in memory as you multiply 12 * 3 = 36 and then add 120 + 36. Regardless of the strategy, the calculation happens consciously.</p><p>Dehaene holds that this kind of multi-step arithmetic can’t happen unconsciously. We can do <em>single-step </em>arithmetic unconsciously: for example, people can be shown a single masked digit <em>n</em>, and then be asked to carry out one of three operations. People might be asked to name the digit (the “<em>n</em>” task), to add 2 to <em>n</em> and report the resulting the number (the “<em>n</em> + 2” task), or to report whether or not it’s smaller than 5 (the “<em>n </em>&lt; 5” task). On all of these tasks, even if people haven’t consciously seen the digit, when they are forced to guess they typically get the right answer half of the time.</p><p>However, unconscious <em>two-step</em> arithmetic fails. If people are flashed an invisible digit and told to first add 2 to it, and then report whether the result is more or less than 5 (the “(<em>n </em>+ 2) &gt; 5” task), their performance is on the chance level. The unconscious mind can carry out a single arithmetic operation, but it can’t then store the result of that operation and use it as the input of a second operation, even though it could carry out either of the two operations alone.</p><p>Dehaene notes that this might seem to contradict a previous finding, which is that the unconscious brain can <em>accumulate</em> multiple pieces of information over time. For instance, in the arrow experiment, people were shown several masked arrows one at a time; at the end, they could tell whether most of them had been pointing to the left or to the right. Dehaene says that the difference is that opening a neural circuit which accumulates multiple observations is a single operation for the brain: and while the accumulator stores information of how many arrows have been observed so far, that information can’t be taken out of it and used as an input for a second calculation. </p><p>The accumulator also can’t reach a decision by itself: for instance, if people saw the arrows consciously, they could reach a decision after having seen three arrows that pointed one way, knowing that the remaining arrows couldn&#x27;t change the overall decision anymore. In unconscious trials, they can’t use this kind of strategic reasoning: the unconscious circuit can only keep adding up the arrows, rather than adding up the arrows <em>and</em> also checking whether a rule of type “if seen_arrows &gt; 3” has been satisfied yet.</p><p>According to Dehaene, implementing such rules is one of the functions of consciousness. In fact, he explicitly compares consciousness to a <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_system_(computer_science)\">production system</a></u>: an AI design which holds a number of objects in a working memory, and also contains a number of IF-THEN rules, such as “if there is an A in working memory, change it to sequence BC”. If multiple rules match, one of them is chosen for execution according to some criteria. After one of the rules has fired, the contents of the working memory gets updated, and the cycle repeats. The conscious mind, Dehaene says, works using a similar principle - creating a biological Turing machine that can combine operations from a number of neuronal modules, flexibly chaining them together for serial execution.</p><h2>A social sharing device</h2><p>If a thought is conscious, we can describe it and report it to other people using language. I won’t elaborate on this, given that the advantages of being able to use language to communicate with others are presumably obvious. I&#x27;ll just note that Dehaene highlights one interesting perspective: one where other people are viewed as additional modules that can carry out transformations on the objects in the workspace. </p><p>Whether it&#x27;s a subsystem in the brain that&#x27;s applying production rules to the workspace contents, or whether you are communicating the contents to another person who then comments on it (as guided by some subsystem in <em>their</em> brain), the same principle of &quot;production rules transforming the workspace contents&quot; still applies. Only in one of the cases, the rules and transformations come from subsystems that are located within a single brain, and in the other case subsystems from multiple brains are engaged in joint manipulation of the contents - though of course the linguistic transmission is lossy, since subsystems in multiple brains can&#x27;t communicate with the same bandwidth as subsystems in a single brain.

    "htmlBody": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>It is clear to most AI safety researchers that the idea of “human values” is underdefined, and this concept should be additionally formalized before it can be used in (mostly mathematical) models of AI alignment. In other words, “AI-conscious” human value theories are those which were created especially in order to help AI alignment research. Most existing psychological theories of human values are verbal, informal and underdefined, so they require some adaptation before they may be applied to AI safety. </p><p>In many cases, the theory of human values cannot be distinguished from the ways how values are expected to be extracted by a future AI, for example, by approval-directed AI. Some researchers (notably, Armstrong) have also presented different theories; providing a link to the researcher is not intended as a claim that said researcher currently adheres to exactly this theory. </p><p>In Figure 1, all current theories of human values are classified according to two main parameters: </p><p>1) <em>Complexity of the values’ description</em> (not the complexity of the theory): Some theories of human values assume that human values are very simple, e.g., that there are only two drives: survival and reproduction; or only one desire, that of maximizing pleasure; or only 9 basic emotions. Other theories suggest that human values are very complex, e.g. they are a matrix of association between all concepts and rewards. </p><p>2) <em>The level of “behaviorism”</em>: Most theories are attracted to one of two poles: “internalist” theories, which assume that values actually exist, but are hidden inside the human brain, and “behaviorist” theories, which assume that values are only appear in human behavior (like approval or choice). Behaviorist theories of human values (generally) integrate the values and the method of their extraction (e.g. approval-directed AI). In contrast, internalist theories typically hold that values exist separately of the ways they are learned. </p><p>These two parameters are not strict, but serve as a useful instrument to orientate ourselves within the field of all possible theories. </p><p><em><a href=\"http://immortality-roadmap.com/val.jpg\">Figure 1. Different real and possible theories about the nature of human values in AI safety</a></em></p><p></p><span><figure><img src=\"http://immortality-roadmap.com/val.jpg\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\" /></figure></span><p></p><p></p><p>Another way to classify theories about human values is according to the level of abstractness: some theories could be applied to any possible mind and thus don’t take any inputs from human psychology and neurophysiology. Such theories are computationally complex and may still contain hidden assumptions about some properties of human minds, like stability, unity, consistency, etc. Human-centered theories depend on the existing theories of human minds. This distinction is illustrated in Figure 2.</p><p><em><a href=\"http://immortality-roadmap.com/val2.jpg\">Figure 2. Mind in general and human-mind theories of values</a></em></p><span><figure><img src=\"http://immortality-roadmap.com/val2.jpg\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\" /></figure></span><h2>Yudkowsky</h2><p>Yudkowsky is a pioneer in the field of AI safety, and among many other things he introduced the idea of the “complexity of values”, which basically means that any short verbal description can’t grasp the complexity of outcomes that we actually want. He summarized his critique of simple wishes as correct presentation of desirable outcomes in “<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/ComplexValues.pdf\">Complex Value Systems are Required to Realize Valuable Futures</a>”. In the same article, he also introduced the concept of “fragility of values”—for example, if one digit in a phone number is wrong, the call will go to a completely different person.</p><p>Another important contribution from Yudkowsky is the idea of <em>Coherent Extrapolated Volition</em>. He wrote in his “Complex Values” article: “We might try to define normativity not by our immediate current desires but by our <em>reflective equilibria</em>, what we would want in the limit of perfect knowledge, the ability to consider all options and arguments, and perfect self-knowledge without unwanted weakness of will (failure of self-control).” More links at his writings about values can be found at <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Complexity_of_value.\">LessWrong Wiki</a>.</p><p>The Arbital page “<a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/value_alignment_value/\">Value</a>,” which is likely written by Yudkowsky, starts with a definition: “In the context of value alignment as a subject, the word &#x27;value&#x27; is a speaker-dependent variable that indicates our ultimate goal - the property or meta-property that the speaker wants or &#x27;should want&#x27; to see in the final outcome of Earth-originating intelligent life”. Obviously, most psychologists, and people in general, define “human values” differently, as most people don’t care about the remote future of humanity in their day-to-day preferences.</p><p>The Arbital article on values also presents a list of possible points of view on the nature of human values, which, in short is:</p><p>· <em>Reflective equilibrium</em>. What I should want “given more factual knowledge, time to consider more knowledge, better self-awareness, and better self-control”. </p><p>· <em>Standard desires</em>. “An object-level view that identifies value with qualities that we currently find very desirable, enjoyable, fun, and preferable, such as Frankena&#x27;s list of desiderata”</p><p>· <em>Immediate goods</em>. “E.g., ‘Cure cancer’”</p><p>· <em>Deflationary moral error theory</em>. “This mostly ends up at an &#x27;immediate goods&#x27; theory in practice, plus some beliefs relevant to the value selection debate”</p><p>· <em>Simple purpose</em>. “Value can easily be identified with X, for some X”.</p><h2>Bostrom</h2><p>Bostrom does not offer a preferred theory of human values, and suggests several instruments for AI alignment, which do not require a direct definition of human values and, in some sense, are similar to <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/cev/\">Coherent Extrapolated Volition</a> (CEV). One such idea is the implementation of a <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/moral-uncertainty-towards-a-solution.html\">virtual parliament</a> of moral theories, where many simulated human minds are held in a simulation until they come to an agreement regarding the most correct presentation of human values. </p><h2>Sotala </h2><p>Sotala analyzed human values in “<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/DefiningValuesForValueLearners.pdf\">Defining Human Values for Value Learners</a>” (a discussion of which can be found <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2Rai96XMwL83d27rc/paper-link-defining-human-values-for-value-learners\">here</a>.) In this article, he listed several problems of simple model of human values as utility function:</p><p>· “The utility function model of value has difficulty dealing with internal conflicts and higher-order preferences”</p><p>· “The utility function model of value ignores the person’s internal experience.”</p><p>· “The utility function model of value does not model changing values.”</p><p>· “The utility function model of value does not give a way to generalize from our existing values to new ones.”</p><p>To solve this problem, he suggests the following definition of values: “…human values are concepts which abstract over situations in which we’ve previously received rewards, making those concepts and the situations associated with them valued for their own sake. A further suggestion is that, as humans tend to naturally find various mental concepts to be associated with affect (the subjective experience of a feeling or emotion, experienced as either positive or negative), the value function might be a least partially encoded in the affect of the various concepts.”</p><p>At the end of article, Sotala suggests useful criteria to estimate validity of any theory of human values. He outlines that such a theory should be:</p><p>● Psychologically realistic</p><p>● Compatible with individual variation</p><p>● Testable</p><p>● Integrated with existing theories</p><p>● Suited for exhaustively modeling different values</p><p>● Suited for modeling internal conflicts and higher order desires</p><p>● Suited for modeling changing and evolving values</p><p>● Suited for generalizing from existing values to new ones</p><h2>Armstrong</h2><p>Stuart Armstrong has written <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601\">many articles and posts </a>in which he defines the nature of human values and addresses popular misconceptions. </p><p>One of such contribution is his proof that it is impossible to distinguish between “values” and “policy” based only on observation of behavior: “The observed behavior can, in principle, be decomposed into two components: a reward function and a planning algorithm, both of which have to be inferred from behavior. This paper presents a No Free Lunch theorem, showing that, without making &#x60;normative&#x27; assumptions beyond the data, nothing about the human reward function can be deduced from human behavior.” However, he has probably assumed that “human values” = “human reward function”, and that a human reward function is approximately the same as a rational agent’s reward function.</p><p>But the problem is even wider than distinguishing between values and policy: we rather arbitrarily call some part of the process in the human mind “values,” which should be preserved, and call other parts “biases,” “policy,” and “knowledge,” concepts which could be freely changed and don’t have any values inside them. </p><p>Armstrong looks at “ontological nature” of human values, that is the question, do they actually exist, in “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RHvseCkfrYzoHJj7M/learning-values-or-defining-them\">Learning values, or defining them</a>.” In it, he wrote: “Many attempts at learning human values are framed as &quot;humans have an underlying true reward R, and here is procedure P for determining it,” and “[e]ven if the moral realists are right, and there is a true R, thinking about it is still misleading. Because there is, as yet, no satisfactory definition of this true R, and it&#x27;s very hard to make something converge better onto something you haven&#x27;t defined.” </p><p>Another post by Armstrong on indefinability of human values Armstrong is <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/ANupXf8XfZo2EJxGv\">Human can be assigned any values whatsoever</a> and the article which covers all these ideas “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812\">Occam&#x27;s razor is insufficient to infer the preferences of irrational agents</a>.” In the post, he sums up his findings: “Humans have no values… nor do any agent. Unless you make strong assumptions about their rationality. And depending on those assumptions, you get humans to have any values.” After he proceeds with a toy model which shows that even Kolmogorov complexity considerations can’t help to find the true values. Also, it seems that Armstrong uses “human values” and “human reward function” interchangeably, which is not necessary so, unless we redefine “human reward” in way which is different from human reward center activation and experience of qualia of pleasure.</p><p>Armstrong argues for the unknowability of human values: “Humans don’t know their own values (sub-issue: humans know their values better in retrospect than in prediction) in his “<a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1388\">List of three problems and different approaches to solutions</a>.” That post also offers a nice table of approaches to solve the AI safety problem. </p><p>In the blogpost “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately\">Resolving human values, completely and adequately</a>,” he suggests the creation of a model of human values which is neither too abstract nor too narrow, but is adequate to escape disastrous outcomes. He suggests that such that such adequate definition is “This is defined to be all the value/preference/reward statements that H[uman] might agree to, more or less strongly.”</p><p>He also introduced the important idea of normative assumption in “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Fg83cD3M7dSpSaNFg/normative-assumptions-regret\">Normative assumptions: regret</a>,” that is, in a nutshell, the idea that any model of “human values” has normative assumptions, i.e., assumptions about which part of the human motivational system is more important than the others. He then suggested that a feeling of regret be used to determine true values: “In a previous post, I presented a model of human rationality and reward as pair (p, R)…[n]ormative assumptions are simply assumptions that distinguish between two pairs (p, R) (p&#x27;, R&#x27;) that lead to the same policy: p(R)=p&#x27;(R&#x27;).” He continued, “[h]ow do we, as humans, define our own rationality and reward? Well, one strong way seems to be through our feeling of regret...[i]f we take ‘feelings and expressions of regret encode true reward information’ as a normative assumption, then this restricts the number of (p, R) pairs that are compatible with such an assumption.”</p><p>The case about regret could be made stronger if it incorporated concepts from the existing psychological literature, which has probably already explored the relationship between regret and values. It is also possible to imagine a “hyper-regret disorder,” in which a person will regret all of his/her choices; in that case, regret would be non-informative about preferences.</p><p>In the another post “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kmLP3bTnBhc22DnqY/beyond-algorithmic-equivalence-self-modelling\">Beyond algorithmic equivalence: self-modelling</a>,” Armstrong defines “human reward” as follows: “we can <em>define</em> the reward of H[uman], as the reward that H models itself as having<strong>.</strong>” However, people may have a value against value extraction and will deny any correctly extracted values. Also, most humans don’t have anything near a complete model of their own values. Most humans are not that introspective.</p><p>In the post “<a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1515\">Humans are not agents: short vs. long term</a>” he looks at an example of logically contradicting preferences about life expectancy as an example of contradicting values.</p><h2>Sarma</h2><p>Sarma and Hay state in their article “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08289\">Mammalian value systems</a>” that “[an] agent utilizing Inverse Reinforcement Learning or Bayesian Inverse Planning will learn and refine its model of human values by observing our behavior, it must begin with some very rough or approximate initial assumptions about the nature of the values it is trying to learn.” They then suggest the use of the phrase “mammalian value system” as a starting point, taking into account later cultural effects on values evolution. They suggest the description of the basic mammalian value system be based on the work of Panksepp and Biven who “categorize the informal list given above into seven motivational and emotional systems that are common to mammals: seeking, rage, fear, lust, care, panic/grief, and play.” Sarma and Hay then introduce the term “neural correlate of value” which is, according to them, some subcortical areas which serve as a mechanism for these seven basic mammalian emotions. That article concludes: “we argue that what we colloquially refer to as human values can be informally decomposed into 1) mammalian values, 2) human cognition, and 3) several millennia of human social and cultural evolution.”</p><p>In “<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99229-7_45\">AI Safety and Reproducibility: Establishing Robust Foundations for the Neuropsychology of Human Values</a>,” Sarma and Hay point out that the reproducibility crisis in psychology makes identification of the correct theory of human values difficult, but urgent actions to that end are necessary to ensure AI safety.</p><p>The newest (as of 2018) article by Sarma, Safron and Hay is “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03493\">Integrative Biological Simulation, Neuropsychology, and AI Safety</a>,” in which they suggest creation of better biological models of animal minds to develop a better understanding of the nature of motivation. </p><h2>Muehlhauser</h2><p>Luke Muehlhauser wrote in the post “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fa5o2tg9EfJE77jEQ/the-human-s-hidden-utility-function-maybe\">The Human&#x27;s Hidden Utility Function (Maybe)</a>” that human utility function is not satisfying axioms of rationality. He also wrote that humans have 3 value systems: model-based, model free (repeating of a successful action) and Pavlovian (described as more like unconditional reflexes). He suggests that only first one is “good,” and should be used as a basis for CEV extrapolation. </p><p>He also wrote in the post “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nBdaTGoDAYxHePSDa/do-humans-want-things\">Do Humans Want Things</a>” that human choice depends on how choices were framed, but not depend on the values as was shown by Kahneman and Tversky: “as far as we can tell, our behavior is often not determined by our wanting a particular state of affairs, but by how our options are framed.”</p><p>In the post “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/48DTJkBH58JbBNSFH/the-neuroscience-of-desire\">The Neuroscience of Desire</a>,” Muehlhauser starts with the observation (supported by a large bibliography) that decision-making in economics and computer science starts with integrating many dimensions in one scalar parameter, and then comparing such parameters for different options. It looks like human brain does the same: “More than a dozen studies show that the subjective utility of different goods or actions are encoded on a common scale by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum in primates (including humans).” </p><p>Then he looks at neuroscience of choice: “Once a common-currency valuation of goods and actions has been performed, how is a choice made between them? Evidence implicates (at least) the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortex in a process that includes neurons encoding probabilistic reasoning. Interestingly, while valuation structures encode absolute (and thus transitive) subjective value, choice-making structures ‘rescale these absolute values so as to maximize the differences between the available options before choice is attempted,’ perhaps via a normalization mechanism like the one discovered in the visual cortex.”</p><p>In the post “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hN2aRnu798yas5b2k/a-crash-course-in-the-neuroscience-of-human-motivation\">A Crash Course in the Neuroscience of Human Motivation</a>,” he wrote a rather long review of different theories of human motivation, beginning from “folk theory” and economics. The article starts with rather bold statement: “But now, neuroscientists are directly measuring the neurons whose firing rates encode value and produce our choices.” </p><p>In an article by Muehlhauser, and Helm, “<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/IE-ME.pdf\">The singularity and machine ethics</a>,” they demonstrate that some (and probably all) known moral theories are unsafe if installed in a powerful optimizer. In Section 5.1 of the article they discuss that “Humans don’t know their values” based on an experiment in which participants explained preference to faces the participant didn’t choose. They state that “[c]ognitive science suggests instead that our knowledge of our own desires is just like our knowledge of others’ desires: inferred and often wrong.”</p><p>Further, they argue against the idea that human beings are rational utility maximizers: </p><p>“Ever since M. Friedman (1953), economists have insisted that humans only behave “as if” they are utility maximizers, not that humans actually compute expected utility and try to maximize it. It was a surprise, then, when neuroscientists located the neurons in the primate brain that encode (in their firing rates) the expected subjective value for possible actions in the current “choice set.” Several decades of experiments that used brain scanners and single neuron recorders to explore the primate decision-making system have revealed a surprisingly well-understood reduction of economic primitives to neural mechanisms; for a review see Glimcher (2010). To summarize: the inputs to the primate’s choice mechanism are the expected utilities for several possible actions under consideration, and these expected utilities are encoded in the firing rates of particular neurons. Because neuronal firing rates are stochastic, a final economic model of human choice will need to use a notion of “random utility,” as in McFadden (2005) or Gul and Pesendorfer (2006).”</p><p>They then look at neurological mechanisms of values: “Recent studies reveal the complexity of subjective values in the brain. For example, the neural encoding of human values results from an interaction of both ‘model-free’ and ‘model-based’ valuation processes.”</p><p>They explore complexity of relation between personal preferences and choices: “...may be that each human being contains something like a ‘hidden’ utility function (within the model-based valuation system) that isn’t consistently expressed in behavior because choice is also partly determined by other systems whose valuations we wouldn’t reflectively endorse because they are ‘blind’ and ‘stupid’ compared to the more sophisticated goal-directed model-based valuation system.”</p><h2>Sezener</h2><p>Sezener, in the article “<a href=\"http://agi-conf.org/2015/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/agi15_sezener.pdf\">Inferring human values for safe AGI design</a>,” suggested that: human values are an arbitrary complex reward function. </p><p>Sezener’s main idea is the use of the Solomonoff induction to find most simple combination of two programs, one of which encodes agent’s reward function, and the other which encodes the agent itself based on an observable sequence of actions and observations. This is similar to Armstrong’s approach of presenting human as (М,З)—a value and policy pair, and then using complexity considerations to find the simplest such pair that explains observable behavior.</p><p>Sezener’s critique of Hibbard: “However, a shortcoming of this approach is that what human models say they value and what they value can still be different.” </p><p>Sezener also wrote about hidden assumptions in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL): “Soares [7] suggests using methods similar to IRL for learning human values. However, the current IRL methods are limited and cannot be used for inferring human values because of their long list of assumptions. For instance, in most IRL methods the environment is usually assumed to be stationary, fully observable, and sometimes known; the policy of the agent is assumed to be stationary and optimal or near-optimal; the reward function is assumed to be stationary as well; and the Markov property is assumed. Such assumptions are reasonable for limited motor control tasks such as grasping and manipulation; however, if our goal is to learn high-level human values, they become unrealistic”.</p><p>Main problems of the Sezener’s approach: 1. behavior and only behavior is the correct representation of a human reward function (what about unconscious parasitic behavior); 2. reward function = values; 3. the model ignores internal contradiction; 4. the model is incomputable; 5. there is an assumption of simplicity of both reward function and agent, which provides “free lunch” in terms of Armstrong. </p><h2>Maxwell</h2><p>John Maxwell in the post “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@pwgen/friendly-ai-through-ontology-autogeneration-5d375bf85922\">Friendly AI through Ontology Autogeneration</a>,” wrote: “If an AI is to be Friendly, it must operate based on an ontology that’s capable of expressing our values,” and, “[r]egardless of the ontology autogeneration algorithm that’s chosen, it’s almost certain that the initial autogeneration will either (a) capture human values with insufficient fidelity or (b) contain so many concepts that finding human values among them will be its own project.”</p><h2>Hibbard</h2><p>Hibbard wrote in <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/UnintendedBehaviors.pdf\">Avoiding Unintended AI Behaviors</a> that in order to evaluate policy an agent “can simply <em>ask model </em>human d to express a utility value between 0 and 1<em>”</em> for the policy.</p><p>This could be called a “counterfactual approval by human model,” which evaluates all possible outcomes of actions. In Hibbard’s case, safe AI consists of two levels: the first creates a model of the world (which includes all humans and their ways of behaving or reacting), and the second calculates how humans in the model will react to possible future histories. </p><h2>Christiano</h2><p>Christino explored many ideas which could be a proxy for human values. One is the use of human approval (or hypothetical approval) of AI actions, summed up in quote “Estimate the expected rating Hugh [human] would give each action if he considered it at length. Take the action with the highest expected rating” from the post “<a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/model-free-decisions-6e6609f5d99e\">Approval-directed agents</a>.” In that case, the idea of “human values” is ignored and replaced with the much more measurable “approval.” There is a lengthy discussion about the robustness and scalability of this approach and its vulnerability to edge cases like wireheading. </p><h2>Kulveit</h2><p>In “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3fkBWpE4f9nYbdf7E/multi-agent-predictive-minds-and-ai-alignment\">Multi-agent predictive minds and AI alignment</a>,” Jan Kulveit combines predictive processing and a multi-agent model of cognition to create a model of the human mind, and then uses it to create approaches to AI alignment. </p><p>In his framework:</p><p>“…how do motivations and “values” arise? The guess is, in many cases something like a “subprogram” is modelling/tracking some variable, “predicting” its desirable state, and creating the need for action by “signalling” prediction error. Note that such subprograms can work on variables on very different hierarchical layers of modelling - e.g. tracking a simple variable like “feeling hungry” vs. tracking a variable like “social status”. </p><p>Such sub-systems can be large: for example, tracking “social status” seems to require lot of computation.” Later, Kulveit states that “In this model, it is hardly possible to disentangle “beliefs” and “motivations” (or values).”</p><p>Kulveit then suggests that the human mind could be modeled by a system consisting of many subagents, larger than Minsky’s small agents, but smaller than a psychologist’s human-like subpersonalities, which may or may not be aligned with each other. The latter results in internally contradictional behavior. This has different implications for different approaches of AL alignment, of which four are listed: 1. Approval (where “only the output of the internal aggregation has some voice”); 2. CIRL-like; 3. “Alignment with the whole system, including the human aggregation process itself” (that is, not just its output); 4. “Adding layers of indirection to the question”.</p><h2>Kavanagh, Linebarger and Schoots</h2><p>Sabrina Kavanagh, Erin Linebarger and Nandi Schoots from “Human preferences” team at the 2018 AI Safety Camp 2 in Prague wrote “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mSPsyEwaymS74unND/acknowledging-human-preference-types-to-support-value\">Acknowledging Human Preference Types to Support Value Learning</a>.” They start with idea that internal conflicts in humans could be explained by different preference types, and explore three such types: liking, wanting, and approval. They list all eight combinations of these three preferences and demonstrate that each corresponds to some type of behavior. </p><p>They later state: “Liking, wanting and approving are for the most part hidden processes. They are not directly observable, but they influence observable behaviors. As a proxy for liking we propose to use facial expressions, body language or responses to questionnaires. Although a cognitive scan may be the most accurate proxy for liking, there is evidence to suggest both that facial expressions and body language are indicators of pleasure and pain [Algom et al. 1994] and that they can be classified well enough to make them technically feasible proxies [Giorgiana et al. 2012]. The observable proxy of wanting is revealed preferences. We propose to encode a proxy for approval via stated preferences.”</p><h2>Alexander</h2><p>Scott Alexander wrote “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ePA4NDzZkunz98tLx/to-what-degree-do-we-have-goals\">To what degree do we have goals</a>,” in which he explores the idea that only conscious personal values should be taken into account, and unconscious ones should be ignored. </p><p>In the post “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/z3cTkXbA7jgwGWPcv/would-your-real-preferences-please-stand-up\">Would Your Real Preferences Please Stand Up</a>?” he argues that in many cases our declared preferences are just “social signaling.” </p><h2>Drexler</h2><p>Drexler, in “<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf\">Reframing superintelligence: Comprehensive AI Services as General Intelligence</a>,” (p.152) plainly states that: “It seems impossible to deﬁne human values in a way that would be generally accepted.”</p><h2>Yampolskiy</h2><p>Yampolskiy is also skeptical that human values could be formalized: “human values are inconsistent and dynamic and so can never be understood/programmed into a machine. Suggestions for overcoming this obstacle require changing humanity into something it is not, and so by definition destroying it” (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/07/15/roman-interview/?fbclid=IwAR2AOyUc0JEySlgclbwoNcYzL7RzeUnyOFerHqQEgIEWGfuzkGCZQYCIWOg\">Roman Yampolskiy on AI Safety Engineering</a>). </p><p>In the article “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01851.pdf\">Personal Universes: A Solution to the Multi-Agent Value Alignment Problem</a>” he suggests a solution to escape difficult value aggregating problem in personal universe which will “which are optimally and dynamically adjusting to align their values and preferences.”</p><h2>Worley</h2><p>Gordon Worley wrote about the need for artificial general intelligence (AGI) alignment to take into account the mental phenomena of consciousness in <a href=\"https://mapandterritory.org/formally-stating-the-ai-alignment-problem-fe7a6e3e5991?fbclid=IwAR0sLRdSjZ9_LjPymvC-Y8gMZa89PvgKXAQPSm3ZfuUF3N_ngyNemjxWk_g\">Formally Stating the AI Alignment Problem</a> and that human values should be describe by the instruments of phenomenology. </p><p>In personal communication, he clarifies his position: “So my view is that values are inextricably tied to the existence of consciousness because they arise from our self-aware experience. This means I think values have a simple, universal structure and also that values are rich with detail in their content within that simple structure. This view also necessarily suggests values are not fully discoverable via behavioral methods and that there is always a hidden, internal part that may not even be accessible by the agent themselves.”</p><h2>Conclusions about the different theories of human values put forward by AI safety researchers</h2><p>There are several internally consistent theories of human values suggested by AI safety researchers in the existing literature. However, despite their internal consistency, these theories are not very compatible with each other and present a very wide set of opinions. </p><p>There are also other “possible theories,” that is, approaches which have not yet (to the best of my knowledge) been put forth by any researcher, but which could be generated based on the same principles as other theories. One is just to assume that all human values are products of evolutionary fitness and can be derived from basic evolutionary considerations in the same way as <a href=\"https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf\">Omohundro’s basic drives</a>. This could explain most basic human drives like survival, sex, status-seeking, exploration instinct, etc. Another such theory is that an AI Oracle should first read the extant psychological literature, choose the best theory of mind, and create its structure of human values based on that theory. </p><p>From this, we could conclude that internal consistency, as well as experimental support and an extensive literature is not enough to provide us with a “correct” theory of human values. We must dig deeper into a question, “do human values exist at all?”</p><p>This work was done during AI safety Camp 2 in Prague (2018) in the “hidden assumptions” team – but all possible errors are my own. The work is part of a longer text about the nature of human values. </p>",

Still, thinking about brier scores, they&#x27;re not very good either. You can only maximise your brier score by betting on things you&#x27;re certain of, it creates perverse incentives to avoid placing bets on uncertain events, which we already have enough of in natural discourse). For a perfectly well calibrated agent, exactly 90% of their 0.9 predictions should have come true, exactly 20% of their 0.2 predictions should have come true, etc. We can reduce a person&#x27;s calibration to a number by, I suppose, getting the sum of squares of the differences of each histogram from its middle point (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s how they do it).</p><p>But whatever they do with the histogram, I think I&#x27;ll find it very unsatisfying, because the result are going to depend on what spacing we used for the histogram segments, and that&#x27;s arbitrary.

    "htmlBody": "<h2>The importance of feedback</h2><p>Consider trying to program a self-driving car to drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles -- <em>with no sensors</em> that allow it to gather information as it is driving. This is possible in principle. If you can predict the exact weather conditions, the exact movement of all of the other cars on the road, the exact amount of friction along every part of the road surface, the exact impact of (the equivalents of) pressing the gas or turning the steering wheel, and so on, then you could compute ahead of time how exactly to control the car such that it gets from SF to LA. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that we will ever be able to accomplish such a feat, even with powerful AI systems.</p><p>No, in practice there is going to be some uncertainty about how the world is going to evolve; such that any plan computed ahead of time will have some errors that will compound over the course of the plan. The solution is to use sensors to gather information <em>while</em> executing the plan, so that we can notice any errors or deviations from the plan, and take corrective action. It is much easier to build a <em>controller</em> that keeps you pointed in the general direction, than to build a plan that will get you there perfectly without any adaptation.</p><p>Control theory studies these sorts of systems, and you can see the general power of feedback controllers in the theorems that can be proven. Especially for motion tasks, you can build feedback controllers that are guaranteed to safely achieve the goal, even in the presence of <em>adversarial</em> environmental forces (that are bounded in size, so you can’t have arbitrarily strong wind). In the presence of an adversary, in most environments it becomes impossible even in principle to make such a guarantee if you do not have any sensors or feedback and must compute a plan in advance. Typically, for every such plan, there is some environmental force that would cause it to fail.</p><h2>The control theory perspective on AI alignment</h2><p>With <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN\">ambitious value learning</a>, we’re hoping that we can learn a utility function that tells us the optimal thing to do into the future. You need to be able to encode exactly how to behave in all possible environments, no matter what new things happen in the future, even if it’s something we humans never considered a possibility so far.</p><p>This is analogous to the problem of trying to program a self-driving car. Just as in that case, we might hope that we can solve the problem by introducing sensors and feedback. In this case, the “feedback” would be human data that informs our AI system what we want it to do, that is, data that can be used to learn values. The evolution of human values and preferences in new environments with new technologies is analogous to the unpredictable environmental disturbances that control theory assumes.</p><p>This does not mean that an AI system must be architected in such a way that human data is <em>explicitly</em> used to “control” the AI every few timesteps in order to keep it on track. It does mean that any AI alignment proposal should have some method of incorporating information about what humans want in radically different circumstances. I have found this an important frame with which to view AI alignment proposals. For example, with <a href=\"https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/indirect-normativity-write-up/\">indirect normativity</a> or idealized humans it’s important that the idealized or simulated humans are going through similar experiences that real humans go through, so that they provide good feedback.</p><h2>Feedback through interaction</h2><p>Of course, while the control theory perspective does not require the feedback controller to be explicit, one good way to ensure that there is feedback would be to make it explicit. This would mean that we create an AI system that explicitly collects fresh data about what humans want in order to inform what it should do. This is basically calling for an AI system that is constantly using tools from <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/vX7KirQwHsBaSEdfK\">narrow value learning</a> to figure out what to do. In practice, this will require interaction between the AI and the human. However, there are still issues to think about:</p><p><strong>Convergent instrumental subgoals:</strong> A simple way of implementing human-AI interaction would be to have an estimate of a reward function that is continually updated using narrow value learning. Whenever the AI needs to choose an action, it uses the current reward estimate to choose.</p><p>With this sort of setup, we still have the problem that we are maximizing a reward function which leads to convergent instrumental subgoals. In particular, the plan “disable the narrow value learning system” is likely very good according to the current estimate of the reward function, because it prevents the reward from changing causing all future actions to continue to optimize the current reward estimate.</p><p>Another way of seeing that this setup is a bit weird is that it has inconsistent preferences over time -- at any given point in time, it treats the expected change in its reward as an obstacle that should be undone if possible.</p><p>That said, it is worth noting that in this setup, the <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/DfcywmqRSkBaCB6Ma\">goal-directedness</a> is coming from the human. In fact, any approach where goal-directedness comes from the human requires some form of human-AI interaction. We might hope that some system of this form allows us to have a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/9zpT9dikrrebdq3Jf\">human-AI system that is overall goal-directed</a> (in order to achieve economic efficiency), while the AI system itself is not goal-directed, and so the overall system pursues the <em>human’s</em> instrumental subgoals. The next post will talk about reward uncertainty as a potential approach to get this behavior.</p><p><strong>Humans are unable to give feedback:</strong> As our AI systems become more and more powerful, we might worry that they are able to vastly outthink us, such that they would need our feedback on scenarios that are too hard for us to comprehend.</p><p>On the one hand, if we’re actually in this scenario I feel quite optimistic: if the questions are so difficult that we can’t answer them, we’ve probably already solved all the simple parts of the reward, which means we’ve probably stopped x-risk.</p><p>But even if it is imperative that we answer these questions accurately, I’m still optimistic: as our AI systems become more powerful, we can have better AI-enabled tools that help us understand the questions on which we are supposed to give feedback. This could be AI systems that do cognitive work on our behalf, as in recursive reward modeling, or it could be AI-created technologies that make us more capable, such as brain enhancement or the ability to be uploaded and have bigger “brains” that can understand larger things.</p><p><strong>Humans don’t know the goal:</strong> An important disanalogy between the control theory/self-driving car example and the AI alignment problem is that in control theory it is assumed that the general path to the destination is known, and we simply need to stay on it; whereas in AI alignment even the human does not know the goal (i.e. the “true human reward”). As a result, we cannot rely on humans to always provide adequate feedback; we also need to manage the process by which humans learn what they want. Concerns about human safety problems and manipulation fall into this bucket.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>If I want an AI system that acts autonomously over a long period of time, but it isn&#x27;t doing ambitious value learning (only narrow value learning), then we necessarily require a feedback mechanism that keeps the AI system &quot;on track&quot; (since my instrumental values will change over that period of time).</p><p>While the feedback mechanism need not be explicit (and could arise simply because it is an effective way to actually help me), we could consider AI designs that have an explicit feedback mechanism. There are still many problems with such a design, most notably that the obvious design has the problem that at any given point the AI system looks like it could be goal-directed with a long-term reward function, which is the sort of system that we are most worried about.</p>",

I've claimed before that there was no answer - <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6437\">anthropic decision theory</a> (ADT) was the only way to go.</p>\n<p>But actually, there are answers - the problem is simply that there are multiple versions of \"<strong>the</strong> question of anthropic probabilities\", each with their own answer. And what decision theory did was unambiguously select the right question (and the right answer) for the job.</p>\n<h1>Frequentist anthropic probabilities</h1>\n<p>It is much easier for humans to think in terms of frequencies, and anthropic probabilities are no exceptions. So imagine that either a small universe (with one copy of you) or a large universe (with <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\omega\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> copies of you) is created, with equal probability. Then your copies will independently observe a large sequence of <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\Omega\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> random bits, with <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"2^\\Omega >> \\omega\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.591em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">Ω</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.077em;\">&gt;<span class=\"mjx-charbox MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0.314em;\">&gt;</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">ω</span></span></span></span></span></span>. After that, the universe ends, and the whole experiment begins again, with a small or large universe being created again. This experiment will then be repeated a <em>very large</em> number of times, so we can coherent talk about frequencies.</p>\n<p>Then there are three questions you might ask yourself during these experiments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What proportion of my versions will be in a large universe?</li>\n<li>What proportion of universes, where versions of me exist, will be large?</li>\n<li>What proportion of universes, where <strong>exact copies</strong> of me exist, will be large?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the limit as these experiments are run a large number of times, the answers to these questions will converge on <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\omega/(1+\\omega)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">ω</span></span><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">/</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">+</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">ω</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>, <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"1/2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">/</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span>, and \"it depends on how many random bits you have seen when you ask the question\".

From outside, however, there are issues with all three.</p>\n<p>Question 2 has the perennial \"reference class problem\": what are you counting as \"versions of me\"? If we change the reference class, we change the question, and therefore its not surprising it gives a different answer.</p>\n<p>Question 3 has the same time inconsistency that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jH3NfxoNgKTh9r5KW/anthropics-full-non-indexical-conditioning-fnc-is\">FNC has</a>: the answer will be (predictably) different at different times, in a way that breaks probabilities = expectation of future probabilities. Again, each question is individually sound, but \"exact copies of me\" means different things at different times.</p>\n<p>Question 1 has a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iNi8bSYexYGn9kiRh/paradoxes-in-all-anthropic-probabilities\">similar time inconsistency issue</a> when the number of identical copies changes predictably but differentially across time.</p>\n<p>Aside from that, questions 1 and 3 are often <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LnearFbA4thE646tR/dead-men-tell-tales-falling-out-of-love-with-sia\">the wrong questions to ask</a> in decision theory. Non-identical versions can timelessly cooperate with you; identical copies may be <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QKc9Kctw6kxJP9amc/sleeping-anti-beauty-and-the-presumptuous-philosopher\">totally opposed to you</a>.</p>\n<h1>The advantages of decision theory</h1>\n<p>Why does decision theory perform well in anthropic contexts, giving single decisions even when there are multiple anthropic probability questions? Simply because it unambiguously selects the question that it is relevant to answer. Average utilitarians maximise their score by figuring out the universe; total utilitarians by figuring out where most of the copies are. The whole process of ADT/UDT decision-making computes a specific reference class: the reference class of all correlated decisions with your own. By automatically including precommitments, ADT/UDT resolves the fact that the class of \"exact copies of me\" keeps on changing. And by being explicitly a decision theory, it resolves the issue of cooperation and non-cooperation of identical and non-identical agents.</p>\n<p>So, back when I thought \"anthropic probabilities\" were a single question with a single answer, the fact that ADT/UDT gave a single answer (albeit a decision one rather than a probability one) convinced me that anthropic decisions were true while anthropic probabilities were not.</p>\n<p>But now that I've realised that there are multiple anthropic probability questions (and also that all the \"paradoxes\" of anthropic probabilities have <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PgsxXNSDsyz4DFEuw/anthropic-paradoxes-transposed-into-anthropic-decision\">non-paradoxical decision theory analogues</a>), I'm fully content to say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Yes Virginia, anthropic probabilities exist, and different anthropic probabilities are answering different anthropic questions.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Incidentally, there are far more than three questions - each of these questions can be different, depending on what time it is asked. So I'd also conclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The reason that anthropic probability is so debated, is because none of the anthropic questions correspond to a simple, stable question that corresponds to an intuitive understanding of what anthropic probability actually is.</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Barbara Oakley talked about two minds system (1). In Buddhism (Theravada is my area of expertise) we have awareness (introspective awareness) and concentration (narrow focus).\nAlso this weird feature is a byproduct that humans focused on the ground, and then they diffused looking forward at the horizont looking over more area for danger. Also Elizer Yudkowsky points this out in an essay. (2) closing your eyes is the best blackhole of ideas you can throw until something good works.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Which leads into another good question to ask yourself straight out: Did I spend five minutes with my eyes closed, brainstorming wild and creative options, trying to think of a better alternative? It has to be five minutes by the clock, because otherwise you blink—close your eyes and open them again—and say, “Why, yes, I searched for alternatives, but there weren’t any.” Blinking makes a good black hole down which to dump your duties. An actual, physical clock is necessary”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Magnus Carlsen did it when he was 13 against Kasparov. The idea was when he gets stuck he not only solves that but he also throws Kasparov off. (3)</p>\n<p>Not only this kind of thinking is useful, is great for math and science (formal logic even). For further reading well researched books:</p>\n<p>A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked ...</p>\n<p>The Mind Illuminated: A Complete Meditation Guide Integrating (Seen it many times on Hacker News, the best description is \"technical manual for your mind\")</p>\n<p>(1) She called them defused , like far apart pong dots, and close and narrow for tunnel vision. The main idea is that the book is insightful on meta-learning.\n(2) “47. The third alternative” by Eliser Yudkowsky.In the book “A mind for number” by Barbara Oakley they talk about closing your eyes and just asking “did that really make sense?” Is the best way to stop tunnel vision.\n(3) spoiler: The game ended in draw. Kasparov later became his mentor. You can find the match by searching young Carlsen vs Kasparov.</p>\n</body></html>",

There's something subtle about the way a deep breath out will interact with the thought stream. &nbsp;Feels like a sigh of letting go. I watch “emotional content” conversations and when I feel the need to take a deep breath, I notice when I don't and when I should.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>The Tiers of subjective experience</strong></h2>\n<p><em>(Side note: Concrete is sometimes called “gross” and causal is sometimes called “</em><a href=\"http://www.scdharma.org/teachings/gross-mind-subtle-mind-and-very-subtle-mind\"><em>very subtle</em></a><em>” in</em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Bodies_Doctrine_(Vedanta)\"><em>different</em></a><a href=\"https://www.stagesinternational.com/terri-ofallon-the-development-of-collective-consciousness-subtle-causal-levels/\"><em>maps</em></a><em>)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Concrete</strong>: This is the physical, physiological. &nbsp;The beating heart, the breath.</p>\n<p><strong>A concrete tier injury</strong> looks like a broken leg. &nbsp;Or a scratch wound. It takes time to heal. &nbsp;Feeling hungry is not on the concrete level, we don’t die from feeling hungry (we die from starvation). &nbsp;Feeling cold usually starts on the subtle level but there is a life threatening feeling of cold.</p>\n<p><em>There is a bridge between Concrete and subtle tiers through experiences like “goosebumps” where they register as a physical state and as a subtle feeling, or some mix of the two.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Subtle</strong>: This is an aptly named tier because - <em>it’s subtle</em>. &nbsp;An experience of the emotional subjective happens here. &nbsp;I feel happy, I feel guilty. A few \"weird\" feelings and hunches like “gut instinct” that seem <em>guiding</em> but without being as easy to describe as the concrete tier.</p>\n<p><strong>A subtle injury</strong> is a panic attack or being distraught. &nbsp;It is possible to be in an extended state of injury to this level but it's not possible to “break a happy” or break a miserable in a way that it becomes permanently injured and requires time to heal like a broken bone or a scratch. &nbsp;It is possible to set up a happy so that it leads straight to fear, i.e. “I’m not allowed to be happy because that’s when bad things happen”. In this sense, “Happy” and “Fear” are not broken themselves but they are routed through each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Causal</strong>: On this level are impersonal ideological drives. &nbsp;This level is where meaning and purpose registers. When someone feels like “making a difference in the world” or “being part of something greater”, these register on the causal level, not quite a feeling but sometimes a drive. &nbsp;The causal level is occasionally described as a void or various spirit-y phenomena.</p>\n<p><strong>A Causal injury</strong> might take days, months to become clear, it might take days, months or years to heal. &nbsp;An example here is tricky to pinpoint but a loss of purpose or a disconnection from meaning might land here. &nbsp;As a teenager, going through a break up hits the causal tier particularly strongly. As an adult (a divorce or) a break up does the same. &nbsp;Relationships often register on the meaning level (for the kegan stage 3 particularly). Where it doesn’t just feel bad, it feels “dooming”.</p>\n<p>About break ups - the interesting thing to note is that I could “break up” every day. It would be emotionally hard, but it would not cause death to me, there’s no “physical injury” to a “break up” despite it probably <em>feeling</em> worse than a broken bone. &nbsp;For something with “break” in the name, something physical did not break. &nbsp;With the open question of, “what took injury in a break up?” (some clues: expectations, intentions, plans, hope). &nbsp;Note: a break up every day would probably start feeling like a heart attack, or conversely - complete numbness.</p>\n<p>Not wanting to downplay the significance of the causal tier with a soft example like a break up, there are more ideological concepts than break ups on causal tier. &nbsp;Imagine being subscribed to communism and the realisation that a lifetime of effort in that movement was ineffective towards it’s goals. Not a physical injury, likely some aspect of “feels bad” but there’s also a “aaaah noooo” experience that goes with this shift of understanding.</p>\n<h5>Where does mental illness fit?</h5>\n<p>The whole model relies on a re-conceptualisation of mental health as being a different kind of information.</p>\n<p>My brief answer is, \"Not as it seems\". Most mental health problems are not states of constant emotional pain, i.e. depression is not an equivalent \"constantly broken\" experience like a bone or scratch. It's a mostly calm mind with small nudges towards less than amazing decisions for a very long time. (I can't say too much in this spot around that - other than, \"huh that's weird, watch this space\"). &nbsp;Psychosis and mania seems like extended subtle tier experiences and I’m still trying to understand that.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Tether</strong></h2>\n<p>The levels are connected with a <em>tether</em> (metaphorically a string that tugs on them to line up). &nbsp;In various circumstances or people, the tether changes length or has freedom depending on all kinds of factors. &nbsp;For example in summer I have more energy. I can take on more social adventures and play around more without feeling bad. &nbsp;(Linking concept <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder\">SAD</a>)</p>\n<p>When I visit a foreign culture, my tether for “getting offended” (Feeling offended) is longer because on a causal level I recognise there is going to be parts of this culture where I don’t understand how it works.</p>\n<p>It may help to think of boats floating on a river, tied to each other. &nbsp;Wherever any boat floats, the other boats will begin to follow. The river is the subjective experience of the external world, like summer, living in a warzone, being stressed at work, getting lots of sleep, etc. &nbsp;There are plenty of examples of different river events that can direct the boats to travel around.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example: Concrete to Subtle Tether</strong></h2>\n<p>I exercise. &nbsp;and I exercise routinely for a month. &nbsp;At some point along the way, my depression lifts and my quality of life increases. &nbsp;Further exercise will help to maintain my quality of life but it's not a guarantee.</p>\n<p>I stop exercising. &nbsp;I spend a lot of time on the couch and TV-watching. &nbsp;I do this for a few weeks and my desire to go out and do interesting activities diminishes. &nbsp;I feel lethargic. I lose motivation and I wonder why. I feel like, “I should really exercise” but I don’t necessarily act.</p>\n<p>In summer, my physical body is warmer. &nbsp;I don't feel hungry as often, and I stay awake longer without feeling tired. &nbsp;I can exercise so hard that I injure myself and it can take days of pretending I am okay in order to seek help. &nbsp;My subtle is strongly anchored in the present state of the concrete tier (I still move around fine despite injury) and my subtle takes time to catch up to the reality of physical injury. &nbsp;Eventually I wake up with difficulty moving and my subtle tier catches up to feeling bad about this.</p>\n<p>These tiers are tethered.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example: Subtle to causal tier</strong></h2>\n<p>I'm happy, curious and excited. &nbsp;It doesn't matter what I put my time towards, I enjoy the activity that I am doing. &nbsp;Wherever I choose to engage my energy, feels like the thing that I most enjoy. I start new projects with this energy. &nbsp;Explore fun ideas, and seem to have enough spare time to do anything I like.</p>\n<p>I meet someone who is kind and generous. &nbsp;They are involved in a church group. I feel good around them because I recognise them as being a great person despite having different beliefs about which groups to be invested in. &nbsp;Eventually I follow them to church because it seems to have been good for them.</p>\n<p>These tiers are tethered.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example: Causal to subtle tier</strong></h2>\n<p>I am working on my favourite hobby. &nbsp;Someone whose opinion I care about makes a sly comment to invalidate my interest. &nbsp;I laugh a little. Days later I am frustrated and annoyed at reality. With good meditation practices I could trace the problem back to the comment. &nbsp;Without it I would just feel uncomfortable and confused as to why. I spend several days wondering why everything is shit. Sitting on the couch maybe, trying desperately to distract myself. &nbsp;With more ADHD I forget and am doing 101 other projects. With less ADHD I have listless misery.</p>\n<p>Without meditation - eventually I take a shower and have shower-thoughts time to make a little progress on the problem. &nbsp;It either stays forever, or goes away by me working it out. Or I quit the project.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example: Subtle to concrete tier.</strong></h2>\n<p>I'm miserable. &nbsp;I just went through a break up. &nbsp;I don't want to move my body. I want to stay in bed. &nbsp;I haven't showered in a few days. I'm eating ice-cream and chocolate but it's really not helping. &nbsp;Somehow this feels like I am honouring my emotional pain, in another way it feels pointless, but everything feels pointless right now.</p>\n<p>When I get stressed at work, I eat more. &nbsp;I get home after work and I am starving. I eat chocolate and snacks and I can’t seem to diet. &nbsp;My friends encourage me to switch to fruit and I do that, I eat the fruit as well. Life is just too hard right now.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example: Subtle to other tiers</strong></h2>\n<p>I experienced the death of my grandfather. &nbsp;I have an image in my mind of the temporary nature of life. &nbsp;It's left me a little shaken for days. I look at all the things he cared about and how some of them never got completed. &nbsp;I wonder about what I'm working towards. I don't rush to work today. I'm delicate to myself for a week or two and I find myself gradually floating back to where I was in life.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example: Concrete to causal</strong></h2>\n<p>I make friends with a dodgy crowd. &nbsp;They drink heavily and they eat unhealthy foods. &nbsp;This is great because drinking heavily helps me avoid the problems caused by heavy drinking. &nbsp;I make this my lifestyle and I regularly drink to avoid connecting with my problems around avoiding purpose in life. &nbsp;Social life is fun and I always laugh with my mates. Maybe that’s all there is to life?</p>\n<h2><strong>Example: Causal to concrete</strong></h2>\n<p>I believe in being part of something greater. &nbsp;I give coins to homeless people and I always smile at strangers. &nbsp;I want to make the world a better place and in these small ways I am connecting with a higher purpose. &nbsp;I know it’s important because I regularly get comments about it and encouragement. I start to see people copying me and I watch a smile spread through a crowd as I pass. &nbsp;I post happy things on social media and I watch as I brighten up people’s days. I live in a world which I choose to see as happy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Working with the tiers</strong></h2>\n<p>The, <a href=\"http://philome.la/jace_harr/you-feel-like-shit-an-interactive-self-care-guide/play\"><em>So you feel like shit</em></a>guide starts with the concrete tier. &nbsp;Have I had a glass of water today? Have I eaten recently? &nbsp;Taken medication? Have I exercised today?</p>\n<p>This is an excellent strategy. &nbsp;The benefit of starting with the ground is that it’s easy to fix being uncomfortable and needing a toilet. &nbsp;Many practices describe themselves as “grounding”. For me, I can check in with my body with a handful of probing questions that I make up myself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Am I breathing? (duh!) &nbsp;Take a deep breath.</li>\n<li>Am I injured?</li>\n<li>Am I sore? &nbsp;Where?</li>\n<li>How is my posture?</li>\n<li>Am I sweating or thirsty?</li>\n<li>Am I hungry? &nbsp;Do I need food?</li>\n<li>Have I exercised? &nbsp;Can I go for a walk?</li>\n<li>Am I currently in physical danger?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a benefit to grounding checks for taking the mind out of past/present rumination and into the present moment, as well as the opportunity to solve these problems if relevant.</p>\n<p>Following concrete checks, move on to subtle checks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Am I currently distraught?</li>\n<li>Is there something that happened that keeps making me feel bad?</li>\n<li>Do I need to complete the thoughts about that?</li>\n<li>What’s the overall feeling quality of the whole saga?</li>\n<li>Is there some trigger that keeps dragging me back to emotional pain?</li>\n<li>Can I bring myself to a calm/neutral space emotionally?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once I’m in a calm place on my concrete and my subtle, I can watch to see what’s happening. &nbsp;This will usually mean physically being still (sitting), emptying out the current thought stream, and watching what happens next. &nbsp;The next place my attention goes towards is likely to be a causal event.</p>\n<p>For example: &nbsp;If I am looking at some birds while I wait (a stimuli). &nbsp;My mind sees one bird go to bite another bird. I kinda smile and think about how they remind me of little kids bickering. &nbsp;Suddenly I recall a fight I had with a childhood friend and how upset I was. And how people seem to misunderstand me. And PAUSE. &nbsp;Wow. That’s what’s bothering me on the causal level. The other day I tried to help someone and they got offended. For all my efforts to help and all my intentions, I am mad at myself for failing.</p>\n<p>“Mad at myself for failing”. &nbsp;Clarity around what I’m upset about can allow me to be compassionate to the part of myself that wants to do better. &nbsp;I’m only mad because I want the world to be a better place, and yeah, I see that. Realising my drive on a causal level to make the world a better place helps me see how that tether is linked to my subtle emotions and how that’s linked to my procrastination on the physical level.</p>\n<p>I think of my “realising” in the paragraph above as a movement on the causal level to loosen the tether between my other causal drive and my subtle emotional states.</p>\n<p>No post of mine is ever complete without at least one picture, so here it is. &nbsp;An idea (causal level entity) that can change the nature of tethers between the concrete (social situation) and the subtle (emotion - excitement/anxious) tiers.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image\"&gt;<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ICK1kv7luriI-XhanN1nFT5Nt6BZ_QGJpSgiSPFUlSq5E9CAmGT4AAZgYb_naMeS9bdFMEdkzQXiP9plSSveAsA_SfWi2EkdhlPSe4kFaDvIobbFcdeoCx0hV6XksduWn7BCyqYu\" alt=\"\">&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Tiers are from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)\">integral theory</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stagesinternational.com/\">StAGES model</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtle_body\">Buddhism</a> several other theories that try to amalgamate the different subjective experiences of consciousness. &nbsp;Mine are not full definitions of the tiers, especially causal (or \"very subtle\") tier, which I find hard to describe. &nbsp;For the purpose of further discussion it may be helpful to treat this as a rough map to someone else's concept.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my draft readers.</p>\n<p>Meta: I’ve been sitting on this post for a few months.

I still endorse most of the specific observations.</em></p><p>So... what&apos;s the deal with counterfactuals?</p><p>Over the past couple of years, I&apos;ve been writing about the CDT=EDT perspective. I&apos;ve now <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/fgHSwxFitysGKHH56\">organized those posts into a sequence</a> for easy reading.</p><p>I call CDT=EDT a &quot;perspective&quot; because it is a way of consistently answering questions about what counterfactuals are and how they work. At times, I&apos;ve argued strongly that it is the <em>correct</em> way. That&apos;s basically because:</p><ul><li>it has been the <em>only</em> coherent framework I put any stock in (more for lack of other proposals for dealing with logical counterfactuals than for an abundance of bad ones);</li><li>there <em>are</em> strong arguments for it, <em>if</em> you&apos;re willing to make certain assumptions;</li><li>it would be awfully nice to settle this whole question of counterfactual reasoning and move on. CDT=EDT is in a sense the most boring possible answer, IE that all approaches we&apos;ve thought of are essentially equivalent and there&apos;s no hope for anything better.</li></ul><p>However, recently I&apos;ve realized that there&apos;s a perspective which unifies <em>even more</em> approaches, while being <em>less boring</em> (more optimistic about counterfactual reasoning helping us to do well in decision-theoretic problems). It&apos;s been right in front of me the whole time, but I was blind to it due to the way I factored the problem of formulating decision theory. It suggests a research direction for making progress in our understanding of counterfactuals; I&apos;ll try to indicate some open curiosities of mine by the end.</p><h1>Three &gt; Two</h1><p>The claim I&apos;ll be elaborating on in this post is, essentially, that the framework in <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703751b2/in-memoryless-cartesian-environments-every-udt-policy-is-a-cdt-sia-policy\">Jessica Taylor&apos;s post about memoryless cartesian environments</a> is better than the CDT=EDT way of thinking. You&apos;ll have to read the post to get the full picture if you haven&apos;t, but to briefly summarize: if we formalize decision problems in a framework which Jessica Taylor calls &quot;memoryless cartesian environments&quot; (which we can call &quot;memoryless POMDPs&quot; if we want to be closer to academic CS/ML terminology), reasoning about anthropic uncertainty in a certain way (via the self-indication assumption, SIA for short) makes it possible for CDT to behave like UDT.</p><p>The result there is sometimes abbreviated as UDT=CDT+SIA, although UDT<span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

This is because UDT has self-coordination power which CDT+SIA lacks. (We could say UDT=CDT+SIA+coordination, but unfortunately &quot;coordination&quot; lacks a snappy three-letter acronym. Or, to be even more pedantic, we could say that UDT1.0 = CDT+SIA, and UDT1.1 = CDT+SIA+coordination. (The difference between 1.0 and 1.1 is, after all, the presence of global policy coordination.)) [EDIT: This isn&apos;t correct.

SSA (the self-sampling assumption) is one of the main contenders beside SIA for correct anthropic reasoning. Caspar&apos;s comment shows that we can think of the correct anthropics as a function of your preference between CDT and EDT. So, we could say that CDT+SIA = EDT+SSA = UDT1.0; or, CDT=EDT=UDT for short. [EDIT: As per <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WkPf6XCzfJLCm2pbK/cdt-edt-udt#Ya8msDGzRdR8yw4br\">Wei Dai&apos;s comment</a>, the equation &quot;CDT+SIA = EDT+SSA = UDT1.0&quot; is really not correct due to differing coordination strengths; as he put it, UDT1.0 &gt; EDT+SSA &gt; CDT+SIA.]</p><p>My CDT=EDT view came from being pedantic about how decision problems are represented, and noticing that when you&apos;re pedantic, it becomes awfully hard to drive a wedge between CDT and EDT; you&apos;ve got to do things which are strange enough that it becomes questionable whether it&apos;s a fair comparison between CDT and EDT. However, I didn&apos;t notice the extent to which my &quot;being very careful about the representation&quot; was really <em>insisting that bayes nets are the proper representation</em>.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6gmLNXl.png\" class=\"draft-image left\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p><em>(Aside: Bayes nets which are representing decision problems are usually called <strong>influence diagrams</strong> rather than Bayes nets. I think this convention is silly; why do we need a special term for that?)</em></p><p>It is rather curious that <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/fgHSwxFitysGKHH56/p/5bd75cc58225bf06703754ba\">LIDT also illustrated CDT=EDT-style behavior</a>. It is part of what made me feel like CDT=EDT was a convergent result of many different approaches, rather than noticing its reliance on certain Bayes-net formulations of decision problems. Now, I instead find it to be curious and remarkable that logical induction seems to think as if the world were made of bayes nets.</p><p>If CDT=EDT comes from insisting that decision problems are represented as Bayes nets, CDT=EDT=UDT is the view which comes from insisting that decision problems be represented as memoryless cartesian environments. At the moment, this just seems like a better way to be pedantic about representation. It unifies three decision theories instead of two.</p><h1>Updatelessness Doesn&apos;t Factor Out</h1><p>In fact, I thought about Jessica&apos;s framework frequently, but I didn&apos;t think of it as an objection to my CDT=EDT way of thinking. I was blind to this objection because I thought (logical-)counterfactual reasoning and (logically-)updateless reasoning could be dealt with as separate problems. The claim was not that CDT=EDT-style decision-making did well, but rather, that any decision problem where it performed poorly could be analyzed as a case where updateless reasoning is needed in order to do well. I let my counterfactual reasoning be simple, blaming all the hard problems on the difficulty of logical updatelessness.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uDwvbDw.png\" class=\"draft-image left\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>Once I thought to question this view, it seemed very likely wrong. The <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wkNQdYj47HX33noKv/cdt-dutch-book\">Dutch Book argument for CDT=EDT</a> seems closer to the true justification for CDT=EDT reasoning than <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/fgHSwxFitysGKHH56/p/x2wn2MWYSafDtm8Lf\">the Bayes-net argument</a>, but the Dutch Book argument is a dynamic consistency argument. I know that CDT and EDT both violate dynamic consistency, in general. So, why pick on one special type of dynamic consistency violation which CDT can illustrate but EDT cannot? In other words, the grounds on which I can argue CDT=EDT seem to point more directly to UDT instead.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oIJ695W.png\" class=\"draft-image left\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><h1>What about all those arguments for CDT=EDT?</h1><h2>Non-Zero Probability Assumptions</h2><p>I&apos;ve noted before that each argument I make for CDT=EDT seems to rely on an assumption that actions have non-zero probability. I leaned heavily on an assumption of epsilon exploration, although one could also argue that all actions must have non-zero probability on different grounds (such as the implausibility of knowing so much about what you are going to do that you can completely rule out any action, before you&apos;ve made the decision). Focusing on cases where we have to assign probability zero to some action was a big part of finally breaking myself of the CDT=EDT view and moving to the CDT=EDT=UDT view.</p><p>(I was almost broken of the view <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/fgHSwxFitysGKHH56/p/zFX8jFLcREJATshdK\">about a year ago</a> by thinking about the XOR blackmail problem, which has features in common with the case I&apos;ll consider now; but, it didn&apos;t stick, perhaps because the example doesn&apos;t actually force actions to have probability zero and so doesn&apos;t point so directly to where the arguments break down.)</p><p>Consider the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zEWJBFFMvQ835nq6h/decision-theory-faq\">transparent Newcomb problem </a>with a perfect predictor:</p><p><em><strong>Transparent Newcomb.</strong></em> <em>Omega runs a perfect simulation of you, in which you face two boxes, a large box and a small box. Both boxes are made of transparent glass. The small box contains $100, while the large one contains $1,000. In the Simulation, Omega gives you the option of either taking both boxes or only taking the large box. If Omega predicts that you will take only one box, then Omega puts you in this situation for real. Otherwise, Omega gives the real you the same decision, but with the large box empty. You find yourself in front of two full boxes. Do you take one, or two?</em></p><p>Apparently, since Omega is a perfect predictor, we are forced to assign probability zero to one-boxing even if we follow a policy of epsilon-exploring. In fact, if you implement epsilon-exploration by refusing to take any action which you&apos;re very confident you&apos;ll take (you have a hard-coded response: if <strong>P(&quot;I do action X&quot;)&gt;1-epsilon</strong>, do anything but <strong>X</strong>), which is how I often like to think about it, then <strong><em>you are forced to 2-box in transparent Newcomb</em></strong>. I was <em>expecting</em> CDT=EDT type reasoning to 2-box (at which point I&apos;d say &quot;but we can fix that by being updateless&quot;), but this is a <em>really weird reason </em>to 2-box.</p><p>Still, that&apos;s not in itself an argument against CDT=EDT. Maybe the rule that we can&apos;t take actions we&apos;re overconfident in is at fault. The argument against CDT=EDT style counterfactuals in this problem is that the agent should expect that if it 2-boxes, then it won&apos;t ever be in the situation to begin with; at least, not in the <em>real</em> world. As discussed somewhat in <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037550e/the-happy-dance-problem\">the happy dance problem</a>, this breaks important properties that you might want out of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703754b5/conditioning-on-conditionals\">conditioning on conditionals</a>. (There are some interesting consequences of this, but they&apos;ll have to wait for a different post.) More importantly for the CDT=EDT question, this can&apos;t follow from evidential conditioning, or learning about consequences of actions through epsilon-exploration, or any other principles in the CDT=EDT cluster. So, there would at least have to be other principles in play.</p><p>A very natural way of dealing with the problem is to represent the agent&apos;s uncertainty about whether it is in a simulation. If you think you might be in Omega&apos;s simulation, observing a full box doesn&apos;t imply certainty about your own action anymore, or even about whether the box is really full. This is exactly how you deal with the problem in memoryless cartesian environments. But, if we are willing to do this here, we might as well think about things in the memoryless cartesian framework all over the place. This contradicts the CDT=EDT way of thinking about things in lots of problems where updateless reasoning gives different answers than updatefull reasoning, such as counterfactual mugging, rather than only in cases where some action has probability zero.</p><p>(I should actually say &quot;problems where updateless reasoning gives different answers than <em>non-anthropic</em> updateful reasoning&quot;, since the whole point here is that updateful reasoning <em>can</em> be consistent with updateless reasoning so long as we take anthropics into account in the right way.)</p><p>I also note that trying to represent this problem in bayes nets, while possible, is very awkward and dissatisfying compared to the representation in memoryless cartesian environments. You could say I shouldn&apos;t have gotten myself into a position where this felt like significant evidence, but, reliant on Bayes-net thinking as I was, it did.</p><p>Ok, so, looking at examples which force actions to have probability zero made me revise my view even for cases where actions all have non-zero probability. So again, it makes sense to ask: but what about the arguments in favor of CDT=EDT?</p><h2>Bayes Net Structure Assumptions</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/fgHSwxFitysGKHH56/p/x2wn2MWYSafDtm8Lf\">argument in the bayes net setting</a> makes some assumptions about the structure of the Bayes net, illustrated earlier. Where do those go wrong?</p><p>In the Bayes net setting, observations are represented as parents of the epistemic state (which is a parent of the action). To represent the decision conditional on an observation, we condition on the observation being true. This stops us from putting some probability on our observations being false due to us being in a simulation, as we do in the memoryless cartesian setup.</p><p>In other words: the CDT=EDT setup makes it impossible to update on something and still have rational doubt in it, which is what we need to do in order to have an updateful DT act like UDT.</p><p>There&apos;s likely <em>some</em> way to fix this while keeping the Bayes-net formalism. However, memoryless cartesian environments model it naturally.</p><p>Question: how can we model memoryless cartesian environments in Bayes nets? Can we do this in a way such that the CDT=EDT theorem applies (making the CDT=EDT way of thinking compatible with the CDT=EDT=UDT way of thinking)?</p><h2>CDT Dutch Book</h2><p>What about the Dutch-book argument for CDT=EDT? I&apos;m not quite sure how this one plays out. I need to think more about the <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/TJT2oBMGaZTE7f2z2/when-is-cdt-dutch-bookable\">setting in which the Dutch-book can be carried out</a>, especially as it relates to anthropic problems and anthropic Dutch-books.</p><h2>Learning Theory</h2><p>I said that I think the Dutch-book argument gets closer to the real reason CDT=EDT seems compelling than the Bayes-net picture does. Well, although the Dutch Book argument against CDT gives a crisp justification of a CDT=EDT view, I felt <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/fgHSwxFitysGKHH56/p/tpWfDLZy2tk97MJ3F\">the learning-theoretic intuitions which lead me to formulate the dutch book</a> are closer to the real story. It doesn&apos;t make sense to ask an agent to have good counterfactuals in any single situation, because the agent may be ignorant about how to reason about the situation. However, any errors in counterfactual reasoning which result in observed consequences predictably differing from counterfactual expectations should eventually be corrected.</p><p>I&apos;m still in the dark about how this argument connects to the CDT=EDT=UDT picture, just as with the Dutch-book argument. I&apos;ll discuss this more in the next section.</p><h1>Static vs Dynamic</h1><p>A big update in my thinking recently has been to cluster frameworks into &quot;static&quot; and &quot;dynamic&quot;, and ask how to translate back and forth between static and dynamic versions of particular ideas. Classical decision theory has a strong tendency to think in terms of statically given decision problems. You could say that the epistemic problem of figuring out what situation you&apos;re in is assumed to factor out: decision theory deals only with what to do once you&apos;re in a particular situation. On the other hand, learning theory deals with more &quot;dynamic&quot; notions of rationality: rationality-as-improvement-over-time, rather than an absolute notion of perfect performance. (For our purposes, &quot;time&quot; includes <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dKAJqBDZRMMsaaYo5/in-logical-time-all-games-are-iterated-games\">logical time</a>; even in a single-shot game, you can learn from relevantly similar games which play out in thought-experiment form.)</p><p>This is a messy distinction. Here are a few choice examples:</p><p><strong>Static version:</strong> Dutch-book and money-pump arguments.</p><p><strong>Dynamic version:</strong> Regret bounds.</p><p>Dutch-book arguments rely on the idea that you shouldn&apos;t <em>ever</em> be able to extract money from a rational gambler without a chance of losing it instead. Regret bounds in learning theory offer a more relaxed principle, that you can&apos;t ever extract <em>too much</em> money (for some notion of &quot;too much&quot; given by the particular regret bound). The more relaxed condition is more broadly applicable; Dutch-book arguments only give us the probabilistic analog of logical consistency properties, whereas regret bounds give us inductive learning.</p><p><strong>Static:</strong> Probability theory.</p><p><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Logical induction.</p><p>In particular, the logical induction criterion gives a notion of regret which implies a large number of nice properties. Typically, the difference between logical induction and classical probability theory is framed as one of logical omniscience vs logical uncertainty. The static-vs-dynamic frame instead sees the critical difference as one of rationality in a static situation (where it makes sense to think about perfect reasoning) vs learning-theoretic rationality (where it doesn&apos;t make sense to ask for perfection, and instead, one thinks in terms of regret bounds).</p><p><strong>Static: </strong>Bayes-net decision theory (either CDT or EDT as set up in the CDT=EDT argument).</p><p><strong>Dynamic:</strong> LIDT.</p><p>As I mentioned before, the way LIDT seems to naturally reason as if the world were made of Bayes nets now seems like a curious coincidence rather than a convergent consequence of correct counterfactual conditioning. I would like a better explanation of why this happens. Here is my thinking so far:</p><ul><li>Logical induction lacks a way to question its perception. As with the Bayes-net setup used in the CDT=EDT argument, to observe something is to think that thing is true. There is not a natural way for logical induction to reason anthropically, especially for information which comes in through the traders thinking longer. If one of the traders calculates digits of <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\pi\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">&#x3C0;</span></span></span></span></span></span> and bets accordingly, this information is simply known by the logical inductor; how can it entertain the possibility that it&apos;s in a simulation and the trader&apos;s calculation is being modified by Omega?</li><li>Logical induction knows its own epistemic state to within high accuracy, as is assumed in the Bayes-net CDT=EDT theorem.</li><li>LIDT makes the action a function of the epistemic state alone, as required.</li></ul><p>There&apos;s a lot of formal work one could do to try to make the connection more rigorous (and look for places where the connection breaks down!).</p><p><strong>Static: </strong>UDT.</p><p><strong>Dynamic: </strong>???</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703753d4/two-major-obstacles-for-logical-inductor-decision-theory\">problem</a> <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037528c/a-failed-attempt-at-updatelessness-using-universal-inductors\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/K5Qp7ioupgb7r73Ca/logical-updatelessness-as-a-robust-delegation-problem\">logical</a> <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375313/open-problem-thin-logical-priors\">updatelessness</a> has been a thorn in my side for some time now. UDT is a good reply to a lot of decision-theoretic problems when they&apos;re framed in a probability-theoretic setting, but moving to a logically uncertain setting, it&apos;s unclear how to apply UDT. UDT requires a fixed prior, whereas logical induction gives us a picture in which logical uncertainty is fundamentally about how to revise beliefs as you think longer.</p><p>The main reason the static-vs-dynamic idea has been a big update for me is that I realized that a lot of my thinking has been aimed at turning logical uncertainty into a &quot;static&quot; object, to be able to apply UDT. I haven&apos;t even posted about most of those ideas, because they haven&apos;t lead anywhere interesting. Tsvi&apos;s post on <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375313/open-problem-thin-logical-priors\">thin logical priors</a> is definitely an example, though. I now think this type of approach is likely doomed to failure, because the dynamic perspective is simply superior to the static one.</p><p>The interesting question is: how do we translate UDT to a dynamic perspective? How do we learn updateless behavior?</p><p>For all its flaws, taking the dynamic perspective on decision theory feels like something <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yXCvYqTZCsfN7WRrg/asymptotic-decision-theory-improved-writeup\">asymptotic decision theory</a> got right. I have more to say about what ADT does right and wrong, but perhaps it is too much of an aside for this post.</p><p>A general strategy we might take to approach that question is: how do we translate individual things which UDT does right into learning-theoretic desiderata? (This may be more tractable than trying to translate the UDT optimality notion into a learning-theoretic desideratum whole-hog.)</p><p><strong>Static:</strong> Memoryless Cartesian decision theories (CDT+SIA or EDT+SSA).</p><p><strong>Dynamic:</strong> ???</p><p>The CDT=EDT=UDT perspective on counterfactuals is that we can approach the question of learning logically updateless behavior by thinking about the learning-theoretic version of anthropic reasoning. How do we learn which observations to take seriously? How do we learn about what to expect supposing we <em>are</em> being fooled by a simulation? Some optimistic speculation on that is the subject of the next section.</p><h1>We Have the Data</h1><p>Part of why I was previously very pessimistic about doing any better than the CDT=EDT-style counterfactuals was that we <em>don&apos;t have any data</em> about counterfactuals, almost by definition. How are we supposed to learn what to counterfactually expect? We only observe the real world.</p><p>Consider LIDT playing transparent Newcomb with a perfect predictor. Its belief that it will 1-box in cases where it sees that the large box is full must converge to 100%, because it only ever sees a full box in cases where it does indeed 1-box. Furthermore, the expected utility of 2-boxing can be anything, since it will never see cases where it sees a full box and 2-boxes. This means I can make LIDT 1-box by designing my LI to think 2-boxing upon seeing a full box will be catastrophically bad: I simply include a trader with high initial wealth who bets it will be bad. Similarly, I can make LIDT 2-box whenever it sees the full box by including a trader who bets 2-boxing will be great. Then, the LIDT will never see a full box except on rounds where it is going to epsilon-explore into 1-boxing.</p><p><em>(The above analysis depends on details of how epsilon exploration is implemented. If it is implemented via the probabilistic chicken-rule, mentioned earlier, making the agent explore whenever it is very confident about which action it takes, then the situation gets pretty weird. Assume that LIDT is epsilon-exploring pseudorandomly instead.)</em></p><p>LIDT&apos;s confidence that it 1-boxes whenever it sees a full box is jarring, because I&apos;ve just shown that I can make it either 1-box or 2-box depending on the underlying LI. Intuitively, an LIDT agent who 2-boxes upon seeing the full box should not be near-100% confident that it 1-boxes.</p><p>The problem is that the cases where LIDT sees a full box and 2-boxes are all counterfactual, since Omega is a perfect predictor and doesn&apos;t show us a full box unless we in fact 1-box. LIDT doesn&apos;t learn from counterfactual cases; the version of the agent in Omega&apos;s head is shut down when Omega is done with it, and never reports its observations back to the main unit.</p><p>(The LI <em>does</em> correctly learn the <em>mathematical fact</em> that its algorithm 2-boxes when input observations of a full box, but, this does not help it to have the intuitively correct expectations when Omega feeds it false sense-data.)</p><p>In the terminology of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037550e/the-happy-dance-problem\">The Happy Dance Problem</a>, LIDT isn&apos;t learning the right observation-counterfactuals: the predictions about what action it takes given different possible observations. However, <em><strong>we have the data:</strong></em> the agent <em>could</em> simulate itself under alternative epistemic conditions, and train its observation-counterfactuals on what action it in fact takes in those conditions.</p><p>Similarly, the action-counterfactuals are wrong: LIDT can believe anything about what happens when it 2-boxes upon seeing a full box. Again, <em><strong>we have the data:</strong></em> LI can observe that on rounds when it is mathematically true that the LIDT agent would have 2-boxed upon seeing a full box, it doesn&apos;t get the chance. This knowledge simply isn&apos;t being &quot;plugged in&quot; to the decision procedure in the right way. Generally speaking, an agent can observe the real consequences of counterfactual actions, because (1) the counterfactual action is a mathematical fact of what the agent does under a counterfactual observation, and (2) the important effects of this counterfactual action occur in the real world, which we can observe directly.</p><p>This observation makes me much more optimistic about learning interesting counterfactuals. Previously, it seemed like <em>by definition</em> there would be no data from which to learn the correct counterfactuals, other than the (EDTish) requirement that they should match the actual world for actions actually taken. Now, it seems like I have not one, but <em>two</em> sources of data: the observation-counterfactuals can be simulated outright, and the action-counterfactuals can be trained on what actually happens when counterfactual actions are taken.</p><p>I haven&apos;t been able to plug these pieces together to get a working counterfactual-learning algorithm yet. It might be that I&apos;m still missing a component. But ... it <em>really</em> feels like there should be something here.</p>",

Ultimately I think that the “right” definition will be closely tied to the use we want to make of it, and so we should be refining this definition in parallel with exploring its applications.</p><p>I’m using the awkward term “ascription universality” partly to explicitly flag that this is a preliminary definition, and partly to reserve linguistic space for the better definitions that I’m optimistic will follow.</p><p>(Thanks to Geoffrey Irving for discussions about many of the ideas in this post.)</p><h1><strong>I. Definition</strong></h1><p>We will try to define what it means for a question-answering system <strong>A</strong> to be “ascription universal.”</p><h2><strong>1. Ascribing beliefs to A</strong></h2><p>Fix a language (e.g. English with arbitrarily big compound <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/approval-directed-algorithm-learning-bf1f8fad42cd\">terms</a>) in which we can represent questions and answers.</p><p>To ascribe beliefs to <strong>A</strong>, we ask it. If <strong>A</strong>(“are there infinitely many twin primes?”) = “probably, though it’s hard to be sure” then we ascribe that belief about twin primes to <strong>A</strong>.</p><p>This is not a general way of ascribing “belief.” This procedure wouldn’t capture the beliefs of a native Spanish speaker, or for someone who wasn’t answering questions honestly. But it can give us a sufficient condition, and is particularly useful for someone who wants to use <strong>A</strong> as part of an alignment scheme.</p><p>Even in this “straightforward” procedure there is a lot of subtlety. In some cases there are questions that we can’t articulate in our language, but which (when combined with <strong>A</strong>’s other beliefs) have consequences that we can articulate. In this case, we can infer something about <strong>A</strong>’s beliefs from its answers to the questions that we can articulate.</p><h2><strong>2. Ascribing beliefs to arbitrary computations</strong></h2><p>We are interested in whether <strong>A</strong> “can understand everything that could be understood by someone.” To clarify this, we need to be more precise about what we mean by “could be understood by someone.”</p><p>This will be the most informal step in this post. (Not that any of it is very formal!)</p><p>We can imagine various ways of ascribing beliefs to an arbitrary computation <strong>C</strong>. For example:</p><ul><li>We can give <strong>C</strong> questions in a particular encoding and assume its answers reflect its beliefs. We can either use those answers directly to infer <strong>C</strong>’s beliefs (as in the last section), or we can ask what set of beliefs about latent facts would explain <strong>C</strong>’s answers.</li><li>We can view <strong>C</strong> as optimizing something and ask what set of beliefs rationalize that optimization. For example, we can give <strong>C</strong> a chess board as input, see what move it produces, assume it is trying to win, and infer what it must believe. We might conclude that <strong>C</strong> believes a particular line of play will be won by black, or that <strong>C</strong> believes general heuristics like “a pawn is worth 3 tempi,” or so on.</li><li>We can reason about how <strong>C</strong>’s behavior depends on facts about the world, and ask what state of the world is determined by its current behavior. For example, we can observe that <strong>C</strong>(113327) = 1 but that <strong>C</strong>(113327) “would have been” 0 if 113327 had been composite, concluding that <strong>C</strong>(11327) “knows” that 113327 is prime. We can extend to probabilistic beliefs, e.g. if <strong>C</strong>(113327) “probably” would have been 0 if 113327 had been composite, then we might that <strong>C</strong> knows that 113327 is “probably prime.” This certainly isn’t a precise definition, since it involves considering logical counterfactuals, and I’m not clear whether it can be made precise. (See also ideas along the lines of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/b3Bt9Cz4hEtR26ANX/knowledge-is-freedom\">“knowledge is freedom”</a>.)</li><li>If a computation behaves differently under different conditions, then we could use restrict attention to a particular condition. For example, if a question-answering system appears to be bilingual but answers questions differently in Spanish and English, we could ascribe two different sets of beliefs. Similarly, we could ascribe beliefs to any subcomputation. For example, if a part of <strong>C</strong> can be understood as optimizing the way data is laid out in memory, then we can ascribe beliefs to that computation about the way that data will be used.</li></ul><p>Note that these aren’t intended to be efficient procedures that we could actually apply to a given computation <strong>C</strong>. They are hypothetical procedures that we will use to define what it means for <strong>A</strong> to be universal.</p><p>I’m not going to try to ascribe a single set of beliefs to a given computation; instead, I’ll consider all of the reasonable ascription procedures. For example, I think different procedures would ascribe different beliefs to a particular human, and don’t want to claim there is a unique answer to what a human “really” believes. A universal reasoner needs to have more reasonable beliefs than the beliefs ascribed to that a human using any particular method.</p><p>An ascription-universal reasoner needs to compete with any beliefs that can be ascribed to <strong>C</strong>, so I want to be generous with this definition. For example, given a chess-playing algorithm, we might rationalize it as trying to win a game and infer its beliefs about the rules of chess. Or we might rationalize it as trying to look like a human and infer its beliefs about what a human would do. Or something different altogether. Most of these will be kind of crazy ascriptions, but I want to compete with them anyway (competing with crazier beliefs will turn out to just be easier).</p><p>It’s not totally clear what counts as a “reasonable” ascription procedure, and that’s the biggest source of informality. Intuitively, the key property is that the ascription itself isn’t doing the “hard work.” In practice I’m using an informal extensional definition, guided by examples like those in the bulleted list.</p><h2><strong>3. Comparing beliefs</strong></h2><p>What does it mean to say that one agent is “better-informed” than another?</p><p>It’s natural to try to express this in terms of empirical information about the world, but we are particularly interested in the different inferences that agents are able to draw from the same data. Another natural approach is to compare their “knowledge,” but I have no idea how to define knowledge or justified belief. So I’m reduced to working directly with sets of beliefs.</p><p>Consider two sets of beliefs, described by the subjective expectations 𝔼¹ and 𝔼². What does it mean to say that 𝔼¹ is better-informed than 𝔼²?</p><p>This framing makes it tempting to try something simple: “for every quantity, 𝔼¹’s belief about that quantity is more accurate.” But this is property is totally unachievable. Even if 𝔼¹ is obtained by conditioning 𝔼² on a true fact, it will almost certainly happen to update in the “wrong” direction for some claims.</p><p>We will instead use a subjective definition, i.e. we’ll define this concept from a particular epistemic position represented by another subjective expectation 𝔼.</p><p>Then we say that 𝔼¹ <strong>dominates</strong> 𝔼² (w.r.t. 𝔼) if, for every bounded quantity X and for every “nice” property Φ:</p><ul><li>𝔼[X|Φ(𝔼¹, 𝔼²)] = 𝔼[𝔼¹[X]|Φ(𝔼¹, 𝔼²)]</li></ul><p>(By “nice” I mean something like: simple to define and open in the product topology, viewing 𝔼¹ and 𝔼² as infinite tables of numbers.)</p><p>Intuitively, this means that 𝔼 always “trusts” 𝔼¹, even if given arbitrary information about 𝔼¹ and 𝔼². For example, if 𝔼 was told that 𝔼¹[X] ≈ <em>x</em> and<br/>𝔼²[X] ≈ <em>y</em>, then it would expect X to be around <em>x</em> (rather than <em>y</em>)<em>.</em> Allowing arbitrary predicates Φ allows us to make stronger inferences, effectively that 𝔼 thinks that 𝔼¹ captures <em>everything</em> useful about 𝔼².</p><p>I’m not sure if this is exactly the right property, and it becomes particularly tricky if the quantity X is itself related to the behavior of 𝔼¹ or 𝔼² (continuity in the product topology is the minimum plausible condition to avoid a self-referential paradox). But I think it’s at least roughly what we want and it may be exactly what we want.</p><p>Note that dominance is <em>subjective</em>, i.e. it depends on the epistemic vantage point 𝔼 used for the outer expectation. This property is a little bit stronger than what we originally asked for, since it also requires 𝔼 to trust 𝔼¹, but this turns out to be implied anyway by our definition of universality so it’s not a big defect.</p><p>Note that dominance is a property of the <em>descriptions</em> of 𝔼¹ and 𝔼². There could be two different computations that in fact compute the same set of expectations, such that 𝔼 trusts one of them but not the other. Perhaps one computation hard-codes a particular result, while the other does a bunch of work to estimate it. Even if the hard-coded result happened to be correct, such that the two computations had the same outputs, 𝔼 might trust the hard work but not the wild guess.</p><h2><strong>4. Complexity and parameterization</strong></h2><p>There are computations with arbitrarily sophisticated beliefs, so no fixed <strong>A</strong>can hope to dominate everything. To remedy this, rather than comparing to a fixed question-answerer <strong>A</strong>, we’ll compare to a parameterized family <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>].</p><p>I’ll consider two different kinds of potentially-universal reasoners <strong>A</strong>:</p><ul><li>In the “idealized” case, <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] depends only on the complexity of <strong>C</strong>.<br/>For example, we might hope that an <em>n</em>-round debate dominates any beliefs that could be ascribed to a fast computation with (<em>n</em>-1) rounds of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_Turing_machine\">alternation</a>. In particular, this <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] is the same for any two computations <strong>C</strong>of the same complexity.</li><li>In the “practical” case, <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] depends on the complexity of <strong>C</strong> but also uses the computation <strong>C</strong> as a hint. For example, if <strong>C</strong> is the training process for a neural net, then we might take <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] to be a debate in which the debaters are able to share weights and activations with the neural net throughout the entire training process.</li></ul><p>I’m generally interested in the case where <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] is only slightly more powerful than <strong>C</strong> itself. This mirrors the setting where a universal Turing machine is able to run any other Turing machine with only a modest slowdown.</p><h2><strong>Putting it all together</strong></h2><p>We say that a set of beliefs 𝔼ᴬ <em>epistemically dominates</em> a computation <strong>C</strong> (w.r.t. some beliefs 𝔼 and language L) if the beliefs ascribed to A by the “straightforward” procedure, using L, dominate (w.r.t. 𝔼) the beliefs ascribed to <strong>C</strong> by any reasonable ascription procedure.</p><p>We say that a family of question-answering systems <strong>A</strong>[<strong>·</strong>] are <em>ascription universal</em> (w.r.t. 𝔼 and L) if <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] epistemically dominates <strong>C</strong> for every computation <strong>C</strong>.</p><h1><strong>II. Discussion</strong></h1><h2><strong>Why is (subjective) dominance sufficient?</strong></h2><p>This universality condition requires that <em>we</em> believe that <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] is better-informed than <strong>C</strong>. Naively we might have wanted it to <em>actually</em> be the case that <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] is better-informed than <strong>C</strong>; the stronger condition is clearly unachievable, but why should we be satisfied with the weaker condition?</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/informed-oversight-18fcb5d3d1e1\">applications</a> <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-consequentialism-within-hch-c0bee00365bd\">of this</a> <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-model-based-rl-b08701394ddd\">property</a>, the subjective condition is what we need in order for <em>us</em> to believe that <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] will cope with the challenges posed by <strong>C</strong>. For example, suppose that <strong>C</strong> formulates a plan to “trick” <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>]. Then the subjective universality condition implies that we don’t expect <strong>C</strong> to succeed.</p><p>This isn’t as good as actually knowing that <strong>C</strong> won’t succeed. But I think it should be good enough for us — the reason we are thinking about AI safety is because we are concerned that something bad will happen. If we find a technique that defuses this argument, then we’ve addressed the motivating problem. It may still be the case that bad things happen (and we should still search for additional reasons that bad things might happen), but we don’t particularly expect them to.</p><p>Of course if you select over a large number of computations, then you may find one that will succeed in tricking <strong>A</strong>. But if we are concerned about that, then we can instead apply ascription universality to the entire process including the selection.</p><h2><strong>Why trust opaque computation?</strong></h2><p>If <strong>C</strong> uses some clever heuristics that I don’t understand, then <strong>C</strong>’s “beliefs” might be excellent, but I might not <em>expect</em> them to be excellent. In this sense understanding may seem almost vacuous. If there is some heuristic that I trust, wouldn’t <strong>A</strong> just use it?</p><p>To see why the definition is demanding, consider the special case where <strong>C</strong>performs an extensive search to find a computation that works well empirically. For example, <strong>C</strong> might be the following computation:</p><ul><li>Start with a training set of (image, label) pairs.</li><li>Search over simple programs to find one that makes good predictions.</li><li>Run that simple program on a new image to predict its label.</li></ul><p>In this case, we can ascribe beliefs to <strong>C</strong> about the contents of the new image. And because those beliefs are coming from a simple program that works empirically, I expect them to be accurate (in some respects).</p><p>For example, a simple classifier <strong>C</strong> may “believe” that the new image contains a particular curve that typically appears in images labeled “dog;” or a really sophisticated classifier may perform complex deductions about the contents of the scene, starting from premises that were empirically validated on the training set.</p><p>So it’s not OK for <strong>A</strong> to simply ignore whatever heuristics <strong>C</strong> is using — if those heuristics have the kind of empirical support that makes us think they actually work, then A needs to be able to understand everything that those heuristics imply about the domain.</p><h2><strong>Why be so general?</strong></h2><p>I’ve formulated universality as competing with arbitrary computations <strong>C</strong>. It seems totally possible that the form of <strong>C</strong> discussed in the last section — searching for a program that works well in practice and then using it in a new situation — is so central that the definition of universality should focus entirely on it.</p><p>One reason to use the broader definition is because sometimes this “selection” process can be embedded in a non-trivial way in a larger computation. For example, if I have a sufficiently large group of humans, I might expect memetic selection to occur and produce systems that could be said to have “beliefs,” and I’d like universal systems to dominate those beliefs as well.</p><p>The other reason to use this very general definition is because I don’t see an easy way to simplify the definition by using the additional structural assumption about <strong>C</strong>. I do think it’s likely there’s a nicer statement out there that someone else can find.</p><h2><strong>Universal from whose perspective?</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, achieving universality depends a lot on the epistemic perspective 𝔼 from which it is being evaluated. For example, if 𝔼 knows any facts, than a universal agent must know all of those facts as well. Thus “a debate judged by Paul” may be universal from Paul’s perspective, but “a debate arbitrated by Alice” cannot be universal from my perspective unless I believe that Alice knows everything I know.</p><p>This isn’t necessarily a big problem. It will limit us to conclusions like: Google engineers believe that the AI they’ve built serves the user’s interests reasonably well. The user might not agree with that assessment, if they have different beliefs from Google engineers. This is what you’d expect in any case where Google engineers build a product, however good their intentions.</p><p>(Of course Google engineers’ notion of “serving the user’s interests” can involve deferring to the user’s beliefs in cases where they disagree with Google engineers, just as they could defer to the user’s beliefs with other products. That gives us reason to be less concerned about such divergences, but eventually these evaluations do need to bottom out somewhere.)</p><p>This property becomes more problematic when we ask questions like: is there a way to <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-security-amplification-551b314a3bab\">seriously limit the inputs and outputs to a human while preserving universality of HCH</a>? This causes trouble because even if limiting the human intuitively preserves universality, it will effectively eliminate some of the human’s knowledge and know-how that can <a href=\"https://medium.com/@weidai/to-put-it-another-way-a-human-translator-has-learned-a-lot-of-valuable-information-much-of-it-48457f95b9bf\">only be accessed on large inputs</a>, and hence violate universality.</p><p>So when investigating schemes based on this kind of impoverished human, we would need to evaluate universality from some impoverished epistemic perspective. We’d like to say that the impoverished perspective is still “good enough” for us to feel safe, despite not being good enough to capture literally everything we know. But now we risk begging the question: how do we evaluate whether the impoverished perspective is good enough? I think this is probably OK, but it’s definitely subtle.</p><p>I think that defining universality w.r.t. 𝔼 is an artifact of this definition strategy, and I’m optimistic that a better definition wouldn’t have this dependence, probably by directly attacking the notion of “justified” belief (which would likely also be useful for actually establishing universality, and may even be necessary). But that’s a hard problem. Philosophers have thought about very similar problems extensively without making the kind of progress that seems adequate for our purposes, and I don’t see an immediate angle of attack.</p><h1><strong>III. Which A might be universal?</strong></h1><h2><strong>Two regimes</strong></h2><p>I’m interested in universality in two distinct regimes:</p><ul><li>Universality of idealized procedures defined in terms of perfect optimization, such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899\">debate</a> under optimal play or <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/humans-consulting-hch-f893f6051455\">max-HCH</a>, where <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] depends only the computational complexity of <strong>C</strong>.</li><li>Universality of practical variants, in which the perfect optimization is replaced by a bounded optimization, which might use the computation <strong>C</strong>as a “hint.” For example, we might consider amplification or debate where the agents are allowed to inspect a transcript of <strong>C</strong>; or if <strong>C</strong> is a neural net training process, we might train them jointly with <strong>C</strong>.</li></ul><h2><strong>Idealized models</strong></h2><p><strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] could be:</p><ul><li>A debate, judged by a human, with perfect debaters, whose length depends on the complexity of <strong>C</strong>. (Hopefully in such a way that <strong>A</strong>[<strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>]] is only a slightly longer debate than <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>].)</li><li>max-HCH, using perfect optimization rather than a bounded optimizer. Again, we can impose a budget limit that depends on the complexity of <strong>C</strong>, ideally such that <strong>A</strong>[<strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>]] does not involve a much larger computation than <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>].</li><li>Use HCH to implement two functions, Info and Answer. Define <strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>](Q) to be Answer(Q, <em>a*</em>)<em>,</em> where <em>a* =</em> argmax Info(<em>a</em>, Q<em>),</em> and the optimization is over advice strings <em>a</em> of length comparable to the description of <strong>C</strong>.</li></ul><p>I don’t think any of these would be universal if instantiated with an open-ended human policy — providing arbitrary complex inputs to a human is likely to lead to bad behavior. Instead, I imagine restricting the human to some small enough space of inputs that they can behave “reasonably” over the whole space, while still being rich enough to be universal. Even as such, I think <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/universality-and-consequentialism-within-hch-c0bee00365bd\">additional measures</a> might be needed to achieve security (since a team of humans may behave badly in some exotic corners of the input space, even if individual humans are sheltered from exotic inputs).</p><h2><strong>Practical models</strong></h2><p>In practice I’m particularly interested in the case where <strong>C</strong> has the special form described in the “Trusting opaque computations” section: it trains a neural net on some dataset, and then runs that neural network on new inputs.</p><p><strong>A</strong>[<strong>C</strong>] could be:</p><ul><li>Debates arbitrated by a human where the debaters are trained jointly with <strong>C</strong>, and can make references to individual examples from the dataset.</li><li>max-HCH where the agent is trained jointly with <strong>C</strong>, and the overseer can consult individual entries from the dataset.</li><li>HCH, combined with interpretability techniques that allow it to get information about what <strong>C</strong> is thinking and to relate its behavior to the dataset on which it was trained.</li></ul><p>For each of these practical variants, I don’t expect it to be universal unless the corresponding idealized model is. So we can think of dividing the universality question into two pieces:</p><ul><li>Would our procedure be universal <em>if the optimization was performed perfectly</em>?</li><li>Is weight sharing / interpretability strong enough to solve the optimization problems needed for universality?</li></ul><p>I think none of the suggestions in this section are plausibly universal without some additional mechanisms, and so even if HCH or debate is universal, additional ideas are needed in order to translate those to practical universal systems. I’m still inclined to focus on the idealized case, because I want to better understand what is needed for universality without thinking about algorithmic difficulties.</p><h1><strong>IV. Which C are hard to epistemically dominate?</strong></h1><p>The definition in this post was somewhat informal, but the discussion in this appendix will be extremely informal. The purpose is to communicate some of my early thinking about universality and my sense for what a universal reasoner might look like.</p><p>The first three examples will consider programs <strong>C</strong> with the following form:</p><ul><li>Iterate over programs to find an <em>f</em> that successfully predicts the answers to some dataset of historical questions for which we know the answer.</li><li>Use that program to predict the answers to future questions.</li></ul><p>The different examples explore features of <em>f</em> that might make it difficult to dominate the overall computation.</p><h2><strong>Deduction</strong></h2><p>Suppose <em>f</em> takes the following form:</p><ul><li>Given a question and context, it performs a short series of deductions from facts in the context, together with some axioms (e.g. “Bob’s eyes are more likely to twitch when he is lying,” the rules of poker, <em>etc.</em>)</li><li>When it arrives at answers that constrain the possible answers to the given question, it outputs an answer consistent with those constraints.</li></ul><p>We could attribute the statements produced by this process to <strong>C</strong> as beliefs. We expect this set of beliefs to have useful information because it was selected for making correct predictions.</p><p>Fortunately, if HCH is able to see the training dataset then it may be able to arrive at similarly accurate views:</p><ul><li>It can compute that P(observations | axioms) is high by following along with the deductive process used by <em>f .</em></li><li>Bayes implies that the axioms are likely to be true (fully capturing the argument which leads us, from our current perspective, to expect them to be true).</li><li>Once HCH knows the axioms are likely to be true, it can follow along with the deductive process to reproduce all of <em>f</em>’s beliefs.</li></ul><h2><strong>Modeling</strong></h2><p>Suppose <em>f</em> takes the following form:</p><ul><li>Given a question Q and context, set up a relevant physical situation.</li><li>Use a dynamics model M to predict what will happen at some future time.</li><li>Use the resulting state to answer Q.</li></ul><p>We could say that <strong>C</strong> believes everything implied by the outcome of this physical simulation. We expect these beliefs to be accurate because <em>f</em> has predicted well in the past.</p><p>As in the deduction case, hopefully HCH can compute that P(observations|M is accurate) is high, since it can also compute the consequences of M. Then Bayes implies the dynamics model is accurate, and HCH can use that model to compute physical states.</p><p>Inferring all the beliefs from a dynamics model is not trivial though. As an extreme example, if <em>f</em> is performing an atom-by-atom simulation of a room, and that room contains Alice and Bob, then we could ascribe extensive beliefs about Alice and Bob to the computation <strong>C</strong>.</p><p>(Here we run head on into the fuzziness about what counts as a “reasonable” ascription procedure, but for the moment I’ll assume that some reasonable procedure ascribes beliefs about Alice and Bob to the computation.)</p><p>To compete with these ascriptions, HCH needs to infer those high-level beliefs about Alice and Bob from the low-level computation involving atoms. One way to do this is to search over possible “bridging” hypotheses that relate low-level physical facts to high-level facts about the environment. If such a hypothesis can explain additional high-level facts, then a Bayesian can learn that it is true. Similarly, if the bridging hypothesis relates facts about the model to constraints we know from the high-level interpretation, then the Bayesian can potentially use that as evidence. (This kind of reasoning will be discussed in a bit more detail in the next section.)</p><p>We could further hope that searching for a bridging hypothesis isn’t much harder than performing the original search over low-level physics, given that the low-level physics needed to explain a bunch of high-level facts and so already must encode some part of that correspondence.</p><p>(Note that the “deduction” example in the previous case could also involve alien concepts or models, in which case the same kind of work would be needed.)</p><h2><strong>Alien reasoning</strong></h2><p>In the previous section we described two styles of reasoning we already understand. But there are probably many kinds of reasoning that work well in practice but that would be more alien, and those might be more challenging. This section will explore one example in some detail to try to help anchor our reasoning about the general phenomenon. It will also elaborate on some of the reasoning about “bridging” hypotheses mentioned in the last section.</p><p>Suppose that our predictions are always of the same form (e.g. what is the probability the stock market will go up today), and <em>f</em> works as follows (the details are long but not very important):</p><ul><li>Find the PSD matrix A with maximum log determinant subject to the constraints in the next bullet points, then output the (0, 0) entry.</li><li>There is an implicit correspondence between the rows/columns of A, and some uncertain properties X(0), X(1), X(2), …. (which we’ll view as 0–1 variables), where X(0) is the property we want to forecast.</li><li>If the (<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>) entry of A represented the expectation E[X(<em>i</em>)X(<em>j</em>)], then the matrix would necessarily satisfy a bunch of constraints, which we impose A. For example:</li><li>If the context implies that X(<em>i</em>) = 1, then E[X(<em>i</em>)X(<em>j</em>)] = E[X(<em>j</em>)] = E[X(<em>j</em>)²], so A(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>) = A(<em>j</em>, <em>j</em>).</li><li>If X(<em>i</em>) and X(<em>j</em>) together imply X(<em>k</em>), then we must have E[X(<em>i</em>)X(<em>j</em>)] ≤ E[X(<em>i</em>)X(<em>k</em>)] and hence A(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>) ≤ A(<em>i</em>, <em>k</em>).</li><li>For any constants <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, …, E[(<em>a</em> X(1) + <em>b</em> X(2) + … )²] ≥ 0 — i.e., the matrix A must be PSD.</li></ul><p>The chosen matrix A(opt) corresponds to a set of beliefs about the propositions X(<em>i</em>), and we can ascribe these beliefs to <strong>C</strong>. Because <em>f</em> predicts well, we again expect these beliefs to say something important about the world.</p><p>I chose this procedure <em>f</em> in part because we can give a kind of argument for why the matrix A(opt) should tend to encode accurate beliefs. But I don’t think that a universal reasoner can make use of that argument:</p><ul><li>Finding the argument that <em>f</em> works is an additional problem, beyond finding <em>f</em> itself, which might be much harder.</li><li>A comprehensible version of that argument may be much larger than the strategy itself, so even in the idealized cases like debate with perfect optimization, we may need to increase the scale.</li><li>I don’t expect that all “good” reasoning strategies have clean understandable arguments in their favor (and even in this case, if it the scheme worked well it would be largely an empirical fact rather than a consequence of the simple theorems we could prove). I think this kind of example is useful because we can easily imagine a human debate judge not having the argument while still being apparently universal. This makes it a useful analogy for cases where the argument really doesn’t exist.</li></ul><p>Instead, I think a universal reasoner needs to be able to infer the efficacy of this reasoning procedure from its empirical success. It’s relatively easy for a Bayesian to learn the regularity “<em>f</em> makes good predictions.” Recovering the rest of the matrix A, and learning how to interpret and whether to trust them, is the hard part.</p><p>This is going to require the same kind of bridging/identification we discussed in the last section. Let’s write X(A) for the set of beliefs about the world implied by the “intended” identification. Searching over possible identifications to find X (or something like it) is the only way we can ever relate the rows of A to the quantities X(<em>i</em>). Again, we can hope that it isn’t much harder than finding the original reasoning procedure.</p><p>I think that a sufficiently sophisticated Bayesian would probably be able to learn to trust X(A):</p><ul><li>If <em>f</em> is performing well enough that we think it’s more likely to be right in the future, then the Bayesian is going to end believing some claim like “the predictions of <em>f</em> are good” (since it explains the data so well).</li><li>This is a complicated statement, and without some kind of explanation this claim has a low prior probability (roughly decaying with the complexity of <em>f)</em>. The Bayesian is motivated to find an explanation with higher prior probability.</li><li>The correspondence X can explain the constraints on the matrix A, in terms of facts that we already know about the world. This explanation may end up being simpler (or at least higher prior) than a direct enumeration of the constraints on A — I hope (and think it’s plausible) that this happens iff we’d actually believe on reflection that X(A) captures reality.<br/>(To the extent that we are uncertain and think A’s beliefs have a non-negligible chance of capturing reality, then hopefully we can capture that by the same mechanism by ending up with a non-degenerate posterior.)</li><li>Now the Bayesian is faced with at least two kinds of explanations:<br/>(a) “If you use the constraints implied by correspondence X(A) + positive semidefiniteness, and then optimize log det, you get a matrix A for which X(A) makes good predictions,”<br/>(b) “The actual situation in the real world is described by positive semi-definite matrices with higher log determinant (under the correspondence X).”</li><li>Explanation (b) is explaining two things at once: both why the optimization done by <em>f</em> respects the constraints on our beliefs, and why that optimization leads to good predictions. Hopefully this is simpler than making two separate bridging claims, one which explains <em>f</em> as respecting the constraints implied by X, and one which claims that <em>f</em> makes good predictions. Ideally, this 2-for-1 that favors (b) exactly mirrors the underlying reasoning that leads us to actually believe that X(A) is correct, rather than resembling what we know about reality and making good predictions “by coincidence.”</li></ul><p>This is a pretty speculative discussion — it’s not very careful, and it’s hard to make it careful in part because I don’t have a formalization of Bayesian reasoning that can even really be applied to this setting. But it seems to match my intuitions about what reasonable Bayesian reasoning “should” do, which gives me a lot more optimism that a careful Bayesian would be able to epistemically dominate <strong>C</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Deliberation and self-improvement</strong></h2><p>Often we expect the computation <strong>C</strong> to have accurate beliefs because it uses a strategy that appears to work in practice — the last 3 examples have discussed that case. But there are other reasons to trust a computation.</p><p>For example, humans often write code and trust it (to some extent) even without extensive empirical testing — instead, we have a reason to think it will work, and need only modest testing to make sure that we haven’t made an error in our implementation or reasoning. If I write an automated mathematician that works by finding proofs that pass a proof checker, I don’t expect it to be correct because of the empirical record (Empirical data backs up some key assumptions, but isn’t being used to directly establishing the correctness of the method.)</p><p>Likewise, if we train a powerful agent, that agent might initially use strategies that work well in training, but over time it might use learned reasoning to identify other promising strategies and use those. Reasoning might allow it to totally skip empirical testing, or to adopt the method after much less testing than would have been necessary without the reasoning.</p><p>To dominate the beliefs produced by such reasoning, we can’t directly appeal to the kind of statistical inference made in the previous section. But in these cases I think we have access to an even more direct strategy.</p><p>Concretely, consider the situation where <strong>C</strong> contains a process <em>f</em> that designs a new reasoning process <em>g</em>. Then:</p><ul><li>From the outside, we trust <em>g</em> because we trust <em>f</em> and it trusts <em>g.</em></li><li>An otherwise-universal reasoner <strong>A</strong> will dominate <em>f</em>’s beliefs, and in particular if <em>f</em> is justified in thinking that <em>g</em> will work then <strong>A</strong> will believe that and understand why.</li><li>Once we understand <em>f’</em>s beliefs, dominating <em>g</em> is essentially another instance of the original ascription universality problem, but now from a slightly stronger epistemic state that involves both what 𝔼 knows and what <em>f</em> knows. So unless our original approach to universality was tightly wedded to details of 𝔼, we can probably dominate <em>g</em>.</li></ul><p>At the end of the day we’d like to put all of this together into a tight argument for universality, which will need to incorporate both statistical arguments and this kind of dynamic. But I’m tentatively optimistic about achieving universality in light of the prospect of agents designing new agents, and am much more worried about the kind of opaque computations that “just work” described in the last few sections.</p>",

My claimed contribution is merely collecting these things together. I will link to my own writing on each topic in large part because that’s what I know.)</p><h1>I. Research directions</h1><h2>1. Reliability and robustness</h2><p>Traditional ML algorithms optimize a model or policy to perform well on the training distribution. These models can behave arbitrarily badly when we move away from the training distribution. Similarly, they can behave arbitrarily badly on a small part of the training distribution.</p><p>I think this is bad news:</p><ul><li>Deploying ML systems will critically change their environment, in a way that is hard or impossible to simulate at training time. (The “treacherous turn” is a special case of this phenomenon.)</li><li>Deployed ML systems are interconnected and exposed to the same world.

At training time, attempt to construct inputs that induce problematic behavior and train on those. Eventually, we hope there will be no catastrophe-inducing inputs left. We don’t yet know what is possible to achieve. (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6199v4.pdf\">Szegedy 2014</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572v3.pdf\">Goodfellow 2015</a>)</li><li><strong>Ensembling and consensus</strong>. We often have confidence that there exists <em>some</em> models which will generalize appropriately. If we can verify that many models agree about an answer, we can be confident that the consensus is correct. If we use this technique, we will often need to abstain on unfamiliar inputs, and in order to remain competitive we will probably need to represent the ensemble implicitly.

If we understood enough about the structure of our model (for example if it reflected the structure of the underlying data-generating process), we might be confident that it will generalize correctly. Very few researchers are aiming for a secure / competitive / scalable solution along these lines, and finding one seems almost (but not completely) hopeless to me. This is MIRI’s approach.</li></ul><p>Usual caveats apply: these approaches may need to be used in combination; we are likely to uncover completely different approaches in the future; and I’m probably overlooking important existing approaches.</p><p>I think this problem is pretty well-understood and well-recognized, but it looks really hard. ML researchers mostly focus on improving performance rather than robustness, and so I think that this area remains neglected despite the problem being well-recognized.</p><p>(Previous posts on this blog: <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/red-teams-b5b6de33dc76#.w2nsces19\">red teams</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/learning-with-catastrophes-59387b55cc30#.a590k1j0p\">learning with catastrophes</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/some-thoughts-on-training-highly-reliable-models-2c78c17e266d#.pbtkz0czs\">thoughts on training highly reliable models</a></em>)</p><h2>2.

But they still face many challenges, and are not yet competitive, scalable, <em>or</em> secure:</p><ul><li>IRL requires a prior over preferences and a model of how human behavior relates to human preferences. Current implementations either only work in severely restricted environments, or use simple models of human rationality which cause the learner to attempt to very precisely imitate the human’s behavior (which might be challenging or impossible).</li><li>For similar reasons, existing IRL implementations are not able to learn from other data like human utterances or off-policy behavior, even though these constitute the largest and richest source of data about human preferences.</li><li>Human feedback requires accurately eliciting human preferences, which introduces many complications. (I discuss a few easy problems <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/thoughts-on-reward-engineering-82b193ec03f6#.6n2d4co3i\">here</a>.)</li><li>Human feedback is expensive and so we will need to be able to learn from a relatively small amount of labeled data. Demonstrations are also expensive and so may end up being a bottleneck for approaches based on IRL though it’s not as clear.</li><li>Both imitation learning and human feedback may fail when evaluating a behavior requires understanding where the behavior came from. For example, if you ask a human to evaluate a painting they may not be able to easily check whether it is derivative, even if over the long run they would prefer their AI to paint novel paintings.</li></ul><p>(I’ve described these approaches in the context of “human” behavior, but the expert providing feedback/demonstrations might themselves be a human augmented with AI assistance, and eventually may simply be an AI system that is aligned with human interests.)</p><p>This problem has not received much attention in the past, but it seems to be rapidly growing in popularity, which is great. I’m currently working on a project in this area.</p><p>(<em>Previous posts on this blog:</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/the-reward-engineering-problem-30285c779450#.f1ihhss6w\">the reward engineering problem</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/ambitious-vs-narrow-value-learning-99bd0c59847e#.s33f26ht5\">ambitious vs. narrow value learning</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/against-mimicry-6002a472fc42#.chg6xlqve\">against mimicry</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/thoughts-on-reward-engineering-82b193ec03f6#.iim1wpt9a\">thoughts on reward engineering</a>.</em>)</p><h2>3. Deliberation and amplification</h2><p>Machine learning is usually applied to tasks where feedback is readily available. The research problem in the previous section aims to obtain quick feedback in general by using human judgments as the “gold standard.” But this approach breaks down if we want to exceed human performance.</p><p>For example, it is easy to see how we could use machine learning to train ML systems to make human-level judgments about urban planning, by training them to produce plans that sound good to humans. But if we want to train an ML system to make superhuman judgments about how to lay out a city, it’s completely unclear how we could do it — without spending billions of dollars trying out the system’s ideas and telling it which ones work.</p><p>This is a problem for the same reasons discussed in the preceding section. If our society is driven by systems superhumanly optimizing short-term proxies for what we care about — such as how much they impress humans, or how much money they make—then we are liable to head off in a direction which does not reflect our values or leave us in meaningful control of the situation.</p><p>If we lowered our ambitions and decide that superhuman performance is inherently unsafe, we would be leaving huge amounts of value on the table. Moreover, this would be an unstable situation: it could last only as long as everyone with access to AI coordinated to pull their punches and handicap their AI systems.</p><p>I’m aware of two approaches to this problem that seem like they could scale:</p><ul><li><strong>IRL [hard mode]</strong>. In principle we can use IRL to recover a representation of human preferences, and then apply superhuman intelligence to satisfy those preferences much better than a human could. However, this is a much more ambitious and challenging form of IRL than is usually discussed, which <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/the-easy-goal-inference-problem-is-still-hard-fad030e0a876\">remains quite challenging</a> even when you set aside all of the usual algorithmic and statistical difficulties. (Jacob Steinhardt and Owain Evans discuss this issue in <a href=\"https://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/model-mis-specification-and-inverse-reinforcement-learning/\">a recent post</a>.)</li><li><strong>Iterated amplification</strong>. A group of interacting humans can potentially be smarter than a single human, and a group of AI systems could be smarter than the original AI system. By using these groups as “experts” in place of individual humans, we could potentially train much smarter systems. The key questions are how to perform this composition in a way that causes the group to implement the same preferences as its members, and whether the cognitive benefits for groups are large enough to overcome the overhead of coordination. (I discuss this approach <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34#.ampcyxi9r\">here</a> and in follow-up work.)</li><li><strong>IRL for cognition</strong>. Rather than applying IRL to a humans’ actions, we could apply it to the cognitive actions taken by a human while they deliberate about a subject. We can then use those values to execute a longer deliberation process, asking “what would the human do if they had more time to think / more powerful cognitive tools?” I think this approach ends up being similar to a blend of the previous two.</li></ul><p>It’s completely unclear how hard this problem is or how far we are from a solution. It is a much less common research topic than either of the preceding points.</p><p>In the short term, I think it might be easier to study analogs of this problem in the context of human behavior than to attempt to directly study it in the context of AI systems.</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.ought.com/\">Ought</a> is a non-profit aimed at addressing (roughly) this problem; I think it is reasonably likely to make significant progress.</p><p>(<em>Previous posts on this blog:</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34\">capability amplification</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/reliability-amplification-a96efa115687\">reliability amplification</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/security-amplification-f4931419f903\">security amplification</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/meta-execution-27ba9b34d377\">meta-execution</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/the-easy-goal-inference-problem-is-still-hard-fad030e0a876\">the easy goal inference problem is still hard</a></em>)</p><h1>II. Desiderata</h1><p>I’m most interested in algorithms that are secure, competitive, and scalable, and I think that most research programs are very unlikely to deliver these desiderata (this is why the lists above are so short).</p><p>Since these desiderata are doing a lot of work in narrowing down the space of possible research directions, it seems worthwhile to be thoughtful and clear about them. It would be easy to gloss over any of them as obviously unobjectionable, but I would be more interested in people pushing back on the strong forms than implicitly accepting a milder form.</p><h2>1. Secure</h2><p>Many pieces of software work “well enough” most of the time; we often learn this not by a deep analysis but by just trying it and seeing what happens. “Works well enough” often breaks down when an adversary enters the prediction.</p><p>Whether or not that’s a good way to build AI, I think it’s a bad way to do alignment research right now.</p><p>Instead, we should try to come up with alignment solutions that work in the least convenient world, when nature itself is behaving adversarially. Accomplishing this requires argument and analysis, and cannot be exclusively or based on empirical observation.</p><p>AI systems obviously won’t work well in the worst case (there is no such thing as a free lunch) but it’s reasonable to hope that our AI systems will never respond to a bad input by actively <em>trying</em> to hurt us —at least as long as we remain in physical control of the computing hardware, and the training process, <em>etc.</em></p><p>Why does security seem important?</p><ul><li>It’s really hard to anticipate what is going to happen in the future. I think it’s easy to peer into the mists and say “well, hard to know what’s going to happen, but this solution might work out OK,” and then to turn out to be too optimistic. It’s harder to make this error when we hold ourselves to a higher standard, of actually giving an argument for why things work. I think that this is a general principle for doing useful research in advance of when it is needed — we should hold ourselves to standards that are unambiguous and clear even when the future is murky. This is a theme that will recur in the coming sections.</li><li>We are used to technological progress proceeding slowly compared to timescales of human judgment and planning. It seems quite likely that powerful AI will be developed during or after a period of acceleration, challenging those assumptions and undermining a traditional iterative approach to development.</li><li>The world really does contain adversaries. It’s one thing to build insecure software when machines have power over modest amounts of money with significant human oversight, it’s another thing altogether when they have primary responsibility for enforcing the law. I’m not even particularly worried about human attackers, I’m mostly worried about a future where all it takes to launch attacks is money (which can itself be earned by executing attacks). Moreover, if the underlying ML is insecure and ML plays a role in almost all software, we are going to have a hard time writing any secure software at all.</li></ul><p>(<em>Previous posts:</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/security-and-ai-control-675ace05ce31\">security and AI alignment</a></em>)</p><h2>2. Competitive</h2><p>It’s easy to avoid building an unsafe AI system (for example: build a spreadsheet instead). The only question is how much you have to sacrifice to do it.</p><p>Ideally we’ll be able to build benign AI systems that are just as efficient and capable as the best AI that we could build by any means. That means: we don’t have to additional domain-specific engineering work to align our systems, benign AI doesn’t require too much more data or computation, and our alignment techniques don’t force us to use particular techniques or restrict our choices in other ways.</p><p>(More precisely, I would consider an alignment strategy a success if the additional costs are sublinear: if the fraction of resources that need to be spent on alignment research and run-time overhead <em>decreases</em> as the AI systems become more powerful, converging towards 0.)</p><p>Why is competitiveness important?</p><p><strong>A. It’s easy to tell when a solution is plausibly competitive, but very hard to tell exactly how uncompetitive an uncompetitive solution will be.</strong> For example, if a purported alignment strategy requires an AI not to use technique or development strategy X, it’s easy to tell that this proposal isn’t competitive in general, but very hard to know exactly how uncompetitive it is.</p><p>As in the security case, it seems very easy to look into the fog of the future and say “well this seems like it will probably be OK” and then to turn out to be too optimistic. If we hold ourselves to the higher standard of competitiveness, it is much easier to stay honest.</p><p>Relatedly, we want alignment solutions that work across an extremely large range of techniques not just because we are uncertain about which techniques will be important, but because generalizing across all of the situations we can foresee is a good predictor of working for situations we can’t foresee.</p><p><strong>B. You can’t unilaterally use uncompetitive alignment techniques; we would need global coordination to avoid trouble.</strong> If we <em>don’t</em> know how to build competitive benign AI, then users/designers of AI systems have to compromise efficiency in order to maintain reliable control over those systems. The most efficient systems will by default be built by whoever is willing to accept the largest risk of catastrophe (or perhaps by actors who consider unaligned AI a desirable outcome).</p><p>It may be possible to avert this kind of race to the bottom by effective coordination by e.g. enforcing regulations which mandate adequate investments in alignment or restrict what kinds of AI are deployed. Enforcing such controls domestically is already a huge headache. But internationally things are even worse: a country that handicapped its AI industry in order to proceed cautiously would face the risk of being overtaken by a less prudent competitor, and avoiding <em>that</em> race would require effective international coordination.</p><p>Ultimately society will be able and willing to pay <em>some</em> efficiency cost to reliably align AI with human interests. But the higher that cost, the harder the coordination problem that we will need to solve. I think the research community should be trying to make that coordination problem as easy as possible.</p><p>(<em>Previous posts:</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/prosaic-ai-control-b959644d79c2\">prosaic AI alignment</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/a-possible-stance-for-ai-control-research-fe9cf717fc1b\">a possible stance for AI control</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/efficient-and-safely-scalable-8218fa8a871f#.m7z8qccef\">efficient and safely scalable</a></em>)</p><h2>3. Scalable</h2><p>Over time, we are acquiring more data, more powerful computers, richer model classes, better optimization algorithms, better exploration strategies, and so on. If we extrapolate these trends, we end up with very powerful models and policies.</p><p>Many approaches to alignment break down at some point in this extrapolation. For example, if we train an RL agent with a reward function which imperfectly approximates what we want, it is likely to fail once the agent becomes sufficiently sophisticated — unless the reward function itself becomes more sophisticated in parallel.</p><p>In contrast, let’s say that a technique is “scalable” if it continues to work just as well even when the underlying learning becomes much more powerful. (See also: Eliezer’s more colorful “<a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/omni_test/\">omnipotence test</a>.”)</p><p>This is another extremely demanding requirement. It rules out many possible approaches to alignment. For example, it probably rules out any approach that involves hand-engineering reward functions. More subtly, I expect it will rule out any approach that requires hand-engineering an informative prior over human values (though some day we will hopefully find a scalable approach to IRL).</p><p>Why is scalability important?</p><ul><li>As in the previous sections, it’s easy to be too optimistic about exactly when a non-scalable alignment scheme will break down. It’s much easier to keep ourselves honest if we actually hold ourselves to producing scalable systems.</li><li>If AI progress rapidly, and especially if AI research is substantially automated, then we may literally confront the situation where the capabilities of our AI systems are changing rapidly. It would be desirable to have alignment schemes that continued to work in this case.</li><li>If we don’t have scalable solutions then we require a continuing investment of research on alignment in order to “keep up” with improvements in the underlying learning. This risks compromising competitiveness, forcing AI developers to make a hard tradeoff between alignment and capabilities. This would be acceptable if the ongoing investments in alignment are modest compared to the investments in capabilities. But as with the last point, that’s a very murky question about which it seems easy to be overly optimistic in advance. If we think the problem will be easy in the future when we have more computing, then we ought to be able to do it now. Or at the very least we ought to be able to explain how more computing will make it easy. If we make such an explanation sufficiently precise then it will itself become a scalable alignment proposal (though perhaps one that involves ongoing human effort).</li></ul><p>(<em>Previous posts:</em> <em><a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/scalable-ai-control-7db2436feee7#.tljxalxgv\">scalable AI control</a></em>)</p><h2>Aside: feasibility</h2><p>One might reject these desiderata because they seem too demanding: it would be great if we had a secure, competitive and scalable approach to alignment, but that might not be possible.</p><p>I am interested in trying to satisfy these desiderata despite the fact that they are quite demanding, for two reasons:</p><ul><li>I think that it is very hard to say in advance what is possible or impossible. I don’t yet see any fundamental obstructions to achieving these goals, and until I see hard obstructions I think there is a significant probability that the problem will prove to be feasible (or “almost possible,” in the sense that we may need to weaken these goals only slightly).</li><li>If there is some fundamental obstruction to achieving these goals, then it would be good to understand that obstruction in detail. Understanding it would help us understand the nature of the problem we face and would allow us to do better research on alignment (by focusing on the key aspects of the problem). And knowing that these problems are impossible, and understanding exactly how impossible they are, helps us prepare for the future, to build institutions and mechanisms that will be needed to cope with unavoidable limitations of our AI alignment strategies.</li></ul><h1>III. Conclusion</h1><p>I think there is a lot of research to be done on AI alignment; we are limited by a lack of time and labor rather than by a lack of ideas about how to make progress.</p><p>Research relevant to alignment is already underway; researchers and funders interested in alignment can get a lot of mileage by supporting and fleshing out existing research programs in relevant directions. I don’t think it is correct to assume that if anyone is working on a problem then it is going to get solved — even amongst things that aren’t literally at the “no one else is doing it” level, there are varying degrees of neglect.</p><p>At the same time, the goals of alignment are sufficiently unusual that we shouldn’t be surprised or concerned to find ourselves doing unusual research. I think that area #3 on deliberation and amplification is almost completely empty, and will probably remain pretty empty until we have clearer statements of the problem or convincing demonstrations of work in that area.</p><p>I think the distinguishing feature of research motivated by AI alignment should be an emphasis on secure, competitive, and scalable solutions. I think these are very demanding requirements that significantly narrow down the space of possible approaches and which are rarely explicitly considered in the current AI community.</p><p>It may turn out that these requirements are infeasible; if so, one key output of alignment research will be a better understanding of the key obstacles. This understanding can help guide less ambitious alignment research, and can help us prepare for a future in which we won’t have a completely satisfying solution to AI alignment.</p><p>This post has mostly focused on research that would translate directly into concrete systems. I think there is also a need for theoretical research building better abstractions for reasoning about optimization, security, selection, consequentialism, and so on. It is plausible to me that we will produce acceptable systems with our current conceptual machinery, but if we want to convincingly <em>analyze</em> those systems then I think we will need significant conceptual progress (and better concepts may lead us to different approaches). I think that practical and theoretical research will be attractive to different researchers, and I don’t have strong views about their relative value.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>This was originally posted <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/directions-and-desiderata-for-ai-control-b60fca0da8f4\">here</a></em> <em>on 6th February 2017.</em></p><p><em>Tomorrow&#x27;s AI Alignment Forum sequences post will be &#x27;Human-AI Interaction&#x27; by Rohin Shah in the sequence on Value Learning.</em></p><p><em>The next post in this sequence will be &#x27;The reward engineering problem&#x27; by Paul Christiano, on Tuesday 15th Jan.</em></p>",

The answer turns out to be yes.</p><p>I&apos;m going to make this a short note rather than being very rigorous about the set of decision problems for which this works.</p><p><em>(This is an edited version of an email, and benefits from correspondence with Caspar Oesterheld, Gerard Roth, and Alex Appel. In particular, Caspar Oesterheld is working on similar ideas. My views on how to interpret the situation have changed since I originally wrote these words, but I&apos;ll save that for a future post.)</em></p><p>Suppose a CDT agent has causal expectations which differ from its evidential expectations, in a specific decision.</p><p>We can modify the decision by allowing an agent to bet on outcomes in the same act. Because the bet is made simultaneously with the decision, the CDT agent uses causal expected value, and will bet accordingly.</p><p>Then, immediately after (before any new observations come in), we offer a new bet about the outcome. The agent will now bet based on its evidential expectations, since the causal intervention has already been made.</p><p>For example, take a CDT agent in <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2017/03/18/new-paper-cheating-death-in-damascus/\">Death in Damascus</a>. A CDT agent will take each action with 50% probability, and its causal expectations expect to escape death with 50% probability. We can expand the set of possible actions from (stay, run) to (stay, run, stay and make side bet, run and make side bet). The side bet could cost 1 util and pay out 3 utils if the agent doesn&apos;t die. Then, immediately after taking the action but before anything else happens, we offer another deal: the agent can get .5 util in exchange for -3 util conditional on not dying. We offer the new bet regardless of whether the agent agrees to the first bet.</p><p>The CDT agent will happily make the bet, since the expected utility is calculated along with the intervention. Then, it will happily sell the bet back, because after taking its action, it sees no chance of the 3 util payout.</p><p>The CDT agent makes the initial bet even though it knows it will later reverse the transaction at a cost to itself, because we offer the second transaction whether the agent agrees to the first or not. So, from the perspective of the initial decision, taking the bet is still +.5 expected utils. If it could stop itself from later taking the reverse bet, that would be even better, but we suppose that it can&apos;t.</p><p>I conclude from this that CDT should equal EDT (hence, causality must account for logical correlations, IE include logical causality). By &quot;CDT&quot; I really mean any approach at all to counterfactual reasoning; counterfactual expectations should equal evidential expectations.</p><p>As with most of my CDT=EDT arguments, this only provides an argument that the expectations should be equal for actions taken with nonzero probability. In fact, the amount lost to Dutch Book will be proportional to the probability of the action in question. So, differing counterfactual and evidential expectations are smoothly more and more tenable as actions become less and less probable. Actions with very low probability will imply negligible monetary loss. Still, in terms of classical Dutch-Book-ability, CDT is Dutch-Bookable.</p><p>Both CDT and EDT have dynamic inconsistencies, but only CDT may be Dutch-booked in this way. I&apos;m not sure how persuasive this should be as an argument -- how special a status should Dutch-book arguments have?</p><p><em>ETA: The formalization of this is now a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/TJT2oBMGaZTE7f2z2/when-is-cdt-dutch-bookable\">question</a>.</em></p>",

I disagree with enough of Sullivan's premises that I have\nsignificant disagreements with her conclusions. Yet her reasoning is\nusually good enough that I'm unsure what to make of our disagreements -\nthey're typically due to differences of intuition that she admits are\ncontroversial.</p>\n<p>I had hoped for some discussion of ethics (e.g. what discount rate to\nuse in evaluating climate change), whereas the book focuses purely on\nprudential rationality (i.e. what's rational for a self-interested\nperson). Still, the discussion of prudential rationality covers most of\nthe issues that make the ethical choices hard.</p>\n<h3>Personal identity</h3>\n<p>A key issue is the nature of personal identity - does one's identity\nchange over time?</p>\n<p>Sullivan starts this discussion by comparing a single-agent model to a\nmodel with multiple distinct stages.</p>\n<p>I initially found that part of the book confusing, as neither model\nseems close to mine, and she seemed to present them as the only possible\nmodels. Then somewhat later on in the book, I figured out that both\nthose models assumed that identity needed to stay constant for some\ntime, and that in the case of the multiple stage model, the change in\nidentity was discontinuous.</p>\n<p>Sullivan prefers that kind of single-agent model, and therefore\nconcludes that we should adopt a time-neutral stance (i.e. she rejects\nany time-discounting, and expects us to care as much about our distant\nfuture selves as we care about our present selves).</p>\n<p>Sullivan eventually compares that single-agent model to some models in\nwhich a current self partially identifies with a future self, which\nwould allow for time-discounting of how much we care about a self.</p>\n<p>The most interesting of those models involves some notion of\nconnectedness between current and future selves.</p>\n<p>This feels like the obviously right approach to me. I expect it to work\nsomething like the \"me\" of a decade ago or a decade in the future being\nsomething I consider to be maybe 75% \"me\". I.e. I practice\ntime-discounting, but with a low enough discount rate that it might be\nhard to distinguish from no discounting in many contexts.</p>\n<p>Sullivan looks at some possible measures of connectedness, and convinces\nme that they don't explain normal attitudes toward our future selves.</p>\n<p>I suggest that she's too quick to give up on her search for\nconnectedness measures. I think the things which cause me to care about\nmy future self more resemble what causes me to feel connected to\nfriends, so it should include something like the extent to which we\nexpect to interact. That includes some measures of how much my present\nself interacts with my future self. I don't have anything resembling a\ncomplete model of how such connectedness would work, but I'm fairly\nconfident that people do use some sort of connectedness model for\ndeciding how much to identify with future selves.</p>\n<p>Sullivan argues that concern-based discounting of future selves would\nrequire changes in how we evaluate our age (e.g. if my two-year-old self\nwasn't connected enough with my current self, then there's something\nwrong with starting at birth to count my age). I agree that it implies\nthere's something imperfect about standard answers to \"how old am I?\",\nbut it seem perfectly reasonable to say we want easily checkable answers\nto how old we are, even if that discards some relevant information.\n(\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong#Quotations_of_George_Box\">All models are wrong, but some are\nuseful</a>\").</p>\n<p>If Sullivan can misunderstand our models of how old we are, then it's\neasy to imagine that she's made a similar mistake with how much we\nshould care about existence over time - i.e. Sullivan sees that it's\nuseful to treat people as time-neutral for the purpose of, say, signing\ncontracts; whereas for other purposes (e.g. do people save enough for\nretirement?), I see people caring less about their future selves. It\nseems likely that time-neutrality is a good enough approximation for\nmost of our activities, which rarely require looking more than a decade\ninto the future. Yet that doesn't say much about how to model\nsubstantially longer time periods.</p>\n<p>It's more common for people to discount the future too much than too\nlittle, so it's often wise to encourage the use of models with less\ndiscounting. That creates some temptation to go all the way to zero\ndiscounting, and doing so may be a good heuristic in some cases. But it\nproduces weird results that I mention below.</p>\n<h3>Caring about the past</h3>\n<p>Sullivan devotes a substantial part of the book to arguing that it's\nmeaningful to have preferences about the past, and that rationality\nprevents us from discounting the past.</p>\n<p>An example: people who sue in response to an accident that caused them\npain will ask for more compensation if asked when they're in pain than\nif they're asked when the pain is in the past.</p>\n<p>Sullivan provides other examples in the form of weird thought\nexperiments about painful surgery followed by amnesia, where I might be\nleft uncertain about whether the pain is in my past or my future.</p>\n<p>No one example seems convincing by itself, but there seems to be a real\npattern of something suspicious happening.</p>\n<p>Sullivan convinced me that preferences about the past mean something,\nand that there's something suspicious about discounting the past -\nunless it follows the same discounting rules as apply to the future.</p>\n<p>But I don't find it helpful to frame problems in terms of preferences\nabout the past. <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Timeless_decision_theory\">Timeless decision\ntheory</a> (TDT)\nseems to provide a more natural and comprehensive solution to these\nkinds of problems, and assumes time-neutrality, or a discount rate\nthat's low enough to approximate time-neutrality over the relevant time\nperiods. (I'm unsure whether TDT is understood much beyond the rather\nspecialized community that cares about it).</p>\n<p>Sullivan's approach seems to leave her puzzled about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavka%27s_toxin_puzzle\">Kavka's toxin\npuzzle</a>. It seems\nthat something in her premises implies that we can't become the kind of\nperson who follows TDT (i.e. follows through on a commitment to drink\nthe poison), but I haven't quite pinned down what premise(s) lead her\nthere, and it seems to leave her in a position that looks time-biased.\nSpecifically, she seems to imply that there's something irrational about\nmaking a time-neutral decision to drink the poison. Yet in other parts\nof the book, she says that our decisions shouldn't depend on what time\nwe happen to find ourselves located at, assuming all other evidence\navailable to us remains the same.</p>\n<p>Sullivan is careful to distinguish care for the past from the sunk cost\nfallacy. One relevant question is: did I get new info which would have\naltered my prior self's decision? Another approach is to imagine what an\nimpartial observer would say - that helps make it irrelevant whether an\nevent is in my past or my future. I probably missed some important\nnuance that Sullivan describes, but those seem like the important\ndistinctions to make.</p>\n<h3>Afterlives</h3>\n<p>How should we think about really long lifespans?</p>\n<p>Sullivan uses a strange (but harmless?) concept of afterlife, which\nincludes any time experienced after an \"irreversible radical change\",\ne.g. heaven, dementia, or quadriplegia.</p>\n<p>A key claim (which I'll abbreviate as SALE) is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Simple Approach for Life Extension:</strong> it is rationally\npermissible (and perhaps rationally obligatory) to prefer some\npotential future state of affairs A over some potential future state\nof affairs B if A has greater aggregate expected well-being than B.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I reject the obligatory version of this claim, because I discount future\nwell-being. If I adopted the time-neutrality that Sullivan endorses, I'd\nendorse the obligatory version of SALE.</p>\n<p>Sullivan is uncomfortable with SALE, because it leads to the \"single\nlife repugnant conclusion\". I.e. that a sufficiently long life of\nslightly positive well-being is better than a short life with more\nwell-being. She doesn't describe a good reason for a time-neutral person\nto find this repugnant, so I'm inclined to guess that she (and most\npeople) find it repugnant due to a (possibly unconscious) preference for\ntime discounting.</p>\n<p>My reluctance to endorse the single life repugnant conclusion seems to\nbe purely a function of my caring more about near-future versions of\nmyself than about distant-future versions.</p>\n<p>Sullivan doesn't seem to identify anything repugnant about the\nconclusion beyond the fact that it feels wrong. So I'm left guessing\nthat her intuitions of repugnance result from intuitions that distant\nfuture selves are less important.</p>\n<p>She can, of course, believe that those intuitions are irrational, and\nthat she's trying to overcome them. But then why doesn't she also try to\novercome the feelings of repugnance about the single life repugnant\nconclusion?</p>\n<p>Sullivan describes another version of SALE's consequences, asking us to\nimagine that hell has enough breaks in the torture that it yields an\naverage positive balance of well-being, for eternity. It looks to me\nlike she's trying to prejudice our intuitions with words that suggest a\nlife that's worse than non-existence, and then contradicting that\nimpression when she gets more specific. I don't see what the substance\nof her objection is here.</p>\n<p>It seems my main disagreement with Sullivan boils down to the choice\nbetween:</p>\n<p>A) agreeing that we will care less about distant future versions of\nourselves than near future versions (i.e. accept something like\ntime-discounting),</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>B) running into repeated conflicts between our intuitions and our logic\nwhen making decisions about time-distant versions of our selves.</p>\n<p>Either choice appears to produce ordinary results when dealing with\nrelatively familiar time periods, and strange results when applied to\nunusually long time periods. Choice A seems a bit simpler and clearer.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The book is mostly clear and well-reasoned, with a few important\nexceptions that I've noted, and those exceptions are about topics that\nseem to confuse most philosophers who tackle them.</p>\n<p>I expect that many people will learn something important from the book,\nbut it caused me to mostly just reinforce my existing beliefs.</p>\n</body></html>",

It was written to fit the bill of &#x27;concrete visions of the future.&#x27; There is one small change here from the version I gave : the Solstice organizers had me change the second-to-last sentence of the speech, because the event centered around the idea of disasters that fall short of extinction, and rebuilding from the ashes. I&#x27;ve changed it back to be more true to what I think Solstice is about - the complete and irrecoverable disaster looming on the horizon, and the reality of our desperate efforts to avoid it.</em></p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>There are lots of people on the Internet and on TV every day telling you how the world is going to dissolve into chaos at any moment. When you think about all the people and animals needlessly suffering, it’s easy to think that the world is terrible. When you read the news, or look at the current state of the art in preparedness for global catastrophic risks, it’s easy to think that the world is doomed, and feel hopeless. But that’s why we’re here. We are here – in this community and in this planetarium – because we believe that there is a future worth fighting for. </p><p>What does that future look like? That’s hard to say. You know how sometimes, when you look directly at a star in the night sky, it fades so that you can barely see it, but when you look a little to the side it’s bright again? That’s sort of how I feel about imagining the future. It’s slippery, hard to get a grasp on, sort of just out of reach. But for now, let’s try to picture it.</p><p>Imagine the world a few hundred years from now. Humanity has completed a process of great deliberation. We’ve overcome global coordination problems, so there’s no more poverty and no more war, and existential risks have shrunk to a millionth of a millionth of their current size. We have overcome physics and engineering challenges and have ships on their way to the distant reaches of the galaxy. We have overcome our biological limitations and no longer die so easily of disease or accident or old age.</p><p>If we sit with that, it still feels abstract, and far away. So try to imagine yourself in that future, even if how we imagine it today will never be how it really is.</p><p>Maybe you’re with your family on a spaceship, off to colonize the edge of the galaxy. Your faces are pressed to the window as you watch the Earth grow small against the blackness. Though you’re leaving this planet behind, probes have been sent out to terraform the barren rocks that lie ahead, and they’ll be lush with life when you arrive. When the pale blue dot has faded to nothing in the distance, you turn away from the window and get to work preparing for the long journey ahead. Your children call up to you and you answer with confidence. You’re in this together. You believe you will make it to your destination. You are not afraid.</p><p>Or maybe you’re there on the day the last factory farm closes. Advances in lab-grown meat and our understanding of nutrition have obviated the need for such cruelty, and our new ethical standards would never allow it. You watch the animals stumble, confused, into the daylight. It’s too late for most of them, but at least they are the last. Humanity will never again commit torture like this.</p><p>Or maybe you work for the government, which is now a legible institution whose mission feels like your mission. Every day you go to work and uphold a system of laws that you believe in, and every night you return home to your children, who are educated in a system that actually lets them learn, while keeping their spirits bright and alive. Around the dinner table at night, they debate with you about the ethics of terraforming, tell you the history of the great deliberation, and explain to you concepts in physics that you could never quite grasp. Your bodies are warm, your stomachs are full, and your minds are active. You’re free to pursue whatever you wish, without the constant nagging guilt that you could be doing more to help others and prevent extinction, because that’s all been taken care of.</p><p>The path ahead is full of obstacles. We don’t yet have the technology to build space colonies or cheat old age, nor have we figured out what incentives will end war, poverty, or factory farming for good. No matter how hard we work, there’s always a chance we won’t make it to tomorrow. But humanity has proved time and again that we can overcome forces of nature once thought to be unstoppable, so no matter how slim the odds, there’s also a chance that we’ll survive. And if we do, we should hold onto those images of how good the future could be. </p><p>By and large, the people here tonight are not religious. We know that we live in a world beyond the reach of God. If we are going to make it out of this, it will have to be by our own power. If the future is going to be as good as the stories I’ve told, we have to make it that way. We only have one chance. Let’s make tomorrow beautiful. </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>On <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/events/falling-apart-the-politics-of-new-start-and-strategic-modernization/\">a recent panel on nuclear modernization and arms control at Brookings</a>, there were a few points made about the potential synergies between arms control and modernization. <br />\n<br />\nWhile modernization and arms control seem contradictory, it really depends on what you are trying to do with each. For example, if you want to reduce the number of nuclear weapons the U.S. has in its stockpile, it may actually make sense to improve the ability of the U.S. to produce new weapons. Why would that be you might ask? It’s because current stockpiles are a <i>hedge</i>, a hedge to replace warheads that are too old and to buy time for a future ability to produce warheads again faster rates. Toward the end of the Bush administration, maintenance and production were so bad that officials were worried that nuclear testing would become necessary again to verify that weapons worked. <br />\n<br />\nStranger yet about this dynamic is that due to U.S. difficulties in production, one of the panelists argued Russia currently has an advantage at warhead production that may incent them to race with the U.S. in the short-run. What are the potential results of this? It may partially explain Russia’s pull-out of the INF treaty: Russian leadership may not have perceived much of a risk to pulling out given lack of current U.S. ability to keep up at warhead production, and a lack of public support in the U.S. for new weapons generally. With the development of new intermediate-range missiles, the Russians will be able to free up some of their longer range nuclear missiles to aim at the U.S. instead of closer targets. If New START isn’t extended in 2021, it doesn’t seem unimaginable that Russia may seek to gain negotiation advantage unconstrained by numbers limits, until the U.S. ramps up its production ability again.<br />\n</p>\n<p>While I am not sure I agree fully with the panel, an implication to be drawn from their arguments is that from an equilibrium of treaty compliance, maintaining the ability to race can disincentivize the other side from treaty violation: it increases the cost to the other side of gaining advantage, and that can be especially decisive if your side has an economic advantage. This just generally seems to be an instance of the idea that it is important to maintain leverage in negotiations.</p>\n<p>Speaking more broadly than just about nuclear weapons: a lack of technological development by a leading country is not sufficient to prevent an arms race. If a weaker power finds low hanging technological fruit, that it knows it can exploit due to the political constraints of its competitors, it may have strong incentive to pursue even risky capabilities since the gains in relative power may be large. If on the other hand, a technologically leading country can credibly signal that it would win an arms race or that gains would be minimal, then the incentive to pursue risky capabilities may be diminished. Modernization is how a country can credibly show that it has the will and ability to race. What a country actually decides to deploy is an independent choice.<br />\n</p>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n</div>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Over the last few months I’ve talked with Eric Drexler a number of times about his Comprehensive AI Services (CAIS) model of AI development, and read most of <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf\">his technical report</a> on the topic. I think these are important ideas which are well worth engaging with, despite personally being skeptical about many of the conclusions. Below I’ve summarised what I see as the core components of Eric’s view, followed by some of own arguments. Note that these are only my personal opinions. I did make some changes to the summary based on Eric’s comments on early drafts, to better reflect his position - however, there are likely still ways I’ve misrepresented him. Also note that this was written before reading <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as\">Rohin’s summary</a> of the same report, although I do broadly agree with most of Rohin’s points.</p><p>One useful piece of context for this model is Eric&#x27;s background in nanotechnology, and his advocacy for the development of nanotech as &quot;atomically precise manufacturing&quot; rather than self-replicating nanomachines. The relationship between these two frameworks has clear parallels with the relationship between CAIS and a recursively self-improving superintelligence.<br/></p><p>The CAIS model: </p><ol><li>The standard arguments in AI safety are concerned with the development of a single AGI agent doing open-ended optimisation. Before we build such an entity (if we do so at all), we will build AI services which each perform a bounded task with bounded resources, and which can be combined to achieve superhuman performance on a wide range of tasks. </li><li>AI services may or may not be “agents”. However, under CAIS there will be no entity optimising extremely hard towards its goals in the way that most AI safety researchers have been worrying about, because: </li><ol><li>Each service will be relatively specialised and myopic (focused on current episodic performance, not maximisation over the whole future). This is true of basically all current AI applications, e.g. image classifiers or Google Translate.</li><li>Although rational agents can be proved equivalent to utility-maximisers, the same is not necessarily true of systems of rational agents. Most such systems are fundamentally different in structure from rational agents - for example, individual agents within the system can compete with or criticise each other. And since AI services aren’t “rational agents” in the first place, a system composed of them is even less likely to implement a utility-maximiser. </li><li>There won&#x27;t be very much demand for unified AIs which autonomously carry out large-scale tasks requiring general capabilities, because systems of AI services will be able to perform those tasks just as well or better. </li></ol><li>Early AI services could do things like massively disrupt financial markets, increase the rate of scientific discovery, help run companies, etc. Eventually they should be able to do any task that humans can, at our level or higher. </li><ol><li>They could also be used to recursively improve AI technologies and to develop AI applications, but usually with humans in the loop - in roughly the same way that science allows us to build better tools with which to do better science. </li></ol><li>Our priorities in doing AI safety research can and should be informed by this model: </li><ol><li>A main role for technical AI safety researchers should be to look at the emergent properties of systems of AI services, e.g. which combinations of architectures, tasks and selection pressures could lead to risky behaviour, as well as the standard problems of specifying bounded tasks. </li><li>AI safety experts can also give ongoing advice and steer the development of AI services. AI safety researchers shouldn&#x27;t think of safety as a one-shot problem, but rather a series of ongoing adjustments. </li><li>AI services will make it much easier to prevent the development of unbounded agent-like AGI through methods like increasing coordination and enabling surveillance, if the political will can be mustered. </li></ol></ol><p>I&#x27;m broadly sympathetic to the empirical claim that we&#x27;ll develop AI services which can replace humans at most cognitively difficult jobs significantly before we develop any single superhuman AGI (one unified system that can do nearly all cognitive tasks as well as or better than any human). One plausible mechanism is that deep learning continues to succeed on tasks where there&#x27;s lots of training data, but doesn&#x27;t learn how to reason in general ways - e.g. it could learn from court documents how to imitate lawyers well enough to replace them in most cases, without being able to understand law in the way humans do. Self-driving cars are another pertinent example. If that pattern repeats across most human professions, we might see massive societal shifts well before AI becomes dangerous in the adversarial way that’s usually discussed in the context of AI safety.<br/></p><p>If I had to sum up my objections to Eric’s framework in one sentence, it would be: “the more powerful each service is, the harder it is to ensure it’s individually safe; the less powerful each service is, the harder it is to combine them in a way that’s competitive with unified agents.” I’ve laid out my arguments in more detail below.<br/></p><p>Richard’s view: <br/></p><ol><li>Open-ended agentlike AI seems like the most likely candidate for the first strongly superhuman AGI system. </li><ol><li>As a basic prior, our only example of general intelligence so far is ourselves - a species composed of agentlike individuals who pursue open-ended goals. So it makes sense to expect AGIs to be similar - especially if you believe that our progress in artificial intelligence is largely driven by semi-random search with lots of compute (like evolution was) rather than principled intelligent design. </li><ol><li>In particular, the way we trained on the world - both as a species and as individuals - was by interacting with it in a fairly unconstrained way. Many machine learning researchers believe that we’ll get superhuman AGI via a similar approach, by training RL agents in simulated worlds. Even if we then used such agents as “services”, they wouldn’t be bounded in the way predicted by CAIS. </li></ol><li>Many complex tasks don’t easily decompose into separable subtasks. For instance, while writing this post I had to keep my holistic impression of Eric’s ideas in mind most of the time. This impression was formed through having conversations and reading essays, but was updated frequently as I wrote this post, and also draws on a wide range of my background knowledge. I don’t see how CAIS would split the task of understanding a high-level idea between multiple services, or (if it were done by a single service) how that service would interact with an essay-writing service, or an AI-safety-research service. </li><ol><li>Note that this isn’t an argument against AGI being modular, but rather an argument that requiring the roles of each module and the ways they interface with each other to be human-specified or even just human-comprehensible will be very uncompetitive compared with learning them in an unconstrained way. Even on today’s relatively simple tasks, we already see end-to-end training outcompeting other approaches, and learned representations outperforming human-made representations. The basic reason is that we aren’t smart enough to understand how the best cognitive structures or representations work. Yet it’s key to CAIS that each service performs a specific known task, rather than just doing useful computation in general - otherwise we could consider each lobe of the human brain to be a “service”, and the combination of them to be unsafe in all the standard ways. </li><li>It’s not clear to me whether this is also an argument against IDA. I think that it probably is, but to a lesser extent, because IDA allows multiple layers of task decomposition which are incomprehensible to humans before bottoming out in subtasks which we can perform. </li></ol><li>Even if task decomposition can be solved, humans reuse most of the same cognitive faculties for most of the tasks that we can carry out. If many AI services end up requiring similar faculties to each other, it would likely be more efficient to unify them into a single entity. It would also be more efficient if that entity could pick up new tasks in the same rapid way that humans do, because then you wouldn’t need to keep retraining. At that point, it seems like you no longer have an AI service but rather the same sort of AGI that we’re usually worried about. (In other words, meta-learning is very important but doesn’t fit naturally into CAIS). </li><li>Humans think in terms of individuals with goals, and so even if there&#x27;s an equally good approach to AGI which doesn&#x27;t conceive of it as a single goal-directed agent, researchers will be biased against it. </li></ol><li>Even assuming that the first superintelligent AGI is in fact a system of services as described by the CAIS framework, it will be much more like an agent optimising for an open-ended goal than Eric claims. </li><ol><li>There&#x27;ll be significant pressure to reduce the extent to which humans are in the loop of AI services, for efficiency reasons. E.g. when a CEO can&#x27;t improve on the strategic advice given to it by an AI, or the implementation by another AI, there&#x27;s no reason to have that CEO any more. Then we’ll see consolidation of narrow AIs into one overall system which makes decisions and takes actions, and may well be given an unbounded goal like &quot;maximise shareholder value&quot;. (Eric agrees that this is dangerous, and considers it more relevant than other threat models). </li><li>Even if we have lots of individually bounded-yet-efficacious modules, the task of combining them to perform well in new tasks seems like a difficult one which will require a broad understanding of the world. An overseer service which is trained to combine those modules to perform arbitrary tasks may be dangerous because if it is goal-oriented, it can use those modules to fulfil its goals (on the assumption that for most complex tasks, some combination of modules performs well - if not, then we’ll be using a different approach anyway). </li><ol><li>While I accept that many services can be trained in a way which makes them naturally bounded and myopic, this is much less clear to me in the case of an overseer which is responsible for large-scale allocation of other services. In addition to superhuman planning capabilities and world-knowledge, it would probably require arbitrarily long episodes so that it can implement and monitor complex plans. My guess is that Eric would argue that this overseer would itself be composed of bounded services, in which case the real disagreement is how competitive that decomposition would be (which relates to point 1.2 above). </li></ol></ol><li>Even assuming that the first superintelligent AGI is in fact a system of services as described the CAIS framework, focusing on superintelligent agents which pursue unbounded goals is still more useful for technical researchers. (Note that I’m less confident in this claim than the others). </li><ol><li>Eventually we’ll have the technology to build unified agents doing unbounded maximisation. Once built, such agents will eventually overtake CAIS superintelligences because they’ll have more efficient internal structure and will be optimising harder for self-improvement. We shouldn’t rely on global coordination to prevent people from building unbounded optimisers, because it’s hard and humans are generally bad at it. </li><li>Conditional on both sorts of superintelligences existing, I think (and I would guess that Eric agrees) that CAIS superintelligences are significantly less likely to cause existential catastrophe. And in general, it’s easier to reduce the absolute likelihood of an event the more likely it is (even a 10% reduction of a 50% risk is more impactful than a 90% reduction of a 5% risk). So unless we think that technical research to reduce the probability of CAIS catastrophes is significantly more tractable than other technical AI safety research, it shouldn’t be our main focus.</li></ol></ol><p>As a more general note, I think that one of the main strengths of CAIS is in forcing us to be more specific about what tasks we envisage AGI being used for, rather than picturing it divorced from development and deployment scenarios. However, I worry that the fuzziness of the usual concept of AGI has now been replaced by a fuzzy notion of “service” which makes sense in our current context, but may not in the context of much more powerful AI technology. So while CAIS may be a good model of early steps towards AGI, I think it is a worse model of the period I’m most worried about. I find CAIS most valuable in its role as a research agenda (as opposed to a predictive framework): it seems worth further investigating the properties of AIs composed of modular and bounded subsystems, and the ways in which they might be safer (or more dangerous) than alternatives.<br/></p><p><em>Many thanks to Eric for the time he spent explaining his ideas and commenting on drafts.

The definition in this post focuses on learning instrumental goals and values. While the definitions are different, I have used the same term for both because I believe that they are both pointing at the same underlying concept. (I do not know if Paul agrees.) I&#x27;m including this post to give a different perspective on what I mean by narrow value learning, before delving into conceptual ideas within narrow value learning.</em></blockquote><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>Suppose I’m trying to build an AI system that “learns what I want” and helps me get it. I think that people sometimes use different interpretations of this goal. At two extremes of a spectrum of possible interpretations:</p><ul><li>The AI learns my preferences over (very) long-term outcomes. If I were to die tomorrow, it could continue pursuing my goals without me; if humanity were to disappear tomorrow, it could rebuild the kind of civilization we would want; <em>etc.</em> The AI might pursue radically different subgoals than I would on the scale of months and years, if it thinks that those subgoals better achieve what I really want.</li><li>The AI learns the narrower subgoals and instrumental values I am pursuing. It learns that I am trying to schedule an appointment for Tuesday and that I want to avoid inconveniencing anyone, or that I am trying to fix a particular bug without introducing new problems, <em>etc.</em> It does not make any effort to pursue wildly different short-term goals than I would in order to better realize my long-term values, though it may help me correct some errors that I would be able to recognize as such.</li></ul><p>I think that many researchers interested in AI safety per se mostly think about the former. I think that researchers with a more practical orientation mostly think about the latter.</p><h2>The ambitious approach</h2><p>The maximally ambitious approach has a natural theoretical appeal, but it also seems quite hard. It requires understanding human preferences in domains where humans are typically very uncertain, and where our answers to simple questions are often inconsistent, like how we should balance our own welfare with the welfare of others, or what kinds of activities we really want to pursue vs. enjoying in the moment. (It seems unlikely to me that there is a unified notion of “what I want” in many of these cases.) It also requires extrapolation to radically unfamiliar domains, where we will need to make decisions about issues like population ethics, what kinds of creatures do we care about, and unforeseen new technologies.</p><p>I have written about this problem, pointing out that it is unclear how you would solve it <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/the-easy-goal-inference-problem-is-still-hard-fad030e0a876\">even with an unlimited amount of computing power</a>. My impression is that most practitioners don’t think of this problem even as a long-term research goal — it’s a qualitatively different project without direct relevance to the kinds of problems they want to solve.</p><h2>The narrow approach</h2><p>The narrow approach looks relatively tractable and well-motivated by existing problems. We want to build machines that helps us do the things we want to do, and to that end they need to be able to understand what we are trying to do and what instrumental values guide our behavior. To the extent that our “preferences” are underdetermined or inconsistent, we are happy if our systems at least do as well as a human, and make the kinds of improvements that humans would reliably consider improvements.</p><p>But it’s not clear that anything short of the maximally ambitious approach can solve the problem we ultimately care about. A sufficiently clever machine will be able to make long-term plans that are significantly better than human plans. In the long run, we will want to be able to use AI abilities to make these improved plans, and to generally perform tasks in ways that humans would never think of perform them — going far beyond correcting simple errors that can be easily recognized as such.</p><h1>In defense of the narrow approach</h1><p>I think that the narrow approach probably takes us much further than it at first appears. I’ve written about these arguments before, which are for the most part similar to the reasons that <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/model-free-decisions-6e6609f5d99e\">approval-directed agents</a> or directly <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/against-mimicry-6002a472fc42\">mimicking human behavior</a> might work, but I’ll quickly summarize them again:</p><h2>Instrumental goals</h2><p>Humans have many clear instrumental goals like “remaining in effective control of the AI systems I deploy,” “acquiring resources and other influence in the world,” or “better understanding the world and what I want.” A value learner may able to learn robust preferences like these and pursue those instrumental goals using all of its ingenuity. Such AI’s would not necessarily be at a significant disadvantage with respect to normal competition, yet the resources they acquired would remain under meaningful human control (if that’s what their users would prefer).</p><p>This requires learning robust formulations of concepts like “meaningful control,” but it does not require making inferences about cases where humans have conflicting intuitions, nor considering cases which are radically different from those encountered in training — AI systems can continue to gather training data and query their users even as the nature of human-AI interactions changes (if that’s what their users would prefer).</p><h2>Process</h2><p>Even if we can’t infer human preferences over very distant objects, we might be able to infer human preferences well enough to guide a process of deliberation (real or hypothetical). Using the inferred preferences of the human could help eliminate some of the errors that a human would traditionally make during deliberation. Presumably these errors run counter to a deliberator’s short-term objectives, if those objectives are properly understood, and this judgment doesn’t require a direct understanding of the deliberator’s big-picture values.</p><p>This kind of error-correction could be used as a complement to other kinds of idealization, like providing the human a lot of time, allowing them to consult a large community of advisors, or allowing them to use automated tools.</p><p>Such a process of error-corrected deliberation could itself be used to provide a more robust definition of values or a more forward looking criterion of action, such as “an outcome/action is valuable to the extent that I would/did judge it valuable after extensive deliberation.”</p><h2>Bootstrapping</h2><p>By interacting with AI assistants, humans can potentially form and execute very sophisticated plans; if so, simply helping them achieve their short-term goals may be all that is needed. For some discussion of this idea, see <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/safe-automated-assistants-aa69edd46a57\">these</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/implementing-our-considered-judgment-6c715a239b3e\">three</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/approval-directed-bootstrapping-5d49e886c14f\">posts</a>.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I think that researchers interested in scalable AI control have been too quick to dismiss “narrow” value learning as unrelated to their core challenge. Overall I expect that the availability of effective narrow value learning would significantly simplify the AI control problem even for superintelligent systems, though at the moment we don’t understand the relationship very well.</p><p>(Thanks to Andreas Stuhlmüller and Owain Evans for helpful discussion.)</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>This was originally posted <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/ambitious-vs-narrow-value-learning-99bd0c59847e\">here</a> on 4th October, 2015.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<h2>Summary</h2><p>To this day there is a lack of systematic research to evaluate a cause area with immense potential: aging research. This is the first of a series of posts in which I&#x27;ll try to begin research to address this gap. The points made in this post are about how to evaluate impact using the concept of Longevity Escape Velocity. Bringing the date of Longevity Escape velocity closer by one year would save 36,500,000 lives of 1000 QALYs, using a conservative estimate. Other sources of impact that arise from the same concept include: increasing the probability of Longevity Escape Velocity, making Longevity Escape Velocity spread faster, and making a new future portion of the population reach Longevity Escape Velocity by increasing its life expectancy. Aging research could also positively impact the cost-effectiveness of other interventions by increasing the probability that Longevity Escape Velocity will be attained in the recipients&#x27; lifetimes. I will also discuss why the probability of Longevity Escape Velocity is substantial and why QALYs should be the measure of impact, and I&#x27;ll give mathematical proofs that the adoption speed of the technologies that arise from research doesn&#x27;t impact cost-effectiveness analyses.</p><h2>The need of a theoretical foundation to evaluate aging research</h2><p>I think one important approach to research in Effective Altruism is to try to lay theoretical foundations and put together tools for helping to evaluate a specific cause area that can be generalised to any intervention inside that cause area. Such work is often not possible because of lack of time and expertise, making it preferable, sometimes, to scout specific promising interventions or refine existing research.</p><p>One cause area that absolutely needs this kind of more systematic groundwork is aging research. The current EA research about aging is lacking in number and in what I think are crucial considerations, even though informal discussion with members of the community reveals that many people regard it as potentially promising. The expertise required to make such an analysis possible is rare to find. It requires people with a strong quantitative background who are also interested not only in biology but in the biology of aging in particular, and they must be accustomed to predicting the future of scientific research and making cost-effectiveness evaluations. I observed that the Effective Altruism community seems to have plenty of people with a background in philosophy, economics, social sciences or computer science, but people with a strong background in biology, or at least a strong interest in it, are scarce. This makes it even harder to find people willing to do the work of evaluating the cause area of aging research.</p><p>For these reasons, and since I&#x27;m very familiar with the topic and I think I have important things to say about it, I am willing to try to lay as much groundwork as possible, at least until I think I&#x27;m needed.</p><p>My long-term hope is that the groundwork I will lay will be good enough for a more formal discussion about this topic within Effective Altruism, both for evaluating specific interventions inside this cause area and for evaluating the cause area as a whole. I will write about what I think are original points and put together all the existing tools that could help both Effective Altruism organisations and organisations within the cause area of aging to make better decisions.</p><p>I have chosen to split the analysis into multiple posts so that I can receive and incorporate feedback during the process and thereby modify my work and its planning along the way. Organising the work in this way will also make the whole thing easier to read.</p><p>I&#x27;m doing this alone and in my free time, between university and other activities, so the posts will probably come out a few weeks or even months apart.</p><p>Although I hope that the bottom line of my arguments is strong, there will probably be many mistakes and many corrections to make. I encourage you to comment, give feedback and to contribute new ideas, especially if you have a consideration about something that I didn&#x27;t address that would substantially impact the result of a potential cost-effectiveness analysis. Along the way I will probably need to collaborate with other people and coauthor some posts, since my knowledge probably has gaps and needs to be complemented. Nonetheless I will try to learn what I currently don&#x27;t know along the way.</p><h2>What will this series of posts be about?</h2><p>This is the first of a series of posts in which I&#x27;ll explore different ways of reasoning about the potential cost-effectiveness of aging research. Each post will focus on one or more considerations. In the last post I would like to wrap everything up with a comprehensive framework useful for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of any given avenue of scientific research into the aging processes and how to treat their various facets. The points made will also provide an idea of the potential of the cause area as a whole.</p><p>An initial major focus will be on the scope of the problem and on moral considerations that could affect it. Neglectedness and tractability will be given space in later posts, in which I will try to lay out useful methods and heuristics to evaluate them in this cause area.</p><p>After this work, I would like to discover the best funding opportunities within this area and compare my conclusions with other past efforts within Effective Altruism that have been made to evaluate aging research.</p><p>Points made in this first post:</p><ul><li>Longevity Escape Velocity (LEV) is the minimum rate of medical progress such that individual life expectancy is raised by at least one year per year if medical interventions are used.</li><li>Reasoning with Longevity Escape Velocity substantially changes cost-effectiveness analyses.</li><li>A conservative estimate for life expectancy after Longevity Escape Velocity is 1000 years, although it’s still not a lower bound.</li><li>In order to account for making Longevity Escape Velocity arrive more quickly in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) the relevant variables are deaths by aging per year, life expectancy after LEV and Expected number of years LEV is made closer by. This without accounting for moral weights and other possible discounts.</li><li>The probability of Longevity Escape Velocity is substantial.</li><li>Another factor potentially greatly influencing impact is the life expectancy increase resulting from research projects or health interventions. If the project is not likely to be funded in the future or subsumed by other research, the recipients of the intervention who would have died near LEV get saved.</li><li>QALYs should be the measure of impact, as one life saved counts more than 30-80 QALYs in this cause area.</li><li>Mathematical proofs that cost-effectiveness analyses aren&#x27;t influenced by how Longevity Escape Velocity, or any technology that arises from a given financed research project, spreads to the whole population</li><li>Making LEV spread faster is another impact consideration that is pertinent to projects potentially leading to policy change or public awareness.</li><li>Certain research projects could also have the effect of increasing the probability of Longevity Escape Velocity, potentially influencing cost-effectiveness analyses substantially.</li><li>Aging research can boost the impact of other altruistic interventions by increasing the probability of LEV happening in the recipients&#x27; lifetimes.</li></ul><p>The next posts in the series will probably be about:</p><ul><li>A better lower bound for the life expectancy after Longevity Escape Velocity, and how this affects the probability of LEV.</li><li>The longevity dividend.</li><li>The value of information (depending on if I need to include considerations specific enough to aging research).</li><li>Moral weights.</li><li>If old people are replaceable in a utilitarian moral framework.</li><li>What is neglected and what is tractable in the cause area of aging research.</li><li>Putting the framework together.</li></ul><h2>Longevity Escape Velocity: what it is</h2><p>Longevity Escape Velocity (LEV) is the minimum rate of medical progress such that individual life expectancy is raised by at least one year per year if medical interventions are used. This does not refer to life expectancy at birth; it refers to life expectancy calculated from a person&#x27;s statistical risk of dying at any given time. This is equivalent to saying that a person&#x27;s expected future lifetime remains constant despite the passing years.</p><p>It&#x27;s possible, given sufficient ongoing improvement of medicine and its democratisation, that nearly everyone on the planet, at a certain date in the future, will benefit from therapies that allow Longevity Escape Velocity to be attained, at least until aging is eradicated completely. Then, other factors will influence risk of death, and expected future lifetime could start falling again each passing year if risk of death flattens or doesn’t continue to fall fast enough.</p><p>How likely that Longevity Escape Velocity is to become a reality in the future depends on a number of factors, which will be explored later in this post.</p><h2>Reasoning with Longevity Escape Velocity substantially changes cost-effectiveness analyses</h2><p>If a given intervention &quot;saves a life&quot;, this usually means that it averts 30 to 80 Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). In order to evaluate the impact of aging research, one could be tempted to try to estimate how many end-of-life DALYs that a possible intervention resulting from the research could save and adjust the number using the probability of success of the research.</p><p>This is the line of reasoning that <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/scientific-research/mechanisms-aging\">OpenPhilanthropy&#x27;s medium investigation on aging</a> uses, although without making any explicitly quantitative argument. This is part of the impact, and it has to be factored in, but it doesn&#x27;t consider where the largest impact of aging research is: making the date of Longevity Escape Velocity come closer. This would have the effect of saving many lives from death due to age-related decline and disease, but here, &quot;a life&quot; means, more or less, 1000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).

By definition, it will fall at a rate such that the expected future lifetime of any given individual will remain constant until aging gets eradicated completely. So, in order to make the most conservative estimate about life expectancy after LEV, we need to find the minimum rate of decrease of p(x) such that this condition holds. The answer to this doesn&#x27;t seem easy, so I&#x27;ll find this lower bound in another post.</p><p>For now, I&#x27;ll use a constant risk of death to calculate the life expectancy of individuals after aging is eradicated completely and risk of death has presumably stopped falling. While this method doesn&#x27;t yield a lower bound, since it leaves out from the calculation the risk of death when it&#x27;s decreasing, it can be made conservative using a relatively high risk of death.

We can estimate the expected QALYs gained because of such an effect. We have established that the average lifespan of a person who reached LEV will be around 1000 years, mostly without disability, and somewhat less if we use a lower bound. The number of QALYs saved are then calculated by multiplying 1000 by the number of people who would otherwise have died of aging if LEV wasn&#x27;t moved closer. Currently, around 100,000 people per day (36,500,000 people per year) die due to age-related decline and diseases, although this figure will be larger when LEV arrives due to population growth.</p><p>So, in order to calculate an almost lower bound for how many expected QALYs that a certain research project would save by making LEV come closer, you simply multiply these values:</p><ul><li>1000 QALYs</li><li>36,500,000 deaths/year</li><li>Expected number of years LEV is made closer by</li></ul><p>This is true for a crude estimate, without accounting for moral weights and potential discount rates.</p><p>It is important to stress the fact that none of these variables depend on how soon LEV will arrive, so we can totally ignore this kind of discussion, even if it is a highly debated topic outside the setting of cost-effectiveness evaluations.</p><p>The first two variables have been already discussed. Then, we need to examine the third one, which depends on many factors, such as:</p><ul><li>How promising the project being examined is, for different meanings of the word &quot;promising&quot;. For example, it may have direct translational value into effective therapies targeting aging processes or hallmarks, or it could have an effect of speeding up the field, such as by providing new tools, by enabling political entities to aid in achieving LEV sooner, or by enabling a new line of research to start sooner or become widespread more rapidly.</li><li>The neglectedness of the project would make the figure larger.</li><li>If there are other projects that could subsume the effect of the examined project, some of which would universally subsume all potential projects. These include technologies outside the field of aging research that are potentially very disrupting and sudden, such as artificial general intelligence.</li><li>The number of years necessary for another group to step in and do the same project.</li><li>The probability of catastrophic events: existential risks or events catastrophic enough to make the information acquired by the project lost or useless.</li><li>Lastly, the probability that LEV will happen in the first place also has a role in estimating this variable. This is because we can model the number of years that LEV is brought closer as the expected value of the random variable that maps to various numbers of years, among which is zero. The probability that the years LEV is brought closer by is zero, in turn, depends not only on the specifically examined project but also on the probability that LEV will not happen. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s useful to outline how to reason about the probability of LEV.</li></ul><h2>Probability of LEV</h2><p>If we had the minimum rate of decrease of risk of death such that LEV would happen, then the probability of LEV happening is the probability that the risk of death would fall at that rate or faster, and so the probability largely depends on that rate and on how fast medical research will be.</p><p>For now, we can reason about the problem by dividing the situations in which LEV will not happen in at least two scenarios:</p><ul><li>Very slow research scenario: In this scenario, each new therapy is developed in the span of an entire generation and contributes only a few more years of healthy life. This slow rate of progress is maintained more or less constantly within the span of a few centuries. Example: every 30 years or so, only one new therapy grants 5 more years of healthy life for the general population. If progress is this slow, LEV will never be reached. Negligible senescence will eventually be met after a few centuries, and generations will have progressively longer lifespans without anyone suddenly making very large jumps in life expectancy. New therapies may rely on previous ones for having substantial effects, forcing new treatments to come sequentially and not in parallel. It&#x27;s also possible that they could theoretically be developed in parallel, but an incredibly inefficient research community develops them sequentially. This scenario seems somewhat unlikely. This tells us that reaching the minimum rate of decrease of risk of death shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult.</li><li>Dire roadblocks scenario: This is the scenario in which there are roadblocks so dire that aging research is stalled for enough time that the recipients of previous interventions die. This doesn&#x27;t necessary prevent LEV all the time; these kind of roadblocks must be enough in number to effectively make the average decrease of risk of death the same as the one of the very slow scenario until aging is cured completely.</li></ul><p>The scenarios in which LEV will happen, instead, are the ones in which the risk of death falls fast enough, which means that new therapies would be developed sufficiently close together. This would be brought about through steady progress in medicine or relatively large jumps in life expectancy that enable previous recipients of therapies to extend their lives by another large amount of time. We can imagine how such scenarios could unfold:</p><ul><li>Today&#x27;s therapies or future therapies appear to be somewhat effective on humans or very effective on mice. This increases public focus on translational aging research, which, in turn, results in a multiplication of resources dedicated to it. It&#x27;s argued that that this first &quot;proof of concept&quot; required to convince the world is <a href=\"https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2014/04/what-is-robust-mouse-rejuvenation-and-why-should-we-care/\">Robust Mouse Rejuvenation</a>, which would double the remaining life expectancy of elderly mice, as demonstrated and then replicated in rigorous laboratory studies. A multiplication of resources for the field should result in therapies following the first proofs of concept. After this, the rate of therapy development and improvement will increase exponentially following the initial success of therapies. The history of technology is full of examples of this feedback loop, in which successive improvements are faster than the development of the proof of concept, a prominent one being flight.</li><li>Without invoking a large public interest, LEV could also be caused by combinations of different treatments coming in waves and by the improvement of treatments over time. This would mean sudden jumps in life expectancy that would buy enough time for other treatments to be developed. A sudden future enlightenment about the nature of aging could be also possible, or the first therapies could also have the effect of slowing down the accumulation of other damages, other than doing the job of addressing their specific targets. This would happen by breaking negative feedback loops of damages or processes. LEV could also happen in a sudden way if effective delivery methods are developed after many proof-of-concept therapies have been demonstrated, for example, in vitro.</li><li>The two scenarios above sound somewhat optimistic, but they might not be needed at all. The research could unfold silently but surely and the risk of death could still fall fast enough to ensure LEV. This would happen if the current situation of very slow improvement is overcome and there isn&#x27;t a large number of new dire roadblocks ahead.</li></ul><p>Given these scenarios, can we have a preliminary idea, without knowing how fast the risk of death needs to fall, of how likely LEV is? There are, at least, probably some relevant points to make regarding the current best guesses about aging and the present state of research.</p><p>It&#x27;s difficult to predict major future roadblocks, but at least it seems that the &quot;very slow research&quot; scenario is proving less and less likely. This doesn&#x27;t mean that we already have effective therapies against aging, or that the pace of science is optimal. But how research is distributed and the theories about what aging is make believable the possibility of therapies being developed closer together, thereby enabling a high-enough rate of decrease of overall risk of death.</p><p>The current best guess about how to tackle aging rests on a milestone paper from 2013: <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(13)00645-4\">The Hallmarks of Aging</a>. The paper has citations in the thousands and counting, and researchers are using it as a framework to orient and justify their own research. It proposes various categories of dysfunction. Every category, or almost every category, should be addressed periodically in order to maintain a youthful state of health. Reversing one hallmark would mean restoring an internal state of the body that is typical of a youthful body. It could also prove true that it will not be necessary to address every hallmark, due to the possible cause-effect relationships between each of them.</p><p>What does this say about how close together therapies will come? It says a lot: a paper like The Hallmarks of Aging means that the field already has an idea of what combination of foreseeable therapies will bring major gains in health and, in turn, life expectancy. This is because this theoretical categorisation constitutes what needs to be addressed.</p><p>It also implies that it enables thinking about rejuvenation, not only &quot;slowing down&quot; aging. This is because the dysfunctions described are exactly what is &quot;wrong&quot; with an old body, and not how those dysfunctions arise, so getting rid of those kind of dysfunctions means rejuvenation.</p><p>It&#x27;s a &quot;downstream&quot; view of aging that decomposes the problem and leaves out what is unnecessary to know in order to intervene, increasing the tractability of the problem. We don&#x27;t need to know how the Hallmarks arise in order to develop therapies that address them. One added benefit is that the hallmarks influence each other in negative feedback loops; reversing one slows down the progress of many others.</p><p>Theoretically, interventions aiming at reversing all of the hallmarks of aging could be developed in parallel, and, in fact, they currently are (although not optimally so). Interventions to ameliorate each one of the Hallmarks, at least in specific parts of the body, are underway. You can follow the progress of each research targeting each hallmark by using the <a href=\"https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/\">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a> made by the Life Extension Advocacy Foundation. This map tracks the progress of research projects that ameliorate each hallmark and provides links with explanations of each project; it also contains citations to the relevant papers.</p><p>As you can see, there are some hallmarks, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of proteostasis, which are in the very early stages of research: the furthest they have reached, so far, is the preclinical stage. Research on how to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, in particular, is in such an early stage of research that it is only pursued by nonprofits and academia, but it needs to be addressed in the wider scheme of therapies that will be needed in order to address all of the dysfunction arising from aging.</p><p>There are other hallmarks, such as cellular senescence and stem cell exhaustion, which are in fairly advanced stages of research (phase 1 and phase 2 trials), and research on them is pursued by well-funded, for-profit companies, such as Unity Biotechnology.</p><p>The fact that all of these lines of research are pursued in parallel is important. It means that at an unspecified time in the future, near or far, lines of research could come together in a relatively short period of time. The fact that right now, many interventions are being researched on specific diseases (e.g. Unity Biotechnology&#x27;s trial is for arthritis) does not negate the previous point: treatments that are being researched using the Hallmarks framework, even though they are being tested for specific conditions, are relevant for therapies that treat a wide range of diseases. Parallel development makes it more likely that therapies will come in waves, with each therapy being released shortly after another.</p><p>There are also other approaches in aging research, such as targeting aging in a more upstream fashion, with less ambitious interventions that target metabolic pathways. One example is <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/ea/1or/expected_cost_per_life_saved_of_the_tame_trial/\">metformin</a>, although I don&#x27;t think that, right now, science is advanced enough for research on specific medical interventions using this approach to substantially make the date of LEV come closer or substantially impact its probability. These kinds of research projects, nonetheless, could have the effect of buying some time for an additional slice of the population to reach LEV. This brings us to another way of accounting impact in this cause area.</p><h2>Accounting for making an additional slice of the population reach LEV</h2><p>Another factor potentially greatly influencing impact is the life expectancy increase resulting from research projects or health interventions. If the project is not likely to be funded in the future or subsumed by other research, the recipients of the intervention who would have died near LEV get saved. I think the health interventions or projects for which this factor is relevant are very few or maybe even non-existent. This consideration influenced the impact measure I used in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SYymYwgT89wcZBPYr/expected-cost-per-life-saved-of-the-tame-trial\">my previous analysis on the TAME trial</a>, but in retrospect I think I overestimated the probability that the health benefit of metformin will not be subsumed by other research.</p><p>In order to account for this, the relevant factors to multiply are:</p><ul><li>Life expectancy after LEV.</li><li>Recipients of the interventions who would have died just before LEV if their life expectancy wasn’t extended by the intervention.</li><li>Probability that the project will not be funded by someone else, or is subsumed by other research.</li></ul><h2>QALYs should be the measure of impact</h2><p>Due to the possibility of LEV, expected QALYs should be the measure of impact of aging research. Lives saved lose their original meaning, unless 1 life of 1000 QALYs is counted as multiple lives of 30-80QALYs. Exactly how many also depends on how moral weights are chosen. In <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/ea/1or/expected_cost_per_life_saved_of_the_tame_trial/\">my previous analysis about the cost-effectiveness of the TAME trial</a>, I made the mistake of measuring impact in lives saved instead of directly in QALYs, without considering the fact that a life saved in that context amounted to 1000 or more QALYs and actually counted as multiple lives saved. In that analysis, I also didn&#x27;t account for DALYs averted at the end of life and every other factor that influences impact, which I will discuss in future posts.</p><h2>How LEV spreads will have no impact on CEAs</h2><p>A concern sometimes comes up when I present LEV-based reasoning: how do we account for the fact that LEV will probably spread to the whole population over a large period of time (e.g. following the sigmoid technology adoption curve)? This consideration has no effect on the final estimate of cost-effectiveness, and making the date of LEV closer by any given period of time prevents exactly the number of deaths by aging occurring during that period of time, regardless of how LEV spreads. Let&#x27;s first see a simple example where this holds and then prove it mathematically in the general case. I came up with two proofs, each one of which is sufficient alone.</p><p>These same arguments and proofs work for any other outcome of a given technology. How a certain technology (health-related or not) will spread doesn&#x27;t influence the cost-effectiveness of financing the research leading to it. I may include the generalised version, which trivially follows from this one, in a separate post.</p><p>Keep in in mind that this does not mean that making LEV spread faster doesn’t impact CEAs. In fact, this is a potential impact factor that I will discuss. This result means that the impact of making the date of LEV come closer isn&#x27;t influenced by how LEV spreads.</p><p>I will use deaths prevented in the example and in the proofs, but a generic measure of impact yields the same result. Using QALYs is not necessary in this case.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><p>Let&#x27;s consider two specific scenarios as an example: in the first scenario, LEV spreads to the whole population instantly, and in the second, it spreads over four years.</p><p>First scenario: A particular piece of research makes LEV come closer by one year. Since LEV spreads instantly over the whole population, it&#x27;s easy to see that the resulting deaths prevented are exactly the deaths by aging occurring during one year: more or less 100k.</p><p>Second scenario: A particular piece of research makes LEV come closer by one year, but LEV spreads over the world during a period of four years. In the first year, 1/4 of the population reaches LEV; in the second year, 1/2; in the third, 4/5; and in the fourth, 5/5. If we shift this gradual transition by one year, then in the first year, we prevent, on the margin (deaths that would have occurred if we didn&#x27;t move the date), 1/4-0 = 1/4 of the deaths of aging occurring during that year. In the second year, we prevent 1/2-1/4 = 1/4 of the deaths by aging that occur during that year. In the third year, we prevent 4/5 - 1/2 = 3/10 of the deaths by aging occurring during that year. In the fourth year, we prevent 5/5 - 4/5 = 1/5 of the deaths by aging occurring during that year. So, in total, by shifting the date of LEV by one year, we prevented: 1/4 + 1/4 + 3/10 + 1/5 = 1. That is, we prevented the deaths by aging occurring during one year: more or less 100k.</p><p>As you can see, the number of deaths prevented in the two scenarios is the same: the number of deaths by aging occurring during one year. LEV is moved closer by one year in both scenarios, but it spreads differently.</p><p>Now, I&#x27;ll prove, more generally, that making LEV closer by any given period of time prevents exactly the number of deaths by aging occurring during that period of time, regardless of how LEV spreads.</p><p><strong>Proof 1:</strong></p><p> <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"n=\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em;

This would make LEV spread faster, and, in turn, save the people who otherwise wouldn’t reach it.</p><p>In order to evaluate this, we need to come up with an estimate of how the future adoption curve will look like. This could possibly be achieved by looking at the way that current health treatments spread, and then evaluate how many people, and, in turn, QALYs, get saved by a change in the curve resulting from the project.</p><p>This consideration will probably be given more space in a separate post investigating current adoption curves for health-related technologies and the impact of advocacy and inducing policy change in this area.</p><h2>Accounting for increasing the probability of LEV</h2><p>Another consideration that may be taken into account to evaluate impact is how much a given research project increases the probability of LEV. This doesn&#x27;t mean increasing the probability of aging getting eradicated completely; it means increasing the probability of research being fast enough to ensure LEV and not a scenario in which research is so slow, or roadblocks so dire, that aging eventually gets eradicated but no one experiences LEV in the meantime.</p><p>This probably depends much on the project in question, but it is also possible that, in general, the impact of this consideration could be small, unless we assume a really inefficient research community, or we are analysing a specific research project that is highly neglected and has the potential effect of removing a major roadblock or unlocking further progress, thus speeding up the general pace of research and making the risk of death for future recipients of interventions fall faster. This could be true for research on new scientific tools or research done in a particularly original way that shows a new approach to problems that wasn&#x27;t seen before.</p><p>In case this consideration has to be taken into account and we need to calculate how many QALYs that increasing this probability would save, we should come up with a distribution of probabilities (with the sum of the probabilities = 1 - the probability of LEV not happening) about how fast the risk of death would fall after LEV. Each outcome yields a different number of QALYs saved by LEV. Then, we should calculate the expected value in QALYs of the distribution with an increased total probability of LEV and the expected value in QALYs of the distribution without an increased total probability of LEV, then determine the difference between the two results.</p><h2>Aging research boosts the impact of other altruistic interventions</h2><p>It should be noted that another effect of aging research is to increase the chance for people saved by other interventions to reach LEV. If a life in Africa is saved thanks to insecticidal nets, then the expected QALYs saved will be more or less the person&#x27;s expected remaining life plus his/her life expectancy after LEV in QALYs (more or less 1000 as we have seen) multiplied by the probability that person has to achieve LEV during the rest of his/her life.</p><p>The probability of an individual reaching LEV depends on:</p><ul><li>The probability of dying of causes not related to aging.</li><li>The probability of LEV arriving in the lifetime of the recipient of the intervention.</li></ul><p>The first depends on the recipients of the intervention, but even in the worst cases, it should be a pretty high number, considering that even in Africa, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/274511/life-expectancy-in-africa/\">the lowest average life expectancy for children born in 2018 is 57 years.</a> The second probability depends on how likely LEV is to appear in any given year. In order to determine this, a very thorough and detailed analysis is needed, and so I will probably tackle this problem in another post.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>This is a crosspost from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jYMdWskbrTWFXG6dH/a-general-framework-for-evaluating-aging-research-part-1\">my post in the Effective Altruism Forum</a>.</p>",

But I want to flesh out some options for consideration and get feedback. Sorry if it&#x27;s long.</em></p><p>WANTED:</p><p><strong>A crowd-sourced site that reliably presents important pros and cons on any/all topics and hopefully leads us collectively closer to consensus.</strong></p><p>This has been on my mind for a few years now. Figuring out truth in the digital age is often tricky and sometimes downright impossible. (Is <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/\">minimum wage a good thing</a>? Should I adopt a paleo or keto or vegan or Shangri-la diet? What do we really know and not know about the historical Jesus?) Especially when it comes to political discussion, answers often depend on more details than an average person has time or energy to research—and even if they did, they may still leave out considerations or solutions that someone else may think of. </p><p>Some links where other rationalists think semi-related things: <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2018/12/toward-an-honest-consensus.html\">Robin Hanson wants AI to help us towards consensus because Wikipedia isn&#x27;t up for the job</a>. <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/26/adversarial-collaboration-contest-results/\">Scott Alexander promoted adversarial collaborations to see if they could reach consensus.</a> (I swear, I saw more examples of people wishing for something like a debate website, but I wasn&#x27;t writing them down and searching for them has failed.)</p><p>THE WISHFUL THINKING PART</p><p>Now let me be more specific about what my imagined website (hereafter, Site) needs to do.</p><p>On matters of t<em>ruth,</em> it needs to support epistemic arguments for w<em>hy w</em>e should believe or not believe particular claims. On matters of <em>action, </em>it needs to provide important pro/cons of taking that action.  Site must have a method of allowing the best arguments to rise to the top. That&#x27;s the most basic functionality.</p><p>Additional Feature A: Because the Site is crowd-sourced, anyone can propose possible actions and possible modifications to actions. In theory, this could mean that Site could be a platform where a crowd-written law could have its details hammered out by many affected parties. Creative solutions could have a chance to be reviewed and, if well-thought-out, could rise higher in the public consciousness.</p><p>Optional Feature B: I really, really would like it if, within the structure of arguments (for either epistemic-truth topics or proposed-actions), Site distinguished between truth-claims and value-claims. This might be especially unrealistic, since no one naturally lays out arguments that way. But gosh dang it, I really want it to.</p><p>Optional Feature C: A number of rationalist posts have discussed how useful it would be for society to have a way to coordinate on certain problems: specifically, having a conditional &quot;I will adopt X if Y% of other relevant people also do&quot;. It might be possible to set up Site so that proposed actions that need a minimum number of people to adopt it in order for it to be worthwhile offer the option of conditionally committing to adopt it and sending out notifications when thresholds are reached. </p><p>THE NITTY-GRITTY</p><p>Obviously, this is a LOT to ask from a website. Before I go into everything that could go wrong and all the reasons it might not even be possible, let me lay out a couple of  operational options.</p><p><u>Contrast Voting</u></p><p>Reddit and other up/down-vote systems suffer from certain effects, an important one being that late-to-the-game comments don&#x27;t stand a chance against early popular comments, even if the later ones are higher quality. To combat this, Site should not allow up/down votes on individual items/comments/whatever. Instead, Site should present <em>two</em> items and ask for a vote on <em>which one is better.</em> In this way, Site can give better rankings to items. A new argument, perhaps one that presents a new, more recent study finding, can quickly outrank the previous top argument if, when those two arguments are presented, most people vote that the new one is better.</p><p><u>Contrast Topics</u></p><p>The Contrast Topics option would not have a page titled &quot;Is God real?&quot; nor a page for &quot;We should outlaw chicken cage farming.&quot; Instead, topics would be presented in terms of possible alternatives. &quot;The Abrahamic God is real&quot; could be separately contrasted with &quot;There is no God&quot; and, on another page, contrasted with &quot;There is a divine energy&quot;. &quot;We should outlaw chicken cage farming&quot; could be contrasted with &quot;We should eat less chicken and let the market adjust chicken cage farming downward&quot; or &quot;We should slowly phase out chicken cage farming according to this detailed plan I&#x27;ve written out&quot; or &quot;We should wait until chicken-like lab meat is available, and then outlaw chicken cage farming&quot;. </p><p>Visually, this might be tricky, but a &quot;Chicken cage farming&quot; page might list all of the proposed actions related to it, and a user could select two actions and click &quot;next&quot; to see the pros and cons of those two actions relative to each other. (These would be more like pros of A vs pros of B, not pro/cons of each; a con of B would be listed as a pro of A and vice versa.) These headings might be treated as tags/labels rather than a strict hierarchy of categories, so that a possible action or topic might appear under multiple headings if it&#x27;s relevant to all of them. Headings might, in turn, have both epistemic truth-claims and potential actions listed under them.</p><p><u>Open Forum</u></p><p>In this option, individual users compose complete arguments, either pro or con. They are allowed and even encouraged to steal what others have written, add/subtract/modify it as they like, and submit it as a new argument. Contrast Voting is used within &quot;pro&quot; and within &quot;con&quot; to rank these arguments and present the highest ranked at the top. Probably only the top one or two submissions will show by default (the rest reached by an expandable + or &quot;show more&quot; or such), since submissions are expected to (eventually) aggregate all the best arguments.</p><p><u>Wikibate</u></p><p>This is an alternative to Open Forum. It works more like Wikipedia; everyone is allowed to directly edit one single page. A pro and con side are provided, and we see if a version comes out that makes enough people happy enough to be stable. A behind-the-scenes contrast voting option might be used to decide which order the possible arguments appear in, but the phrasing of the arguments would have to satisfy people or be edited by someone.</p><p><u>Personal Expertise Stories</u></p><p>In normal life, people rely heavily on personal experiences when forming their beliefs. If Site doesn&#x27;t sometimes take this into account, it will feel shallow to many people. Argue the facts of abortion all you want, but if you can&#x27;t include someone&#x27;s vivid description of having a loved one die from a back-alley abortion or another person&#x27;s horror at seeing what they were told is a &quot;lump of tissue&quot; that turns out to look exactly like a baby, you&#x27;re missing important context. </p><p>It is also the case that sometimes hearing expert testimony is helpful. Lawmakers often rely on it. Experts don&#x27;t always agree, but a claim from an expert can and should carry a different weight than the same claim from a non-expert. </p><p>On a crowd-sourced site, anyone can claim they&#x27;re an expert or make up b.s. stories about what happened to them. A possible solution is to allow people to submit a &quot;personal expertise/story&quot;. If submitting one, you have to include personal contact info like a phone number. Some number, say 10, people can apply to verify a story. Only approved verifiers are given access to the story submitter&#x27;s contact info. The verifiers promise to come back and report on the status of their verification and not to abuse the contact info. (A complaint from a story submitter results in that verifier being unable to do any further verifications, and possibly banned from the Site.) The verifier calls the person and talk to them, get details if possible, like other people or companies they can talk to, to verify parts of the story or claim. In the end they report back, maybe on a 5-point scale, whether they believe the person&#x27;s claim, and the net verification result from all the verifiers is displayed with the story. (E.g. a green bar showing 3.5/5, with a (2) next to it indicating only 2 verifiers have submitted responses.)</p><p><u>Consequences Before Arguments</u></p><p>For proposed actions, <em>before </em>the actual pro/con arguments appear, I would like to see a list of possible consequences that might result from taking that action. While I don&#x27;t want Site to adopt consequentialism as an official philosophy, I remember (Google, you fail me) an article that claimed that people demonstrated less partisanship when they were asked to think about the consequences of possible laws. A potential consequence is itself a truth-claim (&quot;If we do X, then Y will happen&quot;), so that should link to its own page. </p><p><u>Login Voting</u></p><p>Generally, I want people not to have to create accounts in order to participate on the website. IP addresses can be recorded, like Wikipedia does, for submitting/modifying arguments, proposing actions, and creating topics. That should minimize the barrier to entry and encourage participation. However, all voting should require logging in, to minimize one person voting multiple times, and to accurately track if someone changes their relative rankings of two arguments.</p><p><u>Parallel Axes Voting</u></p><p>There is no one standard for what makes an argument &quot;better&quot; than another. Relevant measurements include: accuracy, importance/applicability, thoroughness, kindness, formatting/grammar/spelling. One option might be to allow users to Contrast Vote two arguments in multiple categories separately: Argument A has more important points than B, but B has better grammar than A, and they are the same on kindness. Parallel Axes Voting is more relevant if Site uses the Open Forum style, and not so much if it uses Wikibate. </p><p>THE PROBLEMS, OH SO MANY PROBLEMS</p><ul><li><strong>I don&#x27;t know how to make this website.</strong> I know a little html and css, and I have a vague idea that Amazon Web Services could be initially used to host the site. But I know nothing about how to use AWS, how to make a database and a website talk to each other, how to have user accounts and secure logins, etc. I&#x27;d either need a lot of help or someone else would have to do it entirely or I&#x27;d need to invest a ton of time into basically learning a new profession to make something that might fail.</li><li><strong>The most popular arguments aren&#x27;t necessarily the best.</strong></li><ul><li><em>People might sacrifice truth for simplicity. </em>Given two arguments that make the same point, one that presents the point more simply and understandably is better than one that doesn&#x27;t. However, users will sometimes be offered the choice between a simple, understandable argument that isn&#x27;t accurate and a  difficult one that is more correct. I don&#x27;t know of a way to discourage upvoting the simpler one over the more accurate one. Worse, if all the arguments on the inaccurate side are simple and easy to understand, and all the arguments on the more correct side are difficult to understand, Site could backfire and have the effect of convincing people of something that isn&#x27;t true.</li><li><em>Some topics require a whole background course to understand. </em>Israel/Palestine, the mortgage crisis...there&#x27;s some things that require so much background knowledge (even to be familiar with the relevant terms) that I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible to create arguments that the average reader could understand without also presenting some sort of background course on the topic. [Maybe this could be ameliorated by limiting the voting on certain topics to people who have accessed and agreed that they have read a background page that verified experts have approved?]</li></ul><li><strong>I don&#x27;t know if Site will actually promote consensus. </strong> I think seeing your opponent&#x27;s best arguments instead of only their worst will reduce partisanship a little. I think that comparing multiple possible actions on a topic instead of only one or two will help some. But that might not be enough.</li><ul><li>Having all arguments divided into either pro or con instead of one single narrative might not shift people into a consensus. Relatedly, it might be difficult for the two sides to adequately interact with each other and respond to each other&#x27;s views when everything is listed on one side or the other. </li><li>Seeing the pros and cons of both sides might actually make untrue beliefs (flat Earth, for example) seem more legitimate or reasonable than they are; the epistemic imbalances might not come across effectively.</li><li>Much disagreement includes trusting sources differently. If an argument about whether something did/would happen or not boils down to &quot;Breitbart/Slate said so&quot;, Site might not have a way to resolve that.</li><li>A website might be innately insufficient; personally caring about another person you know might be required for consensus. </li><li>A sub-point on this one is that in the Wikibate style, I don&#x27;t know if arguments can reach a reasonably stable state. Wikipedia does sometimes have those background pages for arguing about whether an article should say one thing or another; Wikibate might try those for settling disputes, deciding whether subtle differences are similar enough to count as the same thing or not, and such. But contentious things are contentious, and that might not be enough.</li></ul><li><strong>Some algorithms and UI details need to be worked out.</strong></li><ul><li><em>How can the conditional-cooperation option be implemented? </em>If different people have different thresholds that need to be met before they will do it, how does Site take that into account? How does it handle identifying the subpopulation of the whole planet that would need to conditionally commit to certain measures? (E.g. all corporations will follow some environmental rule if all the others do too—the CEOs or other higher-ups in the corporations would be the only relevant population that would need to meet the threshold, not every individual on the planet).</li><li><em>What formula should Site use for taking user&#x27;s Contrast Votes and turning them into an overall rank?</em> What happens when people be their inconsistent selves and like A better than B, B better than C, but C better than A?</li><li><em>How do we get users to rank new submissions?</em> Do we list new ones separately above the already-ranked ones? Force a pop-up that asks people to rank a newer submission with a random older one before they continue reading that page? Offer a sidebar that says &quot;Here&#x27;s some new arguments, please review and rank them:&quot;?</li><li><em>Numbers. </em>This is especially relevant when listing possible consequences of actions, but sometimes Site needs to handle numbers delicately. &quot;One more person each year will die if we do this&quot; is different from &quot;100,000 more people will die each year if we do this&quot;. Listing all the possible estimates that individuals pull out of their...err, hat would be overwhelming to look at and consider. Do we create a separate page for arguments over what the number will be and institute Contrast Voting on the results so that the original page shows the most popular estimate? List upper and lower bounds: &quot;Between 1 and 100,000 people will die&quot;? </li><li><em>How does Site handle nesting?</em> How far down do we let nesting continue before deciding that two options are too similar to bother listing them separately? Does Site make you compare only the lowest-nested level with each other, or you compare higher nested levels too? (That is, is there a page for Abrahamic God vs. No God and also a page for prayer-answering Baptist God vs. No God, even though prayer-answering Baptist God is nested under Abrahamic God? Or can you only compare prayer-answering Baptist God to non-so-interventionist Baptist God? If so, how do you get agreement on what aspects of God all the Abrahamics agree on?)</li><li><em>Is a summary possible? </em>Would it be possible for a page to present a sort of consensus summary? (Something like &quot;People prefer immediate outlawing of chicken cage farming if they value reducing the total amount of suffering of living creatures more than they value reducing human suffering alone, and people prefer gradual phasing out of chicken cage farming if they value reducing human suffering alone more than they value reducing the total amount of suffering of living creatures&quot;.)</li><li><em>How does Site balance covering all the options with presenting a number of possibilities that people will actually read? </em>Sometimes it will be enough to list all the options, put the most important/relevant ones at the top, and let people read as far down as they want. Sometimes that might not be enough. For instance, if you want to list the consequences of a possible action before you list the pro/con arguments for that action, then what do you do if there&#x27;s 50 consequences proposed? Cut it off at an arbitrary number (say, only show the 5 most important)? Display any that, say, 50% of people vote should be visible without being hidden behind a &quot;see more&quot; option? </li><li><em>How is moderation handled? </em>Like, I have no clue. This probably varies depending on whether Site uses Open Forum or Wikibate.</li><li>There&#x27;s a lot more details to work out. I think I have some implicit imagery in my head as to how Site looks and operates that I might not have laid out explicitly here, but a lot of it has yet to be worked out. And doubtless huge new problems will be encountered once actually trying to make the site.</li></ul><li><strong>Getting Site to be popular enough to be useful is difficult. </strong>I definitely don&#x27;t have the social network or following to pull something like that off. I don&#x27;t really know anyone who does. The best I could do is email a link (once it&#x27;s set up) to random famous people and say &quot;Please check this out&quot;. Maybe if someone writes up a &quot;6 Reasons to Check Out This Website (And Laugh)&quot; article and submits it to Buzzfeed.</li><li><strong>Funding. </strong>If it does become popular, decisions will need to be made about advertising and how to pay for server maintenance and whatnot.</li><li><strong>Site needs a cool name. </strong>All I&#x27;ve come up with is Wikibate (if it&#x27;s set up that way) or BetterThink.</li></ul><p>In the end, despite the problems, I think Site would be more worth having than not.</p><p>So what do you think? Is Site even possible? Is there a better setup than Open Forum or Wikibate? If not, which of those two is better?  Should the Personal Expertise Stories option be included? What other details could Site implement to be successful? Are any of you willing to work on it? Is it worth my time to work on it?</p>",

It's well known that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem\">not everyone in a corporation acts in the best interests</a> of the corporation. So, a corporation will not act at all like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_value#Maximizing_shareholder_value\">rational shareholder value maximiser</a>. Despite this, is there a way of somehow deducing, from its behaviour and its internal structure, that its true goals are shareholder maximisation?</p>\n<p>I immediately started taking the example too literally, and objected to the premise, mentioning the goals of subagents within the corporation. We were to a large extent talking past each other; I was strongly aware of the fact that even if a system had its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution\">origin in one set of preferences</a>, that didn't mean it couldn't have <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cSXZpvqpa9vbGGLtG/thou-art-godshatter\">disparate preferences of its own</a>. Dylan, on the other hand, was interested in formalising my ideas in a simple setting. This is especially useful, as the brain itself is a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/M4w2rdYgCKctbADMn/sequence-introduction-non-agent-and-multiagent-models-of\">hierarchical system with subagents</a>.</p>\n<p>So here is my attempt to fomalise the problem, <strong>and</strong> present my objection, all at the same time.</p>\n<h2>The setting and actions</h2>\n<p>I'm choosing a very simplified version of the hierarchical planning problem presented in <a href=\"https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/papers/hpnICRA11Final.pdf\">this paper</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/rofptut8jx7mleg/Robot_0.PNG?raw=1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>A robot, in green, is tasked with moving the object A to the empty bottom storage area. The top level of the hierarchical plan formulates the plan of gripping object A.</p>\n<p>This plan is then passed down to a lower level of the hierarchy, that realises that first it must get B out of the way. This is passed to a lower level that is tasked with gripping B. It does so, but, for some reason, it first turns on the music:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/tk3mxrpojlaq3ka/Robot_1.PNG?raw=1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Then it moves B out of the way (this will involve moving up and down the planning hierarchy a few times, by first gripping B, then moving it, then releasing the grip, etc...):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/psk01ckfrvs2m3b/Robot_2.PNG?raw=1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Then the planning moves up the hierarchy again, which re-issues the \"grip A\" command. The robot does that, and eventually moves A into storage:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/4v175jx60rk6cip/Robot_3.PNG?raw=1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>The irrationality of music</h2>\n<p>Now this seems to be mainly a rational plan for moving A to storage, except for the music part. Is the system trying to move A but is being irrational at one action? Or does the music reflect some sort of preferences for the hierarchical system?</p>\n<p>Well, to sort that out, we can look within the agent. Let's look at the level of the hierarchy that is tasked with gripping B, and that turns on the music. In a massively pseudo version of pseudo code, here is one version of this:</p>\n<p><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\begin{array}{rl}\n&amp; \\textbf{Algorithm 1:}\\\\\n\\texttt{1:} &amp;

It's a subagent with non-aligned preferences. Turning on the music is not an accident, it's a deliberate and rational move on the part of this subagent.</p>\n<h2>The goals of the system</h2>\n<p>For Algorithm 1, the system clearly has the goal of of moving A to storage, and has a failure of rationality along the way.</p>\n<p>For Algorithm 2, there are several possible goals: moving A to storage, turning the radio on, and various mixes of these goals. Which is the right interpretation of the goal? We can model the hierarchy in different ways, that suggest different intuitions for the \"true\" goal - for example, Algorithm 2 could actually be a human, acting on instructions from a manager. Or it could be a sub-module of a brain, one that is unendorsed by the rest of the brain.</p>\n<p>My take on it is that the \"true goal\" of the system is underspecified. <strong>From the outside</strong>, my judgement would be that the closer the subagent resembles an independent being, and the closer that <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\texttt{Enjoyment}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-type-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">Enjoyment</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> resembles true enjoyment.</p>\n<p><strong>From the inside</strong>, though, the system may have many meta-preferences that push it in one direction or another. For example, if there was a module that analysed the performance of the rest of the algorithm, and recommended changes; and if that algorithm systematically changed the system towards becoming a A-storage-mover (such as recommending deleting the <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\texttt{Enjoyment}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-type-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">Enjoyment</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> goal), then that would be a strong meta-preference towards only having the storage goal. And if we used the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y2LhX3925RodndwpC/resolving-human-values-completely-and-adequately\">methods here</a>, we'd get moving A the main goal, plus some noise.</p>\n<p>Conversely, maybe there are processes that are ok with the subagent's behaviour. A modern corporation, for instance, has legal limits on what it can inflict on its workers, so some of the meta-preferences of the corporation (located for example in HR and the legal department) are geared towards some livable work environments, even if this doesn't increase shareholder value.</p>\n<p>(Now, <em>I</em> still might like to intervene, in some cases - even if the goal of a slave state invading their neighbours is clear at the object and meta-level, I can still value subagents even if they don't).</p>\n<p>In the absence of some sort of meta-preferences, there are multiple ways of establishing the preferences of a hierarchical system, and many of them are equally valid.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Megaproject management is a new-ish subfield of project management. Originally considered to be the special case of project management where the budgets were enormous (billions of dollars), it is developing into a separate specialization because of the high complexity and tradition of failure among such projects. The driving force behind treating it as a separate field appears to be <a href=\"https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/about-us/people/bent-flyvbjerg\">Bent Flyvbjerg</a>, previously known around here for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting\">Reference Class Forecasting</a> as the first person to develop an applied procedure. That procedure was motivated by megaprojects.</p><p>I will make a summary of the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0003.pdf\">&quot;What you should know about megaprojects, and why: an overview&quot;</a> from 2014. For casual reading, there is an article about it from the New Yorker <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bertha-seattle-infrastructure-trouble-megaprojects\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Megaprojects got their name from the association of mega with big, so think mega-city rather than mega-joule. It did match the unit prefix in the beginning however, as such projects were mostly dams, bridges, or very large buildings in the early 20th century.</p><p>The next shift upward took place with the Manhattan Project and then the Apollo program, which are also frequently drawn on as positive examples. The term &#x27;megaproject&#x27; picked up steam in the 1970s, at the same time project costs crossed over into the billions.</p><p>Currently project costs of 50-100 billion are common, with even larger projects less common but not rare. If you were to view certain things which need dedicated management as a project, like the stimulus packages from 2008 or US defense procurement, then we have crossed over into the trillions and are entering a &#x27;tera era&#x27; of megaprojects.</p><p>Ignoring these special cases, but counting infrastructure and industries where billion dollar projects are common, megaprojects account for ~8% of global GDP.</p><p><strong>Four Sublimes</strong></p><p>These are four reasons which drive the popularity of megaprojects. They are kind of  a group bias for each type of stakeholder. They are:</p><ul><li><strong>Technological sublime:</strong> because engineers and technologists love making the newest/tallest/fastest things.</li><li><strong>Political sublime:</strong> because politicians love being able to associate with huge projects and the publicity that comes with them.</li><li><strong>Economic sublime:</strong> because unions, contractors, and business people love all the jobs and fees.</li><li><strong>Aesthetic sublime:</strong> because designers love making beautiful things, and the public loves to adopt big beautiful things as distinctive for their city/country.</li></ul><p>Predictably with biases, there are side effects:</p><blockquote>The following characteristics of megaprojects are typically overlooked or glossed over when the four sublimes are at play and the megaproject format is chosen for delivery of large-scale ventures: </blockquote><blockquote>1. Megaprojects are inherently risky due to long planning horizons and complex interfaces (Flyvbjerg, 2006). </blockquote><blockquote>2. Often projects are led by planners and managers without deep domain experience who keep changing throughout the long project cycles that apply to megaprojects, leaving leadership weak. </blockquote><blockquote>3. Decision-making, planning, and management are typically multi-actor processes involving multiple stakeholders, public and private, with conflicting interests (Aaltonen and Kujala, 2010). </blockquote><blockquote>4. Technology and designs are often non-standard, leading to &quot;uniqueness bias&quot; amongst planners and managers, who tend to see their projects as singular, which impedes learning from other projects. 3 </blockquote><blockquote>5. Frequently there is overcommitment to a certain project concept at an early stage, resulting in “lock-in” or “capture,” leaving alternatives analysis weak or absent, and leading to escalated commitment in later stages. &quot;Fail fast&quot; does not apply; &quot;fail slow&quot; does (Cantarelli et al., 2010; Ross and Staw, 1993; Drummond, 1998). </blockquote><blockquote>6. Due to the large sums of money involved, principal-agent problems and rent-seeking behavior are common, as is optimism bias (Eisenhardt, 1989; Stiglitz, 1989; Flyvbjerg el al., 2009). </blockquote><blockquote>7. The project scope or ambition level will typically change significantly over time. </blockquote><blockquote>8. Delivery is a high-risk, stochastic activity, with overexposure to so-called &quot;black swans,&quot; i.e., extreme events with massively negative outcomes (Taleb, 2010). Managers tend to ignore this, treating projects as if they exist largely in a deterministic Newtonian world of cause, effect, and control. </blockquote><blockquote>9. Statistical evidence shows that such complexity and unplanned events are often unaccounted for, leaving budget and time contingencies inadequate. </blockquote><blockquote>10. As a consequence, misinformation about costs, schedules, benefits, and risks is the norm throughout project development and decision-making. The result is cost overruns, delays, and benefit shortfalls that undermine project viability during project implementation and operations.</blockquote><p><strong>The Iron Law of Megaprojects</strong></p><ul><li>Over time.</li><li>Over budget.</li><li>Under utilized.</li></ul><p>These aren&#x27;t little, either: cost overruns of 1.5x are common, in bad cases they can run more than 10x, and 90% of projects have them; it is common for projects to have 0.5x <em>or less</em> utilization once complete. This holds for the public and private sectors, and also across countries, so things like excessive regulation or corruption aren&#x27;t good explanations.</p><p>They start off badly, but they <em>do</em> still manage to get completed, which is due to...</p><p><strong>Break-Fix Model</strong></p><p>Since management of megaprojects doesn&#x27;t know what they are doing or don&#x27;t have the incentives to care, inevitably something breaks. Then additional time and money are spent to fix what broke, or the conditions of the project are renegotiated, and it limps along to the next break. This process continues until the project is finished.</p><p>If it is so terrible and we know it is terrible, why do we do it this way?</p><p><strong>Hirschman&#x27;s Hiding Hand</strong></p><p>Because a lot of important stakeholders don&#x27;t know how terrible it is. From Willie Brown, former mayor of San Francisco:</p><blockquote>&quot;News that the Transbay Terminal is something like $300 million over budget should not come as a shock to anyone. We always knew the initial estimate was way under the real cost. Just like we never had a real cost for the [San Francisco] Central Subway or the [San Francisco-Oakland] Bay Bridge or any other massive construction project. So get off it. In the world of civic projects, the first budget is really just a down payment. If people knew the real cost from the start, nothing would ever be approved. The idea is to get going. Start digging a hole and make it so big, there&#x27;s no alternative to coming up with the money to fill it in.&quot;</blockquote><p>Nor are they without justification, for arguments have been made that support it. The first argument is exactly as Willie made it: if we knew how difficult large projects were, we would never build them.</p><p>For the second, note the title of the section is <em>hiding</em>, not <em>hidden</em>. This argument was made by Albert O. Hirschman on the basis of earlier work by J.E. Sawyer, and it says that there is an error in both the estimations of costs, and in the estimation of benefits, and this error should roughly cancel out. The problem is that Sawyer&#x27;s work just pointed out that this was possible based on a picked sample of 5 or so. Hirschman then generalized it into a &quot;Law of the Hiding Hand&quot; and thereby legitimated lying to ourselves.</p><p>Alas it is bunk. Aside from being falsified by the actual data, Flyvbjerg points out the non-monetary opportunity costs through the example of the Sydney Opera House. It&#x27;s architect, Dane Jorn Utzon, won the Pritzker Prize (the Nobel of architecture) in 2003 for the Sydney Opera House. It is his only major work - the catastrophic delays and cost overruns destroyed his career. Contrast with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry\">Frank Gehry</a>, another inspired architect, and it looks like management&#x27;s bungling of the Opera House probably cost us half a dozen gorgeous landmarks.</p><p><strong>Survival of the Unfittest</strong></p><p>The prevailing attitude that it is perfectly acceptable to lie about and then badly manage megaprojects leads to a weird scenario where worse projects are more likely to be chosen. Consider two competing projects, one with honest and competent management, and one with dishonest and incompetent management. The costs look lower for the latter project, and the benefits look higher, and the choosers between them probably expect them to both be over budget and behind schedule by about the same amount. Therefore we systematically make worse decisions about what projects to build.</p><p><strong>Light at the End of the Tunnel</strong></p><p>Fortunately there are bright spots. During the Obama administration these failings were identified as an important policy area for the US government. It is now much more common for a megaproject failure to result in consequences for leadership, like the CEOs of BP and Deepwater Horizon, or Airbus and the A380 superjumbo. There are megaprojects that go well and serve as examples of how to do it right, like the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. Lastly, there is scattered adoption of varying levels of good practices, like reference class forecasting and independent forecasting.</p><p><strong>End</strong></p><p>For those interested in learning more, Oxford has <a href=\"https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/programmes/msc-major-programme-management\">Major Programme Management</a> at the masters level.

This intuition is based on libertarian or anarcho-capitalist ideas, but in some ways seems closer to what humans do when they try to help.</p><h1>Autonomy</h1><p>I was talking to Andrew Forrester about the suffering golem thought experiment. I&#x27;m not sure who came up with this thought experiment, but the idea is:</p><p><strong>Suffering Golem:</strong><em> A golem suffers terribly in every moment of its existence, but it says it wants to keep living. Do you kill it?</em> </p><p>The idea is that if you think it is good to kill it, you&#x27;re a hedonic utilitarian: your altruistic motives have to do with maximizing pleasure / minimizing suffering. If you think it should not be killed, then you&#x27;re more likely to be a preference utilitarian: your altruistic motives have to do with what the person values for themselves, rather than some other thing you think would be good for them. (I tend to lean toward preference utilitarianism myself, but don&#x27;t think the question is obvious.)</p><p>Andrew Forrester was against killing it, but justified his answer with something like &quot;it&#x27;s none of your business. You could provide convenient means of suicide if you wanted...&quot; This wasn&#x27;t an expression of not caring about the welfare of the golem. Rather, it was a way of saying that you want to preserve the golem&#x27;s autonomy.</p><p>I realized that although his answer was consistent with preference utilitarianism on the surface, it went beyond. I think he would likely have a similar response to the following thought experiment:</p><p><strong>Confused Golem:</strong><em> A golem hates every moment of its existence, and would prefer to die, but it is unable to admit the fact to itself. It thinks that it loves life and wants to continue living. Perhaps it could eventually realize that it preferred not to exist if it thought about the question for long enough, but that day is a long way off. Do you kill it?</em></p><p>The autonomy-preserving move is to not kill the confused golem. You might talk to the golem about what it wants, but you wouldn&#x27;t actively optimize for convincing it that it actually wants to die. (That would subtract from its autonomy.) </p><h1>Informed Consent?</h1><p>If I imagine something which is only motivated to help, where &quot;help&quot; is interpreted in the autonomy-centric way, it seems like the idea is an entity which only acts on your informed consent. It will sit and do nothing until it is confident that there is something which you want it to do, and understand the consequences of it doing.</p><p>Imagine you buy a robot which runs on these rules. The robot sits patiently in your house. Sitting there is not a violation of its directive, because it did not place itself there; whatever the consequences may be, they are a result of your autonomous action. However, it does watch you, which may violate informed consent. It has a high prior probability that you understand it is watching and consent to this, because the packaging had prominent warnings about this. Watching you is necessary for the robot to function, since it must infer your consent. It may shut off if it infers that you do not understand this.</p><p>The robot will continue doing nothing until it has gained confidence that you have fully read the instruction booklet, which contains the basic facts about how the robot functions. You may then issue commands to the robot. The instruction booklet recommends that, before you try this, you say &quot;I consent to discuss the meaning of my commands with you, the robot.&quot; This clears the robot to ask clarifying questions about commands and to tell you about the likely consequences of commands if it does not think you understand them. Without giving consent to this, the robot will often fail to do anything without offering any explanation for its failure.</p><p>Another recommended command is &quot;Let&#x27;s discuss how we can work together.&quot; This clears the robot to make general inquiries about how it should behave toward you. Once you issue this command, for the duration of the conversation, the robot will formulate intelligent questions about what you might want, what you like and dislike, where you struggle in your life, and so on. It will make suggestions about how it can help, many invented on the spot. At some point during the conversation it will likely ask if it should maintain this level of candor going forward, or if it should only discuss its tasks in such an open-ended way upon request.</p><h1>Gentle Value Extraction</h1><p>What the robot will <em>absolutely not</em> do during this initial interview is pry into your personal life with questions optimized to extract the maximum useful information about your values and life difficulties. Although that might be the most <em>useful</em> thing it could do during its initial interview with you, it would break your autonomy, because many humans are uncomfortable discussing certain topics, and breaking these norms is not a reasonable consequence to expect from the command you&#x27;ve issued. Since humans may not even wish to consent to the robot <em>knowing</em> various personal details (and may accidentally reveal enough information for the robot to figure things out), the robot has to tread lightly in its inferences, too. Even asking directly whether a certain topic is OK may be an unwanted and unexpected act, making it impossible to go there unless the human brings it up on their own initiative.</p><p>The robot might not even try to gently move the discussion in the direction of greater openness about private details, because &quot;trying to get the human to open up more&quot; is not an obvious consequence of discussing potential tasks. But it isn&#x27;t obvious; maybe trying to get people to open up is normal enough for a conversation that this is fine. The instruction booklet could warn users about it, making it an expected consequence and therefore part of what is consented to.</p><h1>Explicit Consent vs Inferred Consent</h1><p>At this point, someone might be thinking &quot;Why are you talking about the robot inferring that the human consents to certain things as reasonable expectations of giving certain commands? Why give so much leeway? We could just require explicit consent instead.&quot;</p><p>Explicit consent is so impractical as to border on meaninglessness. We want the robot to have some autonomy in how it executes commands. If it knows we like cream in our coffee, it makes sense for it to just put the cream in without asking every time, or us issuing a general rule. Cream in the coffee is a reasonable expectation. The way I think about it, an explicit consent requirement would force us to approve every motor command precisely; the freedom to intelligently carry out complex tasks in response to commands <em>requires</em> a certain amount of freedom to infer consent.</p><p>Another way of thinking about the problem is that explicit consent places dictionary-definition English in too much of a special position. We can convey our meaning in any number of ways. In a sufficiently information-rich context, a glance might be sufficient. </p><p>Turning things the other way around, there are also cases when explicit consent doesn&#x27;t make for inferred consent. If someone is made to consent under duress, consent should not be inferred.</p><p>The biggest argument I see in <em>favor</em> of explicit consent is that it makes for a much lower risk of misunderstanding. Misunderstanding is certainly a serious concern, and one reason why humans often require explicit consent in high-stakes situations. However, in the context of consent-based robotics, there are likely better ways of addressing the concern:</p><ul><li>Requiring higher confidence in inferred consent. This might be modulated by the inferred importance of the question in a situation, so that explicit consent is required in practice for anything of importance, due to the high confidence it establishes. Measuring &quot;importance&quot; in this way creates its own potential safety concerns, of course.</li><li>Using highly robust machine-learning techniques, so that spuriously high confidence in inferred consent is very unlikely.</li></ul><h1>What Does Informed Consent Mean?</h1><p>There&#x27;s a conceptual problem here which feels very similar to impact measures. An impact measure is supposed to quantify the extent to which an action changes things in general. Informed consent seems to require that we quantify the degree to which a change fits within certain expectations. The notion of &quot;change&quot; seems to be common between the two.</p><p>For example, at least according to my intuition, an impact measure should not penalize an AI much for the butterfly-effect changes in weather patterns which any action implies. The future will include hurricanes destroying cities in a broad variety of circumstances, and small actions may create large changes in which hurricanes / which cities. If a particular action foreseeably changes the <em>overall impact</em> of the hurricane/city pattern on <em>other</em> important variables in a significant way, <em>then</em> an impact measure should penalize it.</p><p>Similarly, a human can have informed consent as to the consequences of a robot going to the grocery store and buying bananas without understanding all the consequences on future weather patterns, even though this will involve some large changes to which hurricanes destroy which cities at some point later. On the other hand, if the robot walks to the grocery store in just the right way so as to cause a series of severe hurricanes to tip the right dominoes to cause a severe economic collapse which would otherwise not have happened, then this is a significant unexpected consequence of going to the grocery store which the human would need to consent to separately.</p><h1>Human Rationality Assumptions</h1><p>The bad news is that this approach seems likely to run into essentially all the same conceptual difficulties as value learning, if not more. Although the conceptual framework is not as strongly tied to VNM-style utility functions as value learning is, the robot still needs to infer what the human believes and wants: belief for the &quot;informed&quot; part, and want for the &quot;consent&quot; part. This still sounds like it is most naturally formulated in a VNM-ish framework, although there may be other ways. </p><p>As such, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it helps any with the difficulties of assuming human rationality.</p><h1>Helping Animals</h1><p>My friend mentioned that the suffering golem scenario depends a great deal on whether the golem is sentient. Mercy-killing suffering animals is OK, even good, without any consent. More generally, there are lots of acceptable ways of helping animals which break their autonomy in significant ways, such as taking them to the vet against protests. One might say the same thing of children.</p><p>It isn&#x27;t obvious what makes the difference, but one idea might be: where there is no <em>capacity</em> for informed consent, other principles may apply. But what would this imply for humans? There may be consequences of actions which we lack the capacity to understand. Should the robot simply try to optimize for our preferences on those issues, without constraining acceptable consequences by consent?</p><p>How should an autonomy-respecting robot interact with children? Respecting human autonomy absolutely might make it impossible to help with certain household tasks like changing diapers. If so, the approach might not result in very capable agents.</p><h1>Respecting All Humans</h1><p>So far, I&#x27;ve focused on a thought experiment of a robot respecting the autonomy of a single designated user. Ultimately, it seems like an approach to alignment has to deal with all humans. However, getting &quot;consent&quot; from all humans seems impossible. How can a consent-based approach approve any actions, then?</p><p>One idea is to only require consent from humans who are impacted by an action. Any action which impacts the whole future would require consent from everyone (?), but low-impact actions could be carried out with only consent from those involved.</p><p>It&#x27;s not clear to me how to approach this question.</p><h1>Connections to Other Problems</h1><ul><li>As I mentioned, this seems to connect to <strong>impact measures</strong>.</li><li>The agent as described also may be a <strong>mild optimizer</strong>, because (1) it has to avoid thinking about things when those things are not understood consequences of carrying out commands, (2) plans are constrained by the human probability distribution over plans, somehow (I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but there&#x27;s definitely an aspect of &quot;unexpected plans are not allowed&quot; in play here).</li><li>There is a connection to <strong>transparency</strong>, in that impacts of actions have to be described/understood (and approved) in order to be allowed.</li><li>The agent as I&#x27;ve described it sounds <strong>potentially corrigible</strong>, in that resistance to shutdown or modification would have to be an understood and approved consequence of a command.</li></ul>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>My initial reaction to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ExssKjAaXEEYcnzPd/conversational-cultures-combat-vs-nurture\">Combat vs Nurture</a> was to think &quot;I already <a href=\"http://lo-tho.blogspot.com/2014/12/epistemic-trust.html\">wrote</a> <a href=\"http://lo-tho.blogspot.com/2015/06/epistemic-trust-clarification.html\">about</a> <a href=\"http://lo-tho.blogspot.com/2015/12/levels-and-levels.html\">that</a>!&quot; and &quot;but there should be three clusters, not two&quot;. However, looking at my old posts, I see that my thinking has shifted since I wrote them, and I don&#x27;t describe the three clusters in quite the way I currently would. So, here is how I think about it:</p><ul><li><strong>&quot;Face Culture&quot; / &quot;Playing Team&quot;:</strong> When people offer ideas, their ego/reputation is on the line. It is therefore important to &quot;recognize the value of every contribution&quot; -- accepting or rejecting an idea has a strong undercurrent of accepting or rejecting the person offering the idea. This sometimes makes rational decision impossible; the value of team members is greater than the value of the specific decision, so incorporating input from a team member can be a higher priority than making the best decision. Much of the time, bad ideas <em>can</em> be discarded, but it involves a dance of &quot;due consideration&quot;: an idea may be entertained for longer than necessary in order to signal strongly that the team valued the input, and downsides may be downplayed to avoid making anyone look stupid. Eventually you want someone on the team to point out a decisive downside in order to reject a bad idea, but ideally you coax this out of the person who originated the idea. (I called this &quot;face culture&quot;, but I have heard people call it &quot;playing team&quot;.)</li><li><strong>Intellectual Debate: </strong>It is assumed that engaging with an idea involves arguing against it. Approving an idea doesn&#x27;t necessarily signal anything bad, but unlike face culture, arguing against an idea doesn&#x27;t signal anything bad either. Arguing against someone (genuinely or in a devil&#x27;s-advocate position) shows that you find the idea interesting and worth engaging with. Concepts like burden of proof are often applied; one tends to operate as if there were an <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ikMvvDgzFCSrYMRfd/the-problematic-third-person-perspective\">objective standard of truth</a> which both sides of the debate are accountable to. This warps the epistemic standards in a variety of ways, for example, making it unacceptable to bring raw intuitions to the table without putting them in justifiable terms (even if a raw intuition is your honest reason). However, if you have to choose between face culture and intellectual debate culture, intellectual debate is far better for making intellectual progress.</li><li><strong>Mutual Curiosity &amp; Exploration:</strong> I called this level &quot;intellectual honesty&quot; in my <a href=\"http://lo-tho.blogspot.com/2015/12/levels-and-levels.html\">old post</a>. This level is closer to the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement\">double crux</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aFyWFwGWBsP5DZbHF/circling\">circling</a>. In this type of conversation, there may still be some &quot;sides&quot; to debate, but everyone is on the side of the truth; there is no need for someone to take one side or the other, except to the extent that they hold some intuitions which haven&#x27;t been conveyed to others yet. In other words, it is more natural to weave around offering supporting/contrary evidence for various possibilities, instead of sticking to one side and defending it while attacking others. It is also more natural for there to be more than two possibilities on the table (or more possibilities than people in the conversation). People don&#x27;t need to have any initial disagreement in order to have this kind of conversation.</li></ul><p>Whereas Ruby&#x27;s Combat vs Nurture post put the two cultures on a roughly even footing, I&#x27;ve obviously created a hierarchy here. But, the hierarchy swings between the two poles of combat and nurture. Ruby mentioned that there&#x27;s a contrarian aspect to intellectual debate: the bluntness manages to be a countersignal to the more mainstream niceness signal, so that getting blunt responses actually signals social acceptance. Yet, Ruby also mentions that the culture amongst bay area rationalists is primarily nurture culture, seemingly aligning with the mainstream rather than the contrarian combat culture. I explain this by offering my three-layer cake above, with mutual curiosity and exploration being the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kcTNWopvXFncXgPy/intellectual-hipsters-and-meta-contrarianism\">meta-contrarian</a> position. Although it can be seen as a return to nurture culture, it still <em>significantly differs</em> from what I call face culture.</p><p>I&#x27;ve said this before, and I&#x27;ll say this again: placing these conversation cultures in a hierarchy from worse to better <em>does not mean that you should frown on &quot;lower&quot; strategies</em>. <strong>It is very important to meet a conversation at the level at which it occurs</strong>, respecting the games of face culture if they&#x27;re being played. You can try to gently move a conversation in a positive direction, but a big part of the point of my <a href=\"http://lo-tho.blogspot.com/2014/12/epistemic-trust.html\">original post</a> on this stuff was to say that the underlying cause of different conversational practices is the <em>level of intellectual trust</em> present. Face culture is a way to manage conversations where people lack common knowledge of trust (and perhaps lack actual trust), so must signal carefully. Intellectual debate requires a level of safety such that you don&#x27;t think an argument is a personal attack. Yet, at the same time, intellectual debate is a way of managing a discussion in which you can&#x27;t trust people to be detached from their own ideas; you expect people to be biased in favor of what they&#x27;ve proposed, so you embrace that dynamic and construct a format where intellectual progress can happen anyway. The level of mutual curiosity and exploration can only be reached when there is trust that everyone has some ability to get past that bias. (Actually, double crux seems like a bridge between intellectual debate and mutual exploration, since it still leans heavily on the idea of people taking sides.)</p><p>Having established a meta-contrarian hierarchy, we can extend the idea further. This stretches things a bit, and I&#x27;m less confident that the five levels which follow line up with reality as well as the three I give above, but it seems worth mentioning:</p><ul><li><strong>0. Open Verbal Combat:</strong> This is the &quot;lower&quot; level which face culture is a reaction to. Here, everyone&#x27;s ego is out in the open. There is still a veneer of plausible deniability around intellectual honesty: arguments would be meaningless if no one respected the truth at all and only argued what was convenient to them in the moment. However, at this level, that&#x27;s almost exclusively what&#x27;s happening. Even in cases where it looks like arguments are being respected for their undeniable force, there&#x27;s a lot of status dynamics in play; people are reacting to who they can expect to be on their side, and logic only has force as a coordinating signal.</li><li><strong>1. Face Culture.</strong></li><li><strong>2. Intellectual Debate.</strong></li><li><strong>3. Mutual Curiosity.</strong></li><li><strong>4. Exchanging Gears: </strong>Once everyone has a common framework of mutual curiosity, in which exchanging intuitions is acceptable and valued rather than <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ikMvvDgzFCSrYMRfd/the-problematic-third-person-perspective\">steamrolled by attempts at objectivity</a>, then a further evolution is possible, which involves a slight shift back towards combat culture. At this level, you don&#x27;t even worry very much about deciding on the truth of things. The focus is on exchanging possible models; you trust that everyone will go and observe the world later, and update in favor of the best models over a long period of time. Articulating and understanding models is the bottleneck, so it deserves most of the attention. I think this is what Ben Pace describes in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zucjLBpQ9S9eWPWGu\">Share Models, Not Beliefs</a>. However, this shift is smaller than the shifts between levels below this one (at least, in terms of what I currently understand).</li></ul><p>Again: <em>the biggest take-away from this should be that you want to <strong>meet a conversation at the level at which it is occurring</strong>. </em>If you are used to one particular culture, you are very likely to be blind to what&#x27;s going on in conversations following a different culture, and get frustrated or frustrate others. Read <a href=\"http://philosiology.blogspot.com/2011/04/surviving-philosopher-attack.html\">Surviving a Philosopher-Attack</a> if you haven&#x27;t, and keep in mind that responding from combat culture when someone is used to nurture culture can make people cry and never want to speak with you ever again.</p>",

The Protestant work ethic declared that hard work, discipline, and honesty would bring success. The “managerial work ethic” holds that a good employee has quite different “virtues” — things like</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ability to play politics</li>\n<li>loyalty &amp; willing to subordinate oneself to one’s manager</li>\n<li>“flexibility” (the opposite of stubbornness — not holding strong individual opinions)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To give an outside example, the author of “<a href=\"https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/11/western-elite-chinese-perspective/\">The Western Elite from a Chinese Perspective</a>” was coming from a “Protestant work ethic” culture of hard work (though not, of course, actually Protestant) and encountering the “managerial work ethic” culture of American office politics.</p>\n<p><em>Moral Mazes </em>relies on the author’s observations and interviews with managers. I’m sure it’s not a fully objective portrayal — perhaps the author selected the most damning quotes, and perhaps the most disgruntled and cynical managers were the most willing to talk.  But the picture the book gives is of a culture where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rank is everything — contradicting your boss, especially in public, is career suicide, and deference to superiors is expected</li>\n<li>beyond a certain minimum floor of competence, objective job performance doesn’t determine career success, political skill does</li>\n<li>“credit flows upwards, details flow downwards” — higher-rank managers take credit for work done by their subordinates, and the higher-rank you are, the fewer object-level details you concern yourself with</li>\n<li>mistakes and bad decisions are <em>reliably </em>concealed; then, when the inevitable catastrophe happens, whoever’s politically vulnerable takes the fall</li>\n<li>managers are tested for their “flexibility” — someone with strong opinions about the best engineering decisions or with rigid ethical principles will not rise far in their career</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you watch <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em>, Joel Maisel’s job at the plastics company is a classic example of the managerial work ethic; he’s basically a professional sycophant.  He’s burned out and unmotivated, and he leaves to “find himself” as a comedian, but quickly realizes he has no talent at comedy either.  Instead, working in his father’s garment business, he comes to life again.  He learns the nitty-gritty of the factory floor, the accounting, the machines, the seamstresses and their personal needs and strengths and weaknesses.  It’s a beautiful illustration of the difference between fake work and real work.</p>\n<p><em>An Everyone Culture</em>‘s prescription for the problems of deception, sycophancy, and stagnation in conventional companies is complex, but I’d summarize it as follows: creating a culture where <em>everyone talks about mistakes and improvements</em>, and <em>where the personal/professional boundaries are broken down.</em></p>\n<p>This sounds vaguely cultish and shocking, and indeed, the companies profiled (like Bridgewater) are often described as cults.  Kegan acknowledges that their practices are outside most of our comfort zones, but believes that nothing <em>inside </em>the range of what we think of as a normal workplace will solve workplace dysfunctions.</p>\n<p>What distinguishes the companies profiled in the book is a <em>lot </em>of talk, about issues that would ordinarily be considered too “personal” for work.  When someone makes a mistake, a DDO looks for the root cause, as you would in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen\">kaizen</a> system, but it won’t stop there — people will also ask what <em>personal or psychological </em>issue caused the mistake.  Does this person have a tendency towards overconfidence that they need to work on?  Were they afraid of looking bad?  Do they need to learn to consider others’ feelings more?</p>\n<p>It’s vulnerable to be laid bare in this way, but, at least in the ideal of a DDO, <em>everyone </em>does it, from the interns to the CEO, to the point that people internalize that <em>having flaws and a personal life is nothing to hide</em>. Some people would find this horrifically intrusive, but others find it a relief.</p>\n<p>I’ve never worked in a DDO, but I think I might like it; with enough mandated transparency, I’d be forced to override the temptation to hide flaws and make myself look better, and could focus better on actually <em>doing </em>good work.</p>\n<p>The cost, of course, is <em>way more communication</em> about seemingly non-work-related things. You’d be processing personal stuff with coworkers all the time. The hope is that this is actually cheaper than the costs of the bad decisions made when you don’t have enough honest communication, but it’s an empirical matter whether that works out in practice, and the authors don’t have data so far.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Ambitious value learning aims to achieve superhuman performance by figuring out the underlying latent &quot;values&quot; that humans have, and evaluating new situations according to these values. In other words, it is trying to infer the criteria by which we judge situations to be good. This is particularly hard because in novel situations that humans haven&#x27;t seen yet, we haven&#x27;t even developed the criteria by which we would evaluate. (This is one of the reasons why we need to model humans as suboptimal, which causes problems.)</p><p>Instead of this, we can use <em>narrow value learning</em>, which produces behavior that we want in some narrow domain, without expecting generalization to novel circumstances. The simplest form of this is imitation learning, where the AI system simply tries to imitate the supervisor&#x27;s behavior. This limits the AI’s performance to that of its supervisor. We could also learn from preferences over behavior, which can scale to superhuman performance, since the supervisor can often evaluate whether a particular behavior meets our preferences even if she can’t perform it herself. We could also teach our AI systems to perform tasks that we would not want to do ourselves, such as handling hot objects.</p><p>Nearly all of the work on preference learning, including most work on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), is aimed at narrow value learning. IRL is often explicitly stated to be a technique for imitation learning, and early algorithms phrase the problem as <em>matching</em> the features in the demonstration, not exceeding them. The few algorithms that try to generalize to different test distributions, such as AIRL, are only aiming for relatively small amounts of generalization.</p><p>(Why use IRL instead of behavioral cloning, where you mimic the actions that the demonstrator took? The hope is that IRL gives you a good inductive bias for imitation, allowing you to be more sample efficient and to generalize a little bit.)</p><p>You might have noticed that I talk about narrow value learning in terms of actual observed behavior from the AI system, as opposed to any sort of “preferences” or “values” that are inferred. This is because I want to include approaches like imitation learning, or meta learning for quick task identification and performance. These approaches can produce behavior that we want without having an explicit representation of “preferences”. In practice any method that scales to human intelligence is going to have to infer preferences, though perhaps implicitly.</p><p>Since any instance of narrow value learning is defined with respect to some domain or input distribution on which it gives sensible results, we can rank them according to how general this input distribution is. An algorithm that figures out what food I like to eat is very domain-specific, whereas one that determines my life goals and successfully helps me achieve them in both the long and short term is very general. When the input distribution is “all possible inputs”, we have a system that has good behavior everywhere, reminiscent of <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN\">ambitious value learning</a></u>.</p><p>(Annoyingly, I defined ambitious value learning to be about the <em>definition</em> of optimal behavior, such as an inferred utility function, while narrow value learning is about the observed behavior. So really the most general version of narrow value learning is equivalent to “ambitious value learning plus some method of actually obtaining the defined behavior in practice, such as by using deep RL”.)</p>",

(By default, User Profiles, All Posts and Daily will show all post types)</p><h2>GreaterWrong now gets better spam protection</h2><p>We had previously implemented a filter so that new user&#x27;s posts didn&#x27;t appear on the home page until approved by an admin. But this only applied to specific frontpage post views. Now, it applies to all views by default, so GreaterWrong should get less spam in their All Posts page.</p><h2>Password Resetting</h2><p>Resetting passwords should now work properly (previously it required an awkward workaround where you had to log out before you could reset it)</p>",

I've found that just 3 resources that cover the skill from 3 separate viewpoints(along with either daily practice or a project) is enough to quickly get all the pieces I need to learn the new skill.</p><p>I'm partial to books, so I've called this The 3 Books Technique, but feel free to substitute books for courses, mentors, or videos as needed.<br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oPEWyxJjRo4oKHzMu/ct8icmsbqukqazg6kpqd\" alt=\"Path 2: Make Learning Visible - Surface, Deep, Transfer | Department of  Education\"></p><h1>The \"What\" Book</h1><p>The \"What\" book is used as reference material. It should be a thorough resource that gives you a broad overview of your skill. If you run into a novel situation, you should be able to go to this book and get the information you need. It covers the \"surface\" section of the learning model from nature pictured above.</p><p>Positive reviews of this book should contain phrases like \"Thorough\" and \"Got me out of a pinch more than once.\" Negative reviews of this book should talk about \"overwhelming\" and \"didn't know where to start.\"</p><h1>The \"How\" Book</h1><p>The \"How\" Book explains the step-by-step, nuts and bolts of how to put the skill into practice. It often contains processes, tools, and steps. It covers the \"deep\" part of the learning model covered above.</p><p>Positive reviews of this book should talk about \"Well structured\" and \"Clearly thought out.\" Negative reviews should mention it being \"too rote\" or \"not enough theory.\"</p><h1>The \"Why\" Book</h1><p>The \"WHY\" book explains the mindset and intuitions behind the skill. It tries to get into the authors head and lets you understand what to do in novel situations. It should cover the \"transfer\" part of the learning model above.</p><p>Positive reviews of this book should talk about \"gaining intuitions\" or \"really understanding\". Negative reviews should contain phrases like \"not practical\" or \"still don't know what steps to take.\"</p><h1>The Project or Practice</h1><p>Once I have these 3 resources, I'll choose a single project or a daily practice that allows me to practice the skills from the \"How\" book and the mindsets from the \"Why\" book. If I get stuck, I'll use the \"What\" book to help me.</p><h1>Examples</h1><h2>Overcoming Procrastination</h2><p><strong>\"What\" Book: </strong>The Procrastination Equation by Piers Steel</p><p><strong>\"How\" Book:</strong> The Now Habit by Neil Fiore</p><p><strong>\"Why\" Book</strong>: The Replacing Guilt blog sequence by Nate Soares</p><p><strong>Project or Practice: </strong>Five pomodoros every day where I deliberately use the tools from the now habit and the mindsets from replacing guilt. If I find myself stuck, I'll choose from the plethora of techniques in the Procrastination Equation.</p><h2>Learning Calculus</h2><p><strong>\"What\" Book</strong>: A First Course in Calculus by Serge Lange</p><p><strong>\"How\" Book: </strong>The Khan Academy series on Calculus</p><p><strong>\"Why\" Book</strong>: The Essence of Calculus Youtube series by 3blue1brown</p><p><strong>Project or Practice: </strong>Daily practice of the Khan Academy calculus exercises.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This is a simple technique that I've found very helpful in systematizing my learning process.

I realized that I could get that easygoing feeling back and just route around this maladaptive mental pattern by labeling the post as &quot;bonus content&quot; to the question!

What is happening in the brain when a human questions? How has its meaning and etymology morphed over time? How do other languages conceptualize the act of questioning? What metaphors are useful to understanding what questioning is? What are unusual framings of the concept of questions? What are the different kinds of question? When is a question not a question? Do animals ever &#x27;ask questions&#x27;? Can questions be nonverbal? What does it feel like to have a question and to have that question resolved? What is the research on questions? What are their significance to human history? Do they actually exist? </p><p>Can you Taboo &quot;answers&quot;? How does one know when one has an answer? What is information? What is knowledge? Are answers always tentative? Can one predict when one will receive an answer? How do people go about seeking answers to their questions?</p><p>Can you compose a satisfying, useful, compact, and true model of what questions are?</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/nRMpYRW/Question-Mark.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>When I hear scientists talk about Thomas Kuhn, he sounds very reasonable. Scientists have theories that guide their work. Sometimes they run into things their theories can’t explain. Then some genius develops a new theory, and scientists are guided by that one. So the cycle repeats, knowledge gained with every step.</p>\n<p>When I hear philosophers talk about Thomas Kuhn, he sounds like a madman. There is no such thing as ground-level truth! Only theory! No objective sense-data! Only theory! No basis for accepting or rejecting any theory over any other! Only theory! No scientists! Only theories, wearing lab coats and fake beards, hoping nobody will notice the charade!</p>\n<p>I decided to read Kuhn’s <i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-50th-Anniversary/dp/0226458121/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547011449&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=structure+of+scientific+revolutions+kuhn&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;linkId=21b4b21745358e226bb26fdb31b5e305&amp;language=en_US\">The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions</a></i> in order to understand this better. Having finished, I have come to a conclusion: yup, I can see why this book causes so much confusion.</p>\n<p>At first Kuhn’s thesis appears simple, maybe even obvious. I found myself worrying at times that he was knocking down a straw man, although of course we have to <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/11/read-history-of-philosophy-backwards/\">read the history of philosophy backwards</a> and remember that Kuhn may already be in the water supply, so to speak. He argues against a simplistic view of science in which it is merely the gradual accumulation of facts. So Aristotle discovered a few true facts, Galileo added a few more on, then Newton discovered a few more, and now we have very many facts indeed.</p>\n<p>In this model, good science cannot disagree with other good science. You’re either wrong – as various pseudoscientists and failed scientists have been throughout history, positing false ideas like “the brain is only there to cool the blood” or “the sun orbits the earth”. Or you’re right, your ideas are enshrined in the Sacristry Of Settled Science, and your facts join the accumulated store that passes through the ages.</p>\n<p>Simple-version-of-Kuhn says this isn’t true. Science isn’t just facts. It’s <i>paradigms</i> – whole ways of looking at the world. Without a paradigm, scientists wouldn’t know what facts to gather, how to collect them, or what to do with them once they had them. With a paradigm, scientists gather and process facts in the ways the paradigm suggests (“normal science”). Eventually, this process runs into a hitch – apparent contradictions, or things that don’t quite fit predictions, or just a giant ugly mess of epicycles. Some genius develops a new paradigm (“paradigm shift” or “scientific revolution”). Then the process begins again. Facts can be accumulated within a paradigm. And many of the facts accumulated in one paradigm can survive, with only slight translation effort, into a new paradigm. But scientific progress is the story of one relatively-successful and genuinely-scientific effort giving way to a different and contradictory relatively-successful and genuinely-scientific effort. It’s the story of scientists constantly tossing out one another’s work and beginning anew.</p>\n<p>This gets awkward because paradigms look a lot like facts. The atomic theory – the current paradigm in a lot of chemistry – looks a lot like the fact “everything is made of atoms and molecules”. But this is only the iceberg’s tip. Once you have atomic theory, chemistry starts looking a lot different. Your first question when confronted with an unknown chemical is “what is the molecular structure?” and you have pretty good ideas for how to figure this out. You are not particularly interested in the surface appearance of chemicals, since you know that iron and silver can look alike but are totally different elements; you may be much more interested in the weight ratio at which two chemicals react (which might seem to the uninitiated like a pretty random and silly thing to care about). If confronted with a gas, you might ask things like “which gas is it?” as opposed to thinking all gases are the same thing, or wondering what it would even mean for two gases to be different. You can even think things like “this is a mixture of two different types of gas” without agonizing about how a perfectly uniform substance can be a mixture of anything. If someone asks you “How noble and close to God would say this chemical sample is?” you can tell them that this is not really a legitimate chemical question, unless you mean “noble” in the sense of the noble gases. If someone tells you a certain chemical is toxic because toxicity is a fundamental property of its essence, you can tell them that no, it probably has to do with some reaction it causes or fails to cause with chemicals in the body. And if someone tells you that a certain chemical has changed into a different chemical because it got colder, you can tell them that cold might have done something to it, it might even have caused it to react with the air or something, but chemicals don’t change into other chemicals in a fundamental way just because of the temperature. None of these things are obvious. All of them are hard-won discoveries.</p>\n<p>A field without paradigms looks like the STEM supremacist’s stereotype of philosophy. There are all kinds of different schools – Kantians, Aristotelians, Lockeans – who all disagree with each other. There may be progress within a school – some Aristotelian may come up with a really cool new Aristotelian way to look at bioethics, and all the other Aristotelians may agree that it’s great – but the field as a whole does not progress. People will talk past one another; the Aristotelian can go on all day about the telos of the embryo, but the utilitarian is just going to ask what the hell a telos is, why anyone would think embryos have one, and how many utils the embryo is bringing people. “Debates” between the Aristotelian and the utilitarian may not be literally impossible, but they are going to have to go all the way to first principles, in a way that never works. Kuhn interestingly dismisses these areas as “the fields where people write books” – if you want to say anything, you might as well address it to a popular audience for all the good other people’s pre-existing knowledge will do you, and you may have to spend hundreds of pages explaining your entire system from the ground up. He throws all the social sciences in this bin – you may read Freud, Skinner, and Beck instead of Aristotle, Locke, and Kant, but it’s the same situation.</p>\n<p>A real science is one where everyone agrees on a single paradigm. Newtonianism and Einsteinianism are the same kind of things as Aristotelianism and utilitarianism; but in 1850, everybody believed the former, and in 1950, the latter.</p>\n<p>I got confused by this – is Aristotelian philosophy a science? Would it be one if the Aristotelians forced every non-Aristotelian philosopher out of the academy, so that 100% of philosophers fell in line behind Aristotle? I <i>think</i> Kuhn’s answer to this is that it’s telling that Aristotelians haven’t been able to do this (at least not lately); either Aristotle’s theories are too weak, or philosophy too intractable. But all physicists unite behind Einstein in a way that all philosophers cannot behind Aristotle. Because of this, all physicists mean more or less the same thing when they talk about “space” and “time”, and they can work together on explaining these concepts without constantly arguing to each other about what they mean or whether they’re the right way to think about things at all (and a Newtonian and Einsteinian would <i>not</i> be able to do this with each other, any more than an Aristotelian and utilitarian).</p>\n<p>So how does science settle on a single paradigm when other fields can’t? Is this the part where we admit it’s because science has objective truth so you can just settle questions with experiments?</p>\n<p>This is very much not that part. Kuhn doesn’t think it’s anywhere near that simple, for a few reasons.</p>\n<p>First, there is rarely a single experiment that one paradigm fails and another passes. Rather, there are dozens of experiments. One paradigm does better on some, the other paradigm does better on others, and everyone argues over which ones should or shouldn’t count.</p>\n<p>For example, one might try to test the Copernican vs. Ptolemaic worldviews by observing the parallax of the fixed stars over the course of a year. Copernicus predicts it should be visible; Ptolemy predicts it shouldn’t be. It isn’t, which means either the Earth is fixed and unmoving, or the stars are unutterably unimaginably immensely impossibly far away. Nobody expected the stars to be that far away, so advantage Ptolemy. Meanwhile, the Copernicans posit far-off stars in order to save their paradigm. What looked like a test to select one paradigm or the other has turned into a wedge pushing the two paradigms even further apart.</p>\n<p>What looks like a decisive victory to one side may look like random noise to another. Did you know weird technologically advanced artifacts <a href=\"http://www.messagetoeagle.com/11-extraordinary-out-of-place-artifacts/\">are sometimes found</a> encased in rocks that our current understanding of geology says are millions of years old? Creationists have no trouble explaining those – the rocks are much younger, and the artifacts were probably planted by nephilim. Evolutionists have no idea how to explain those, and default to things like “the artifacts are hoaxes” or “the miners were really careless and a screw slipped from their pocket into the rock vein while they were mining”. I’m an evolutionist and I agree the artifacts are probably hoaxes or mistakes, even when there is no particular evidence that they are. Meanwhile, probably creationists say that some fossil or other incompatible with creationism is a hoax or a mistake. But that means the “find something predicted by one paradigm but not the other, and then the failed theory comes crashing down” oversimplification doesn’t work. Find something predicted by one paradigm but not the other, and often the proponents of the disadvantaged paradigm can – and should – just shrug and say “whatever”.</p>\n<p>In 1870, flat-earther Samuel Rowbotham performed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_Level_experiment\">a series of experiments</a> to show the Earth could not be a globe. In the most famous, he placed several flags miles apart along a perfectly straight canal. Then he looked through a telescope and was able to see all of them in a row, even though the furthest should have been hidden by the Earth’s curvature. Having done so, he concluded the Earth was flat, and the spherical-earth paradigm debunked. Alfred Wallace (more famous for pre-empting Darwin on evolution) took up the challenge, and showed that the bending of light rays by atmospheric refraction explained Rowbotham’s result. It turns out that light rays curve downward at a rate equal to the curvature of the Earth’s surface! Luckily for Wallace, refraction was already a known phenomenon; if not, it would have been the same kind of wedge-between-paradigms as the Copernicans having to change the distance to the fixed stars.</p>\n<p>It is all nice and well to say “Sure, it <i>looks</i> like your paradigm is right, but once we adjust for this new idea about the distance to the stars / the refraction of light, the evidence actually supports my paradigm”. But the supporters of old paradigms can do that too! The Ptolemaics are rightly mocked for adding epicycle after epicycle until their system gave the right result. But to a hostile observer, positing refraction effects that exactly counterbalance the curvature of the Earth sure looks like adding epicycles. At some point a new paradigm will win out, and its “epicycles” will look like perfectly reasonable adjustments for <a href=\"http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail\">reality’s surprising amount of detail</a>. And the old paradigm will lose, and its “epicycles” will look like obvious kludges to cover up that it never really worked. Before that happens…well, good luck.</p>\n<p>Second, two paradigms may not even address or care about the same questions.</p>\n<p>Let’s go back to utilitarianism vs. Aristotelianism. Many people associate utilitarianism with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problem</a>, which is indeed a good way to think about some of the issues involved. It might be tempting for a utilitarian to think of Aristotelian ethics as having some different answer to the trolley problem. Maybe it does, I don’t know. But Aristotle doesn’t talk about how he would solve whatever the 4th-century BC equivalent of the trolley problem was. He talks more about “what is the true meaning of justice?” and stuff like that. While you can twist Aristotle into having an opinion on trolleys, he’s not really optimizing for that. And while you can make utilitarianism have some idea what the true meaning of justice is, it’s not really optimized for that either.</p>\n<p>An Aristotelian can say their paradigm is best, because it does a great job explicating all the little types and subtypes of justice. A utilitarian can say <i>their</i> paradigm is best, because it does a great job telling you how to act in various contrived moral dilemmas.</p>\n<p>It’s actually even worse than this. The closest thing I can think of to an ancient Greek moral dilemma is the story of Antigone. Antigone’s uncle declares that her traitorous dead brother may not be buried with the proper rites. Antigone is torn between her duty to obey her uncle, and her desire to honor her dead brother. Utilitarianism is…not really designed for this sort of moral dilemma. Is ignoring her family squabbles and trying to cure typhus an option? No?</p>\n<p>But then utilitarianism’s problems are deeper than just “comes to a different conclusion than ancient Greek morals would have”. The utilitarian’s job isn’t to change the ancient Greek’s mind about the answer to a certain problem. It’s to convince him to stop caring about basically all the problems he cares about, and care about different problems instead.</p>\n<p>Third, two paradigms may disagree on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6i3zToomS86oj9bS6/mysterious-answers-to-mysterious-questions\">what kind of answers</a> are allowed, or what counts as solving a problem.</p>\n<p>Kuhn talks about the 17th century “dormitive potency” discourse. Aristotle tended to explain phenomena by appealing to essences; trees grew because it was “in their nature” to grow. Descartes gets a bad rap for inventing dualism, but this is undeserved – what he was really doing was inventing the concept of “matter” as we understand it, a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of stuff with no hidden essences that responds mechanically to forces (and once you have this idea, you naturally need some other kind of stuff to be the mind). With Cartesian matter firmly in place, everyone made fun of Aristotle for thinking he had “solved” the “why do trees grow?” question by answering “because it is in their nature”, and this climaxed with the playwright Moliere portraying a buffoonish doctor who claimed to have discovered how opium put people to sleep – it was because it had a dormitive potency!</p>\n<p>In Aristotle’s view of matter, saying “because it’s their essence” successfully answers questions like “why do trees grow?”. The Cartesian paradigm forbade this kind of answer, and so many previously “solved” problems like why trees grow became mysterious again – a step backwards, sort of. For Descartes, you were only allowed to answer questions if you could explain how purely-mechanical matter smashing against other purely-mechanical matter in a billiard-ball-like way could produce an effect; a more virtuous and Descartes-aware doctor explained opium’s properties by saying opium corpuscles must have a sandpaper-like shape that smooths the neurons!</p>\n<p>Then Newton discovered gravity and caused an uproar. Gravity posits no corpuscles jostling other corpuscles. It sounds almost Aristotelian: “It is the nature of matter to attract other matter”. Newton was denounced as trying to smuggle occultism into science. How much do you discount a theory for having occult elements? If some conception of quantum theory predicts the data beautifully, but says matter behaves differently depending on whether someone’s watching it or not, is that okay? What if it says that a certain electron has a 50% chance of being in a certain place, full stop, and there is no conceivable explanation for which of the two possibilities is realized, and you’re not even allowed to ask the question? What if my explanation for dark matter is “invisible gremlins”? How do you figure out when you need to relax your assumptions about what counts as science, versus when somebody is just cheating?</p>\n<p>A less dramatic example: Lavoisier’s theory of combustion boasts an ability to explain why some substances gain weight when burned; they are absorbing oxygen from the air. A brilliant example of an anomaly explained, which proves the superiority of combustion theory to other paradigms that cannot account for the phenomenon? No – “things shouldn’t randomly gain weight” comes to us as a principle of the chemical revolution of which Lavoisier was a part:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the seventeenth century, [an explanation of weight gain] seemed unnecessary to most chemists. If chemical reactions could alter the volume, color, and texture of the ingredients, why should they not alter weight as well? Weight was not always taken to be the measure of quantity of matter. Besides, weight-gain on roasting remained an isolated phenomenon. Most natural bodies (eg wood) lose weight on roasting as the phlogiston theory was later to say they should.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In previous paradigms, weight gain wasn’t even an anomaly to be explained. It was just a perfectly okay thing that might happen. It’s only within the constellation of new methods and rules we learned around Lavoisier’s time, that Lavoisier’s theories solved anything at all.</p>\n<p>So how <i>do</i> scientists ever switch paradigms?</p>\n<p>Kuhn thinks it’s kind of an ugly process. It starts with exasperation; the old paradigm is clearly inadequate. Progress is stagnating.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Awareness [of the inadequacy of geocentric astronomy] did come. By the thirteenth century Alfonso X could proclaim that if God had consulted him when creating the universe, he would have received good advice. In the sixteenth century, Copernicus’ coworker, Domenico da Novara, held that no system so cumbersome and inaccurate as the Ptolemaic had become could possibly be true of nature. And Copernicus himself wrote in the Preface to the De Revolutionibus that the astronomical tradition he inherited had finally created only a monster.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then someone proposes a new paradigm. In its original form, it is woefully underspecified, bad at matching reality, and only beats the old paradigm in a few test cases. For whatever reason, a few people jump on board. Sometimes the new paradigm is simply more mathematically elegant, more beautiful. Other times it’s petty things, like a Frenchman invented the old paradigm and a German the new one, and you’re German. Sometimes it’s just that there’s nothing better. These people gradually expand the new paradigm to cover more and more cases. At some point, the new paradigm explains things a little better than the old paradigm. Some of its predictions are spookily good. The old paradigm is never conclusively debunked. But the new paradigm now has enough advantages that more and more people hop on the bandwagon. Gradually the old paradigm becomes a laughingstock, people forget the context in which it ever made sense, and it is remembered only as a bunch of jokes about dormitive potency.</p>\n<p>But now that it’s been adopted and expanded and reached the zenith of its power, <i>this</i> is the point at which we can admit it’s objectively better, right?</p>\n<p>For a better treatment of this question than I can give, see Samzdat’s <a href=\"https://samzdat.com/2018/05/31/science-cannot-count-to-red-thats-probably-fine/\">Science Cannot Count To Red</a>. But my impression is that Kuhn is not really willing to say this. I think he is of the “all models are wrong, some are useful” camp, thinks of paradigms as models, and would be willing to admit a new paradigm may be more useful than an old one.</p>\n<p>Can we separate the fact around which a paradigm is based (like “the Earth orbits the sun”) from the paradigm itself (being a collection of definitions of eg “planet” and “orbit”, ways of thinking, mathematical methods, and rules for what kind of science will and won’t be accepted)? And then say the earth factually orbits the sun, and the paradigm is just a useful tool that shouldn’t be judged objectively? I think Kuhn’s answer is that facts cannot be paradigm-independent. A medieval would not hear “the Earth orbits the sun” and hear the same claim we hear (albeit, in his view wrong). He would, for example, interpret it to mean the Earth was set in a slowly-turning crystal sphere with the sun at its center. Then he might ask – where does the sphere intersect the Earth? How come we can’t see it? Is Marco Polo going to try to travel to China and then hit a huge invisible wall halfway across the Himalayas? And what about gravity? My understanding is the Ptolemaics didn’t believe in gravity as we understand it at all. They believed objects had a natural tendency to seek the center of the universe. So if the sun is more central, why isn’t everything falling into the sun? To a medieval the statement “the Earth orbits the sun” has a bunch of common-sense disproofs everywhere you look. It’s only when attached to the rest of the Copernican paradigm that it starts to make sense.</p>\n<p>This impresses me less than it impresses Kuhn. I would say “if you have many false beliefs, then true statements may be confusing in that they seem to imply false statements – but true statements are still objectively true”. Perhaps I am misunderstanding Kuhn’s argument here; the above is an amalgam of various things and not something Kuhn says outright in the book. But whatever his argument, Kuhn is not really willing to say that there are definite paradigm-independent objective facts, at least not without a lot of caveats.</p>\n<p>So where <i>is</i> the point at which we admit some things are objectively true and that’s what this whole enterprise rests on?</p>\n<p>Kuhn only barely touches on this, in the last page of the book:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anyone who has followed the argument this far will nevertheless feel the need to ask why the evolutionary process should work. What must nature, including man, be like in order that science be possible at all? Why should scientific communities be able to reach a firm consensus unattainable in other fields? Why should consensus endure across one paradigm change after another? And why should paradigm change invariably produce an instrument more perfect in any sense than those known before? From one point of view those questions, excepting the first, have already been answered. But from another they are as open as they were when this essay began. It is not only the scientific community that must be special. The world of which that community is a part must also possess quite special characteristics, and we are no closer than we were at the start to knowing what these must be. That problem— What must the world be like in order that man may know it?— was not, however, created by this essay. On the contrary, it is as old as science itself, and it remains unanswered. But it need not be answered in this place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At this point I lose patience. Kuhn is no longer being thought-provoking, he’s being disingenuous. IT’S BECAUSE THERE’S AN OBJECTIVE REALITY, TOM. YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE SO COY ABOUT IT. “OHHHHH, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY EXPLAIN WHY SCIENCE BEHAVES THE WAY IT WOULD IF OBJECTIVE REALITY EXISTS, NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW, LET’S JUST NEVER ANSWER IT”. Get a life.</p>\n<p>Honestly this decreases my trust in some of what’s come before. Maybe he wrote all those sections about incommensurable paradigms because paradigms really are that incommensurable. Or maybe it’s because he thinks he’s playing some kind of ridiculous game where the first person to admit the existence of objective reality loses.</p>\n<p><b>II.</b></p>\n<p>A lot of the examples above are mine, not Kuhn’s. Some of them even come from philosophy or other nonscientific fields. Shouldn’t I have used the book’s own examples?</p>\n<p>Yes. But one of my big complaints about this book is that, for a purported description of How Science Everywhere Is Always Practiced, it really just gives five examples. Ptolemy/Copernicus on astronomy. Alchemy/Dalton on chemistry. Phlogiston/Lavoisier on combustion. Aristotle/Galileo/Newton/Einstein on motion. And ???/Franklin/Coulomb on electricity.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t explain any of the examples. If you don’t already know what Coulomb’s contribution to electricity is and what previous ideas he overturned, you’re out of luck. And don’t try looking it up in a book either. Kuhn says that all the books have been written by people so engrossed in the current paradigm that they unconsciously jam past scientists into it, removing all evidence of paradigm shift. This made parts of the book a little beyond my level, since my knowledge of Coulomb begins and ends with “one amp per second”.</p>\n<p>Even saying Kuhn has five examples is giving him too much credit. He usually brings in one of his five per point he’s trying to make, meaning that you never get a really full view of how any of the five examples exactly fit into his system.</p>\n<p>And all five examples are from physics. Kuhn says at the beginning that he wished he had time to talk about how his system fits biology, but he doesn’t. He’s unsure whether any of the social sciences are sciences at all, and nothing else even gets mentioned. This means we have to figure out how Kuhn’s theory fits everything from scattershot looks at the history of electricity and astronomy and a few other things. This is pretty hard. For example, consider three scientific papers I’ve looked at on this blog recently:</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/26/ssc-journal-club-cipriani-on-antidepressants/\">Cipriani, Ioannidis, et al</a> perform a meta-analysis of antidepressant effect sizes and find that although almost all of them seem to work, amitriptyline works best.</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/1/5/e1400253.full.pdf\">Ceballos, Ehrlich, et al</a> calculate whether more species have become extinct recently than would be expected based on historical background rates; after finding almost 500 extinctions since 1900, they conclude they definitely have.</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/12/before-you-get-too-excited-about-that-github-study/\">Terrell et al</a> examine contributions to open source projects and find that men are more likely to be accepted than women when adjusted for some measure of competence they believe is appropriate, suggesting a gender bias.</p>\n<p>What paradigm is each of these working from?</p>\n<p>You could argue that the antidepressant study is working off of the “biological psychiatry” paradigm, a venerable collection of assumptions that can be profitably contrasted with other paradigms like psychoanalysis. But couldn’t a Hippocratic four-humors physician of a thousand years ago done the same thing? A meta-analysis of the effect sizes of various kinds of leeches for depression? Sure, leeches are different from antidepressants, but it doesn’t look like the belief in biological psychiatry is affecting anything about the research other than the topic. And although the topic is certainly important, Kuhn led me to expect something more profound than that. Maybe the paradigm is evidence-based-medicine itself, the practice of doing RCTs and meta-analyses on things? I think this is a stronger case, but a paradigm completely divorced from the content of what it’s studying is exactly the sort of weird thing that makes me wish Kuhn had included more than five examples.</p>\n<p>As for the extinction paper, surely it can be attributed to some chain of thought starting with Cuvier’s catastrophism, passing through Lyell, and continuing on to the current day, based on the idea that the world has changed dramatically over its history and new species can arise and old ones disappear. But is that “the” paradigm of biology, or ecology, or whatever field Ceballos and Lyell are working in? Doesn’t it also depend on the idea of species, a different paradigm starting with Linnaeus and developed by zoologists over the ensuing centuries? It look like it dips into a bunch of different paradigms, but is not wholly within any.</p>\n<p>And the open source paper? Is “feminism” a paradigm? But surely this is no different than what would be done to investigate racist biases in open source. Or some right-winger looking for anti-Christian biases in open source. Is the paradigm just “looking for biases in things?”</p>\n<p>What about my favorite trivial example, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/25/is-everything-a-religion/\">looking both ways when you cross the street so you don’t get hit by a bus?</a> Is it based on a paradigm of motorized transportation? Does it use assumptions like “buses exist” and “roads are there to be crossed”? Was there a paradigm shift between the bad old days of looking one way before crossing, and the exciting new development of looking both ways before crossing? Is this really that much more of a stretch than calling looking for biases in things a paradigm?</p>\n<p>Outside the five examples Kuhn gives from the physical sciences, identifying paradigms seems pretty hard – or maybe too easy. Is it all fractal? Are there overarching paradigms like atomic theory, and then lower-level paradigms like organic chemistry, and then tiny subsubparadigms like “how we deal with this one organic compound”? Does every scientific experiment use lots of different paradigms from different traditions and different levels? This is the kind of thing I wish Kuhn’s book answered instead of just talking about Coulumb and Copernicus over and over again.</p>\n<p><b>III.</b></p>\n<p>In conclusion, all of this is about predictive coding. </p>\n<p>It’s the same thing. Perception getting guided equally by top-down expectations and bottom-up evidence. Oh, I know what you’re thinking. “There goes Scott again, seeing predictive coding in everything”. And yes. But also, Kuhn does everything short of come out and say “When you guys get around to inventing predictive coding, make sure to notice that’s what I was getting at this whole time.”</p>\n<p>Don’t believe me? From the chapter <i>Anomaly And The Emergence Of Scientific Discovery</i> (my emphasis, and for “anomaly”, read “surprisal”):</p>\n<blockquote><p>The characteristics common to the three examples above are characteristic of all discoveries from which new sorts of phenomena emerge. Those characteristics include: the previous awareness of anomaly, the gradual and simultaneous emergence of both observational and conceptual recognition, and the consequent change of paradigm categories and procedures often accompanied by resistance. </p>\n<p><b>There is even evidence that these same characteristics are built into the nature of the perceptual process itself.</b> In a psychological experiment that deserves to be far better known outside the trade, Bruner and Postman asked experimental subjects to identify on short and controlled exposure a series of playing cards. Many of the cards were normal, but some were made anomalous, e.g., a red six of spades and a black four of hearts. Each experimental run was constituted by the display of a single card to a single subject in a series of gradually increased exposures. After each exposure the subject was asked what he had seen, and the run was terminated by two successive correct identifications. </p>\n<p>Even on the shortest exposures many subjects identified most of the cards, and after a small increase all the subjects identified them all. For the normal cards these identifications were usually correct, but the anomalous cards were almost always identified, without apparent hesitation or puzzlement, as normal. The black four of hearts might, for example, be identified as the four of either spades or hearts. Without any awareness of trouble, it was immediately fitted to one of the conceptual categories prepared by prior experience. One would not even like to say that the subjects had seen something different from what they identified. With a further increase of exposure to the anomalous cards, subjects did begin to hesitate and to display awareness of anomaly. Exposed, for example, to the red six of spades, some would say: That’s the six of spades, but there’s something wrong with it— the black has a red border. Further increase of exposure resulted in still more hesitation and confusion until finally, and sometimes quite suddenly, most subjects would produce the correct identification without hesitation. Moreover, after doing this with two or three of the anomalous cards, they would have little further difficulty with the others. A few subjects, however, were never able to make the requisite adjustment of their categories. Even at forty times the average exposure required to recognize normal cards for what they were, more than 10 per cent of the anomalous cards were not correctly identified. And the subjects who then failed often experienced acute personal distress. One of them exclaimed: “I can’t make the suit out, whatever it is. It didn’t even look like a card that time. I don’t know what color it is now or whether it’s a spade or a heart. I’m not even sure now what a spade looks like. My God!” In the next section we shall occasionally see scientists behaving this way too. </p>\n<p>Either as a metaphor or <b>because it reflects the nature of the mind</b>, that psychological experiment provides a wonderfully simple and cogent schema for the process of scientific discovery.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And from <i>Revolutions As Changes Of World-View</i>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Surveying the rich experimental literature from which these examples are drawn makes one suspect that something like a paradigm is prerequisite to perception itself. What a man sees depends both upon what he looks at and also upon what his previous visual-conceptual experience has taught him to see. In the absence of such training there can only be, in William James’s phrase, “a bloomin’ buzzin’ confusion.” In recent years several of those concerned with the history of science have found the sorts of experiments described above immensely suggestive.</b></p></blockquote>\n<p>If you can read those paragraphs and honestly still think I’m just just irrationally reading predictive coding into a perfectly innocent book, I have nothing to say to you.</p>\n<p>I think this is my best answer to the whole “is Kuhn denying an objective reality” issue. If Kuhn and the predictive coding people are grasping at the same thing from different angles, then both shed some light on each other. I think I understand the way that predictive coding balances the importance of pre-existing structures and categories with a preserved belief in objectivity. If Kuhn is trying to use something like the predictive coding model of the brain processing information to understand the way the scientific community as a whole processes it, then maybe we can import the same balance and not worry about it as much.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-50th-Anniversary/dp/0226458121/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547011449&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=structure+of+scientific+revolutions+kuhn&amp;linkCode=li2&amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;linkId=d21748afbf4f70cbe14324493e1afd6e&amp;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0226458121&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;language=en_US\" /></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=slatestarcode-20&amp;language=en_US&amp;l=li2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0226458121\" /></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>[An overview of why I didn’t write as much in 2018. Aversions snowballed, and the blog format led to having expectations about content I found sometimes hard to satisfy. A look back at some of my favorite posts of last year, as well as what I plan to do in 2019.]</em></p><p>In 2018, not counting the small essays that found their way to my <u><a href=\"https://owenshen24.github.io/muse/\">short-form blog</a></u>, I wrote 16 full-length blog posts. </p><p>I am disappointed by this because one of my constant goals with blogging is to write new essays every week. Partially, it feels bad because I <em>did</em> mostly succeed in hitting my original goal of weekly essays in both 2016 and 2017, so I felt like going for another year would be doable. And partially it feels bad because I feel like this means I’ve grown less as a person because I’ve had less bloggable thoughts, or something like that.</p><p>This is a blog post to dive into what happened with my blog posts in 2018.</p><p>Near the end of 2017  I went off to college, and it was then that I realized my writing schedule had taken a hit. Aside from adjusting to the environment, rationality-esque things felt less important and useful. There weren’t a lot of rationalists at school, I had less free time, social incentives produced different focuses, etc. etc.. Typical stuff. Thus, it seems like the outside view might have predicted a drop in my writing output. Looking at my <u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/01/05/two-year-review/\">2017 review post</a></u>, though, it seems like I was still enthusiastic and optimistic for 2018; I’d outlined some areas which I had wanted to explore.</p><p>Now, a year (and relatively few blog posts) later, it looks like things have gone contra my expectations, if not altogether awry.</p><p>Admitting that this has been a problem and addressing it has been difficult for me. For most of 2018, I had a large ball of guilt, wherein I kept reminding myself that I had this blog I was very much not attending to. In the rare moments where I would find the time and excitement to write a blog post, the feeling didn’t last. If I asked my gut what happened, I’d get an answer like:</p><p><em>“Well, it…just kinda snowballed, y’know? Like, I guess maybe I had some good thoughts, but then I wasn’t really interacting that much with the rationality community…then I had other things taking up time…and then I just…didn’t want to write all that much…and then I started to feel less like the sort of person who writes…and all the while I felt bad because I had this large archive of my previous thoughts kind of staring back at me like ‘Okay Owen, what are you gonna do next?’ and it felt hard to top some of my previous essays, or something like that.”</em></p><p>This essay has been a long-time coming. But it hasn’t been until now that I’ve found the time, inclination, and clarity to structure my thoughts on this topic. I’ve broken up my thoughts on writing (or my lack thereof) into three sections: Level Up or Shut Up, Static vs Evolving, and You Can Only Go So Meta.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>1] Level Up or Shut Up:</u></strong></p><p>One big chunk of the issue was that, from a personal growth perspective, I found myself hitting the same issues over and over again. It’s not just that I was rediscovering the same principles, but rather, I found myself struggling to do things I’d thought were obvious…like Doing The Obvious Things, or making TAPs when I wanted to make something a habit. </p><p>(There’s a larger question here of <em>why</em> I wasn’t progressing, why I kept running into the same roadblocks, and what this all means for rationality skills in general. For now, I’m just taking it as a given.)</p><p>I outlined this state of mind in <u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/05/25/coming-full-circle/\">Coming Full Circle</a></u>, where I felt like I’d already written essays about any sort of problem I might encounter. In a way, it felt like it meant I hadn’t “progressed”, or something like that, with regards to my rationality skills. As a result, I felt like I’d either be repeating myself in new blog posts or I’d have to wait until something else new and interesting came by (which didn’t happen often). </p><p>And if I kept writing about the same topics, it felt like I’d be admitting that rationality didn’t work, given that the very person who espoused these techniques (me) was still getting screwed over. Thus, fears of hypocrisy were also there.</p><p>I’ve mentioned this before, but I think that an issue with gratuitous categorization is that you might be able to recognize an issue—and then leave it at that, feeling lifted by the momentary satisfaction of naming a Thing. It becomes very easy to think <em>“Oh hey! I recognize that I’m currently having an issue with X! This situation fits pattern X!”</em>, whereupon I’d feel good for having made the connection between my current situation and an existing concept, but then I wouldn’t go any farther to solve it.</p><p>Problems are interesting when you tackle them for the first time, but I think there’s definitely a fading novelty thing going on here too, where the 17th time you realize <em>“Oh, I guess Murphyjitsu would have come in handy in this situation too”</em>, you begin to tire of it all.</p><p>(And once again, it says something about the quality of your solutions if they aren’t continuously effective, or if they become aversive to use. But we’re sidestepping that for now as well.)</p><p>Reflecting back on this now, the dichotomy between “write about the same stuff while looking like a hypocrite” and “wait long periods of time for novel ideas” was a false one. In <u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/04/28/meditations-on-the-medium/\">Meditations on the Medium</a></u>, I expressed frustration with essays being static snapshots. I think that the quality of explanations can always be made better. Even though I might already have had an essay that detailed whatever self-improvement things were on my mind that week, it could still have been useful to revisit the essay, update it, and maybe add some more recent examples.</p><p>But that doing so felt weird on a blog, where updates to older posts wouldn’t get immediately pushed back up to the top and shown. And speaking of the blog format… </p><p></p><p><strong><u>2] Static vs Evolving:</u></strong></p><p>When I’m writing blog posts, there’s always tension between several goals, which aren’t always complementary. The conflict can be succinctly summarized as a question of, “Am I writing this blog post for my benefit or the benefit of my readers?”, which is explored in <u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2017/11/03/writing-as-input-vs-writing-as-output/\">Writing as Input vs Writing as Output</a></u>.</p><p>On the one hand, I want to be able to use blog posts as a way to capture my current state of mind. There’s immediate short-term value in tracking what problems I’m currently facing and which thoughts are currently on my mind. <u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2017/07/15/explication/\">Explication</a></u> is useful for disambiguating concepts and fitting them into a larger structure. Focusing on the present, however, is necessarily going to date my posts. As I keep growing and changing, many of the posts get rendered obsolete, as they are no longer accurate portrayals of who I am, or become superseded by future essays.</p><p>On the other hand, I also want my blog posts to be as timeless as they can; the best case is that they stay useful even long after I’ve written them. In practice, this means I’d like for them to be crystallized explanations of concepts, so even if time passes, they can still serve as essays for future reference or pedagogy for future readers. However, optimizing for clarity of explanation is a longer process, requiring me to spend more time and attention on my essays.</p><p>It’s much easier to throw care to the winds and write what’s on my mind, than to try to craft something explanatorily useful. It seems like what I personally needed this year was more therapeutic stream-of-consciousness stuff, but I kept wanting to output more long-lived, crystallized content. The disconnect led to more aversion. One way I could have made more of a compromise was to keep privately writing periodic blog posts, and then do a later pass to cull the best stuff into public posts.</p><p>But of course that didn’t occur to me at the time. For 2019, one large project I want to undertake is to apply a stronger filter / polish on my existing posts. But more on that later.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>3] You Can Only Go So Meta:</u></strong></p><p>Also alluded to in Coming Full Circle, when you go ever meta on the writing process and rationality, you start to hit some conceptual limits; it feels like you’ve categorized everything that there is. In the beginning of Chapter 6 of <em><u><a href=\"https://equilibriabook.com/against-modest-epistemology/\">Inadequate Equilibria</a></u></em> (ctrl-f for “In other words”), Yudkowsky goes over some general guidelines for thinking, where he writes:</p><p><em>“Try to spend most of your time thinking about the object level. If you’re spending more of your time thinking about your own reasoning ability and competence than you spend thinking about Japan’s interest rates and NGDP, or competing omega-6 vs. omega-3 metabolic pathways, you’re taking your eye off the ball.”</em></p><p>And, well, mindlevelup is a pretty meta blog… </p><p>Speaking generally, I think it <em>is</em> good to be focused on object-level things. There’s a pattern of dive into something object-level → muck around for a bit → discover new things → generalize to a larger concept. The important part of this process is that, in order to be discovering new connections in the direction of “specific to general”, you need to be constantly interacting with the world. Along the same lines as <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Sdx6A6yLByRRs8iLY/fact-posts-how-and-why\">fact posts</a></u>, I think there’s more object-level stuff I haven’t explored.</p><p>For example, I think that I carved out a set of useful thoughts about relationships when I started a romantic relationship. Similarly, much of my time in university is spent doing computer science; presumably there are more fact-based posts I could make, where I write about something technical. A lot of the good Paul Graham stuff, too, seems to be drawing a lot of his insights from his time spent “in the field”. Meta-level stuff has a self-referential flavor which I think makes it so appealing to the nerd-types (of whom I’d count myself a member). It also makes it easy to get tangled up in the structure of concepts and trick yourself into thinking you’re gaining insight. </p><p>Sticking to something more concrete and “real” gives you better feedback and potentially more useful thoughts. Still, though, I can’t shake my feeling of disappointment at the state of self-help. There is a book on self-help that I wish existed, and it currently doesn’t exist. I’d like to write this book, if only in bits and pieces at a time, fractured into snippets of blog posts. This is definitely an excuse-of-sorts to keep writing meta-stuff, but, sigh, I wish that the state of meta-level self-help was just <em>better</em>.</p><p>(Of course there are reasons why self-help doesn’t look like the structured edifice of mental models that I wish it did, but that’s also a topic for another time.)</p><p></p><p><strong><u>Reviewing 2018:</u></strong></p><p>That all being said, it’s not like I wrote nothing at all in 2018. Just less. And the posts that did get written were, I feel, at least of similar, if not greater quality, than my best stuff in years past. Some essays have already been alluded to above, but, at the risk of some redundancy,  here’s a quick overview of my favorite posts of this year:</p><ol><li><u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/01/27/replace-stereotypes-with-experiences/\">Replace Stereotypes with Experiences</a></u> points out a common categorization error I’d found myself making. Even now, I seem to mix up initial aesthetic / affect with the actual sensory feeling I’d get while engaging in a topic. This feels ingrained, in the same way that things like the halo effect prey on our surface-level impressions.<br/></li><li><u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/03/11/a-developmental-framework-for-rationality/\">A Developmental Framework for Rationality</a></u> did a good job of outlining how I progressed throughout rationality. I was inspired by Kegan’s levels of adult development. Of course, now, it seems I’ve regressed or something, but I think the core ideas of shifting priorities about what rationality is “really” about still hits the nail on the head.<br/></li><li><u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/04/28/meditations-on-the-medium/\">Meditations on the Medium</a></u> represents a good collection of innovative thoughts and frustrations I have with text as a medium. I think especially now, having reflective essays on the nature of knowledge representation is high-value. Computers and digital mediums are allowing for several new degrees of freedom, and I think this stuff is underexplored.<br/></li><li><u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/08/31/normative-vs-descriptive-confusions/\">Normative vs Descriptive Confusions</a></u> gave me more clarity towards an internal conflict, brought on by the increased fluidity I had started to view myself with. Though I don’t I’ve got a full answer yet, I like this framing. It also started out as a more of “okay, let’s try to just get this mess of thoughts I have onto paper into something more structured”, and I think it does a passable job of straddling the line between “represent my state of mind at that time” and “walk new readers towards my conclusions”.<br/></li><li><u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/07/27/fading-novelty-2/\">Fading Novelty</a></u> finally outlined my stab at the Big Experiential Phenomenon that I think about a lot. As a phenomenon, it appears to be largely entwined with how we live life, i.e. in how humans continuously seeking out new experiences, which makes it difficult to look at in isolation. But I’m glad I now have a semi-well-structured essay to serve as a central point, after making several implicit references.<br/></li><li><u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2018/11/17/letting-others-be-vulnerable/\">Letting Others Be Vulnerable</a></u> got shared a lot on Facebook, and it presented a crystallization of a model about accepting others I’d been mulling on for a while. It’s also probably the most coherent and organized out of my posts on things related to the social sphere.</li></ol><p>So those are some of my favorite posts from this year.</p><p>Here are the other stats for 2018, compared to 2016 and 2017:</p><p>Words written:</p><p>In 2016: 30,000 words.</p><p>In 2017: 75,000 words.</p><p>In 2018: 23,000 words.</p><p>So I ended up writing even less than I did in 2016.</p><p>Given that I wrote less, it makes sense that I received less views.</p><p>Page views:</p><p>In 2016: 4,912 views.</p><p>In 2017: 17,914 views.</p><p>In 2018: 11,869 views.</p><p>In 2017, I tracked my time with Toggl and found that around 200 hours were spent writing MLU posts. I have since stopped using Toggl, and I don’t know how much time I spent writing blog posts this year. A rough estimate is 2 hours per 1000 words, so I probably spent around 50 hours this year.</p><p>And, that’s what it is.</p><p>I think 3 years is a long time to be blogging. If you add up all the stuff that I’ve written, it’s around 120,000 words, which is enough to fill a book. Like in previous years, I’ve taken the time to compile all of 2018’s posts into a PDF for offline reading. It’s on the Post Compilations page now.</p><p>One question I’ve been wondering on and off is, “How do blogs die?” </p><p>I often stumble across interesting blogs on the internet with a large archive of posts…and no formal farewell at the end? I guess it’s maybe a more gradual thing, as the authors move on to other pursuits. And maybe I’m a stickler for closure, but I can’t help wanting some sort of acknowledgment of things left unfinished—but of course I’ve felt the same slow disengagement myself, so I can sympathize.</p><p>Several times this year, as I struggled to churn out blog posts, I wondered if it wasn’t easier to just make an official hiatus post and let myself just live without the burden of writing at the back of my mind. Yet, in the same way that <u><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2017/03/24/act-into-uncertainty/\">uncertainty can be comforting</a></u>, it felt like <em>not</em> writing such a post would enable me to keep telling myself that I was making progress. </p><p>“It’s not an official end yet!” I wanted to cry out. Not as if that helped, really. The blog posts still sputtered.</p><p>My prediction in the beginning of the year for 2018 was 3 primers and 50,000 words. I hit a little under half of that, and there were no real primers that got written.</p><p>For 2019, I’m more aware of the pitfalls and changes that I’ll go through. I don’t know if the right move is to just stop making goals. There are still things I want to write about. I just don’t feel like pushing myself as much to get them done, outside of maintaining a consistent schedule. </p><p>I sort of wish I could go back to a weekly schedule, where I’d feel excited to explore different concepts, but there’s mental stuff in the way, i.e. the things I outlined above.</p><p>But, more concretely… </p><p></p><p><strong><u>Into 2019:</u></strong></p><p>When writing for this year, I want to keep doing the introspective stuff that helps me with explicating my own thoughts, goals, priorities, and worries. I also want to devote more time to a showcase of the best of my writing, creating a new blog where I can put The Good Stuff in a way to maximize readability / pedagogy. In other words, I’d like to separate my thoughts into the messy stuff (which might be private) versus the readable stuff, and then I’d want to post them to different places.</p><p>What would the new public showcase look like?</p><p>What I want is a nice looking statically generated blog that gives me more control to try experimental UI features. Wordpress is very nice for analytics and easily deploying posts, but I don’t really care for either of those features right now.</p><p>I think <u><a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/\">Read The Sequences</a></u> is a really good example of the sort of aesthetic I want to shoot for, of a well-polished series of essays written in a clear fashion. <u><a href=\"https://meaningness.com/\">Meaningness</a></u>, to a lesser extent, has also influenced my aesthetic views.</p><p>I already have the seed of some code with <u><a href=\"https://github.com/owenshen24/Volta\">Volta</a></u>, a small Python script which turns my markdown files into HTML. So there’s not too much work that’s needed to put together this new site. The final part would be, of course, culling the content / re-editing things to make a more coherent collection.</p><p>There’s a lot about this idea that I’m excited about. However, I also know that writing has dropped as a priority for me, whether I want to admit it or not. Realistically, I don’t expect to have a lot of time in the short-term where I’ll feel excited to make large amounts of progress on this project.</p><p><strong>That’s why I’ve decided to give myself a complete break, guilt-free, from writing anything major and public for the next three months.</strong></p><p>It feels like the biggest ball of bad-feels I have inside of me is worrying about fully losing my rationality faculties if I stop writing, but, looking back, my writing has already been rather sparse. I’d rather spend some time just doing more stuff in the world and come back with a fresher take on things.</p><p>I might write some more things between now and April, but I won’t hold myself to it.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/\">AlphaGo Zero</a> is an impressive demonstration of AI capabilities. It also happens to be a nice proof-of-concept of a <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/benign-model-free-rl-4aae8c97e385\">promising alignment strategy</a>.</p><h2>How AlphaGo Zero works</h2><p>AlphaGo Zero learns two functions (which take as input the current board):</p><ul><li>A prior over moves <strong>p</strong> is trained to predict what AlphaGo will eventually decide to do.</li><li>A value function <strong>v</strong> is trained to predict which player will win (if AlphaGo plays both sides)</li></ul><p>Both are trained with supervised learning. Once we have these two functions, AlphaGo actually picks it moves by using 1600 steps of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), using <strong>p</strong> and <strong>v</strong> to guide the search. It trains <strong>p</strong> to bypass this expensive search process and directly pick good moves. As <strong>p</strong> improves, the expensive search becomes more powerful, and <strong>p</strong> chases this moving target.</p><h2>Iterated capability amplification</h2><p>In the simplest form of <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/benign-model-free-rl-4aae8c97e385\">iterated capability amplification</a>, we train one function:</p><ul><li>A “weak” policy <strong>A</strong>, which is trained to predict what the agent will eventually decide to do in a given situation.</li></ul><p>Just like AlphaGo doesn’t use the prior <strong>p</strong> directly to pick moves, we don’t use the weak policy <strong>A</strong> directly to pick actions. Instead, we use a <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34\">capability amplification</a> scheme: we call <strong>A</strong> many times in order to produce more intelligent judgments. We train <strong>A</strong> to bypass this expensive amplification process and directly make intelligent decisions. As <strong>A</strong> improves, the amplified policy becomes more powerful, and <strong>A</strong> chases this moving target.</p><p>In the case of AlphaGo Zero, <strong>A</strong> is the prior over moves, and the amplification scheme is MCTS. (More precisely: <strong>A</strong> is the pair (<strong>p</strong>, <strong>v</strong>), and the amplification scheme is MCTS + using a rollout to see who wins.)</p><p>Outside of Go, <strong>A</strong> might be a question-answering system, which can be applied several times in order to first break a question down into pieces and then separately answer each component. Or it might be a policy that updates a <a href=\"https://blog.ought.com/dalca-4d47a90edd92\">cognitive workspace</a>, which can be applied many times in order to “think longer” about an issue.</p><h2>The significance</h2><p>Reinforcement learners take a reward function and optimize it; unfortunately, it’s not clear where to get a reward function that faithfully tracks what we care about. That’s a key source of safety concerns.</p><p>By contrast, AlphaGo Zero takes a policy-improvement-operator (like MCTS) and converges towards a fixed point of that operator. If we can find a way to improve a policy <em>while preserving its alignment</em>, then we can apply the same algorithm in order to get very powerful but aligned strategies.</p><p>Using MCTS to achieve a simple goal in the real world wouldn’t preserve alignment, so it doesn’t fit the bill. But “<a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/humans-consulting-hch-f893f6051455\">think longer</a>” might. As long as we start with a policy that is <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">close enough</a> to being aligned — a policy that “wants” to be aligned, in some sense — allowing it to think longer may make it both smarter <em>and</em> more aligned.</p><p>I think designing alignment-preserving policy amplification is a tractable problem today, which can be studied either in the context of existing ML or human coordination. So I think it’s an exciting direction in AI alignment. A candidate solution could be incorporated directly into the AlphaGo Zero architecture, so we can already get empirical feedback on what works. If by good fortune powerful AI systems look like AlphaGo Zero, then that might get us much of the way to an aligned AI.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>This was originally posted <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/alphago-zero-and-capability-amplification-ede767bb8446\">here</a> on 19th October 2017. </em></p><p><em>Tomorrow&#x27;s AI Alignment Forum sequences will continue with a pair of posts, &#x27;What is narrow value learning&#x27; by Rohin Shah and &#x27;Ambitious vs. narrow value learning&#x27; by Paul Christiano, from the sequence on Value Learning.</em></p><p><em>The next post in this sequence will be &#x27;Directions for AI Alignment&#x27; by Paul Christiano on Thursday.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>[UPDATE: I have concluded that the argument in this post is wrong. In particular, consider a generative model. Say the generative model has a choice between two possible &#x27;fixed point&#x27; predictions A and B, and currently assigns A 70% probability and B 30% probability. Then the target distribution it is trying to match is A 70 % B 30%, so it will just stay like that forever(or drift, likely increasing the proportion of A). This is true even if B is easier to obtain good predictions for -- the model will shift from &quot;70 % crappy model of A / 30% good model to B&quot; --&gt; &quot;70% slightly better model of A / 30% good model of B&quot;. It won&#x27;t increase the fraction of B. </p><p>In general this means that the model should converge to a distribution of fixed points corresponding to the learning bias of the model -- &#x27;simpler&#x27; fixed points will have higher weight. This might end up looking kind of weird anyway, but it won&#x27;t perform optimization in the sense I described below.] </p><p><br/>In machine learning, we can make the distinction between predictive and agent-like systems. Predictive systems include classifiers or language models. Agent-like systems are the domain of reinforcement learning and include <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf\">AlphaZero</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/\">OpenAI Five</a>, etc. While predictive systems are passive, modelling a relationship between input and output, agent-like systems perform optimization and planning.<br/><br/>It&#x27;s well-known around here that agent-like systems trained to optimize a given objective can exhibit behavior unexpected by the agent&#x27;s creators. It is also known that systems trained to optimize one objective can end up optimizing for another, because optimization can <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Optimization_daemons\">spawn sub-agents with different objectives</a>. Here I present another type of unexpected optimization: in realistic settings, systems that are trained purely for prediction can end up behaving like agents.<br/><br/>Here&#x27;s how it works. Say we are training a predictive model on video input. Our system is connected to a video camera in some rich environment, such as an AI lab. It receives inputs from this camera, and outputs a probability distribution over future inputs(using something like a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114\">VAE</a>, for instance). We train it to minimize the divergence between its predictions and the actual future inputs, exponentially decaying the loss for inputs farther in the future.<br/><br/>Because the predictor is embedded in the environment, its predictions are not just predictions; they affect the future dynamics of the environment. For example, if the predictor is very powerful, the AI researchers could use it to predict how a given research direction or hiring decision will turn out, by conditioning the model on making that decision. Then their future actions will depend on what the model predicts. <br/><br/>If the AI system is powerful enough, it will learn this; its model of the environment will include its own predictions. For it to obtain an accurate prediction, it must output a fixed-point: a prediction about future inputs which, when instantiated in the environment, causes that very prediction to come about. The theory of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04145\">reflective oracles </a>implies that such (randomized) fixed points must exist; if our model is powerful enough, it will be able to find them.<br/><br/>The capacity for agency arises because, in a complex environment, there will be multiple possible fixed-points. It&#x27;s quite likely that these fixed-points will differ in how the predictor is scored, either due to inherent randomness, logical uncertainty, or computational intractability(predictors could be powerfully superhuman while still being logically uncertain and computationally limited). Then the predictor will output the fixed-point on which it scores the best.<br/><br/>As a simple example, imagine a dispute between two coworkers, Alice and Bob, in the AI lab; each suspects the other of plotting against them. If Bob is paranoid, he could check the predictions of the AI system to see what Alice will do. If the AI system predicts that Alice will publicly denounce Bob, this could confirm his suspicions and cause him to spread rumors about Alice, leading her to publicly denounce him. Or, if the AI system predicts that Alice will support Bob on a key issue, Bob could conclude he was wrong all along and try to reconcile with Alice, leading her to support him on a key issue. The AI system will prefer to output whichever branch of the prediction is simpler to predict.<br/><br/>A more extreme example. If the predictor is VERY superhuman, it could learn an adversarial fixed-point for humans: a speech which, when humans hear it, causes them to repeat the speech, then commit suicide, or otherwise act in a very predictable manner. It&#x27;s not clear if such a speech exists; but more broadly, in a complex environment, the set of fixed-points is probably very large. Optimizing over that set can produce extreme outcomes.<br/><br/>These same problems could arise within AI systems which use predictors as a component, like <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/an-unaligned-benchmark-b49ad992940b\">this system</a>, which contains a predictive model optimized for predictive accuracy, and a policy network optimizing for some objective. The policy network&#x27;s decisions will depend on what the predictive model says is likely to happen, influencing what the predictive model ends up seeing. The predictor could then steer the overall system towards more predictable fixed-points, even if those fixed-points obtain less value on the objective the policy network is supposed to be optimizing for. <br/><br/>To some extent, this seems to undermine the orthogonality thesis; an arbitrary predictor can&#x27;t just be plugged into an arbitrary objective and be counted on to optimize well. From the perspective of the system, it will be trying to optimize its objective as well as it can given its beliefs; but those &#x27;beliefs&#x27; may themselves be optimized for something quite different. In self-referential systems, beliefs and decisions can&#x27;t be easily separated.</p>",

In particular, you can <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/dqMSZj\">sign up</a>, or look through this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PwWbWZ6FPqAgZWOoOcXM8N_tUCuxpEyMbN1NYYC02aM/edit?usp=sharing\">spreadsheet</a> of all summaries that have ever been in the newsletter.</p><p>The Alignment Forum sequences have started again! As a reminder, treat them as though I had highlighted them.</p><h1>Highlights</h1><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reframing/\">Reframing Superintelligence: Comprehensive AI Services as General Intelligence</a></strong> <em>(Eric Drexler)</em>: This is a huge document; rather than summarize it all in this newsletter, I wrote up my summary in <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services\">this post</a>. For this newsletter, I&#x27;ve copied over the description of the model, but left out all of the implications and critiques.</p><p>The core idea is to look at the pathway by which we will develop general intelligence, rather than assuming that at some point we will get a superintelligent AGI agent. To predict how AI will progress in the future, we can look at how AI progresses currently -- through research and development (R&amp;D) processes. AI researchers consider a problem, define a search space, formulate an objective, and use an optimization technique in order to obtain an AI system, called a service, that performs the task.</p><p>A service is an AI system that delivers bounded results for some task using bounded resources in bounded time. Superintelligent language translation would count as a service, even though it requires a very detailed understanding of the world, including engineering, history, science, etc. Episodic RL agents also count as services.</p><p>While each of the AI R&amp;D subtasks is currently performed by a human, as AI progresses we should expect that we will automate these tasks as well. At that point, we will have automated R&amp;D, leading to recursive technological improvement. This is not recursive self-improvement, because the improvement comes from R&amp;D services creating improvements in basic AI building blocks, and those improvements feed back into the R&amp;D services. All of this should happen before we get any powerful AGI agents that can do arbitrary general reasoning.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I&#x27;m glad this has finally been published -- it&#x27;s been informing my views for a long time now. I broadly buy the general view put forward here, with a few nitpicks that you can see in <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services\">the post</a>. I really do recommend you read at least the post -- that&#x27;s just the <em>summary</em> of the report, so it&#x27;s full of insights, and it should be interesting to technical safety and strategy researchers alike.</p><p>I&#x27;m still not sure how this should affect what research we do -- techniques like preference learning and recursive reward modeling seem applicable to CAIS as well, since they allow us to more accurately specify what we want each individual service to do.</p><h1>Technical AI alignment</h1><h2>Iterated amplification sequence</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/xKvzpodBGcPMq7TqE/supervising-strong-learners-by-amplifying-weak-experts\">Supervising strong learners by amplifying weak experts</a> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em>: This was previously covered in <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/c1f376f3a12e/alignment-newsletter-30\">AN #30</a>, I&#x27;ve copied the summary and opinion. This paper introduces iterated amplification, focusing on how it can be used to define a training signal for tasks that humans cannot perform or evaluate, such as designing a transit system. The key insight is that humans are capable of decomposing even very difficult tasks into slightly simpler tasks. So, in theory, we could provide ground truth labels for an arbitrarily difficult task by a huge tree of humans, each decomposing their own subquestion and handing off new subquestions to other humans, until questions are easy enough that a human can directly answer them.</p><p>We can turn this into an efficient algorithm by having the human decompose the question only once, and using the current AI system to answer the generated subquestions. If the AI isn&#x27;t able to answer the subquestions, then the human will get nonsense answers. However, as long as there are questions that the human + AI system can answer but the AI alone cannot answer, the AI can learn from the answers to those questions. To reduce the reliance on human data, another model is trained to predict the decomposition that the human performs. In addition, some tasks could refer to a large context (eg. evaluating safety for a specific rocket design), so they model the human as being able to access small pieces of the context at a time.</p><p>They evaluate on simple algorithmic tasks like distance between nodes in a graph, where they can program an automated human decomposition for faster experiments, and there is a ground truth solution. They compare against supervised learning, which trains a model on the ground truth answers to questions (which iterated amplification does not have access to), and find that they can match the performance of supervised learning with only slightly more training steps.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This is my new favorite post/paper for explaining how iterated amplification works, since it very succinctly and clearly makes the case for iterated amplification as a strategy for generating a good training signal. I&#x27;d recommend reading the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08575\">paper</a> in full, as it makes other important points that I haven&#x27;t included in the summary.</p><p>Note that it does not explain a lot of Paul&#x27;s thinking. It explains one particular training method that allows you to train an AI system with a more intelligent and informed overseer.</p><h2>Value learning sequence</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9zpT9dikrrebdq3Jf/will-humans-build-goal-directed-agents\">Will humans build goal-directed agents?</a> <em>(Rohin Shah)</em>: The <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NxF5G6CJiof6cemTw/coherence-arguments-do-not-imply-goal-directed-behavior\">previous post</a> argued that coherence arguments do <em>not</em> mean that a superintelligent AI must have goal-directed behavior. In this post, I consider other arguments suggesting that we&#x27;ll build goal-directed AI systems.</p><p>- Since humans are goal-directed, they will build goal-directed AI to help them achieve their goals. <em>Reaction:</em> Somewhat agree, but this only shows that the human + AI system should be goal-directed, not the AI itself.</p><p>- Goal-directed AI can exceed human performance. <em>Reaction:</em> Mostly agree, but there could be alternatives that still exceed human performance.</p><p>- Current RL agents are goal-directed. <em>Reaction:</em> While the math says this, in practice this doesn&#x27;t seem true, since RL agents learn from experience rather than planning over the long term.</p><p>- Existing intelligent agents are goal-directed. <em>Reaction:</em> Seems like a good reason to not build AI using evolution.</p><p>- Goal-directed agents are more interpretable and so more desirable. <em>Reaction:</em> Disagree, it seems like we&#x27;re arguing that we should build goal-directed AI so that we can more easily predict that it will cause catastrophe.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/tHxXdAn8Yuiy9y2pZ/ai-safety-without-goal-directed-behavior\">AI safety without goal-directed behavior</a> <em>(Rohin Shah)</em>: The main thrust of the second chapter of the sequence is that it is not <em>required</em> for a superintelligent AI system to be goal-directed. While there are certainly economic arguments suggesting that we will build goal-directed AI, these do not have the force of a theorem. Given the strong arguments we&#x27;ve developed that goal-directed AI would likely be dangerous, it seems worth exploring other options. Some possibilities are AI systems that infer and follow norms, corrigible AI, and bounded and episodic AI services.</p><p>These other possibilities can be cast in a utility-maximization framework. However, if you do that then you are once again tempted to say that you are screwed if you get the utility function slightly wrong. Instead, I would want to build these systems in such a way that the desirable properties are inherent to the way that they reason, so that it isn&#x27;t even a coherent question to ask &quot;what if we get it slightly wrong&quot;.</p><h2>Problems</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/whRPLBZNQm3JD5Zv8/imitation-learning-considered-unsafe\">Imitation learning considered unsafe?</a> <em>(capybaralet)</em>: We might hope that using imitation learning to mimic a corrigible human would be safe. However, this would involve mimicking the human&#x27;s planning process. It seems fairly likely that slight errors in the imitation of this process could lead to the creation of a goal-directed planning process that does dangerous long-term optimization.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This seems pretty similar to the problem of inner optimizers, in which while searching for a good policy for some task T on training distribution D, you end up finding a consequentialist agent that is optimizing some utility function that leads to good performance on D. That agent will have all the standard dangers of goal-directed optimization out of distribution.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6RjL996E8Dsz3vHPk/two-more-decision-theory-problems-for-humans\">Two More Decision Theory Problems for Humans</a> <em>(Wei Dai)</em>: The first problem is that any particular human&#x27;s values only make sense for the current environment. When considering different circumstances (eg. an astronomically large number of very slightly negative experiences like getting a dust speck in your eye), many people will not know how to evaluate the value of such a situation.</p><p>The second problem is that for most formalizations of values or utility functions, the values are defined relative to some way of making decisions in the world, or some ontology through which we understand the world. If this decision theory or ontology changes, it&#x27;s not clear how to &quot;transfer&quot; the values to the new version.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/G2EupNcdtigdyNhL2/predictors-as-agents\">Predictors as Agents</a></p><h2>Technical agendas and prioritization</h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reframing/\">Reframing Superintelligence: Comprehensive AI Services as General Intelligence</a></strong> <em>(Eric Drexler)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><h2>Agent foundations</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mrZp6qC7DDXKQZeeC/failures-of-udt-aixi-part-1-improper-randomizing\">Failures of UDT-AIXI, Part 1: Improper Randomizing</a> <em>(Diffractor)</em></p><h2>Preventing bad behavior</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ehLX2RdbD5ZkeJyuJ/optimization-regularization-through-time-penalty\">Optimization Regularization through Time Penalty</a> <em>(Linda Linsefors)</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>[<em>this post is completely fluffy and superficial</em>]</p>\n<p>When talking about AIs, the issue of emotions often comes up. I normally finesse the question by saying that we don’t really know if AIs would have things we would recognise and emotions, and would you stop pestering me, I have some serious and scary points to make.</p>\n<p>But… If we take the question seriously for a second, and allow ourselves to speculate… The main angle of attack is to wonder: what are emotions for, what functions do they serve? And would they serve the same functions in an AI?</p>\n<p>So, here’s a speculative cross-section of emotions, and whether AIs are likely to have versions of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very likely: Joy, Sadness, Boredom, Empathy, Interest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At their simplest, joy and sadness are responses to the situation turning out better or worse than expected. These are essential to learning, and the AI would certainly have some version of them. Similarly, boredom is a sign that the AI should do more exploration of its environment, empathy is useful for understanding other agents, and interest is a sign that a certain area should be investigated in priority.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possible, if the AI is limited or non-transparent: Anger, Kindness, Cruelty, Trust, Distrust, Surprise</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the AI is able to credibly pre-commit to certain actions (eg if attacked, it will retaliate), then some of these emotions won’t be needed. But it might not be able to credibly signal that, in which case anger would be useful: other agents will be less inclined to exploit it, lest it react aggressively (note that giving in to anger is generally a disadvantage, but being known to give in to anger is often an advantage). Kindness and cruelty are similarly tools for managing social interactions; if the AI is transparent and can pre-commit, they won’t be needed.</p>\n<p>Empathy is the key AI emotion, but it’s possible that it may award special categories for other agents with especially positive or negative traits. Surprise, finally, is a signal that unlikely events are happening, and a re-assessment is needed; if the AI cannot implement its assessments and reassessments in a smooth way, it may need some threshold of surprise to trigger a reaction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possible, if the AI has a physical body: Fear, Disgust, Anxiety, Feelings of Security</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These emotions are all connected with protecting our own physical body, so an AI would only feel them if it had a physical body itself, and couldn’t just think through the issues dispassionately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlikely for an AI to feel: Love, Shame, Pride, Envy, Indignation, Excitement, Pity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are very specific to the human condition, and the human social circumstances, so they are unlikely to be felt by generic AIs. Now, it's always <em>possible</em> for AIs to feel these, but there's no necessary reason for them to feel them, as far as we known now.</p>\n<p>Finally, we should consider that AI’s could have emotions that we never had, because humans were never in circumstances where we would use them. What do you think these might be like? I’ll present two speculative ideas: first of all, AIs should have an intuitive grasp of statistics and probability that is much better than our own, so they may have statistical instincts. Secondly, if the AI gets copied a lot, self-loyalty – loyalty to copies and slightly-divergent-copies – may become useful, and instinctive ways of resolving debates with itself may become common.</p>\n</body></html>",

I have focused on the earlier chapters, because I found those to be more important for understanding the core model. Later chapters speculate about more concrete details of how AI might develop, as well as the implications of the CAIS model on strategy. ETA: This <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as#sXHXAfSKWPyEMhtcu\">comment</a> provides updates based on more discussion with Eric.</p><h2>The Model</h2><p>The core idea is to look at the pathway by which we will develop general intelligence, rather than assuming that at some point we will get a superintelligent AGI agent. To predict how AI will progress in the future, we can look at how AI progresses currently -- through research and development (R&amp;D) processes. AI researchers consider a problem, define a search space, formulate an objective, and use an optimization technique in order to obtain an AI system, called a <em>service</em>, that performs the task.</p><p>A service is an AI system that delivers bounded results for some task using bounded resources in bounded time. Superintelligent language translation would count as a service, even though it requires a very detailed understanding of the world, including engineering, history, science, etc. Episodic RL agents also count as services.</p><p>While each of the AI R&amp;D subtasks is currently performed by a human, as AI progresses we should expect that we will automate these tasks as well. At that point, we will have automated R&amp;D, leading to recursive <em>technological</em> improvement. This is <em>not</em> recursive <em>self</em>-improvement, because the improvement comes from R&amp;D services creating improvements in basic AI building blocks, and those improvements feed back into the R&amp;D services. All of this should happen before we get any powerful AGI agents that can do arbitrary general reasoning.</p><h2>Why Comprehensive?</h2><p>Since services are focused on particular tasks, you might think that they aren't general intelligence, since there would be some tasks for which there is no service. However, pretty much everything we do can be thought of as a task -- including the task of creating a new service. When we have a new task that we would like automated, our service-creating-service can create a new service for that task, perhaps by training a new AI system, or by taking a bunch of existing services and putting them together, etc. In this way, the collection of services can perform any task, and so as an aggregate is generally intelligent. As a result, we can call this Comprehensive AI Services, or CAIS. The \"Comprehensive\" in CAIS is the analog of the \"General\" in AGI. So, we'll have the capabilities of an AGI agent, before we can actually make a monolithic AGI agent.</p><h2>Isn't this just as dangerous as AGI?</h2><p>You might argue that each individual service must be dangerous, since it is superintelligent at its particular task. However, since the service is optimizing for some <em>bounded</em> task, it is not going to run a long-term planning process, and so it will not have any of the standard convergent instrumental subgoals (unless the subgoals are helpful for the task before reaching the bound).</p><p>In addition, all of the optimization pressure on the service is pushing it towards a particular narrow task. This sort of strong optimization tends to <em>focus</em> behavior. Any long term planning processes that consider weird plans for achieving goals (similar to \"break out of the box\") will typically not find any such plan and will be eliminated in favor of cognition that will actually help achieve the task. Think of how a racecar is optimized for speed, while a bus is optimized for carrying passengers, rather than having a \"generally capable vehicle\".</p><p>It's also worth noting what we mean by superintelligent here. In this case, we mean that the service is extremely <em>competent</em> at its assigned task. It need not be <em>learning</em> at all. We see this distinction with RL agents -- when they are trained using something like PPO, they are learning, but at test time you can simply execute them without any PPO and they will perform the behavior they previously learned and won't change that behavior at all.</p><p><em>(My opinion: I think this isn't engaging with the worry with RL agents -- typically, we're worried about the setting where the RL agent is learning or planning at test time, which can happen in learn-to-learn and online learning settings, or even with vanilla RL if the learned policy has access to external memory and can implement a planning process separately from the training procedure.)</em></p><p>On a different note, you might argue that if we analyze the system of services as a whole, then it certainly looks generally intelligent, and so should be regarded as an AGI agent. However, \"AGI agent\" usually carries the anthropomorphic connotation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem\">VNM</a> rationality / expected utility maximization / goal-directedness. While it seems possible and even likely that each individual service can be well-modeled as VNM rational (albeit with a bounded utility function), it is <em>not</em> the case that a system of VNM rational agents will itself look VNM rational -- in fact, game theory is all about how systems of rational agents have weird behavior.</p><p>In addition, there are several aspects of CAIS that make it more safe than a classic monolithic AGI agent. Under CAIS, each service interacts with other services via clearly defined channels of communication, so that the system is interpretable and transparent, even though each service may be opaque. We can reason about what information is present in the inputs to infer what the service could possibly know. We could also provide access to some capability through an external resource during training, so that the service doesn't develop that capability itself.</p><p>This interpretability allows us to monitor the service -- for example, we could look at which subservices it accesses in order to make sure it isn't doing anything crazy. But what if having a human in the loop leads to unacceptable delays? Well, this would only happen for deployed applications, where having a human in the loop seems expected, and should also be economically incentivized because it leads to better behavior. Basic AI R&amp;D can continue to be improved autonomously without a human in the loop, so you could still see an intelligence explosion. Note that tactical tasks requiring quick reaction times probably would be delegated to AI services, but the important strategic decisions could still be left in human hands (assisted by AI services, of course).</p><h2>What happens when we create AGI?</h2><p>Well, it might not be valuable to create an AGI. We want to perform many different tasks, and it makes sense for these to be done by diverse services. It would not be competitive to include all capabilities in a single monolithic agent. This is analogous to how specialization of labor is a good idea for us humans.</p><p><em>(My opinion: It seems like the lesson of deep learning is that if you can do something end-to-end, that will work better than a structured approach. This has happened with computer vision, natural language processing, and seems to be in the process of happening with robotics. So I don't buy this -- while it seems true that we will get CAIS before AGI since structured approaches tend to be available sooner and to work with less compute, I expect that a monolithic AGI agent would outperform CAIS at most tasks once we can make one.)</em></p><p>That said, if we ever do build AGI, we can leverage the services from our CAIS-world in order to make it safe. We could use superintelligent security services to constrain any AGI agent that we build. For example, we could have services trained to identify long-term planning processes and to perform adversarial testing and red teaming.</p><h2>Safety in the CAIS world</h2><p>While CAIS suggests that we will not have AGI agents, this does not mean that we automatically get safety. We will still have AI systems that take high impact actions, and if they take even one wrong action of this sort it could be catastrophic. One way this could happen is if the system of services starts to show agentic behavior -- our standard AI safety work could apply to this scenario.</p><p>In order to ensure safety, we should have AI safety researchers figure out and codify the best development practices that need to be followed. For example, we could try to always use predictive models of human (dis)approval as a sanity check on any plan that is being enacted. We could also train AI services that can adversarially check new services to make sure they are safe.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>The CAIS model suggests that before we get to a world with monolithic AGI agents, we will already have seen an intelligence explosion due to automated R&amp;D. This reframes the problems of AI safety and has implications for what technical safety researchers should be doing.</p><p>ETA: This <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as#sXHXAfSKWPyEMhtcu\">comment</a> provides updates based on more discussion with Eric.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>A typical paradigm by which people tend to think of themselves and others is as <em>consequentialist agents</em>: entities who can be usefully modeled as having beliefs and goals, who are then acting according to their beliefs to achieve their goals.</p><p>This is often a useful model, but it doesn’t quite capture reality. It’s a bit of a <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDP4ZWYLNj7MGXWiW/in-praise-of-fake-frameworks\">fake framework</a></u>. Or in computer science terms, you might call it a <u><a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/\">leaky abstraction</a></u>. </p><p>An abstraction in the computer science sense is a simplification which tries to hide the underlying details of a thing, letting you think in terms of the simplification rather than the details. To the extent that the abstraction actually succeeds in hiding the details, this makes things a lot simpler. But sometimes the abstraction inevitably leaks, as the simplification fails to predict some of the actual behavior that emerges from the details; in that situation you need to actually know the underlying details, and be able to think in terms of them.</p><p>Agent-ness being a leaky abstraction is not exactly a novel concept for Less Wrong; it has been touched upon several times, such as in Scott Alexander’s <u><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_Blue-Minimizing_Robot_(sequence)\">Blue-Minimizing Robot Sequence</a></u>. At the same time, I do not think that it has been quite fully internalized yet, and that many foundational posts on LW go wrong due to being premised on the assumption of humans being agents. In fact, I would go as far as to claim that this is the biggest flaw of the original Sequences: they were attempting to explain many failures of rationality as being due to cognitive biases, when in retrospect it looks like understanding cognitive biases doesn’t actually make you substantially more effective. But if you are implicitly modeling humans as goal-directed agents, then cognitive biases is the most natural place for irrationality to emerge from, so it makes sense to focus the most on there.</p><p>Just knowing that an abstraction leaks isn’t enough to improve your thinking, however. To do better, you need to know about the actual underlying details to get a better model. In this sequence, I will aim to elaborate on various tools for thinking about minds which look at humans in more granular detail than the classical agent model does. Hopefully, this will help us better get past the old paradigm.</p><p>My model of what I think our subagents looks like draws upon a number of different sources, including neuroscience, psychotherapy and meditation, so in the process of sketching out my model I will be covering a number of them in turn. To give you a rough idea of what I'm trying to do, here's a summary of some upcoming content.</p><h1>Published posts:</h1><p>(<em>Note: this list may not always be fully up to date; see <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip\">the sequence index</a> for actively maintained version)</em></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq\">Book summary: Consciousness and the Brain</a>. </strong>One of the fundamental building blocks of much of consciousness research, is that of <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory\">Global Workspace Theory</a></u> (GWT). This could be described as a component of a multiagent model, focusing on the way in which different agents exchange information between one another. One elaboration of GWT, which focuses on how it might be implemented in the brain, is the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model in neuroscience. Consciousness in the Brain is a 2014 book that summarizes some of the research and basic ideas behind GNW, so summarizing the main content of that book looks like a good place to start our discussion and for getting a neuroscientific grounding before we get more speculative.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st\">Building up to an IFS model</a>. </strong>One theoretical approach for modeling humans as being composed of interacting parts is that of <a href=\"https://selfleadership.org/about-internal-family-systems.html\">Internal Family Systems</a>. In my experience and that of several other people in the rationalist community, it’s very effective for this purpose. However, having its origins in therapy, its theoretical model may seem rather unscientific and woo-y. This personally put me off the theory for a long time, as I thought that it sounded fake, and gave me a strong sense of \"my mind isn't split into parts like that\".</p><p>In this post, I construct a mechanistic sketch of how a mind might work, drawing on the kinds of mechanisms that have already been demonstrated in contemporary machine learning, and then end up with a model that pretty closely resembles the IFS one.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/AhcEaqWYpa2NieNsK\">Subagents, introspective awareness, and blending.</a></strong>  In this post, I extend the model of mind that I've been building up in previous posts to explain some things about change blindness, not knowing whether you are conscious, forgetting most of your thoughts, and mistaking your thoughts and emotions as objective facts, while also connecting it with the theory in the meditation book The Mind Illuminated.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oJwJzeZ6ar2Hr7KAX/subagents-akrasia-and-coherence-in-humans\">Subagents, akrasia, and coherence in humans.</a></strong> We can roughly describe coherence as the property that, if you become aware that there exists a more optimal strategy for achieving your goals than the one that you are currently executing, then you will switch to that better strategy.  For a subagent theory of mind, we would like to have some explanation of when exactly the subagents manage to be collectively coherent (that is, change their behavior to some better one), and what are the situations in which they fail to do so. </p><p>My conclusion is that we are capable of changing our behaviors on occasions when the mind-system as a whole puts sufficiently high probability on the new behavior being better, when the new behavior is not being blocked by a particular highly weighted subagent (such as an IFS-style protector) that puts high probability on it being bad, and when we have enough <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack\">slack</a> in our lives for any new behaviors to be evaluated in the first place. Akrasia is subagent disagreement about what to do.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/hnLutdvjC8kPScPAj\">Integrating disagreeing subagents</a></strong>. In the previous post,  I suggested that akrasia involves subagent disagreement - or in other words, different parts of the brain having differing ideas on what the best course of action is. The existence of such conflicts raises the question, how does one resolve them?</p><p>In this post I discuss various techniques which could be interpreted as ways of resolving subagents disagreements, as well as some of the reasons for why this doesn’t always happen.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh/subagents-neural-turing-machines-thought-selection-and\">Subagents, neural Turing machines, thought selection, and blindspots</a></strong>. In my summary of <em>Consciousness and the Brain</em>, I briefly mentioned that one of the functions of consciousness is to carry out artificial serial operations; or in other words, implement a production system (equivalent to a Turing machine) in the brain.<br><br>While I did not go into very much detail about this model in the post, I’ve used it in later articles. For instance, in <em>Building up to an Internal Family Systems model</em>, I used a toy model where different subagents cast votes to modify the contents of consciousness. One may conceptualize this as equivalent to the production system model, where different subagents implement different production rules which compete to modify the contents of consciousness.<br><br>In this post, I flesh out the model a bit more, as well as applying it to a few other examples, such as emotion suppression, internal conflict, and blind spots.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u5RLu5F3zKTB3Qjnu/subagents-trauma-and-rationality\">Subagents, trauma, and rationality</a></strong>.  This post interprets the appearance of subagents as emerging from <em>unintegrated memory networks</em>, and argues that the presence of these is a matter of degree. There’s a continuous progression of fragmented (dissociated) memory networks giving arise to increasingly worse symptoms as the degree of fragmentation grows. The continuum goes from everyday procrastination and akrasia on the “normal” end, to disrupted and dysfunctional beliefs on the middle, and conditions like clinical PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and dissociative identity disorder on the severely traumatized end.</p><p>I also argue that emotional work and exploring one's past traumas in order to heal them, is necessary for effective instrumental and epistemic rationality.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HbXXd2givHBBLxr3d/against-system-1-and-system-2-subagent-sequence\">Against \"System 1\" and \"System 2\"</a></strong>.  The terms System 1 and System 2 were originally coined by the psychologist Keith Stanovich and then popularized by Daniel Kahneman in his book <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow.</em> Stanovich noted that a number of fields within psychology had been developing various kinds of theories distinguishing between fast/intuitive on the one hand and slow/deliberative thinking on the other. Often these fields were not aware of each other. The S1/S2 model was offered as a general version of these specific theories, highlighting features of the two modes of thought that tended to appear in all the theories.</p><p>Since then, academics have continued to discuss the models. Among other developments, <em>Stanovich and other authors have discontinued the use of the System 1/System 2 terminology as misleading</em>, choosing to instead talk about Type 1 and Type 2 processing. In this post, I will build on some of that discussion to argue that Type 2 processing is a <em>particular way of chaining together the outputs of various subagents using working memory</em>. Some of the processes involved in this chaining are themselves implemented by particular kinds of subagents.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ\">Book summary: Unlocking the Emotional Brain</a></strong>.  Written by the psychotherapists Bruce Ecker, Robin Ticic and Laurel Hulley, <em>Unlocking the Emotional Brain</em> claims to offer a neuroscience-grounded, comprehensive model of how effective therapy works. In so doing, it also happens to formulate its theory in terms of belief updating, helping explain how the brain models the world and what kinds of techniques allow us to <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind\">actually change our minds</a>. Its discussion and models are closely connected to the models about internal conflict and belief revision that are discussed in previous posts, particularly \"integrating disagreeing subagents\".</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/WYmmC3W6ZNhEgAmWG\">A mechanistic model of meditation</a>.</strong> Meditation has been claimed to have all kinds of transformative effects on the psyche, such as improving concentration ability, healing trauma, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QqSNFcGSZdnARx56E/meditation-insight-and-rationality-part-1-of-3\">cleaning up delusions</a>, allowing one to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tMhEv28KJYWsu6Wdo/kensh?commentId=wgb3wu6kQYdCpoehL\">track their subconscious strategies</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZawRiFR8ytvpqfBPX/the-hard-work-of-translation-buddhism\">making one’s nervous system more efficient</a>. However, an explanation for why and how exactly this would happen has typically been lacking. This makes people reasonably skeptical of such claims.</p><p>In this post, I want to offer an explanation for one kind of a mechanism: meditation increasing the degree of a person’s introspective awareness, and thus leading to increasing psychological unity as internal conflicts are detected and resolved.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/Mf2MCkYgSZSJRz5nM\"><strong>A non-mystical explanation of insight meditation and the three characteristics of existence: introduction and preamble</strong>.</a> Insight meditation, enlightenment, what’s that all about? </p><p>The sequence of posts starting from this one is my personal attempt at answering that question. It seeks to:</p><ul><li>Explain what kinds of implicit assumptions build up our default understanding of reality and how those assumptions are subtly flawed. </li><li>Point out aspects from our experience whose repeated observation will update those assumptions, and explain how this may cause psychological change in someone who meditates.</li><li>Explain how the so-called “<u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence\">three characteristics of existence</a></u>” of Buddhism - impermanence, no-self and unsatisfactoriness - are all interrelated and connected with each other in a way that is connected to the previously discussed topics in the sequence.</li></ul><h1>Farther out (sketched out but not as extensively planned/written yet)</h1><p><strong>The game theory of rationality and cooperation in a multiagent world. </strong>Multi-agent models have a natural connection to <u><a href=\"http://elephantinthebrain.com/\">Elephant in the Brain</a></u> -style dynamics: our brains doing things for purposes of which we are unaware. Furthermore, there can be strong incentives to continue systematic self-deception and <em>not</em> integrate conflicting beliefs. For instance, if a mind has subagents which think that specific beliefs are dangerous to hold or express, then they will work to suppress subagents holding that belief from coming into conscious awareness. </p><p>“Dangerous beliefs” might be ones that touch upon political topics, but they might also be ones of a more personal nature. For instance, someone may have an identity as being “good at X”, and then <u><a href=\"https://www.theferrett.com/2018/08/31/why-your-friends-are-probably-lying-to-themselves-about-what-theyre-good-at-and-how-to-work-around-it/\">want to rationalize away any contradictory evidence</a></u> - including evidence suggesting that they were wrong on a topic related to X. Or it might be something even more subtle. </p><p>These are a few examples of how rationality work has to happen on two levels at once: to debug some beliefs (individual level), people need to be in a community where holding various kinds of beliefs is <em>actually safe</em> (social level). But in order for the community to be safe for holding those beliefs (social level), people within the community also need to work on themselves so as to deal with their own subagents that would cause them to attack people with the “wrong” beliefs (individual level). This kind of work also seems to be necessary for fixing “politics being the mind-killer” and collaborating on issues such as existential risk across sharp value differences; but the need to carry out the work on many levels at once makes it challenging, especially since the current environment incentivizes many (sub)agents to sabotage any attempt at this. </p><p>(This topic area is also related to <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AqbWna2S85pFTsHH4/the-intelligent-social-web\">that stuff Valentine has been saying about Omega</a></u>.)</p><br><p><em>This sequence is part of research done for, and supported by, the <u><a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/\">Foundational Research Institute</a></u>.</em></p>",

Further details, models, and advice are somewhat speculative despite being drawn from varying amounts of observation. Essay a little rushed since otherwise I’d be unlikely to publish.</em></p><p>When setting out on a venture, one faces some choices. </p><ul><li><strong>Optimize reality:</strong> How much do you optimize for the success of your stated goal? I define goal to be <em>some desired state of reality such that success or failure is assessed with respect to reality.</em></li><li><strong>Optimize stories: </strong>How much do you optimize for the appearance of success at your stated goal, i.e. stories?  I define a story as <em>a collection of facts about a reality asserted to be true and relevant, usually presented to others but  sometimes only to oneself.</em></li></ul><p>Ideally, optimizing for one would be the same as optimizing for another. Very often, however, optimizing one is not the same as optimizing for other. What’s worse, the two ends compete for the same set of limited resources.</p><p>A concrete example might be someone who sets out to develop and sell a medicinal tea which relieves hangover symptoms. Overall success is selling your tea and making money. Investing in optimizing reality would mean investing in experiments to develop and improve the tea. Introducing variants, randomized controlled trials, etc., etc. Optimizing story means having a really good explanation for why your tea is able to do what you claim it does, plus having a great website with good copy, publishing testimonials, publishing your methodology and experimental results, etc.</p><p>Success can be attained by both, in combination, but also possibly each on its own. If you have a tea which works well, word will spread and you’ll end up with many customers seeking your genuinely palliative tea. Alternatively, if your marketing materials are persuasive, you might accrue many customers too, even if your tea is no better than placebo. Of course, truly effective tea plus a well-conveyed story about its great properties will generate more sales than effective tea or a good story alone. </p><h1>Optimizing Reality</h1><p>The following points are worth noting:</p><ul><li>When optimizing reality, success depends on reality at large being a certain way.</li><li>There is only one reality when it comes to what you’re optimizing for.</li><li>You can’t fool reality. It is what it is no matter what you say or do.</li><li>Optimizing for reality is easiest to do when outcomes are easy to measure and feedback is quick.</li><li>Engineers dealing with concrete, measurable phenomena are likely to be optimizing reality.</li><li>Genuinely creating value, though often expensive, is a good strategy for capturing value to yourself. Likely it’s the best long-term strategy in many domains.</li><ul><li>I would claim that every major successful company is producing clear value to someone. Facebook, Google, AirBnB, ExxonMobil, United Airlines, Starbucks. At the end of the day, there’s something real there.</li></ul></ul><h1>Optimizing Stories</h1><ul><li>For any goal, there might be many possible stories which will lead to success.</li><li>Stories don’t have to be true or accurate to be effective.</li><li>It can be rational, or outright necessary, for one’s success to optimize for stories without regard to reality.</li><ul><li>If your success ultimately depends on someone else being convinced, then reality at large doesn’t matter.</li></ul><li>Salespeople, marketers, politicians, startup founders and generally those whose success depends on persuading others will spend much of their effort optimizing stories.</li><li>Very often your “customer” only cares that you have a “good story” and not at all that your story matches reality.</li><ul><li>Consider a reseller of your medicinal tea. If they’re unscrupulous, it doesn’t matter to them whether or not the tea works. It only matters to them that your story is good enough to persuade end-consumers.</li><li>Consider a hospital IT employee whose job is to purchase software which helps doctors. The supposed goal of improved doctor efficiency is not measured in any way. The hospital IT employee’s success will be judged by the impressive-seemingness of the software they select - how good the story it comes with - not any actual reality. In other words, the IT employee, as a customer, is incentivized to be shopping for good stories and only good stories.</li><ul><li>But you needn&#x27;t assume people only purchase stories for the sake of others! Many people, having a loose relationship, are happy to purchase a story which makes them feel good. &quot;Oh, those crystals from the mystery mountains have the right frequencies to bring me good fortune? Yes please!&quot;</li></ul></ul><li>In cases where those hearing the stories lack the expertise to assess reality, e.g. non-experts trying assess an expert, &quot;dumbed-down&quot; stories comprehensible to the non-experts will completely outweigh reality itself. <em>Cf. </em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/m4a8jFjWjx7Q5k24r/overconfident-talking-down-humble-or-hostile-talking-up\">Overconfident talking down, humble or hostile talking up.</a></li><li>If it’s only stories which matter, yet you split your efforts between stories and reality, then you will likely be outcompeted by someone who spent all of their resources on crafting good stories. <em>Cf. <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Moloch</a></u>.</em></li><li>Even those who care a lot about reality itself can slide into a focus on stories if empirical feedback is absent or very slow.</li><li>Notwithstanding all of the above, stories will sometimes reach the end of their tether and the lack of a good reality to support your stories will catch up with you.</li><li>We don’t just tell stories to others, we also tell themselves to ourselves.</li><ul><li>The danger of being too much in the habit of telling stories is that we don’t merely risking fooling others, but also ourselves.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h2>“Story Economies”</h2><p>I conjecture that what arises in our modern world are “<em>economies” of stories </em>whereby people buy and sell stories often without regard for reality. </p><p>Another example: imagine an analyst working at a startup crafts a report which highlights all the ways in which the company is rapidly improving. The analyst&#x27;s manager isn’t too worried about whether the report is a bit biased towards the positive - they know the CEO will be pleased. The CEO doesn’t mind if the report is a bit biased towards the positive - they know the board will be pleased. The board doesn’t mind if the report is a bit biased - they know that the next round of investors won’t really be able to tell the difference, it will just make the company look good. </p><p>Here you have a whole chain of people who only care about the story. At the very end there’s someone who cares about the reality, but they’re very often not in a great position to evaluate it themselves. They probably don’t know even the right questions to ask. All they’ve got is the story which has been placed before them.</p><p>Some people gravitate more towards stories than others, e.g. salespeople and politicians. Some of them might readily admit that they chiefly deal in stories somewhat tenuously linked to reality, yet I wager that many, if not most, won’t. The most persuasive stories are those you devoutly believe yourself. Hence the vast overconfidence of startup founders. And, in the <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn_PSJsl0LQ\">immortal words</a></u> of George Costanza: <em>it&#x27;s not a lie... if you believe it. </em></p><h2>Stories about yourself ...to yourself and others</h2><p>If there’s one domain where we’re endlessly crafting and broadcasting stories, it’s the stories we tell about ourselves. I’m <em>this </em>kind of person. I might decide that the story I want to tell is that I’m a &quot;science nerd&quot;. So I read science books and science magazines. I have my answer ready when people ask me what I do for fun and I know exactly what to post on social media. My Instagram is full of homemade volcanoes and photos from my personal backyard telescope. </p><p>The above fictional example might have the redeeming feature that at least this fictional person is creating a genuine reality to match the story. They are learning a tonne of science genre facts. Still, I wager there’s a tradeoff. Doing science-y things which are easily communicable and demonstrable introduces a constraint. Possibly leveling up as a scientist would mean reading textbooks with facts that are incomprehensible and boring to those not at that level. By trying to have the best story to tell, they’ve handicapped their own excellence. (However, if the story is primarily for oneself, this constraint is avoided. “<em>I know just how science-y I am!)</em></p><p>If you want to know, I tell myself the story that I’m a person who’s afraid of losing myself to trying craft myself into someone optimized for impressing others. Though I do it. I’m doing it right now. There may be no escape.</p><p><em>Cf. <u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Brain-Hidden-Motives-Everyday/dp/0190495995\">Elephant in the Brain</a></u>.</em></p><h2>You can’t escape stories</h2><p>At this point you might be thinking, “gee, stories are awfully deceitful and non-cooperate, I want to cooperative and honest and I’m just going to provide direct facts!” and “I really, really don’t want to deceive myself with stories!”</p><p>I don’t think you can escape stories entirely. I would claim that as soon as you summarize your facts or data, the mere selection of which facts to present or summarize is the crafting of a story. Even dumping all your data and every observation is likely to be biased by which data you collected and what you paid attention to. What you thought were the relevant things to report to another person.</p><p>That said, I think there’s storytelling which attempts to be honest effort to share reality as is so that someone else can make an informed judgment. It’s challenging if one’s success is threatened by less scrupulous competitors, but it’s possible to choose domains where measurable feedback favors those who’ve optimized actual reality.</p><p>You’re not always doing others a favor if you try to give them raw facts with no biased conclusions. The world is large and messy and confusing such that people usually like to be handed a story about who you are and how you will behave. They want you to be a nerdy, bookish type, or an outdoorsy type, or a foodie. If you give me a story and promise to act in accordance with it, that makes simple. It’s clear what to talk about, what to get you for your birthday, etc., etc.</p><p>At least for those spending much time out in mainstream culture, it helps to have one or two stories prepared about yourself. “Masks.” They function a bit like APIs, really. People often protest that they don’t like being put in boxes, but those boxes help you relate to people before you’ve spent the many, many hours to have absorbed the messy reality that any given human is.</p><h1>What to do, what to do</h1><p>Reality on the ground is complex, incentives are messy, things which work in the short run don’t necessarily work in the long run. I can&#x27;t say “here’s my one simple recipe to determine the right allocation of resources between optimizing story vs optimizing reality.”</p><p>I proffer the obvious advice:</p><ul><li>Notice the incentives for each domain you deal in - how much does your success depend on stories vs direct reality?</li><li>By judging the incentives in the domains you deal, assess how much you can judge the stories you are presented with.</li><li>Accept that the tradeoffs are hard. Personally, I wish I could deal only in truth and provide only open and transparent facts. Unfortunately, I might need either to compromise or to find myself severely disadvantaged in certain arenas, e.g. politics.</li><ul><li>Moreover, the incentives mean despite myself, self-interest bias means I’m likely to present things to others in ways which favor myself.</li></ul><li>Accept that you probably need a story about yourself. If you like, keep the story separate from yourself so that you might let yourself be more. <em>Cf.</em> <em><u><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html\">Keep your identity small</a></u>.</em></li></ul>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>When I first entered the field of AI safety, I thought of the problem as figuring out how to get the AI to have the “right” utility function. This led me to work on the problem of inferring values from demonstrators with unknown biases, despite the impossibility results in the area. I am less excited about that avenue because I am pessimistic about the prospects of ambitious value learning (for the reasons given in the first part of this sequence).</p><p>I think this happened because the writing on AI risk that I encountered has the pervasive assumption that any superintelligent AI agent must be maximizing some utility function over the long term future, such that it leads to goal-directed behavior and convergent instrumental subgoals. It’s often not stated as an assumption; rather, inferences are made assuming that you have the background model that the AI is goal-directed. This makes it particularly hard to question the assumption, since you don’t realize that the assumption is even there.</p><p>Another reason that this assumption is so easily accepted is that we have a long history of modeling rational agents as expected utility maximizers, and for good reason: there are many coherence arguments that say that, <em>given that you have preferences/goals</em>, if you aren’t using probability theory and expected utility theory, then you can be taken advantage of. It’s easy to make the inference that a superintelligent agent must be rational, and therefore it must be an expected utility maximizer.</p><p>Because this assumption was so embedded in how I thought about the problem, I had trouble imagining how else to even consider the problem. I would guess this is true for at least some other people, so I want to summarize the counterargument, and list a few implications, in the hope that this makes the issue clearer.</p><h3>Why goal-directed behavior may not be required</h3><p>The main argument of this chapter is that it is not <em>required</em> that a superintelligent agent takes actions in pursuit of some goal. It is possible to write algorithms that select actions without doing a search over the actions and rating their consequences according to an explicitly specified simple function. There is no coherence argument that says that your agent must have preferences or goals; it is perfectly possible for the agent to take actions with no goal in mind simply because it was programmed to do so; this remains true even when the agent is intelligent.</p><p>It seems quite likely that by default a superintelligent AI system would be goal-directed anyway, because of economic efficiency arguments. However, this is <em>not</em> set in stone, as it would be if coherence arguments implied goal-directed behavior. Given the negative results around goal-directed behavior, it seems like the natural path forward is to search for alternatives that still allow us to get economic efficiency.</p><h3>Implications</h3><p>At a high level, I think that the main implication of this view is that we should be considering other models for future AI systems besides optimizing over the long term for a single goal or for a particular utility or reward function. Here are some other potential models:</p><ul><li>G<em>oal-conditioned policy with common sense:</em> In this setting, humans can set goals for the AI system simply by asking it in natural language to do something, and the AI system sets out to do it. However, the AI also has “common sense”, where it interprets our commands pragmatically and not literally: it’s not going to prevent us from setting a new goal (which would stop it from achieving its current goal), because common sense tells it that we don’t want it to do that. One way to think about this is to consider an AI system that infers and follows human <em>norms</em>, which are probably much easier to infer than human values (most humans seem to infer norms very accurately).</li><li><em>Corrigible AI:</em> I’ll defer to Paul Christiano’s <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">explanation of corrigibility</a>.</li><li><em><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf\">Comprehensive AI Services</a> (CAIS):</em> Maybe we could create lots of AI services that interact with each other to solve hard problems. Each individual service could be bounded and episodic, which immediately means that it is no longer optimizing over the long term (though it could still be goal-directed). Perhaps we have a long-term planner that is trained to produce good plans to achieve particular goals over the span of an hour, and a plan executor that takes in a plan and executes the next step of the plan over an hour, and leaves instructions for the next steps.</li></ul><p>There are versions of these scenarios which are compatible with the framework of an AI system optimizing for a single goal:</p><ul><li>A goal-conditioned policy with common sense could be operationalized as optimizing for the goal of “following a human’s orders without doing anything that humans would reliably judge as crazy”.</li><li><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf\">MIRI’s version of corrigibility</a> seems like it stays within this framework.</li><li>You could think of the services in CAIS as optimizing for the <em>aggregate</em> reward they get over all time, rather than just the reward they get during the current episode.</li></ul><p>I do <em>not</em> want these versions of the scenarios, since they then make it tempting to once again say “but if you get the goal even slightly wrong, then you’re in big trouble”. This would likely be true if we built an AI system that could maximize an arbitrary function, and then tried to program in the utility function we care about, but <em>this is not required</em>. It seems possible to build systems in such a way that these properties are inherent in the way that they reason, such that it’s not even coherent to ask what happens if we “get the utility function slightly wrong”.</p><p>Note that I’m not claiming that I know how to build such systems; I’m just claiming that we don’t know enough yet to reject the possibility that we could build such systems. Given how hard it seems to be to align systems that explicitly maximize a reward function, we should explore these other methods as well.</p><p>Once we let go of the idea of optimizing for a single goal and it becomes possible to think about other ways in which we could build AI systems, there are more insights about how we could build an AI system that does what we intend instead of what we say. (In my case it was reversed -- I heard a lot of good insights that don’t fit in the framework of goal-directed optimization, and this eventually led me to let go of the assumption of goal-directed optimization.) We’ll explore some of these in the next chapter.</p>",

Often you&#x27;ll get three different business models thrown at you with minimal motivation. You won&#x27;t be told about the environment this model evolved in, nor why the particular elements were included. Sometimes you&#x27;ll get a concrete example, sometimes not, but if so, it&#x27;s more likely to be a made up scenario rather than an example from someone&#x27;s real life experience. It is even rarer that you will receive multiple such examples.</p><p>This is largely a result of people&#x27;s bias towards explicit knowledge. But the explicit knowledge is in most cases simply one of many ways of carving up possibility space. Much more important is the implicit knowledge of how to apply the system and what situations it is helpful in. Strategy = Ends + Ways + Means becomes more applicable when you learn that it became dominate after the Vietnam War when it was felt that the loss was the result of attempting to achieve certain objectives without sufficient resources. So instead of just asking, &quot;What are we trying to achieve?&quot; and &quot;How could we achieve it?&quot;, you also wanted to ask, &quot;What resources are needed to achieve it?&quot;. Similarly, the Waterfall Model becomes more useful when you are told that many projects have not been as successful as desired because of a failure to consider requirements (ie. using a framework that requires Internet Explorer 10+ when some staff are stuck on Internet Explorer 9). Similarly, people often perform the cost analysis of projects for just the initial coding, without accounting for the maintenance cost. This is a system for making sure that you don&#x27;t forget the obvious.</p><p>It would be even better if I could illustrate these with examples from my own experience, but this should still be sufficient to illustrate my point.

Non-Economic Disadvantages of Card Rebalancing</h3>\n<p>Last time, I explored eight reasons why card rebalancing was great. Now it is time to turn those reasons on their head, and see how disaster might strike.</p>\n<p>There are three central reasons why I worry about card rebalancing. They are card and game economics, destruction of history, work and memory, a desire to ‘overbalance,’ and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart’s Law</a>.</p>\n<p>Economics I’ve already considered. For considerations of card ownership, in-game economics and related matters, see <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/12/27/card-collection-and-ownership/\">Card Collection and Ownership</a> and <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/12/31/card-rebalancing-and-economic-considerations-in-digital-card-games/\">Card Rebalancing, Card Oversupply and Economic Considerations in Digital Card Games</a>. I won’t consider such issues here.</p>\n<h4>Category 1: Destruction of history, work and memory.</h4>\n<h4>1A. Players cannot rely on their knowledge of what cards do.</h4>\n<p>I know the exact abilities of thousands of Magic cards and hundreds of Artifact cards, plus thousands of cards in other games, both collectible and otherwise. I know the rules of thousands of board games, card games and video games.</p>\n<p>Now imagine if those abilities and rules were constantly changing. If every turn and every action I had to worry that the rule wasn’t I thought it was, or the card had different abilities.</p>\n<p>Magic players already have a taste of this with <a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/grand-creature-type-update-2007-09-26\">the grand creature type update</a>. In that case, the problem was redoubled by not being able to know the change by reading the card. Players know that looking at a sufficiently old card’s printed creature type is not a good guide to its actual creature type. It can be obvious that Elvish Archers is now an Elf and an Archer, and most other changes are similarly guessable and logical.</p>\n<p>The good news in a digital game is that one can always read the card, and various visual aids can be introduced to warn a player that a card has changed within some time frame, or since the last time the card was played against them. The other good news is that one periodically expects to face new cards, so facing new variations of existing cards is a reasonable punch to roll with.</p>\n<p>Still, not being able to trust your knowledge of a game is off putting at best. When one is keeping close track of a game, making it a primary focus of time, this isn’t a big deal. When one wants to take breaks and return to games later or occasionally, it is a much bigger one.</p>\n<p>I have always had trouble learning foreign languages. The closest I’ve come is being able to learn card games and their associated vocabulary. Not ebing a</p>\n<h4>1B. Players cannot rely on their knowledge of the strategic landscape.</h4>\n<p>The flip side of keeping a game fresh and new all the time, and giving people new strategies to explore, is that you invalidate what everyone has learned.</p>\n<p>I will speak to this issue from my experience as a professional competitor.</p>\n<p>When strategic situations move slowly, or shift periodically with set releases, one can make a medium-term investment in strategic acumen. Practice and study can be gotten out of the way, allowing one to be ready for and focus on the game itself (along with any drafts or sealed deck builds). Once familiar with a game and a format, knowledge will continue to advance and the meta-game may shift, and there is always room to go deeper and improve, but with confidence that one’s work will continue to have relevance, and mostly not go to waste.</p>\n<p>When strategic situations move too fast, taking even a week off of ‘doing the work’ gets severely punished. It becomes impossible to ‘stay in fighting shape’ without continuous work. Magic, due to Magic Online and various events, even without cards changing, has reached a point where you <em>must </em>prepare for the constructed portion of events during the final week, and you can’t change your list in the last two days, leaving a <em>very </em>narrow window that leaves zero flexibility for players lives. All previous work was necessary to be in position to adapt but still mostly wasted.</p>\n<p>This is in sharp contrast to the old era, when people prepared mostly in private over the course of a month. Then, I would work hard but often have several weeks between finishing my work and the event itself.</p>\n<p>This is all, of course, the flip side of making innovation and interesting new things possible. It’s not like we want a world in which there are not new things. But by effectively forcing everyone to constantly relearn things to stay in shape, while having constant internet sources of basic knowledge and strategy, you force those looking to not follow the herd to put in absurd amounts of work that won’t last. Cards changing all the time would make this that much worse.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://sludgefeed.com/mark-cuban-says-he-wont-buy-esports-team/\">Mark Cuban’s recent notes</a> about why he declined to buy an e-sports team. Constantly changing rules and elements force insanely long work weeks and lead to player burnout. I speak from experience that burnout is a real problem, and that minor tweaks that wipe out your existing knowledge and assumptions are a big contributor to that, in a way that adding additional elements every so often is distinct from.</p>\n<p>What about more casual players? Is this a problem confined to a relatively small percent of players at the top? Based on my experience in other games that I was not taking as seriously, the same problem is real there as well, on longer time scales, and losing solidity is a big deal.</p>\n<p>Below a certain level of precision and seriousness this should presumably fall off in magnitude. Even better, for those who only play during a short window, the changes won’t feel like changes at all, so none of this matters unless a player stays for a longer time frame. That also makes it difficult to measure the effect.</p>\n<h4>1C. Destruction of history.</h4>\n<p>A lot of the joy of Magic lies in its history. We have a quarter century of cards, games, mistakes, brilliancies, broken ideas, innovations, theories, decks, choices, competitions, friendships, communities, arguments, formats and stories. Investing in Magic now pays off not only in fun and learning how to think. It pays off in a community, in deep friendships and shared stories and experiences. It pays off in older decks and formats that provide permanent sources of throwback fun, that are a much underused source whose surface Magic Online has only begun to scratch in its throwback offerings.</p>\n<p>When we alter things such that this history, our stories and the related formats and decks no longer makes sense or function properly, because its components have all been changed, we severely damage this.</p>\n<p>I know this may seem like a special interest petty concern. I do not think it is, and it and other hard to notice risks and costs being completely ignored and crushed once Goodhart’s Law considerations start operating.</p>\n<p>The default of the internet age is to periodically break or expire everything from the past, such that it ceases to function, in many ways that make me deeply sad. Servers shut down and games become unavailable, websites go silent. Often this could have been avoided at little cost, but such considerations were not taken into account at all, so over time we all get poorer than we could have been.</p>\n<p>Getting the throwback NES Classic and SNES Classic consoles these past few years has been a great joy, and the Playstation Classic and Sega Genesis Classic failed to join them only due to failure of execution. I spend a substantial portion of my gaming time on experiences created during those ancient times, and variations therefrom, and if technologically easier I would spend more. Remakes of these experiences, or modern takes on those experiences that impose similar restrictions, I often find to be superior. Remakes can greatly enhance the experience, by offering quality-of-life improvements, but can also make difficulty adjustments that destroy the real game experience. This brings us to the second category of concerns.</p>\n<h4>Category 2: Goodhart’s Law considerations</h4>\n<h4>2A. <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/choices-are-bad/\">Choices are Bad</a></h4>\n<p>When cards <em>can </em>change, there will be higher expectations for every aspect of them, and more blame when things are not exactly to people’s preferences. People will compare what exists to what might exist, and not forgive the designers their (in the player’s opinion) mistakes. This will be especially bad given that mistakes are, to an extent, good for a game, as we’ll get to later.</p>\n<p>Quirky things will be cries for fixes rather than quirky things to adjust around. When a player loses to a thing, they will more often cry the thing is unfair and to nerf it, rather than looking around for how to beat it.</p>\n<p>There are two big potential downsides here.</p>\n<p>The first is that for any given game experience delivered, players (who care about things enough to think at this level) will be less happy, because they are judging against a different standard.</p>\n<p>The second is that there will be tremendous pressure to optimize a variety of metrics, and to judge changes on short time horizons based on success on these metrics.</p>\n<p>Potential targets include number of active players, time played, card prices, revenue, estimated lifetime revenue per customer, reported player satisfaction or posted reviews, what people say on Reddit or Google News or elsewhere, diversity of metagame on a variety of skill and card access levels, win rates for various strategies, number of players playing a variety of decks, or other things I’m not thinking about right now.</p>\n<p>Hello, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart’s Law</a>. Hello, <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/short-termism/\">short termism</a>.</p>\n<h4>2B. Players are wrong about what they want</h4>\n<p>People are very bad at knowing what they want. They are even worse at figuring out what impacts changes would have, short term or long term, on a game.</p>\n<p>Magic’s player base <em>reliably </em>had too much support, too fast, for bans and emergency actions, for decades. This may have eventually been fixed after decades of explanations and data, or it might not have been. I would expect this to be the pattern for almost all games, and for balance changes to follow the pattern even more.</p>\n<p>There are lots of other things that are short term popular but long term detrimental and not so popular. Power creep, and using up more design space, are two easy examples. In the interests of space and avoiding side arguments I won’t go further here.</p>\n<p>Magic has managed to educate its player base to dampen this effect somewhat, but only somewhat.</p>\n<h4>2C. Game risks focusing developer time on the wrong things</h4>\n<p>Focus risks being on tweaking existing things, and making short term improvements, rather than on creating new things and making long term improvements.</p>\n<p>When creating new cards and formats, it will be impossible to plan for them fully in advance, as key elements already in print will change all the time. The equivalent of the Magic “Future Future League” will give far less valuable data. Secondary and older formats like Vintage and Legacy (or I suspect even Modern) in Magic will not be properly considered when changes are made, either.</p>\n<h4>2D. Goodhart’s Law hill climbs destroy art and end poorly</h4>\n<p>I strongly believe that Goodhart’s Law problems are getting worse every year, and causing many, perhaps most, of our internet experiences to become incrementally worse rather than better, in ways that major corporations that do many brilliant things have proven unable to overcome. Some day I want to focus in on Netflix, and some day I want to spend a ton of time getting this case exactly right, but for now I want to avoid such sidetracks.</p>\n<p>I do not trust anyone, myself included, to handle this well. Give a person enough knobs, and enough immediate feedback that feels important, and they <em>will </em>turn those knobs until their numbers go up. Other considerations that are harder to measure <em>will </em>be discarded. Visions and virtues <em>will </em>be compromised. Utilitarian, consequentialist philosophies <em>will </em>de facto dominate the discussion.</p>\n<h4>2E. Old man yells at cloud</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/019/304/old.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I want to stop here to say, yes, I <em>totally, totally </em>get this is a thing and I might well be doing a lot of that thing. And that my inability to be more convincing, or in places more concrete, with these arguments is a symptom that points to that. That I liked things better back when everything was worse, time has in some ways passed me by, and other such things.</p>\n<p>I feel that way about a lot of things, sometimes. I get old, same as everyone. It’s hard to tell how much of this is me getting old and set in ways and nostalgic, versus how much is actual problems and civilizational decline and social media and Goodhart’s Law and [other things] destroying everything good. How much of this is me having very strong links to the benefits and deep implications of systems that no longer make sense, and making errors in magnitude? Is this the same impulse that leads to NIMBYism and hatred of capitalists and creative destruction everywhere, and is almost always valid in important ways but centrally and more importantly wrong? Is all of my good reasons justifying it me being too clever for my own good?</p>\n<p>I don’t know.</p>\n<p>It is also likely that I have undo motivation to find problems with card rebalancing. I have quirky preferences. I think it leads to too much superficial balance, largely because players demand it, and that this is quite bad, which I’ll discuss in the last section. Also, I’ll be building a game where easy rebalancing is flat out not an option because it will be counting on establishing player trust in its digital objects, and appealing to an audience that highly values what I call card ownership, because it highly values parallel types of ownership anywhere and everywhere.</p>\n<p>When I ask myself what my <em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TGux5Fhcd7GmTfNGC/is-that-your-true-rejection\">true, main objection</a> </em>is in all this, I get back two answers.</p>\n<p>The first is that by doing constant changes we’re wiping out value and history, but that feels like <em>a valid choice. </em>It will sometimes be <em>the right thing to do. </em>If that’s all there is.</p>\n<p>The second is that I believe that given the power and opportunity, <em>it will be used wrong, </em>and be used to make the product worse. Goodhart’s Law. When I tunnel into that, and ask: What is the primary way I expect this to happen?</p>\n<p>I get a clear answer.</p>\n<p>Overbalance.</p>\n<h4>3. Games That Rebalance Will Overbalance</h4>\n<h4>3A. Cards, including many iconic cards that are core to the game, or to factions/colors/classes, get nerfed.</h4>\n<p>Games without rebalancing solve their most extreme problems with bans. As the cost of banning cards goes down via rebalancing, they use this cheaper form of banning cards more often.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/02/10/eternal-and-hearthstone-economy-versus-magic-economy/\">Eternal</a> and Hearthstone rely on rebalancing. In both cases, it has been used frequently to nerf constructed cards, resulting in effective bans.</p>\n<p>In both cases, it has not been used frequently (if at all) to strengthen cards in a way that resulted in the cards gaining constructed level power and appearing frequently.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_changes\">this compilation of Hearthstone balance changes</a>, almost all of which are cost increases or effect decreases. Hearthstone’s base set has continuously gotten crappier, as its staple cards have been taken out one at a time, to the extent that a substantial percentage of the set has now fallen victim. The rate slowed a lot when the beta ended, but the pattern continued.</p>\n<p>This is especially bad when it targets powerful cards that represent a unique ability of a color or faction. The best versions of these abilities need to be very good cards, so the abilities will be things worth sacrificing to get. You also don’t want more cards that do the same thing at the same power level, to avoid letting players use tons of copies of the card. Red in Artifact is balanced not around <em>all </em>its heroes being bigger and stronger than <em>all </em>others, but around <em>its best </em>heroes being stronger than <em>other colors’ best </em>heroes. Hence (pre-patch) Axe and Legion Commander, then a drop off. Druid in Heartstone used to get Innervate and Wild Growth, which balanced what other colors get, and has now mostly lost both.</p>\n<p>Each iconic card that gets weakened doubly strengthens the case for weakening the next one. The remaining cards are comparatively stronger, and the bar to taking action has gone down in both relative and absolute terms.</p>\n<h4>3B. Cards that are already good will not get better</h4>\n<p>Artifact’s first patch weakened or transformed two of its best heroes, and strengthened five others. None of the five strengthened heroes were previously playable in constructed, and at most one of them is at all playable now.</p>\n<p>One of its other two moves, the changes to Jasper Daggers, did create a powerful card with a unique new ability. This was good to see in principle, if a little odd (and I do in some ways dislike that you can get out from having all your heroes silenced, but we learn and adapt), and its primary purpose was to serve as an additional way to weaken one of the two injured heroes, by giving players an answer to Gust and thus to Drow Ranger.</p>\n<p>Jasper Daggers was not an example of ‘we have a card that we’d like to be good enough, but people aren’t playing it, so we’ll push that hard more.’ It was also not an example of, ‘we have a card that people are playing, but we’d like them to play it more, so we’re going to make it better’ or ‘we have a card people are playing, but we’d like to make the associated decks stronger, so we’re going to make it better.’ It was more like ‘we need this card to exist, and can’t wait until we have an expansion, so we’re going to stick that card (with aggressive costing) into the slot where we used to have Jasper Daggers.’</p>\n<p>To preserve the flavor and connection to the original Jasper Daggers, it was allowed to keep pierce. But this was much more of a ‘print a new card out of cycle’ action than a balance change.</p>\n<p>Eternal, unlike Hearthstone, does often strengthen cards, but like Artifact’s hero improvements, it does so on cards that are not competitive, and does not in doing so create dangerous new cards. Consider the first change log I found on Google search, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalCardGame/comments/9nbd39/139_balance_changes/\">patch 1.39</a>. That was also the patch that made me say ‘all right, I’m out with (almost) no regrets.’ The constructed section takes down key longtime staples Channel the Tempest and Icaria, the Liberator, newcomer Auerlian Merchant, and the what-did-I-ever-do-to-you-except-eat-your-face hidden gem Predatory Carnosaur. Then the draft portion offers various buffs and nerfs, with more buffs than nerfs, but none of those buffs are impactful on constructed play, nor were they intended to be.</p>\n<p>So in an important sense, none of them count.</p>\n<p>Thus:</p>\n<h4>3C. Card power levels will converge and cards will become redundant</h4>\n<p>There is a range of sensible power differentials between cards. Sometimes, this move will be in the right direction. For a time. But all slopes are slippery and everything is trying to kill you, if changes only go in one direction.</p>\n<p>The rest of this section risks being something that belonged in <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/12/28/card-balance-and-artifact/\">Card Balance and Artifact</a> but I realized that the previous post didn’t really justify why such balance could be a bad thing, so here we are.</p>\n<p>Each faction/color will now have a wide variety of options to do each of its core things, within a relatively narrow power level. Decisions stop being as interesting.</p>\n<p>I like the idea that blue gets a single copy of a broken counter, Mana Drain, then four copies of one great counter, Counterspell, then mediocre ones like Power Sink and Spell Blast. Or later, that you get Counterspell for UU, you get a conditional Mana Leak for 1U, and then if you want more counters like Dissipate you’ll have to pay three mana for them and not get much in exchange. No matter what you’re looking for, you have big tension, as there’s a marginal card that’s there to tempt you.</p>\n<p>Or that red gets to play Lightning Bolt, then it gets to play Chain Lightning, then it gets to pay up for Fireball, or at least Incinerate. Or that Druid in Hearthstone gets Innervate and Wild Growth, but only gets two of each and no supplemental options half as good.</p>\n<p>Magic now has a variety of counters available, mostly all the same. You spend three mana, and you get to counter a spell plus a little something extra, as many times as you want. I tested for the Pro Tour on Magic Arena with Sinister Sabotage instead of Ionize, because I didn’t feel like wasting rare wildcards on Ionize. Close enough. Red similarly has a large number of available burn spells at close power levels, none of which is a clear big reward for splashing the color like Lightning Bolt is in Old School.</p>\n<p>In Artifact, <em>it is important that the fourth red hero is much worse than the second one. </em>That’s one way you have to sacrifice to get one color decks. Another is that <em>your cards 35-40 are also going to suck, and you’re going to get less of the awesome. </em>Take those away, and we get a lot of mono-color decks and things are much less interesting. If mono-blue gets too good in Artifact, which is easy to imagine, the risk is that they target it by doing something like pushing Annihilate to seven mana, which makes rewards to diverse colors that much worse rather than better.</p>\n<p>Games also stop being as interesting. We want a diversity of game experiences, and having all the cards at similar power levels makes that much harder, and risks taking out one of the good sources of variance and luck. Decks should have key cards that they very much want to draw, that games then revolve around, and to do that those cards need to be big rewards.</p>\n<p>It seems like over time, we learn what players will play and like it because they need the effect in question, and we give them that, which to me takes the joy away. The cards are less special, you don’t have that ‘good stuff’ feeling that players (and I in particular) love. That idea that you’re getting away with something and mining out the premium quality.</p>\n<p>The countering force is new cards that restore the imbalance. As noted in the advantages section, rebalancing enables this to be more extreme. That also carries its own dangers. Colors, and the game, become focused each quarter on the ‘new hotness’ of the latest set, disenfranchising existing cards and strategies and forcing players to take up the new ones. Existing strategies need to get major help each set as the balance shifts, or they fall away, so diversity is limited to what an individual set can do. Core abilities like counters and burn can’t get such boosts all that often.</p>\n<h4>3D. Matchups become more balanced, cards <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/25/complexity-is-bad/\">get more complex</a> and answers stop working</h4>\n<p>Brad Nelson recently wrote an article (behind the Star City Games paywall) where he celebrated that Magic was embracing cards that could play in all situations. He noted that one big advantage of this was that Arena’s best of one matches would make more sense, as sideboards would be less vital. He also noted how he hates it when sideboards are about jamming lots of hate cards in that swing entire matchups.</p>\n<p>I agree that this is happening. I strongly disagree that this is good.</p>\n<p>I think Magic’s lack of hate cards, and its printing lots of cards (including but not limited to its planeswalkers) that have tons of versatility and that always play well, as one of its key problems. I think that Modern is great in large part because if you want to beat any given thing, you mostly can do that quite reliably, so things adjust. It’s a little heavy handed, sure, but it gets the job done.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, it guards us against mistakes. If something is out of hand, players can respond with the hate until it is back in hand. Whereas in Standard, we’ve seen cycle after cycle where one or two decks proved to ‘play better Magic’ than others, once the good builds were found, and suddenly entire colors couldn’t beat them no matter how much they cared.</p>\n<p>Sideboarding that is subtle and involves small strategic shifts is super interesting, and it’s been great for Brad Nelson, since he’s perhaps the world’s expert in it. But it’s also highly dangerous, and I think it being less dramatic and obvious hurts the average player experience.</p>\n<p>Players often complain about matchups being ‘too lopsided’ as if this reduces skill too much. In extremus it can do that, but having everything be 55-45 to me is far worse. I much prefer things more bold. Not every good card, or every good deck, should be good at every task.</p>\n<p>In practice, I believe that more tuning will lead to calls to even out these matchups, and for things to more approach the 50-50-for-all world far too often. Which also gets us to the next problem.</p>\n<h4>3E. Decks become scripted and dictated</h4>\n<p>This is a strange result. It seems backwards.</p>\n<p>One would expect that without careful balance, whatever is strongest would emerge as strongest, and force everyone to use it.</p>\n<p>Instead, what we <em>actually </em>see is that development teams effectively do things like ‘This is the second three drop for the U/G flying deck and that deck needs a little help there to deal with the three-damage mass removal spell we used to balance out the R/G deck, so let’s move it to 3/4.’</p>\n<p>Once the decks people want to play, slash the game wants to create, are identified, they are given tools that are fitted to answer the other fitted tools in the other decks. Cards that other supported decks find hard to answer are weakened, cards that other supported decks are strong against are not.</p>\n<p>The idea that ‘these are the things, and they should all be roughly equal’ is a natural thing to think, in and out of games. My Google News last week contained a Reddit post on Hearthstone entitled ‘we might have a problem’ because in the last week, the author had faced one hero 30% of the time. As conclusive evidence on its own. Out of nine possible! That is a highly toxic thing to consider an issue. Even in his stats, you could see that the second most played class was a natural answer to the most played one. This is one more reason to want to tie one’s hands. It’s also one more example of unbalanced matchups keeping things in check.</p>\n<p>The result is that strategies end up with more and more clearly correct included cards, and less room for variety and creativity. There might be a lot of these scripted decks (e.g. Eternal has <em>a ton </em>of at least tier 2 options because of this) but each involves a core that’s been pre-selected, then a few choices between similarly strong filler cards slash adjustments to the curve or number of removal spells or such, all of which are solid. There is relatively little need or temptation to splash additional colors or include conflicting strategies to improve card quality or shore up weaknesses.</p>\n<p>By contrast, when decks that are unexpected take the stage, often they have to play awkward cards that don’t work right but are necessary, or fill out requirements with cards that are outright bad because the deck wasn’t intentionally rounded out in that spot. Or they don’t have everything they naturally want so they are tempted to branch out into other colors or actions rather than give up card quality or flexibility.</p>\n<p>Often those decks are the result of someone’s heroic effort, and/or a window where what is being played becomes unbalanced and opens things up to a not-as-naturally-strong idea. I don’t want to lose that.</p>\n<p>When I returned to the Pro Tour, I came to Standard with a Blue/Black Faerie deck. As is strangely often the case, I was a set too early, as Bitterblossom was in the next set and did not yet exist. But with the use of Pendelhaven and a willingness to play eight 1/1 high flying one drops, my team had made the deck work, and it did quite well.</p>\n<p>Before the tournament, head developer Aaron Forsythe asked to see the deck. I showed him.</p>\n<p>When he asked who built the deck, I told him: You did.</p>\n<p>There were <em>exactly </em>enough playable Faeries to make the deck work, so you played all of them. Then you played the obviously best spells to complement that. Then you were done. I’d put the deck together, but in a real sense, Aaron dictated what it looked like.</p>\n<p>I was wrong that day. Wizards had, with the aid of Bitterblossom, built a different and much better deck. Mine was my own creation, and I came to realize this – I was making something where there wasn’t (yet) supposed to be anything. More and more, though, this has become a rarity. Which is a shame.</p>\n<p>One could flip that on its head, of course. By forcing cards to lock in, we might force things to be heavy handed, to make sure the intended strategies work, whereas with adjustments we can see what people do and go from there in case we miss (or overshoot). But then, in the end, it will absolutely be the game’s people choosing what the decks look like.</p>\n<h4>4. Conclusion</h4>\n<p>How aggressively and frequently should games, especially digital card games, rebalance their components?</p>\n<p>Different games have different economic structures and different goals, and want different things. My conclusion, having looked at this from many angles, is that each game should embrace a pattern.  That pattern should either strongly favor rebalancing, <em>or </em>strongly favor <em>not </em>rebalancing. Games in the first section should use this tool to move their components around in interesting ways on a continuous basis. Games in the second section should do their best to avoid changing their components once they are set, and do so at most in emergencies where the alternative is a ban.</p>\n<p>The biggest key for the first category is to avoid the trap of scaling back everything powerful and cool, and strengthening only things that are still not very good. The other key is to not be afraid to try stuff and be inconsistent. It’s <em>totally fine </em>to change a casting cost from four to six to three and then back to four, if that’s doing something interesting. Try stuff. See what happens. Build the expectation that players will need to roll with the punches, and that what they’ve learned could prove unhelpful.</p>\n<p>The biggest key for the second category is that you’re operating without a net. The benefits are hard to get. If you mess up, the mistake is forever. That makes it hard to do interesting things without taking big, real risks. Rotation helps, but only goes so far. The idea of a public rebalancing period, before permanent ownership of cards (or allowing it, but with the known associated risks) and during which cards can be changed, may be a good one – but it also might allow the same kind of Goodhart’s Law problems discussed here in through the back door.</p>\n<p>One can also think of rebalancing cards as a type of government intervention, with all its advantages and downsides. The intervention will almost always be well-meaning, and seek to respond to the needs of the people. It has a problem it is trying to help with. But it threatens people’s rights, property, and ability to know how things work or predict the future, and risks making things too much about what interventions are chosen. People focus on the next action, what it should be, how to influence it. If you do what is popular or solves short term concerns, too often, the result ends up gradually being more oppressive in ways that can be hard to see. Interventions tend to be in one direction, the government is loathe to look like an idiot or to contradict itself, and its moves become difficult to reverse. On the other hand, there are real problems that won’t solve themselves, and things that get sufficiently out of balance will stay out of balance and make people unhappy and worse off if not addressed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<h2>Abstract </h2><blockquote>Many real world learning tasks involve complex or hard-to-specify objectives, and using an easier-to-specify proxy can lead to poor performance or misaligned behavior. One solution is to have humans provide a training signal by demonstrating or judging performance, but this approach fails if the task is too complicated for a human to directly evaluate. We propose Iterated Amplification, an alternative training strategy which progressively builds up a training signal for difficult problems by combining solutions to easier subproblems. Iterated Amplification is closely related to Expert Iteration (Anthony et al., 2017; Silver et al., 2017b), except that it uses no external reward function. We present results in algorithmic environments, showing that Iterated Amplification can efficiently learn complex behaviors.</blockquote><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><em>Tomorrow&#x27;s AI Alignment Forum sequences post will be &#x27;AI safety without goal-directed behavior&#x27; by Rohin Shah,</em> in the sequence on Value Learning.</p><p>The next post in this sequence on Iterated Amplification will be &#x27;AlphaGo Zero and capability amplification&#x27;, by Paul Christiano, on Tuesday 8th January.</p>",

Consider a multiplayer game of stag hunt where rabbits are shared equally among the group, but it&#x27;s still better for everyone to team up and capture the stag than for everyone to catch a rabbit. The all-rabbit equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium that isn&#x27;t the best ash equilibrium. This case seems simple to resolve, but there are much more difficult examples, such as a MAX-3-SAT game where each hypothetical version of the agent in Omega&#x27;s head has incompatible observation strings, some short, some very long, and they are each responsible for fixing the value of one variable.</p><h2><strong>Problem 1: Improper Randomization</strong></h2><p>Setting the Vingean and game theory issues to one side, there&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s going wrong here. <em>The stated setup of how the policy interacts with the environment is incompatible with this Nash equilibrium view of UDT</em>.</p><p>As a simple example of what&#x27;s going wrong, consider a single-turn game against an environment that makes two queries to what the policy does, and returns a reward of 1 if they are the same, and 0 if they are different. In standard game theory, randomizing between two actions with identical payoff should have the same expected payoff. But here there&#x27;s a penalty for randomizing! And because each call to the policy returns an action sampled from the distribution <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\" \\pi(\\vec{o})\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">π</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-munderover\"><span class=\"mjx-stack\"><span class=\"mjx-over\" style=\"height: 0.248em; padding-bottom: 0.06em; padding-left: 0.048em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\" style=\"vertical-align: top;\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-vec-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.225em;\">→</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-op\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">o</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>, identical oracle calls to the policy may return different outputs. The proper way to view this to make it compatible with the Nash equilibrium view is to sample the action <em>first</em>, and <em>then</em> plug it into the open slots in the environment. You only randomize once.</p><p>This isn&#x27;t quite as trivial as it looks, because Reflective Oracles have this &quot;intrinsic randomness&quot; thing going on, two identical oracle calls to the same agent may return different outputs. In Abram&#x27;s words, reflective oracles are annoyingly realist about probability, they act as if a agent can randomize in such a way as to take different actions in the same information state. The proper way to do this is to sample a deterministic policy first, and then plug it into the slots in the environment. When thinking about a situation where an agent (possibly yourself) is randomizing, you may not know what action it will take, but you should think that the agent will take the same action in an identical state.</p><p>The obvious hack is to just cache the result every time the environment makes an oracle call, because if you compute it up-front, the policy sample will probably take an infinite amount of information to specify. But if you apply this hack and cache what was said about the policy so far, you run into another issue with non-halting environments. Because Reflective Oracle-AIXI calls an oracle on an environment to get the next bit, instead of just running the environment (maybe the environment doesn&#x27;t halt, and you still need to get the next bit somehow), you don&#x27;t get the policy sample. If the partial policy sample used by the environment on turn <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"t\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span></span></span></span></span> takes less than <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"f(t)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;\">f</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> (where <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"f\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;\">f</span></span></span></span></span></span> is computable) bits to encode, you can use the oracle to recover it and use that information on the next turn, but again this fails in full generality. The problem arises when you&#x27;ve got an environment that, on some turn, with some positive probability, doesn&#x27;t halt and makes infinitely many oracle calls. Then there&#x27;s no way (that I know of, yet) to guarantee that the behavior of the policy on future turns is consistent with what it did on that turn.</p><h2><strong>Problem 2: Can&#x27;t Build Desired Oracle</strong></h2><p>What if we then attempt to get a new notion of oracle where we have a probability distribution over samples?

But seems to me that the problem is with <em>high variance </em>(one year a ton of goods, the very next year nothing), not with foreign goods <em>per se</em>. Because, anytime a country participates in foreign trade, the local producers of the stuff that is being imported, are pushed out of business. But we have the law of comparative advantages saying that in global, this is a <em>good </em>thing, for both countries. (Or to put it differently, trade <em>sanctions </em>are typically used as a punishment, not as a reward.)

However, there are many other arguments that suggest that AI systems will or should be goal-directed, which I will discuss in this post.</p><p>Note that I don’t think of this as the <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI\">Tool AI vs. Agent AI</a> argument: it seems possible to build agent AI systems that are not goal-directed. For example, imitation learning allows you to create an agent that behaves similarly to another agent -- I would classify this as “Agent AI that is not goal-directed”. (But see <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9zpT9dikrrebdq3Jf/will-humans-build-goal-directed-agents#mjYjBiq4mQosy6Wwt\">this comment thread</a> for discussion.)</p><p>Note that these arguments have different implications than the argument that superintelligent AI must be goal-directed due to coherence arguments. Suppose you believe all of the following:</p><ul><li>Any of the arguments in this post.</li><li>Superintelligent AI is not <em>required</em> to be goal-directed, as I argued in the <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NxF5G6CJiof6cemTw/coherence-arguments-do-not-imply-goal-directed-behavior\">last post</a>.</li><li>Goal-directed agents cause catastrophe by default.</li></ul><p>Then you could try to create alternative designs for AI systems such that they can do the things that goal-directed agents can do without themselves being goal-directed. You could also try to persuade AI researchers of these facts, so that they don’t build goal-directed systems.</p><h3>Economic efficiency: goal-directed humans</h3><p>Humans want to build powerful AI systems in order to help them achieve their goals -- it seems quite clear that humans are at least partially goal-directed. As a result, it seems natural that they would build AI systems that are also goal-directed.</p><p>This is really an argument that the <em>system</em> comprising the human and AI agent should be directed towards some goal. The AI agent by itself need not be goal-directed as long as we get goal-directed behavior when combined with a human operator. However, in the situation where the AI agent is much more intelligent than the human, it is probably best to delegate most or all decisions to the agent, and so the agent could still look mostly goal-directed.</p><p>Even so, you could imagine that even the small part of the work that the human continues to do allows the agent to not be goal-directed, especially over long horizons. For example, perhaps the human decides what the agent should do each day, and the agent executes the instruction, which involves planning over the course of a day, but no longer. (I am <em>not</em> arguing that this is safe; on the contrary, having very powerful optimization over the course of a day seems probably unsafe.) This could be extremely powerful without the AI being goal-directed over the long term.</p><p>Another example would be a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fkLYhTQteAu5SinAc/corrigibility\">corrigible</a> agent, which could be extremely powerful while not being goal-directed over the long term. (Though the meanings of “goal-directed” and “corrigible” are sufficiently fuzzy that this is not obvious and depends on the definitions we settle on for each.)</p><h3>Economic efficiency: beyond human performance</h3><p>Another benefit of goal-directed behavior is that it allows us to find novel ways of achieving our goals that we may not have thought of, such as AlphaGo’s move 37. Goal-directed behavior is one of the few methods we know of that allow AI systems to exceed human performance.</p><p>I think this is a good argument for goal-directed behavior, but given the problems of goal-directed behavior I think it’s worth searching for alternatives, such as the two examples in the previous section (optimizing over a day, and corrigibility). Alternatively, we could learn human reasoning, and execute it for a longer subjective time than humans would, in order to make better decisions. Or we could have systems that remain uncertain about the goal and clarify what they should do when there are multiple very different options (though this has its own problems).</p><h3>Current progress in reinforcement learning</h3><p>If we had to guess today which paradigm would lead to AI systems that can exceed human performance, I would guess reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, we have a reward function and we seek to choose actions that maximize the sum of expected discounted rewards. This sounds a lot like an agent that is searching over actions for the best one according to a measure of goodness (the reward function [1]), which I said previously is a goal-directed agent. And the math behind RL says that the agent should be trying to maximize its reward for the rest of time, which makes it long-term [2].</p><p>That said, current RL agents learn to replay behavior that in their past experience worked well, and typically do not generalize outside of the training distribution. This does not seem like a search over actions to find ones that are the best. In particular, you shouldn’t expect a treacherous turn, since the whole point of a treacherous turn is that you don’t see it coming because it never happened before.</p><p>In addition, current RL is episodic, so we should only expect that RL agents are goal-directed <em>over the current episode</em> and not in the long-term. Of course, many tasks would have very long episodes, such as being a CEO. The vanilla deep RL approach here would be to specify a reward function for how good a CEO you are, and then try many different ways of being a CEO and learn from experience. This requires you to collect many full episodes of being a CEO, which would be extremely time-consuming.</p><p>Perhaps with enough advances in model-based deep RL we could train the model on partial trajectories and that would be enough, since it could generalize to full trajectories. I think this is a tenable position, though I personally don’t expect it to work since it relies on our model generalizing well, which seems unlikely even with future research.</p><p>These arguments lead me to believe that we’ll probably have to do something that is not vanilla deep RL in order to train an AI system that can be a CEO, and that thing may not be goal-directed.</p><p>Overall, it is certainly possible that improved RL agents will look like dangerous long-term goal-directed agents, but this does not seem to be the case today and there seem to be serious difficulties in scaling current algorithms to superintelligent AI systems that can optimize over the long term. (I’m not arguing for long timelines here, since I wouldn’t be surprised if we figured out some way that <em>wasn’t</em> vanilla deep RL to optimize over the long term, but that method need not be goal-directed.)</p><h3>Existing intelligent agents are goal-directed</h3><p>So far, humans and perhaps animals are the only example of generally intelligent agents that we know of, and they seem to be quite goal-directed. This is some evidence that we should expect intelligent agents that we build to also be goal-directed.</p><p>Ultimately we are observing a correlation between two things with sample size 1, which is really not much evidence at all. If you believe that many animals are also intelligent and goal-directed, then perhaps the sample size is larger, since there are intelligent animals with very different evolutionary histories and neural architectures  (eg. octopuses).</p><p>However, this is specifically about agents that were created by evolution, which did a relatively stupid blind search over a large space, and we could use a different method to develop AI systems. So this argument makes me more wary of creating AI systems using evolutionary searches over large spaces, but it doesn’t make me much more confident that all good AI systems must be goal-directed.</p><h3>Interpretability</h3><p>Another argument for building a goal-directed agent is that it allows us to predict what it’s going to do in novel circumstances. While you may not be able to predict the specific actions it will take, you can predict some features of the final world state, in the same way that if I were to play Magnus Carlsen at chess, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rEDpaTTEzhPLz4fHh/expected-creative-surprises\">I can’t predict how he will play, but I can predict that he will win</a>.</p><p>I do not understand the intent behind this argument. It seems as though faced with the negative results that suggest that goal-directed behavior tends to cause catastrophic outcomes, we’re arguing that it’s a good idea to build a goal-directed agent so that we can more easily predict that it’s going to cause catastrophe.</p><p>I also think that we would typically be able to predict significantly <em>more</em> about what any AI system we actually build will do (than if we modeled it as trying to achieve some goal). This is because “agent seeking a particular goal” is one of the simplest models we can build, and with any system we have more information on, we start refining the model to make it better.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Overall, I think there are good reasons to think that “by default” we would develop goal-directed AI systems, because the things we want AIs to do can be easily phrased as goals, and because the stated goal of reinforcement learning is to build goal-directed agents (although they do not look like goal-directed agents today). As a result, it seems important to figure out ways to get the powerful capabilities of goal-directed agents through agents that are not themselves goal-directed. In particular, this suggests that we will need to figure out ways to build AI systems that do not involve specifying a utility function that the AI should optimize, or even learning a utility function that the AI then optimizes.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>[1] Technically, actions are chosen according to the Q function, but the distinction isn’t important here.</p><p>[2] Discounting does cause us to prioritize short-term rewards over long-term ones. On the other hand, discounting seems mostly like a hack to make the math not spit out infinities, and so that learning is more stable. On the third hand, infinite horizon MDPs with undiscounted reward aren&#x27;t solvable unless you almost surely enter an absorbing state. So discounting complicates the picture, but not in a particularly interesting way, and I don’t want to rest an argument against long-term goal-directed behavior on the presence of discounting.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>First posted to <a href=\"http://notthinkable.com/blog\">notthinkable.com</a></em></p><p>I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a blog post for awhile (years), because more and more I&#x27;m finding that contributing to others, in whatever form that takes, is a really rewarding thing to do, and makes me feel connected.<br/><br/>But I&#x27;ve been putting it off, because I can&#x27;t write <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Meditations on Moloch</a> on my first try.</p><p>I have this really sticky idea that if I hold off writing a post, somehow, in the future, I&#x27;ll be able to write something really good: that moves a conversation, or that is an authentic expression of who I am, or something. Even though I know this is silly. People tend to have to have practice writing blog posts for awhile before they produce something that touches people.<br/><br/>However, the feeling is still there. Because I don&#x27;t want to give up on the idea that this won&#x27;t be as good as I want it to be when I publish it. That would mean a kick to my ego, and that would be bad. Why can&#x27;t I just write something and revise it endlessly, so that it can be good enough first time? I don&#x27;t want blogging to be how it is. I want it my way!<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>It seems that I&#x27;m a slow learner when it comes to this.<br/><br/>Last year I got into online dating (briefly). I&#x27;d been putting it off for awhile (years). Eventually what it took was a close friend sitting down next to me, watching me, whilst I messaged people, because I just wouldn&#x27;t do it alone.<br/><br/>It reminds me of a Jordan Peterson video where he talks about treating people who are afraid of needles. They&#x27;ll start with the smallest possible step: let&#x27;s just have a needle in the room, and reveal this fact. Not even a visible needle. Just create awareness that there&#x27;s a needle in the room. And go from there: first having the needle visible. Then having it brought closer. Then having the patient touch it, etc. Each session taking a small step, making progress little by little.<br/><br/>I was originally going to write an essay called &#x27;holding hands&#x27; awhile back, about this dynamic. My friend said that sounded like a great idea. But I didn&#x27;t ever write it, because I didn&#x27;t follow my own advice.<br/><br/>There&#x27;s a lot of humility required in something like this. A previous Nick would have judged. Aren&#x27;t you ashamed of yourself? You can&#x27;t even do that? That&#x27;s pretty pathetic. You should just get over yourself, and start dating. Man up!<br/><br/>The thing is though, the judging didn&#x27;t work, but &#x27;holding hands&#x27; did.<br/><br/>It turned out that I really didn&#x27;t want to be judged, rejected, or have people ignore my messages. &#x27;Turned out&#x27; I say. No, I totally knew that was the case all along, but I wanted it not to be that way.<br/><br/>And then even after I went through that, I still wanted it my way! I would really read through someone&#x27;s profile, <em>thoughtfully</em>, and picture myself <em>spending time</em> with that person, and then after doing that, send a really <em>personalised</em>, <em>thoughtful</em>, and <em>kind</em> message, before finally, after feeling good about myself for awhile for doing that, begrudgingly move on to the next person.<br/><br/>There&#x27;s something about giving up wanting it your way that opens you up to how a system actually works. What it actually is. So in other words, letting go of your own stuff about how a thing should be, lets you see the thing for how it is in reality. As a consequence of this you get better results with the thing.<br/><br/>But even knowing this, I still want it my way.<br/><br/>Way before actually doing it, I&#x27;d modelled out how online dating worked, in theory. I knew that most messages I&#x27;d send to women would be ignored, and that it was a numbers game. I also had a strong suspicion that certain kinds of messages would have better results. However, I still wanted it my way, and still needed to have the experience of having my thoughtful messages ignored, before I finally let go of all of that and accepted the way the system actually is. And suddenly then the whole thing made much more sense, and then I could think about it and model it well, because I&#x27;m no longer getting in my own way, and it&#x27;s less about me.<br/><br/>However, even knowing all that, I still rewrote a bunch of blog posts endlessly, and put off making a post to the community, because I want my first post to be good and read by a bunch of people and liked and for it to all go my way.<br/><br/>I expect that the experience of making a post and not having this result will be the gentle nudge from reality that I need to let go of wanting this to go my way, and subsequently free me up to make better posts. God forbid if people actually like it.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>I think that wanting or expecting things to &#x27;go my way&#x27; is a pretty deeply grounded assumption in the human psyche.<br/><br/>I recently decided to quit my job and start my own <a href=\"http://notthinkable.com\">coaching and personal development company,</a> and what I am now consistently faced with is my own wishful thinking about every single aspect of that whole thing.<br/><br/>I assumed I&#x27;d be able to get clients easily. After all, I already had clients, and now that I have way more hours in the day to throw at this, surely that will mean I can just expand my efforts and more clients will appear to me. Also: it wouldn&#x27;t take me that long, right? After all, I&#x27;m a really talented coach. People keep telling me how great I am at it, and I haven&#x27;t even trained! And I&#x27;m doing a transformational coaching course with all these other up-and-coming coaches, and so by the time I&#x27;ve done that I&#x27;m going to be super amazing. People should be knocking down my door. I&#x27;ll transform their lives!</p><p>Oh yes and my energy! Once I have more clients, I&#x27;m going to have more energy. Because coaching is my favourite thing in the world, and gives me so much energy, so clearly I can just convert that 1-1 into productive actions that give me even more clients... message, before finally, after feeling good about myself for awhile for doing that, begrudgingly move on to the next person. </p><p>I mean, I&#x27;ve been reading LessWrong for awhile, and I&#x27;ve done CFAR and the mentorship program, and a bunch of other stuff. So surely I&#x27;m not going to be super irrational about this, right? Assume I know what&#x27;s something&#x27;s going to be like before doing it, and all that? I&#x27;ll have much more realistic expectations, and I&#x27;ll be burning cash too, so I&#x27;ll have to get serious, because now money is on the line! <em>It&#x27;s like a gigantic bet on myself!</em></p><p>Uh oh, there I go again! </p><p>But I really really want it to be this way!<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>I want to say something in this essay beyond: Look how irrational I am. Something that is useful, or a contribution.<br/><br/>So let&#x27;s give that a try.<br/><br/>If my primary directive is to keep things the way they are, and validate my own existence by maintaining and reinforcing my own identity and beliefs about the world, say, then all of the actions above are totally understandable.<br/><br/>If I see myself as talented, and I believe the world is such a place that talented people should be able to win because that&#x27;s how it should be, then it would be painful to have those views trodden on by being ignored by people when I&#x27;m actually putting my talents out there. And plus I really care too, because I believe, say, that discovering ones own blindspots and assumptions is incredibly important, and is like my calling, so clearly other people should care about that too, right?<br/><br/>Or if I&#x27;m someone who sees themselves as intelligent, and so then has to maintain and reinforce my self-image as such a person, then I&#x27;d better not write a blog post that threatens this view. Otherwise people will ignore it, or pass judgement on it, and that would be pretty bad for my reinforcing-self-image-ness.<br/><br/>Or maybe I believe that failure is bad, and that if I fail, then I personally am I failure. So I have those two things conflated. Then anything I do risks failing, especially new things, so I&#x27;d better not do the new things, then. Because I want it my way, and I don&#x27;t like thinking about the fact I could be a failure.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>Ok let&#x27;s try again, with metaphors this time.<br/><br/>I take the view that the default position, in any new domain, is something like: childlike, egocentric, personally-oriented, and all about you (or me). That&#x27;s sort of like a fact of reality, when trying something new. So if you do try something new, you start in the default position. The default position &#x27;wants it my way&#x27; and so resists how things are. Resists the way the system actually is.<br/><br/>So now, like a child learning to walk, you dip a finger into the system. It&#x27;s cold, that system, and wet. It wasn&#x27;t a warm paradise, like you wanted it to be. But something funny has happened now. You now have this wet watery thing on your finger, and you can look at it, and it&#x27;s interesting. And oh, look also, this thing, this system you dipped your finger into, it has properties. It has stuff-ness. It&#x27;s wet, I mean, that&#x27;s something right? Before you touched it, you didn&#x27;t even know that! I mean, ok, you intellectually knew it was wet, because you&#x27;d read a book and you know that lakes are made of water. But this wetness.. it wasn&#x27;t how you expected it to be at all! In a sense, it was really nothing like the books.</p><p>Then you can put a foot in, say. You can feel the rough mud beneath the surface. It feels different to the water. Yeah, you knew that there might be mud down there, you&#x27;d read that too. But this is your first time feeling it, and its so different to what you expected it to be. It&#x27;s not what you wanted... but it isn&#x27;t not what you wanted either. It&#x27;s not even in the realm of wanting or not wanting. It&#x27;s in the realm of: this is what&#x27;s actually there, now. Wanting or not wanting lives in a totally different realm, it would seem.<br/><br/>And then maybe you go through a few more cycles and you learn to swim in the lake. Now you&#x27;re fully immersed in the system. Your identity no longer has anything to say about it, because it is how it is, and your opinion on it, although now informed, lives in a totally separate domain. And also it gets in the way of your swimming, you see now. You can&#x27;t both swim effectively and hold an opinion on it. You can&#x27;t do both activities without the swimming suffering. And why? Well, because the system of swimming says so.<br/><br/>Do you still get worried about dipping a finger in now you&#x27;re a pro swimmer? Not really. I mean, you can, but it wouldn&#x27;t really be a valuable use of your time to relive that experience, except for nostalgia. Your psychological development in the swimming domain is now actualised. Your identity in this realm is reduced, almost nothing. So there&#x27;s nothing to protect or maintain anymore, with respect to you and swimming. There just is the swimming, or not. And that barrier wall-y resistance-y feeling is no longer there, as a result. Not in the world of swimming, at least.<br/><br/>But try hand-gliding, and there it is again!<br/><br/>So what gives?<br/><br/>I think new domains are inherently threatening to our main job to persist and survive as weird conceptual beings of thoughts and ideas. I mean you have to get your ass kicked, before you learn to get out of your own way. And that&#x27;s why you have the default position.<br/><br/>But surely I can make the cycle faster! I&#x27;m a rationalist! I want it this way!<br/><br/>I do think you can make the cycle faster. The more you try new things, and see your own edges, the more ass-kicking you give yourself, the quicker the cycle becomes. But I suspect it&#x27;s always going to be there, just as a natural aspect of the growth and expansion of the consciousness of a human being.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>Wanting things to be a certain way is a function of me, not of the system. But that&#x27;s pretty obvious, I knew that right? It&#x27;s not going to stop me from wanting it my way.<br/><br/>One of my goals this year is to keep doing small things at the boundaries, to see my own edges and expand myself. So writing blog posts is one thing, making videos is another. And I&#x27;ll likely ask for help and support with this, holding hands if necessary. This takes humility, but then again, not wanting to hold hands is a function of me, not of the system.<br/><br/>Another related goal is to try to embrace the principles of MVP. Until I do something, there&#x27;s a good chance that what I&#x27;ve got is mostly childlike, egocentric, wishful thinking. Until I&#x27;ve really spent time interacting with a system, its just a conceptual blob of other people&#x27;s stuff, and I should probably just let go of that. Once I&#x27;ve shipped something, however, then it&#x27;s vulnerable to reality, and only then will I truly learn and grow.<br/><br/>But here&#x27;s my biggest takeaway from all this:<br/><br/>What I really wanted out of the system, in each case, wasn&#x27;t the most valuable thing to get, or what it had to teach me. What I wanted was me, and my own beliefs, and for everything to stay the same, so that my prime directive would be met.<br/><br/>What I got was, when I let go of that, was something new.<br/><br/>I had to empty my cup a little, give up wanting it my way, and immerse myself in not-knowing, for some new possibility to arise.<br/><br/>And so my final actionable here will be spend time in the not-knowing, when working in new domains, and to do so compassionately. The reason it&#x27;s uncomfortable, after all, is because I&#x27;m risking a part of myself. In the end I have to let go of something, in order to have something new.<br/><br/>This process of mini-cycles of psychological development, and of letting go of the way we want things to be, for the way they actually are, seems to be a pretty natural part of human growth and development. So I shouldn&#x27;t expect it to not be like that.<br/><br/>Likely publishing this is going to teach me something not at all like what I expect. And it has to be that way. Any growth that comes out of it for me, will necessarily be new. And that&#x27;s ok!<br/><br/>That said, I hope it gets received my way...</p><p></p>",

As of the last <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/09/prediction-markets-update.html\">general update</a>, Robin Hanson notes that while there is increasing research interest and a few general platforms are coming soon, the real goal of implementing inside organizations remains elusive.</p><p>I strongly suspect that it will remain so until companies are founded which use them from the beginning. This is because introducing people to new tools is hard. Introducing them to new tools that don’t even have a direct bearing on doing their jobs is even harder. We know that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/reitXJgJXFzKpdKyd/beware-trivial-inconveniences\">trivial inconveniences</a> are important; it was the dominant theme of the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MajyZJrsf8fAywWgY/a-lesswrong-crypto-autopsy\">crypto autopsy</a>. If it happens in an environment like Lesswrong with crypto, I expect it will be worse in virtually all other contexts.</p><p>If prediction markets are going to be widely adopted, they need to be widely applicable, which basically means that any given schlub needs to be able to make a bet in a market without any math/economics/computing background. Happily, we have extremely robust evidence that any given schlub is perfectly capable of making a bet, courtesy of casinos.</p><p>One way to help with this problem is to make it as easy and intuitive as possible to learn. To wit: interactive visualizations. The biggest inspirations are <a href=\"http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/\">Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a> by Brett Victor, and <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?show-welcome=true\">Metaculus</a>. The first is about exploring system behavior without math, and the training for the second does a pretty good job of letting you make predictions based on the <em>shape</em> of the probability curve (though this doesn’t work as well for understanding the payoffs). Another relevant tool is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram\">Sankey Diagram</a>, which makes the relative sizes of flows apparent at a glance. I don&#x27;t know of anything which makes such a thing interactive though - which is a shame, because I bet it would make controls comprehensible to people who don&#x27;t know any differential equations or linear algebra. I am currently impressed by <a href=\"https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/#firstPage\">Seeing Theory</a>. I ran across a few other websites which are designed to communicate math, and even one about risk, but for some reason all these savages are using Flash.</p><p>However, all of these is mostly for teaching math, and that is not actually the goal. Fundamentally the idea is information flows into the market, and only payments need to flow back out. So what we need is a way for people to specify what they think the outcome will be, with what confidence, without numbers.</p><p>Naively I am leaning in this direction:</p><ul><li>Numbers are presented as areas</li><li>Functions are presented as shapes</li><li>Operations show up as transformations of the areas/shapes (for example, showing how a given bet affects the overall market, or maybe combining sub-bets).</li><li>We want people to be able to translate their beliefs this way pretty easily. Stuff like &quot;the more sure you are, the narrower the shape should be,&quot; where the shape is the distribution curve, is intuitive.</li></ul><p>I feel like the instructions could be collapsed into a few drag-and-drop shapes, and a few heuristic guidelines for how to manipulate them to represent a belief accurately. Training people how to do this should easily fit into a single-session course, not more than a day if we include motivation, the payoffs, and a bunch of trial runs.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>(This post has been sitting in my drafts folder for 6 years. Not sure why I didn't make it public, but here it is now after some editing.)</p>\n<p>There are two problems closely related to the <a href=\"/posts/KLaJjNdENsHhKhG5m/ontological-crisis-in-humans\">Ontological Crisis in Humans</a>. I'll call them the \"Partial Utility Function Problem\" and the \"Decision Theory Upgrade Problem\".</p>\n<p><strong>Partial Utility Function Problem</strong></p>\n<p>As I mentioned in a <a href=\"/lw/fyb/ontological_crisis_in_humans/\">previous post</a>, the only apparent utility function we have seems to be defined over an ontology very different from the fundamental ontology of the universe. But even on it's native domain, the utility function seems only partially defined. In other words, it will throw an error (i.e., say \"I don't know\") on some possible states of the heuristical model. For example, this happens for me when the number of people gets sufficiently large, like 3^^^3 in Eliezer's Torture vs Dust Specks scenario. When we try to compute the expected utility of some action, how should we deal with these \"I don't know\" values that come up?</p>\n<p>(Note that I'm presenting a simplified version of the real problem we face, where in addition to \"I don't know\", our utility function could also return essentially random extrapolated values outside of the region where it gives sensible outputs.)</p>\n<p><strong>Decision Theory Upgrade Problem</strong></p>\n<p>In the Decision Theory Upgrade Problem, an agent decides that their current decision theory is inadequate in some way, and needs to be upgraded. (Note that the Ontological Crisis could be considered an instance of this more general problem.) The question is whether and how to transfer their values over to the new decision theory.</p>\n<p>For example a human might be be running a mix of several decision theories: reinforcement learning, heuristical model-based consequentialism, identity-based decision making (where you adopt one or more social roles, like \"environmentalist\" or \"academic\" as part of your identity and then make decisions based on pattern matching what that role would do in any given situation), as well as virtual ethics and deontology. If you are tempted to drop one or more of these in favor of a more \"advanced\" or \"rational\" decision theory, such as UDT, you have to figure out how to transfer the values embodied in the old decision theory, which may not even be represented as any kind of utility function, over to the new.</p>\n<p>Another instance of this problem can be seen in someone just wanting to be a bit more consequentialist. Maybe UDT is too strange and impractical, but our native model-based consequentialism at least seems closer to being rational than the other decision procedures we have. In this case we tend to assume that the consequentialist module already has our real values and we don't need to \"port\" values from the other decision procedures that we're deprecating. But I'm not entirely sure this is safe, since the step going from (for example) identity-based decision making to heuristical model-based consequentialism doesn't seem <em>that</em> different from the step between heuristical model-based consequentialism and something like UDT.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I&#x27;m trying to come up with a set of questions for self-calibration, related to AI and ML.</p><p>I&#x27;ve written down what I&#x27;ve come up with so far below.  But I am principally interested in what other people come up with -- thus the question metatype -- both for questions, and for predictions for the questions.</p><p>So far I have an insufficient number of questions to produce anything like a nice calibration curve.  I&#x27;ve also struggled with coming up with meaningful questions.</p><p>I&#x27;ve rot13&#x27;ed my predictions to avoid anchoring anyone.  I&#x27;m pretty uncertain about most of these as point estimates however.</p><h3>On Explicitly Stated ML / Systems Goals</h3><p>It is (relatively) easy to determine if these are fulfilled or not.  The trade-off is that they likely have little relation to AGI.</p><p>1. OpenAI succeeds in defeating top pro teams on unrestricted Dota2</p><p>OpenAI has explicitly <a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/the-international-2018-results/ that they wish to beat top human teams through \">said</a> that they wish to beat top human teams in the MOBA Dota2.  Their latest attempt to do so used self-play and familiar policy-gradient strategies on an incredibly massive scale to train, but still lost to top teams who won (relatively?) easily.</p><p>I&#x27;m also interested in people&#x27;s probabilities on whether OpenAI succeeds, conditional on OpenAI not including genuine algorithmic novelty in their learning methods, although that&#x27;s a harder question to define because of cloudiness around &quot;algorithmic novelty.&quot;</p><p>My prediction: Friragl-svir creprag.</p><p>2. Tesla succeeds in a self-driving car driving coast-to-coast without intervention.</p><p>Tesla sells cars with (ostensibly) all the hardware necessary for full self-driving, and an in-house self-driving research program that uses a mix of ML and hard-coded rules.  They have a <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-autonomous-coast-to-coast-self-driving-trip/\">goal</a> of giving a demonstration autonomous coast-to-coast drive, although this goal has been repeatedly delayed.  There is widespread skepticism both of the sensor suite in Tesla cars and of the maturity of their software.</p><p>My prediction: Gra creprag.</p><p>3. DeepMind reveals a skilled RL-trained agent for StarCraft II.</p><p>After AlphaGo, DeepMind announced that they would try to create an expert-level agent for SCII.  They&#x27;ve released preliminary <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01830.pdf\">research</a>  related to this topic, although what they&#x27;ve revealed is far from such an agent.</p><p>My prediction: Nobhg svir creprag.</p><h3>On Goals Not So Clearly Marked As Targets</h3><p>1. Someone gets a score on the Winograd Schema tests above 80%.</p><p>The Winograd Schemas are a series of tests designed to test the common-sense reasoning properties of a system.  Modern ML struggles to get better than random chance -- a 50% is approximately equal to random guessing, and modern <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02847.pdf\">state of the art</a> gets less than 70%.  (This is the best score I could find; there are several papers which claim better scores, but these deal with subsets of the Winograd Schemas as far as I can tell.  [I.e., the classic &quot;Hey, we got a better score... on a more constrained dataset.&quot;]  I might be wrong about this, if I&#x27;m wrong please illuminate me.)</p><p>My prediction: Nobhg svir creprag.</p><p>2. Reinforcement Learning Starts Working</p><p>This is a bad, unclear goal.  I&#x27;m not sure how to make it clearer and could use help.</p><p>There are a lot of articles about how <a href=\"https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html\">reinforcement learning</a> doesn&#x27;t work.  It generalizes incredibly poorly, and only succeeds on complex tasks like Dota2 by playing literal centuries worth of games.  If some algorithm were discovered, such that one could get RL to work with kind of the same regularity that supervised learning works, that would be amazing.  I&#x27;m still struggling with a way to rigorously note this.  A 10x improvement in sample efficiency on the Atari suite would (probably?) fulfill this, but I&#x27;m not sure what else would.  And it&#x27;s quite a PITA to keep track of what the current state-of-the-art on Atari is anyhow.</p><p>My prediction: Need to get this more defined.</p><p></p>",

Hoping for an answer that elucidates that core more clearly.</em> </p><p>It is something of a rationalist folk theorem that social movements face the risk of an &quot;Eternal September&quot;, or of scaling into oblivion. (See e.g. <a href=\"http://leverageresearch.org/blog/ea-failure-scenarios\">this blog post by Leverage research</a>, <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MovementGrowth.pdf\">this paper by Owen Cotton-Barratt</a>, <a href=\"https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths\">David Chapman</a> or <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/construction-beacons/\">Benjamin Hoffman</a> on &quot;Geeks, MOPs and sociopaths&quot;, and Scott Alexander on <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/\">&quot;the toxoplasma of rage&quot;</a>). </p><p>I&#x27;ve had the sense that some cocktail of Hansonian/Dunbarian evolutionary psychology, basic game theory/microeconomics, memetic theory and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law\">Sturgeon&#x27;s law</a>, should predict this. That is, that some reasonably operationalised version of the claim &quot;most social movements fail&quot; is true.</p><p>Yet I am not able to point to &gt;=5 historical examples of social movements that suffered this fate, along with some gears for what went wrong. </p><p>Hence I&#x27;m looking for links, historical examples, more fleshed-out gears, ... anything that might form a more rigorous reference point for <em>an outside view on the fate of social movements</em>.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Together with <a href=\"http://annewissemann.com/\">Anne Wissemann</a>  we are going to do a 2-day weekend workshop on applied rationality in  Cologne, Germany. If you cannot apply since you have already scheduled  something important, feel free to <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/QYiU2womvVVaggaE3\">leave your email</a> to be informed about future workshops in the Cologne area.</p><h2>Summary</h2><ul><li>Date: 19. &amp; 20.01.2019, 9am - 6pm</li><li>Application-form:<a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/DLfsznUTbWzoIJV12\"> https://goo.gl/forms/DLfsznUTbWzoIJV12</a> (Deadline: Friday, 11.01.2018, confirmations will be send on Saturday)</li><li>Location: somewhere in Cologne... to be announced :)</li><li>Costs: 40-60€</li><li>Topic: CFAR-techniques and other useful rationality-concepts</li><li>Limited to 20 attendees</li><li>Target Group: Aspiring EAs &amp; Rationalists</li><li>Housing available on request</li></ul><h2>Aims</h2><p>We - the EA Köln/Cologne group - want to contribute to the positive development of the EA &amp; Rationality community. </p><p>Over  the past year we organized weekly Meetups including Socials, Book-Clubs  as well as talks with discussion rounds. Recently we decided to make  weekend seminars and workshops a priority since they seem to have  multiple benefits:</p><ul><li>real deep-diving into topics compared to evening events</li><li>&#x27;Unite&#x27; the EA &amp; LessWrong communities addressing mutual interests</li><li>socialize with great people</li><li>filter for (really interested) newcomers</li><li>Due  to weekend time frame: invite great speakers and people from other  cities (who would not take the effort traveling for an evening only) </li></ul><h2>Overview</h2><p><a href=\"http://annewissemann.com/\">Anne</a>  works as a coach for members of the rationality and effective altruism  communities. In addition to her own CFAR workshop, she has volunteered  as a mentor at 5 other mainline workshops since 2014, has undergone and  taught at CFAR&#x27;s mentorship training, as well as helped develop her  local <a href=\"http://lesswrong.de/\">weekly Rationality Dojo in Berlin</a>. She plans to teach the participants:</p><p>- Double Crux<br/>- Focusing<br/>- Internal Double Crux <br/>- Trigger-Action Plans (TAP) <br/>  - Flash classes/concepts: Mindfulness, Negative Visualisation,  Decreasing Marginal Returns, helpful Debugging prompts, Frogs, How to  notice things, experimental mindset, and more!<br/>- Hamming Circles = Debugging on what&#x27;s most important <br/>- Goal Factoring </p><p>For a more detailed description see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Mc0W2i1-_Av6niVVUoEURhUE8I9h7H4tXcuWR-g1I0/edit#heading=h.gl5phvapdufu\">this document</a>. </p><p>Lunch, snacks and drinks are included. If you need housing, please take the steps indicated in the application form.</p><h2>Past events</h2><p>In mid November we had our first weekend workshop with <a href=\"https://stijnbruers.wordpress.com/\">Stijn Bruers</a>  about &#x27;Rational Ethics&#x27;. We had participants from all parts of Germany  including experienced EAs as well as some newcomers. 13/15 participants  (no feedback from 2 participants) rated the seminar on a scale from -3  to +3. All indicated this event to be better then an average workshop  (=0) and the mean score was 1.5.</p><p>Participants who answered the  feedback form moreover indicated to be exceptionally interested in  &#x27;Rationality skills&#x27; and &#x27;Mental well-being&#x27;.</p><h2>Notes on finances</h2><p>We  were granted some financial support by CEA to start our workshop-series  in  November 2018. Since the workshops ought to be self supporting we  charge low ticket prices to fund travel costs &amp; adequat  compensation for our speakers as well as lunch, snacks and drinks. In  case we should make any profit it will solely be used to fund future  workshops, allow discounts and the like. </p><p>During our last workshop  ticket prices were not sufficient to pay for all the expenses. Thus we  had to adjust the ticket price. Nevertheless discounts are available if  needed.</p><p><strong>Edit: </strong>typos</p><p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Remove a link</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>TL/DR; The invention of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network\">Convolution Neural Networks</a> for image and audio processing was a key landmark in machine learning.  </p><p>This topic is for people who already know what CNNs are, and are interested in how to innovate to riff on and extend the core reason (perhaps?) that CNNs learn faster.  Probing the technology topic is one &#x27;sub goal&#x27; in questioning where our AI knowledge is heading, and how fast.  In turn, that&#x27;s because we want it to progress in a good direction.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><h1>Sub Goal</h1><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can the reduction in number of parameters that a CNN introduces be achieved in a more general way?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.  Here are sketches of two ways:</p><p>1) <strong>Saccades.</strong>  Train one network (layer) on attention.  Train it to learn which local blocks of the image to give attention to.  Train the second part of the network using  those chosen &#x27;local blocks&#x27; in conjunction with coordinates of their locations.  </p><p>The number of blocks that have large CNN kernels applied to them is much reduced.  Those blocks are the blocks that matter.</p><p>2)<strong> Parameter Compression</strong>.  Give each layer of a neural network more (potential) connections than you think will actually end up being used.  After training for a few cycles, compress the parameter values using a lossy algorithm, always choosing the  compression which scores best on some weighting of size and quality. Uncompress and repeat this process till you have completed the training set.  </p><p>The number of bits used to represent parameters is being kept low, helping to guard against over fitting.</p><h1>Dialog</h1><p>[Doubter] This all sounds very hand wavy.  How exactly would you train a saccadic network on the right movements?  </p><p>[Optimist] One stepping stone, before you get to a true saccadic network with the locus of attention following a temporal trajectory, is to train a shallow network to classify where to give attention.  So this stepping stone outputs a weighting for how much attention to give to each location.  For sake of being more concrete, it works on a down sampled image and gives 0 for no attention, 1 for convolution with a 3x3 kernel, 2 for convolution with a 5x5 kernel.  </p><p>[Doubter] You still haven&#x27;t said how you would do that attention training.</p><p>[Optimist] You could reward a network for robustness to corruption of the image.  Reward it for zeroes in the attention layers. </p><p>[Doubter] That&#x27;s not clear, and I think there is a Catch 22.  You need to have analysed the image to decide where to give it attention.</p><p>[Optimist] ...but not analyse in full detail.  Use only a few down sampled layers to decide where to give attention.  You save a ton of CPU by only giving more attention where it is needed.</p><p>[Doubter] I really doubt that.  You will pay for that saving many times over by the less regular pattern of &#x27;attention&#x27; and the more complex code.  It will be really hard to use a GPU to accelerate it as well as is already done with a standard CNNs.  Besides, even a 16x reduction in total workload, and I actually doubt there would be any reduction in workload at all, is not that significant.  What actually matters is the quality of the end result.</p><p>[Optimist] We shouldn&#x27;t be worrying about that GPU.  That&#x27;s &#x27;premature optimisation&#x27;.  You&#x27;re artificially constraining your thinking by the hardware we use right now.</p><p>[Doubter] Nevertheless, GPU is the hardware we have right now, and we want practical systems.  An alternative to CNNs using hybrid CPU/GPU at least has to come close on speed to current CNNs on GPU, and have some other key advantage.</p><p>[Optimist] Explainability in a saccadic CNN is better, since you have the explicit weightings for attention.  For any output, you can show where the attention is.</p><p>[Doubter] But that is not new.  We can already show where attention is by looking at what weights mattered in a classification.  See for example the way we learned that &#x27;hands&#x27; were important in detecting dumbbell weights, or that snow was important in differentiating wolves from dogs.</p><p>[Optimist] Right.  And those insights in how CNNs classify were really valuable landmarks, weren&#x27;t they?  And now we would have something more direct to do that, as we can go straight to the attention weights.  And we can explore better strategies for setting those weights.</p><p>[Doubter] You still haven&#x27;t explained exactly how the attention layers would be constructed, nor have you explained the later &#x27;better strategies&#x27; nor how you would progress to temporal attention strategies.  I doubt the basic idea would do more than a slightly deeper CNN would.  Until I see an actual working example, I&#x27;m unconvinced.  Can we move onto &#x27;parameter compression&#x27;? </p><p>[Optimist] Sure.</p><p>-----</p><p>[Doubter] So what I am struggling with is that you are throwing away data after  a little training.  Why &#x27;lossy compression&#x27; and not &#x27;lossless compression&#x27;?</p><p>[Optimist] That&#x27;s part of the point of it.  We&#x27;re trying to reward a low bit count description of the weights. </p><p>[Doubter] Hold on a moment.  You&#x27;re talking more like a proponent of evolutionary algorithms than of neural networks.  You can&#x27;t &#x27;back propagate&#x27; a reward for a low entropy solution back up the net.  All you can do is choose one such parameter set over another.</p><p>[Optimist] Exactly.  Neural networks are in fact just a particular rather constrained case of evolutionary algorithm.  I&#x27;d contend there is advantage in exploring new ways of reducing the degrees of freedom in them.  CNNs do reduce the degrees of freedom, but not in a very general way.  We need to add something like compression of parameters if we want low degrees of freedom with more generality.</p><p>[Doubter] In CNNs that lack of generality is an advantage.  Your approach could encode a network with a ridiculously large number of useless non-zero weights - whilst still using very few bits.  That won&#x27;t work.  That would take way longer to compute one iteration.  It would be as slow as pitch drops dripping.</p><p>[Optimist] Right.  So some attention must be paid to exactly what the lossy compression algorithm is.  Just as jpeg throws away low weight vectors, this compression algorithm could too.</p><p>[Doubter] So I have a couple of comments here.  You have not worked out the details, right?  It also doesn&#x27;t sound like this is bio-inspired, which was at least a saving grace of the saccadic idea.  </p><p>[Optimistic] Well, the compression idea wasn&#x27;t bio-inspired originally, but later I got to thinking about how genes could create many &#x27;similar patterns&#x27; of connections locally.  That could do CNN type connections, but genes can also do similar patterns with long range connections.  So for example, genes could learn the ideal density of long range connections relative to short range connections.  That connection plan gets repeated in many places whilst being encoded compactly.  In that sense genes are a compression code.</p><p>[Doubter] So you are mixing genetic algorithms and neural networks?  That sounds like a recipe for more parameters.</p><p>[Optimistic] ...a recipe for new ways of reducing the number of parameters.</p><p>[Doubter] I think I see a pattern here, in that both ideas offer CNNs as a special case.  With saccadic networks the secret sauce is some not too clear way you would program the &#x27;attention&#x27; function.  With  parameter compression your secret sauce is the choice of lossy compression function.  If you &#x27;got funded&#x27; to do some demo coding, you could keep naive investors happy for a long while with networks that were actually no better than existing CNNs and plenty of promises of more to come with more funding.   But the &#x27;more to come later&#x27; never would come. Your deep problem is the &#x27;secret sauce&#x27; is more aspiration than actually demonstrable.</p><p>[Optimist] I think that&#x27;s a little unfair.  I am not claiming these approaches are implemented demonstrable improvements.  I am not claiming that I know exactly how to get the details of these two ideas right quickly.  You are also losing sight of the overall goal, which is to <strong>progress the value of AI as a positive transformative force</strong>.</p><p>[Doubter] Hmm.  I see only a not-too-convincing claim of being able to increase the power of machine learning <em>and an attempt to burnish your ego and your reputation</em>.  <strong>Where is the focus on positive transformative force?</strong></p><p>[Optimist] Breaking the mould on how to think about machine learning is a pretty important subgoal in progressing thought on AI, don&#x27;t you think?  &quot;Less Wrong&quot; is the best possible place on the internet for engaging in discussion of ethical progression of AI.  If this  &#x27;subgoal&#x27; post does not gather any useful feedback at all, then I&#x27;ll have to agree with you that my post is not helping progress the possible positive transformative aspects of AI - and try again with another iteration and different post, until I find what works.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Reading the <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2018/11/22/2018-update-our-new-research-directions/#identifier_5_18363\">New Research Directions</a> update from MIRI, I was struck by the description of deconfusion:</p><blockquote>By deconfusion, I mean something like “making it so that you can think  about a given topic without continuously accidentally spouting  nonsense.”</blockquote><p>I find this concept deeply impressive. I have also lately been considering the problem of strategy or lack thereof, so the idea popped up almost immediately: strategy is deconfusion in the action domain.</p><p>I&#x27;m going to draw on three sources for this post: the first is the aforementioned New Research Directions post from MIRI; the second is a paper from Parameters 46 Winter issue by Jeffrey W. Meiser, &quot;<a href=\"https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/parameters/issues/Winter_2016-17/10_Meiser.pdf\">Are Our Strategic Models Flawed? Ends+Ways+Means = (Bad) Strategy</a>&quot;; the third is an article from November 2012 in The Atlantic by Thomas E. Ricks, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/11/general-failure/309148/\">General Failure</a>.&quot; I recommend them all individually, but I won&#x27;t assume you have read them.</p><p>Returning to the concept of deconfusion, it is easy to change the quoted section only a little to capture what I mean:</p><blockquote>By strategy, I mean something like &quot;making it so that you can act towards a given end-state without continuously accidentally wasting effort.&quot;</blockquote><p>I think this is an important connection to draw. There is a <em>lot</em> of information available on strategy: each military philosopher of note supports an entire corpus of commentary, and likewise for every conqueror; every war has lots of official and academic analysis done on its results; there is an absurd profusion of filtering the military and historical information through the lens of self-help or business-speak. It has all <em>very consistently</em> failed to guide the development and execution of good strategies, and I think deconfusion does a good job of pointing to why.</p><p><strong>Failure to Notice Confusion and the Lykke Model</strong></p><p>Meiser&#x27;s paper is about the current norms in the US military and the Army in particular. The focus of the paper is the Lykke model and the ways in which it encourages bad strategy. It consists of the following:</p><blockquote>“Strategy equals ends (objectives toward which one strives) plus ways (courses of action) plus means (instruments by which some end can be achieved).”</blockquote><p>The problem in practice, Meiser argues, is that strategy development is dominated by means-based planning. This is because the theory is from 1989, developed in reaction to the failures of the Vietnam War; the thinking went that if resource constraints were better taken into account, we could prevent &quot;unrealistic strategies.&quot; Ends are treated as given and what people mostly do with planning is look at the means table, match them against the ends table, and then call it a day. The problem with the model is that it promotes a kind of plug-and-chug approach.</p><p>Meiser uses General Stanley McChrystal&#x27;s plan for Afghanistan after he took command of that theater as an example:</p><blockquote>What emerges from journalistic accounts of the 2009 Obama administration strategy-making process is the observation that the entire discussion by civilian officials and military officers was about the number of troops, not strategy.</blockquote><blockquote>. . . </blockquote><blockquote>After repeated presidential requests for at least three distinct options, all Obama ever got was slight variations of the original ones. All options were based on the amount of resources being thrown at the problem.</blockquote><p>The debate was actually moot. No one knew how to really use those resources, and the military did not notice their confusion about the problem. Of course, this is not the only shortfall. </p><p><strong>Assuming Confusion Away</strong></p><p>Returning to the MIRI post, this is given as an example of confused thinking about AI risk:</p><blockquote>People who are serious thinkers about the topic today, including my colleagues Eliezer and Anna, said things that today sound confused. (When I say “things that sound confused,” I have in mind things like “isn’t intelligence an <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/general_intelligence/\">incoherent</a> concept,” “but the economy’s <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/27/things-that-are-not-superintelligences/\">already</a> superintelligent,” “if a superhuman AI is smart enough that it could kill us, it’ll also be <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/orthogonality/\">smart enough</a> to see that that isn’t what the good thing to do is, so we’ll be fine,” “we’re Turing-complete, so it’s impossible to have something dangerously <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2017/12/06/chollet/\">smarter</a> than us, because Turing-complete computations can emulate anything,” and “anyhow, we could just <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2018/02/28/sam-harris-and-eliezer-yudkowsky/#3\">unplug</a> it.”) </blockquote><p>From the Atlantic article, quoting a slide from a classified briefing:</p><blockquote>“What to Expect After Regime Change”:</blockquote><blockquote>Most tribesmen, including Sunni loyalists, will realize that their lives will be better once Saddam is gone for good. Reporting indicates a growing sense of fatalism, and accepting their fate, among Sunnis. There may be a small group of die hard supporters that [are] willing to rally in the regime’s heartland near Tikrit—but they won’t last long without support.</blockquote><p>Comparing these two is only marginally appropriate; the first quote is from (at the time) amateurs who were deeply engaged with the problem they were thinking about, whereas the latter is from nominal experts who were negligently hand-waving the problem away. I say that both suggest confusion about how to consider the problems at hand. I go further and say that the latter is a more pernicious sort of confusion, because they assumed there never was any from the beginning.</p><p>Also from Ricks, regarding General Tommy Franks at the beginning of the Iraq War:</p><blockquote>In many ways, Franks is the representative general of the post-9/11 era. He concerned himself principally with tactical matters, refusing to think seriously about what would happen after his forces attacked. “I knew the President and Don Rumsfeld would back me up,” he wrote in his memoir, “so I felt free to pass the message along to the bureaucracy beneath them: <em>You pay attention to the day</em> after <em>and I’ll pay attention to the day</em> of.” Franks fundamentally misunderstood generalship, which at its topmost levels must link military action to political results.</blockquote><p>This did not improve as the war went on:</p><blockquote>Not long after the Anaconda battle, Franks spoke at the Naval War College, in Newport, Rhode Island. A student heard his talk and then posed the most basic but most important sort of question: What is the nature of the war you are fighting in Afghanistan? “That’s a great question for historians,” Franks said. He then went on to discuss how U.S. troops cleared cave complexes.</blockquote><p>Nor was it a problem unique to Franks. Regarding his successor, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez:</p><blockquote>Sanchez inherited no real war strategy from Franks or the Bush administration, and he did nothing to remedy that deficit. This lack of any coherent strategy manifested itself in the radically different approaches taken by different Army divisions in the war. Observers moving from one part of Iraq to another were often struck by the extent to which each division was fighting its own war, with its own assessment of the threat, its own solutions, and its own rules of engagement. </blockquote><p>Eventually on the third try someone noticed that they were confused about what the Army was doing, in the person of General George Casey:</p><blockquote>He knew the Army needed to start operating differently in Iraq. He developed a formal campaign plan, something Sanchez had never done. More significant, he asked two counterinsurgency experts, Colonel Bill Hix and retired Lieutenant Colonel Kalev Sepp, to review the actions of individual units and make suggestions. Sepp, a Special Forces veteran of El Salvador with a doctorate from Harvard, reviewed the commander of every battalion, regiment, and brigade in Iraq and concluded that 20 percent of them understood how to properly conduct counterinsurgency operations, 60 percent were struggling to do so, and 20 percent were not interested in changing and were fighting conventionally, “oblivious to the inefficacy and counterproductivity of their operations.” In other words, a vast majority of U.S. units were not operating effectively.</blockquote><p>But he, too, took the ends as both given and uncomplicated. While Baghdad was in the throes of civil war:</p><blockquote>Casey’s lack of awareness began to undercut his support at the top of the Bush administration. On August 17, 2006, during a video briefing to top national-security officials, he said he wanted to stick with his plan to turn Baghdad over to Iraqi security forces by the end of the year. Vice President Dick Cheney, watching from Wyoming, was troubled by that comment. “I respected General Casey, but I couldn’t see a basis for his optimism,” he wrote later.</blockquote><p>From the beginning of the conflicts in both Afghanistan and Iraq, the possibility of being confused about the goals was not seriously considered, because the military assumed the problem away.</p><p><strong>Theory of Success and Re-enter Deconfusion</strong></p><p>Current strategy norms don&#x27;t admit the idea of confusion, which is a problem. In Meiser&#x27;s paper he offers a different definition of strategy which he hopes will promote &quot;creative and critical thinking,&quot; which I have taken the liberty of interpreting as addressing the confusion problem. Pleasingly he moves into terms and concepts we are familiar with (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote>The two definitions that come closest to articulating a distinctive meaning for strategy are offered by Barry Posen and Eliot Cohen. Posen defines grand strategy as “a state’s theory about how it can best ‘cause’ security for itself.” Cohen defines strategy as a “theory of victory.” The key insight by Posen and Cohen is the inclusion of the term theory. If we define theories as “statements predicting which actions will lead to what results—and why,” we can move toward a better definition of strategy that is general, but not too inclusive, and captures the essence of the concept.</blockquote><blockquote>If we use the Posen-Cohen approach with a more general definition of purpose, we arrive at a sufficient working definition: strategy is a theory of success. This creates the expectation that <strong>anything called a strategy will be a causal explanation of how a given action or set of actions will cause success</strong>. Most strategies will include multiple intervening variables and conditions. Defining strategy as a theory of success encourages creative thinking while keeping the strategist rooted in the process of causal analysis; it brings assumptions to light and forces strategists to clarify exactly how they plan to cause the desired end state to occur.</blockquote><p>This puts strategy on the same type of conceptual ground that motivated deconfusion in the first place; it is the primary reason I see deconfusion being so valuable. A secondary reason I see deconfusion as being valuable is shifting from the current paradigm. Currently formal strategic methods don&#x27;t account for confusion, and lazy or negligent approaches to those methods can make it impossible to resolve. Viewing deconfusion as fundamental means that my assumption is that <em>I am confused.</em></p>",

See <u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898\">The Lean Startup</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-mvp-is-dead-long-live-the-rat-233d5d16ab02\">Riskiest Assumption Testing</a></u> for other resources.</em></p><p>Suppose you are Bob Steele, structural engineer extraordinaire, and you’ve recently completed your doctorate thesis in advanced bridge aerodynamics. You see how a new generation of bridge technology could significantly improve human welfare. Bridges are not as direct as bed nets or cash transfers, but improved transport infrastructure in developing regions boosts economic productivity flowing through to healthcare, education, and other life-improving services. There’s no time to waste. You found Bridgr.io, put the hard in hardware startup, and get to work bringing your revolutionary technologies to the world.</p><p>Common advice is that startups should have a few core metrics which capture their goals, help them track their progress, and ensure they stay focused. For Bridgr.io that reasonably might be revenue, clients, and number of bridges built. There is a danger in this, however.</p><p>Although Bridgr.io’s ultimate goal is to have built bridges in the right place, the most pressing tasks are not construction tasks. They’re research tasks. Refining the designs and construction process. Until Bridgr.io hits on a design which works and can be scaled, there is no point sourcing steel and construction workers for a thousand bridges. The first step should be building a sufficient number of test and prototype-bridges (or simulations) not with goal that these bridges will transport anyone, just with the goal of <em>learning</em>.</p><p><em>Phase 1: Figure what to do and how to do it.</em></p><p><em>Phase 2: Do it.</em></p><p>It’s true that if Bridgr.io tries to build as many bridges as possible as quickly as possible that they will learn along the way what works and what doesn’t, that R&amp;D will automatically happen. But I claim that this kind of learning that happens as a product of trying to <em>do</em> the thing (prematurely) is often inefficient, ineffective, and possibly lethal to your venture.</p><p>Superficially, building bridges <em>to have bridges</em> and building bridges <em>to figure out which bridges to build </em>both involve building bridges. Yet in the details they diverge. If you’re trying to <em>do the thing</em>, you often spend your time trying to mobilize enough resources for the all-out effort. You throw everything you’ve got at it, because that’s what it would take to build a thousand bridges all over the globe. Acting <em>to learn</em> is different. Rather than scale, it’s about taking carefully-selected, targeted actions to reduce uncertainty. You don’t seek a contract for fifty bridges, instead you focus on building three crazy different designs to help you test your assumptions.</p><p>Among other things, value of information can decline rapidly with scale. If you can build five bridges, as far as the fundamentals go, you can build fifty. And scaling your current process doesn’t necessarily test the uncertainty which matters. Perhaps building fifty bridges in the United States doesn’t test the viability of building them in Central Africa. If you were building to learn, you’d build a couple here and a couple there.</p><p>The mistake I see, and the motivation for this post, is many people skipping over the <em>learning </em>phase, or trying to smush it into the actual doing. They seek to maximize their metrics now rather than first investing figuring out what is they really should be doing. What will work at all. The mistake is always operating with a d<em>oing-intention</em> when really a l<em>earning-intention</em> is needed first.</p><h2>Doing-Intention</h2><p><em>You’re building a bridge because you want a bridge. You want a physical outcome in the world. You’re doing the actual thing.</em></p><h2>Learning-Intention</h2><p><em>You’re building a bridge because you’re trying to understand bridges better. It’s true that ultimately you want an actual physical bridge, but this bridge isn’t for that. This bridge is just about gaining information about what doesn&#x27;t fall down.</em></p><p></p><h2>In the context of Effective Altruism</h2><p>I have some concern that this error is common among those doing directly altruistic work. If, like Bob Steele, you believe that your intervention could be helping people right now, then it’s tempting to want to ramp up production and just <em>do the good thing</em>. Every delay might result in the loss of lives. When the work is very real, it’s hard to step back and treat it like an abstract information problem. (Possibly the pressures are no weaker in the startup world, but that realm might benefit from stronger cultural wisdom exhorting people not scale before they have “product-market fit.&quot;)</p><p></p><h2>Possible causes of this error-mode</h2><p>Why do people make this class of mistake? A few guesses:</p><ul><li>The pressure to present results now. Donors, funders, and employees especially want to see something for time and money invested.</li><li>The dislike of uncertainty. It’s more comfortable to decide to fully run with plausibly good Plan A, whose likelihoods of success you can trump up, than stay in limbo while you test Plans A, B, and C.</li><li>The underestimation of how much uncertainty remains even after early evidence suggests a plan or direction might be a good idea. As an example, a company I once worked for spent over a year pursuing a misguided strategy because using it they landed one large deal with what turned out to be an atypical client. </li><li>Although people have the notion of an experimental mindset and value of information, there’s a failure to adopt an experimental/research mindset if certainty is above a certain level. People think of conducting experiments when they don&#x27;t know whether something will work at all, but not when the overall picture looks promising and what remains is implementation details. For instance, if I have a program to distribute bed nets, I might have 75% credence this will do a lot of good, even if I’m uncertain about just how much good, what my opportunity costs are, and the true best way to implement. At the point of 75% confidence (or much less), I might stop thinking my program as experimental and fall into a maximizing, doing-intention. Show everyone them big results.</li><ul><li>This is lethal if your goals are extremely long-term with minimal feedback, e.g. long-termist effective altruists. There will be many plausibly good things to do, but if you scale up prematurely by turning your experiments into all-out interventions, then you might either miss far greater opportunities or fail to implement your intervention in a way that works at all on the long-term scale.</li><li>Community-feedback can also push in the wrong direction. People looking in from the outside into an EA project will approve of efforts to do good backed by a decent plausibility story for effectiveness. After that, scale and certainty are probably perceived as more impressive than an array of small-scale experiments and a list of uncertainties.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h2>Final caveat: the perils of Learning-Intention</h2><p>As much as I&#x27;m advocating for them here, there are of course a great many perils associated with <em>learning-intentions </em>too. Learning can <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Lost-Purposes\">easily become divorced from real-world goals</a> and picking the right actions to learn the information you actually need is no small challenge. Faced between a choice between degenerate doing-intention and degenerate learning-intention, I think I would pick the former given is more likely to have empiricism on its side. </p><p></p>",

Card Rebalancing and Gameplay Benefits</h3>\n<p>Let us presume we’ve gotten economics out of the way. We’ve chosen a model compatible with limited ownership of cards and/or paid the price for not doing so. Most players will have access to whatever level of cards they usually have access to, and at least don’t mind the changes to their cards.</p>\n<p>What are the effects on game play? What are the good and bad scenarios?</p>\n<p>I’ll lay out the good scenarios and features, and offer eight good reasons to rebalance your cards.</p>\n<p>Next time, I’ll lay out the bad scenarios and features, and why it all might be a terrible mistake.</p>\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Changing cards keeps the game fresh and new.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After the most recent set has been released for a while, it is easy for card games to become stale and repetitive. Players know the best decks and strategies, and the same patterns happen repeatedly. Changing a few key cards even in subtle ways can shake that up, as there are often lots of subtle factors determining how decks look and play.</p>\n<p>Consider Axe moving from seven power to six power, and from eleven to ten health. This dramatically improved the value of heroes with seven health, which among means Zeus, Ogre Magi, Drow Ranger (although she was nerfed at the same time) and Bounty Hunter. Blue became much stronger, and black decks have reason to pick Bounty Hunter, which is also now a lock to kill Axe by default on the second turn, even if you lose both coin flips. There are also now a lot more scenarios where heroes are left at one health, which also helps Ogre Magi and Zeus, making blue that much more appealing. This isn’t only about Axe doing six on turn one, it is also about him being much worse with Duel and his companion card Berserker’s Rage. It also makes him want a weapon that much more to get back to where he needs to be, making Short Sword, Jasper Daggers and Demagicking Maul more attractive.</p>\n<p>Drow Ranger’s change is also transformative. Decks no longer have to worry that green can knock out an entire lane if given initiative, so long as they can put two heroes in non-adjacent locations. This in turn makes it horribly difficult for green to go wide or commit to deep board presence in a lane for fear of Annihilation and other removal. Drow Ranger lost so much power that some green player no longer even use her, making the threat that much more remote. Without a good answer to blue’s mass removal, green can’t pursue its best game plans there, and this has effectively mostly taken green out of play.</p>\n<p>As a permanent state of affairs that is very bad. But it need not last long. There can and should always be more changes. Green can be easily brought back to life by strengthening some other green cards in ways that help deal with its issues, or are just generically good enough to make up for them. Blue can in turn be brought down if necessary.</p>\n<p>This last week there have been tons of subtle new things to explore as players moved on to new decks and new combinations. There is no reason that can’t happen with many or most similar changes. Subtle is good enough if you choose good targets. Fresh and new is pretty great.</p>\n<p>Fresh and new <em>every two weeks </em>would be super awesome.</p>\n<p>2. We can give players less of what they dislike and more of what they like.</p>\n<p>People hate, hate, hate Cheating Death. They have a religious hatred of the very concept. They see it as capricious, random, dangerously unequal and unfair and a source of inequality, and feel that if you can’t save everyone, then all should suffer and die the same way. They see it being expensive as a scandal, and it being cheap as another different scandal. They rail about its terrible impact on the environment. They fail to see how important it is and how much is lost when it is given up.</p>\n<p>They also similarly disliked a green card in Artifact that involves coin flips.</p>\n<p>I didn’t at first disagree with them on the card. At the end of my first test session, they asked what card we disliked the most. I said Cheating Death (my favorite card was Enough Magic!). Several others agreed. Making the card worse helped a little, but it remained deeply reviled.</p>\n<p>Over time, I saw why Cheating Death exists, that decks needed to be built and played with the card in mind, and why the game benefits from having something fill that role, which the new version is not strong enough to do. But in the end, it does not matter. Players hate the card, and we should not this frequently give players an experience they hate.</p>\n<p>It is a huge advantage to be able to notice that something is despised by players, and be able to change it into something else that is not despised in this way.</p>\n<p>The mirror of this is to find cards that are fun and popular, but aren’t good enough, and make them good enough. See what happens. If what happens is fun and healthy, keep it. If not, undo the changes, or try a third thing.</p>\n<p>The alternative is to require a much longer turnaround time to make this happen, as new cards are printed. It also means printing a new copy of a card similar but superior to another older card, which is not a great place to be. Much better to upgrade Timbersaw now than to print “Timbersaw the Slightly Better” in expansion one, especially if the plan is to do so incrementally.</p>\n<p>3. We can take bigger, bolder, better chances. We can avoid missing opportunities.</p>\n<p>Playtesting new ideas and breaking cards in half is <em>fun. </em>Don’t hog that fun! Let the players enjoy it too. Nerf no card before its time.</p>\n<p>Certain classes of Magic: The Gathering cards are known to be dangerous. They entail some probability that the card and related strategies will get out of hand. Cards with alternate casting costs fall into this category. Alternate win conditions that are interesting count. Anything with the potential to lock your opponent out. Any full combo kill. Massive card drawing on the cheap. Paying life for powerful effects. Effects that shut creatures out entirely. And so on.</p>\n<p>Cards that are generically good count too, if pushed far enough.</p>\n<p>For a game like Artifact, where the game is poorly understood and wide open, any new type of card that’s priced to be good is going to be dangerous.</p>\n<p>All of these cards lead to new deck designs, new problems and interesting games when they first appear. That week when everything is fresh and new is great even if things eventually settle on a best deck and a broken build. The next week is usually good, too. A month later, having oppressive things around cuts off the ability to have fun, kills off diversity and drives people away. Magic has had a large number of holding periods where the game was stuck in a non-fun non-diverse equilibrium but nothing could be done about it until the next banned list announcement. Even then it wasn’t clear the price of banning a card was worth paying, since outright bans are terrible. Riding things out to the next set release becomes a live option. Other times, bans don’t do the job as other cards replace what you ban, but now you don’t have another chance for months.</p>\n<p>With continuous card adjustments, the solution is much easier. The card is too good, so make it worse. If that isn’t enough, do it again until it is enough.</p>\n<p>This allows us to run experiments at low cost. When we have a fun new idea, we can put it where we know it is at least interesting and might be too good, intending to scale it back if we overshoot the mark. The less cost we attach to such action, the bolder we can be.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Wizards often introduces new ideas at pitifully weak power levels, or allows weak but fun ideas to languish. Double strike took years to become a constructed ability because Wizards was understandably terrified it would prove too strong, and started it off at a very weak level. Lots of fun concepts get printed at ‘casual-only’ casting costs, then stay there because there’s much less appetite to print essentially the same card over again but cheaper or bigger, or because the mechanic on the card was tied to its expansion, so it is now too late.</p>\n<p>With continuous and frequent card changes, we can introduce new concepts at high power level, fully intending to frequently pull them back after seeing what they can do. Other times, we can notice that players love a card or idea but it isn’t good enough, so we can give it a large boost to make it good, perhaps even too good, then pull it back if we overshoot.</p>\n<p>4. Mistakes cost much less.</p>\n<p>This is similar to and related to the above, but importantly different.</p>\n<p>Sometimes games take a calculated risk. There is a new strategy to be enabled, a new mechanic to introduce at the constructed level. Occasionally, one will make it better than intended, or the answers or competition are worse than intended, or things otherwise end up unbalanced.</p>\n<p>Other times, mistakes were made. Things get missed.</p>\n<p>Two examples of famous Magic mistakes: <a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416756\">Umezawa’s Jitte</a> was created at the last minute and no one realized how straight up bonkers it was. No one at Wizards noticed the combination of <a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417759\">Saheeli Rai</a> and <a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=423686\">Felidar Guardian</a> ended the game on the spot for a combined seven mana.</p>\n<p>You also have cards like <a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1547\">Sylvan Library</a>. Green got the ability to look at and draw extra cards in exchange for paying life, <em>which made absolutely zero sense, </em>at a very high power level. To this day in older formats, <em>people splash green in order to pay life to draw cards. </em>That’s kind of insane, and an example worth talking about later in more detail.</p>\n<p>These mistakes are great things, <em>if you can then fix them.</em></p>\n<p>One effect of this is terror at making good cards late in the process, which is more about III. This is about, once we do have an oversight, we’d rather not have it ruin the game for a year.</p>\n<p>5. We can make new sets exciting by having temporary power creep without permanent power creep.</p>\n<p>Hearthstone, when I was playing it, made a habit of periodically nerfing cards<em> in</em> <em>the base set </em>to allow more room for new cards to be good.</p>\n<p>Yu-Gi-Oh! kept its new sets exciting by making the numbers in each set bigger than in the last set. Many games embraced pure power creep in similar ways.</p>\n<p>Magic defaults to having slow power creep, despite intentions to keep it in check. Periodically, a set pulls the power level back, such as Mercadian Masques, making a short term sacrifice to restore balance.</p>\n<p>Continuous adjustments offers the opportunity to <em>start out </em>new sets at high power level, allowing new cards to be everywhere and dominate play. Then, once we’ve had our fun, we can start taking those cards down a notch to restore power level to its previous point. If done correctly, this offers the fun lots-of-great-new-toys moments early and drives card sales, and then you end up in the same place you would have anyway.</p>\n<p>There would even be a sense that this new period was a special window to have fun with toys that you wouldn’t get to keep for that long, so take advantage of it while you can. That period of intentional imbalance is one I often look back to as much more fun than other periods, even in other types of games.</p>\n<p>As examples, I would point to the excellent games <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/\">Europa Universalis IV</a> and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3900/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_IV/\">Civilization IV</a>. Both are great. Both <em>were even better </em>back when there were overpowered loopholes and strategies in the wild to find and exploit. Later, these strategies were scaled back, and I became sad about it. Which makes this a double edged sword we’ll return to in the next section.</p>\n<p>6. We can match the flavor to the play.</p>\n<p>Decipher created the Star Trek and Star Wars TCGs. The clear intention was for the best cards and strategies to mimic the stars of the original material. The Enterprise bridge crew and ship itself were massively better than alternatives, sporting six abilities where others would have one to three, in a game without a costing mechanism. Light side decks centered on Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Leia, while dark side decks were always led by Darth Vader. If you didn’t have these rare cards, the game didn’t really work right until several expansions in, and not having them still put you at a severe disadvantage.</p>\n<p>It was a good thing that Jean-Luc Picard was a better card than Random Unknown Ensign, and players got to play with Picard. Cool things are cool, whether that’s flavor, mechanical or otherwise. The massive overkill Decipher used to get there was unfortunate. It was a presumably combination of making sure to hit players over the head with the need to buy such cards and see their reward, and not wanting to take <em>any </em>chances.</p>\n<p>With card tuning, you can ensure that the cards you <em>want </em>to be played, are the cards played. You need not use a giant anvil to do so. You can now either start off with a giant anvil, then scale back once people have ‘had their fun’ with the anvils until things get to the level of imbalance you had in mind, or you can start with the minimum you think will work, and ramp up the good stuff when it misses the mark. Or both.</p>\n<p>Artifact has some great flavor, making great use of the world it inherited from DOTA 2. It is a shame to miss out on it because the cards that would trigger it aren’t up to the task, or to be exposed to the same subsection over and over.</p>\n<p>7. Players can be forced to explore in interesting ways</p>\n<p>Often players all accept a bit of conventional wisdom, or have the intuition that an approach is correct. They end up all playing the same cards, either everywhere or when using a particular deck or color combination.</p>\n<p>The catch is, <em>that decision is often wrong. </em>Or at least, there are alternatives worth using at least some of the time. But no one has thought of them.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Old School format is one way to see that players spent years missing everything from interesting individual card choices to entire strategies.</p>\n<p>A more brazen example? Remember Magic’s Trix deck that used Necropotence, Illusions of Grandeur and Donate? It took over its format completely.</p>\n<p>In the first Pro Tour where the deck was legal, <em>zero players </em>played both Necropotence and Donate. My test group didn’t even look at it.</p>\n<p>At one point, I won a Grand Prix with a deck called TurboLand. I was the only person in the entire 400+ person field who played it, despite writing about it before the tournament. It then became a first-tier deck for the rest of that season. If I had drawn poorly in one more round in that tournament and finished 23rd, no one would have looked at the deck twice.</p>\n<p>There is a phenomenon where sometimes, banning a card makes the deck it was in <em>better, </em>because players then focus on optimizing the deck and finding all their remaining options, and find a better build. If you then put the banned card back, the deck might get better still.</p>\n<p>[TODO]The trick is, suppose everyone plays Blink Dagger in every Artifact deck. Which they more or less do. Players get experience playing with Blink Dagger, learning how best to use it. Even if other cards are as good, and sometimes more appropriate, players will never try them out and get that information and experience. If you got rid of (or increased the cost of) Blink Dagger, players would be forced to experiment. Even if you later returned the cost back, players would have learned about other items and how to build their decks and strategies using them. We’d end up with more diversity and more fun.</p>\n<p>8. Players feel they have a voice and the game is responding to them</p>\n<p>The comments to this series so far only reinforce what the rest of the internet is saying, and has said for a long time. Most players believe that balance is good, and rebalancing is good if it creates more balance. Such policies and actions make them happy.</p>\n<p>No matter what other effects rebalancing has, we have proven beyond a doubt that players and potential players of Artifact are thrilled to hear about it. They feel listened to and cared about. They feel like Valve is committed to solving problems and to caring most about the best game play.</p>\n<p>That’s a great thing. Even if the changes turn out to ultimately have some nasty side effects, making players happy via their reactions to the announcement is a huge deal. If reaction is this positive, the resulting player love and interaction might dwarf all the other factors straight away.</p>\n<p>Done right, card rebalancing offers the opportunity to make a game everything it was intended to be or could be, and more, while keeping it fresh and new for the players. Sounds great.</p>\n<p>There are catches. That’s for next time.</p>\n<p> </p>",

As a reminder, most adversarial examples research is focused on finding imperceptible perturbations to existing images that cause the model to make a mistake. In contrast, unrestricted adversarial examples allow you to find <em>any</em> image that humans will reliably classify a particular way, where the model produces some other classification.</p><p>The key idea is simple -- train a GAN to generate images in the domain of interest, and then create adversarial examples by optimizing an image to simultaneously be &quot;realistic&quot; (as evaluated by the generator), while still being misclassified by the model under attack. The authors also introduce another term into the loss function that minimizes deviation from a randomly chosen noise vector -- this allows them to get diverse adversarial examples, rather than always converging to the same one.</p><p>They also consider a &quot;noise-augmented&quot; attack, where in effect they are running the normal attack they have, and then running a standard attack like FGSM or PGD afterwards. (They do these two things simultaneously, but I believe it&#x27;s nearly equivalent.)</p><p>For evaluation, they generate adversarial examples with their method and check that humans on Mechanical Turk reliably classify the examples as a particular class. Unsurprisingly, their adversarial examples &quot;break&quot; all existing defenses, including the certified defenses, though to be clear existing defenses assume a different threat model where an adversarial example must be an imperceptible perturbation to one of a known set of images. You could imagine doing something similar by taking the imperceptible-perturbation attacks and raise the value of ϵ until it is perceptible -- but in this case the generated images are much less realistic.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This is the clear first thing to try with unrestricted adversarial examples, and it seems to work reasonably well. I&#x27;d love to see whether adversarial training with these sorts of adversarial examples works as a defense against both this attack and standard imperceptible-perturbation attacks. In addition, it would be interesting to see if humans could direct or control the search for unrestricted adversarial examples.</p><h1>Technical AI alignment</h1><h3>Technical agendas and prioritization</h3><p><a href=\"http://s-risks.org/why-i-expect-successful-alignment/\">Why I expect successful alignment</a> <em>(Tobias Baumann)</em>: This post gives three arguments that we will likely solve the narrow alignment problem of having an AI system do what its operators intend it to do. First, advanced AI systems may be developed in such a way that the alignment problem doesn&#x27;t even happen, at least as we currently conceive of it. For example, under the comprehensive AI services model, there are many different AI services that are superintelligent at particular tasks that can work together to accomplish complex goals, but there isn&#x27;t a single unified agent to &quot;align&quot;. Second, if it becomes obvious that alignment will be a serious problem, then we will devote a lot of resources to tackling the problem. We already see reward hacking in current systems, but it isn&#x27;t sufficiently dangerous yet to merit the application of a lot of resources. Third, we have already come up with some decent approaches that seem like they could work.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I generally agree with these arguments and the general viewpoint that we will probably solve alignment in this narrow sense. The most compelling argument to me is the second one, that we will eventually devote significant resources to the problem. This does depend on the crux that we see examples of these problems and how they could be dangerous before it is too late.</p><p>I also agree that it&#x27;s much less clear whether we will solve other related problems, such as how to deal with malicious uses of AI, issues that arise when multiple superintelligent AI systems aligned with different humans start to compete, and how to ensure that humans have &quot;good&quot; values. I don&#x27;t know if this implies that <em>on the margin</em> it is more useful to work on the related problems. It could be that these problems are so hard that there is not much that we can do. (I&#x27;m neglecting <a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/importance-neglectedness-tractability/\">importance of the problem</a> here.)</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03493\">Integrative Biological Simulation, Neuropsychology, and AI Safety</a> <em>(Gopal Sarma et al)</em>: This paper argues that we can make progress on AI capabilities and AI safety through integrative biological simulation, that is, a composite simulation of all of the processes involved in neurons that allow us to simulate brains. In the near future, such simulations would be limited to simple organisms like Drosophila, but even these organisms exhibit behavior that we find hard to replicate today using our AI techniques, especially at the sample efficiency that the organisms show. On the safety side, even such small brains share many architectural features with human brains, and so we might hope that we could discover neuroscience-based methods for value learning that generalize well to humans. Another possibility would be to create test suites (as in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09883\">AI Safety Gridworlds</a>) for simulated organisms.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I don&#x27;t know how hard it would be to create integrative biological simulations, but it does strike me as very useful if we did have them. If we had a complete mechanistic understanding of how intelligence happens in biological brains (in the sense that we can simulate them), the obvious next step would be to understand <em>how</em> the mechanistic procedures lead to intelligence (in the same way that we currently try to understand why neural nets work). If we succeed at this, I would expect to get several insights into intelligence that would translate into significant progress in AI. However, I know very little about biological neurons and brains so take this with many grains of salt.</p><p>On the value learning side, it would be a good test of inverse reinforcement learning to see how well it could work on simple organisms, though it&#x27;s not obvious what the ground truth is. I do want to note that this is specific to inverse reinforcement learning -- other techniques depend on uniquely human characteristics, like the ability to answer questions posed by the AI system.</p><h3>Agent foundations</h3><p><a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/robust-program-equilibrium/\">Robust program equilibrium</a> <em>(Caspar Oesterheld)</em>: In a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma where you have access to an opponent&#x27;s source code, you can hope to achieve cooperation by looking at how the opponent would perform against you. Naively, you could simply simulate what the opponent would do given your source code, and use that to make your decision. However, if your opponent also tries to simulate you, this leads to an infinite loop. The key idea of this paper is to break the infinite loop by introducing a small probability of guaranteed cooperation (without simulating the opponent), so that eventually after many rounds of simulation the recursion &quot;bottoms out&quot; with guaranteed cooperation. They explore what happens when applying this idea to the equivalents of FairBot/Tit-for-Tat strategies when you are simulating the opponent.</p><h3>Preventing bad behavior</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mDTded2Dn7BKRBEPX/penalizing-impact-via-attainable-utility-preservation\">Penalizing Impact via Attainable Utility Preservation</a> <em>(Alex Turner)</em>: This post and the linked paper present [Attainable Utility Preservation] (<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/0c5eeec28f75/alignment-newsletter-25\">AN #25</a>) more simply. There are new experiments that show that AUP works on some of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09883\">AI Safety Gridworlds</a> even when using a set of <em>random</em> utility functions, and compares this against other methods of avoiding side effects.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> While this is easier to read and understand, I think there are important points in the <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure\">original post</a> that do not come across, so I would recommend reading both. In particular, one of my core takeaways from AUP was that convergent instrumental subgoals could be avoided by penalizing <em>increases</em> in attainable utilities, and I don&#x27;t think that comes across as well in this paper. This is the main thing that makes AUP different, and it&#x27;s what allows it to avoid disabling the off switch in the Survival gridworld.</p><p>The fact that AUP works with random rewards is interesting, but I&#x27;m not sure it will generalize to realistic environments. In these gridworlds, there is usually a single thing that the agent is not supposed to do. It&#x27;s very likely that several of the random rewards will care about that particular thing, which means that the AUP penalty will apply, so as long as full AUP would have solved the problem, AUP with random rewards would probably also solve it. However, in more realistic environments, there are many different things that the agent is supposed to avoid, and it&#x27;s not clear how big a random sample of reward functions needs to be in order to capture all of them. (However, it does seem reasonably likely that if the reward functions are &quot;natural&quot;, you only need a few of them to avoid convergent instrumental subgoals.)</p><h3>Adversarial examples</h3><p><strong><a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8052-constructing-unrestricted-adversarial-examples-with-generative-models.pdf\">Constructing Unrestricted Adversarial Examples with Generative Models</a></strong> <em>(Yang Song et al)</em>: Summarized in the highlights!</p><h1>Near-term concerns</h1><h3>Fairness and bias</h3><p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10352\">Learning Not to Learn: Training Deep Neural Networks with Biased Data</a> <em>(Byungju Kim et al)</em></p><h1>AI strategy and policy</h1><p><a href=\"http://cdn.aiindex.org/2018/AI%20Index%202018%20Annual%20Report.pdf\">AI Index 2018 Report</a> <em>(Yoav Shoham et al)</em>: Lots of data about AI.

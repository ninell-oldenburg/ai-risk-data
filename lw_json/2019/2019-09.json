First, various sources of errors that may accompany introspection are distinguished based on previous critical literature. Four main errors are classified, namely attentional, attributional, conceptual, and expressional error. Furthermore, methodological recommendations for the possible elimination of these errors have been determined based on the analysis and focused excerpting of introspective scientific literature. The following groups of methodological recommendations were determined: 1) a better focusing of the subject&#x2019;s attention to their mental processes, 2) providing suitable stimuli, and 3) the sharing of introspective experience between subjects. Furthermore, the potential of adjustments in introspective research designs for eliminating attentional, attributional, conceptual, and expressional error is discussed.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>AI Alignment is a confusing topic in general, but even compared to other alignment topics, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08575\">IDA</a> seems especially confusing. Some of it is surely just due to the nature of communicating subtle and unfinished research ideas, but other confusions can be cleared up with more specific language or additional explanations. To help people avoid some of the confusions I or others fell into in the past while trying to understand IDA (and to remind myself about them in the future), I came up with this list of past confusions that I think have mostly been resolved at this point. (However there's some chance that I'm still confused about some of these issues and just don't realize it. I've included references to the original discussions where I think the confusions were cleared up so you can judge for yourself.)</p>\n<p>I will try to maintain this list as a public reference so please provide your own resolved confusions in the comments.</p>\n<h1>alignment = intent alignment</h1>\n<p>At some point Paul started using \"alignment\" refer to the top-level problem that he is trying to solve, and this problem is narrower (i.e., leaves more safety problems to be solved elsewhere) than the problem that other people were using \"alignment\" to describe. He eventually settled upon \"intent alignment\" as the formal term to describe his narrower problem, but occasionally still uses just \"aligned\" or \"alignment\" as shorthand for it. <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment/comment/MRmNFj2iG9Bf68jiK\">Source</a></p>\n<h1>short-term preferences ≠ narrow preferences</h1>\n<p>At some point Paul used \"short-term preferences\" and \"narrow preferences\" interchangeably, but no longer does (or at least no longer endorses doing so). <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption/comment/cPGHdfkYbdbnjYMzR\">Source</a></p>\n<h1>preferences = \"actual\" preferences (e.g., preferences-on-reflection)</h1>\n<p>When Paul talks about preferences he usually means \"actual\" preferences (for example the preferences someone would arrive at after having a long time to think about it while having access to helpful AI assistants, if that's a good way to find someone's \"actual\" preferences). He does <em>not</em> mean their current revealed preferences or the preferences they would state or endorse now if you were to ask them. <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption/comment/ERmqHuN3ZWziS4SGH\">Source</a></p>\n<h1>corrigibility ≠ based on short-term preferences</h1>\n<p>I had misunderstood Paul to be using \"corrigibility to X\" as synonymous with \"based on X's short-term preferences\". Actually \"based on X's short-term preferences\" is a way to achieve corrigibility to X, because X's short-term preferences likely includes \"be corrigible to X\" as a preference. \"Corrigibility\" itself means something like \"allows X to modify the agent\" or a generalization of this concept. <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption/comment/P6iwWY7mnXAosnhQz\">Source</a></p>\n<h1>act-based = based on short-term preferences-on-reflection</h1>\n<p>My understanding is that \"act-based agent\" used to mean something different (i.e., a simpler kind of AI that tries to do the same kind of action that a human would), but most people nowadays use it to mean an AI that is designed to satisfy someone's short-term preferences-on-reflection, even though that no longer seems particularly \"act-based\". <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption/comment/rv4Whcn5RTXFZvu7B\">Source</a></p>\n<h1>act-based corrigibility</h1>\n<p>Evan Hubinger used \"act-based corrigibility\" to mean both a method of achieving corrigibility (based on short-term preferences) and the kind of corrigibility achieved by that method. (I'm not sure if he still endorses using the term this way.) <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr/mechanistic-corrigibility/comment/cyLJYF9TW2ivBKWrk\">Source</a></p>\n<h1>learning user preferences for corrigibility isn't enough for corrigible behavior</h1>\n<p>Because an act-based agent is about \"actual\" preferences not \"current\" preferences, it may be incorrigible even if it correctly learns that the user currently prefers the agent to be corrigible, if it incorrectly infers or extrapolates the user's \"actual\" preferences, or if the user's \"actual\" preferences do not actually include corrigibility as a preference. (ETA: Although in the latter case presumably the \"actual\" preferences include something even better than corrigibility.) <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption/comment/rv4Whcn5RTXFZvu7B\">Source</a></p>\n<h1>distill ≈ RL</h1>\n<p>Summaries of IDA often describe the \"distill\" step as using supervised learning, but Paul and others working on IDA today usually have RL in mind for that step. <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/HBGd34LKvXM9TxvNf/new-safety-research-agenda-scalable-agent-alignment-via/comment/WJC9Q5MvzqJeNSnLx\">Source</a></p>\n<h1>outer alignment problem exists? = yes</h1>\n<p>The existing literature on IDA (including a post about \"reward engineering\") seems to have neglected to describe an outer alignment problem associated with using RL for distillation. (Analogous problems may also exist if using other ML techniques such as SL.) <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/NtX7LKhCXMW2vjWx6/thoughts-on-reward-engineering/comment/ZRhxEg2EkvbfzZAnK\">Source</a></p>\n<h1>corrigible to the user? ≈ no</h1>\n<p>IDA is typically described as being corrigible to the user. But in reality it would be trying to satisfy a combination of preferences coming from the end user, the AI developer/overseer, and even law enforcement or other government agencies. I think this means that \"corrigible to the user\" is very misleading, because the AI is actually not likely to respect the user's preferences to modify (most aspects of) the AI or to be \"in control\" of the AI. Sources: <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/vbtvgNXkufFRSrx4j/three-ai-safety-related-ideas/comment/33cFGfHDQXrPgkweo\">this comment</a> and a talk by Paul at an AI safety workshop</p>\n<h1>strategy stealing ≠ literally stealing strategies</h1>\n<p>When Paul says \"strategy stealing\" he doesn't mean observing and copying someone else's strategy. It's a term borrowed from game theory that he's using to refer to coming up with strategies that are as effective as someone else's strategy in terms of gaining resources and other forms of flexible influence. <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption/comment/sHXaose7razaYpr9F\">Source</a></p>\n",

When considering <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">mesa optimization</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care\">AN #58</a></u>), it is natural to instead decompose robustness into two variables: robust capabilities and robust alignment. When given an environment that does not perfectly resemble its training environment, a mesa optimizer could be dangerous by competently pursuing a mesa objective that is different from the loss function used during training. This combination of robust capabilities without robust alignment is an example of a malign failure, the most worrisome outcome of creating a mesa optimizer.</p><p><strong>Matthew&apos;s opinion:</strong> Decomposing robustness in this way helps me distinguish misaligned mesa optimization from the more general problem of machine learning robustness. I think it&apos;s important for researchers to understand this distinction because it is critical for understanding why a failure to solve the robustness problem could plausibly result in a catastrophe rather than merely a benign capabilities failure.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I strongly agree with this distinction, and in fact when I think about the problem of mesa optimization, I prefer to only think about models whose capabilities are robust but whose objective or goal is not, rather than considering the internals of the model and whether or not it is performing search, which seems like a much hairier question.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Iterated amplification</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05863\">Finding Generalizable Evidence by Learning to Convince Q&amp;A Models</a></u> <em>(Ethan Perez et al)</em> (summarized by Asya): This paper tries to improve performance on multiple-choice questions about text passages using a technique similar to <u><a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/debate/\">AI safety via debate</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/0ae5d69de63b/alignment-newsletter-5\">AN #5</a></u>). The set-up consists of a <strong>judge model</strong> and one or more <strong>evidence agents</strong>. First, the judge model is pretrained on samples consisting of a passage, a multiple-choice question about that passage, and the correct answer to that question. Then, in the experimental portion of the set-up, instead of looking at a full passage, the judge model looks at a subsequence of the passage created by combining the outputs from several evidence agents. Each evidence agent has been given the same passage and assigned a particular answer to the question, and must select a limited number of sentences from the passage to present to the judge model to convince it of that answer.</p><p>The paper varies several parameters in its setup, including the training process for the judge model, the questions used, the process evidence agents use to select sentences, etc. It finds that for many settings of these parameters, when judge models are tasked with generalizing from shorter passages to longer passages, or easier passages to harder passages, they do better with the new passages when assisted by the evidence agents. It also finds that the sentences given as evidence by the evidence agents are convincing to humans as well as the judge model.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think it&apos;s a cool and non-trivial result that debating agents can in fact improve model accuracy. It feels hard to extrapolate much from this narrow example to debate as a general AI safety technique. The judge model is answering multiple-choice questions rather than e.g. evaluating a detailed plan of action, and debating agents are quoting from existing text rather than generating their own potentially fallacious statements.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cYduioQNeHALQAMre/what-are-the-differences-between-all-the-iterative-recursive#swv9DbRydFtm4oueh\">What are the differences between all the iterative/recursive approaches to AI alignment?</a></u> <em>(Issa Rice)</em></p><h3><strong>Mesa optimization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/bG4PR9uSsZqHg2gYY/utility-reward\">Utility &#x2260; Reward</a></u> <em>(Vladimir Mikulik)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post describes the overall story from <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">mesa-optimization</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care\">AN #58</a></u>). Unlike the original paper, it focuses on the distinction between a system that is optimized for some task (e.g. a bottle cap), and a system that is optimizing for some task. Normally, we expect trained neural nets to be optimized; risk arises when they are also optimizing.</p><h3><strong>Agent foundations</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zQZcWkvEA8DLjKR7C/theory-of-ideal-agents-or-of-existing-agents\">Theory of Ideal Agents, or of Existing Agents?</a></u> <em>(John S Wentworth)</em> (summarized by Flo): There are at least two ways in which a theoretical understanding of agency can be useful: On one hand, such understanding can enable the <strong>design</strong> of an artificial agent with certain properties. On the other hand, it can be used to <strong>describe</strong> existing agents. While both perspectives are likely needed for successfully aligning AI, individual researchers face a tradeoff: either they focus their efforts on existence results concerning strong properties, which helps with design (e.g. most of <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/p7x32SEt43ZMC9r7r/embedded-agents\">MIRI&apos;s work on embedded agency</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a></u>)), or they work on proving weaker properties for a broad class of agents, which helps with description (e.g. <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WmNeCipNwg9CmGy3T/markets-are-universal-for-logical-induction\">all logical inductors can be described as markets</a></u>, summarized next). The prioritization of design versus description is a likely crux in disagreements about the correct approach to developing a theory of agency.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> To facilitate productive discussions it seems important to disentangle disagreements about goals from disagreements about means whenever we can. I liked the clear presentation of this attempt to identify a common source of disagreements on the (sub)goal level.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WmNeCipNwg9CmGy3T/markets-are-universal-for-logical-induction\">Markets are Universal for Logical Induction</a></u> <em>(John S Wentworth)</em> (summarized by Rohin): A logical inductor is a system that assigns probabilities to logical statements (such as &quot;the millionth digit of pi is 3&quot;) over time, that satisfies the <em>logical induction criterion</em>: if we interpret the probabilities as prices of contracts that pay out $1 if the statement is true and $0 otherwise, then there does not exist a polynomial-time trader function with bounded money that can make unbounded returns over time. The <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03543.pdf\">original paper</a></u> shows that logical inductors exist. This post proves that for any possible logical inductor, there exists some market of traders that produces the same prices as the logical inductor over time.</p><h3><strong>Adversarial examples</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03973\">E-LPIPS: Robust Perceptual Image Similarity via Random Transformation Ensembles</a></u> <em>(Markus Kettunen et al)</em> (summarized by Dan H): Convolutional neural networks are one of the best methods for assessing the perceptual similarity between images. This paper provides evidence that perceptual similarity metrics can be made adversarially robust. Out-of-the-box, network-based perceptual similarity metrics exhibit some adversarial robustness. While classifiers transform a long embedding vector to class scores, perceptual similarity measures compute distances between long and wide embedding tensors, possibly from multiple layers. Thus the attacker must alter far more neural network responses, which makes attacks on perceptual similarity measures harder for adversaries. This paper makes attacks even harder for the adversary by using a barrage of input image transformations and by using techniques such as dropout while computing the embeddings. This forces the adversarial perturbation to be substantially larger.</p><h1><strong>AI strategy and policy</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/cooperation-on-safety/\">Why Responsible AI Development Needs Cooperation on Safety</a></u> <em>(Amanda Askell et al)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): AI systems are increasingly being developed by companies, and as such it is important to understand how competition will affect the safety and robustness of these systems. This paper models companies as agents engaging in a cooperate-defect game, where cooperation represents responsible development, and defection represents a failure to develop responsibly. This model yields five factors that increase the likelihood of companies cooperating on safety. Ideally, companies will have <strong>high trust</strong> that others cooperate on safety, large benefits from mutual cooperation (<strong>shared upside</strong>), large costs from mutual defection (<strong>shared downside</strong>), not much incentive to defect when others cooperate (<strong>low advantage</strong>), and not be harmed too much if others defect when they cooperate (<strong>low exposure</strong>).</p><p>They then suggest four concrete strategies that can help improve norms today. First, companies should help promote accurate beliefs about the benefits of safety. Second, companies should collaborate on research and engineering. Third, companies should be transparent and allow for proper oversight and feedback. Fourth, the community should incentivize adhering to high safety standards by rewarding safety work and penalizing unsafe behavior.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> Given that much of current AI progress is being driven by increases in computation power, it seems likely to me that companies will soon become more significant players in the AI space. As a result, I appreciate that this paper tries to determine what we can do now to make sure that the competitive landscape is conducive to taking proper safety precautions. I do, however, believe that the single step cooperate-defect game which they use to come up with their factors seems like a very simple model for what will be a very complex system of interactions. For example, AI development will take place over time, and it is likely that the same companies will continue to interact with one another. Iterated games have very different dynamics, and I hope that future work will explore how this would affect their current recommendations, and whether it would yield new approaches to incentivizing cooperation.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04534\">The Role of Cooperation in Responsible AI Development</a></u></p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Hierarchical RL</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10667\">Reinforcement Learning with Competitive Ensembles of Information-Constrained Primitives</a></u> <em>(Anirudh Goyal et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Learning policies that generalize to new environments is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. In particular, humans seem to be adept at learning skills and understanding the world in a way that is compositional, hinting at the source of the discrepancy. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has partially addressed the discrepancy by decomposing policies into options/primitives/subpolicies that a top-level controller selects from. However, generalization is limited because the top-level policy must work for all states.</p><p><strong>In this paper, the authors explore a novel decentralized approach where policies are still decomposed into primitives, but without a top-level controller.</strong> The key idea is to incentivize each primitive to work on a different cluster of states. Every primitive has a variational information bottleneck between the state and predicted action, that allows us to quantify how much information about the state the primitive uses in selecting actions. Intuitively, a primitive that knows how to open gates is going to extract a lot of information about gates from the state to choose an appropriate action, and won&#x2019;t extract much information in states without gates. So, our high-level controller can just be: check which primitive is using the most state information, and let that primitive choose the action.</p><p>The reward R from a trajectory is split amongst the primitives in proportion to how likely each primitive was to be chosen. This is what incentivizes the primitives to use information from the state. The primitives also get a cost in proportion to how much information they use, incentivizing them to specialize to a particular cluster of states. Finally, there is a regularization term that also incentivizes specialization, and in particular prevents a collapse where a single primitive is always active.</p><p>To demonstrate effectiveness, the authors compare the baseline HRL methods option-critic and <u><a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/learning-a-hierarchy/\">Meta-learning Shared Hierarchy</a></u> to their method in grid-world and motion imitation transfer tasks. They show that using an ensemble of primitives can outperform more traditional HRL methods in generalization across tasks.</p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> <strong>Overall, this paper is compelling because the method presented is both promising and provides natural ideas for future work.</strong> The method presented here is arguably simpler than HRL and the ability to generalize to new environments is simple to implement. The idea of introducing competition at an information theoretic level seems natural and the evidence for better generalization capability is compelling. It&apos;d be interesting to see what would happen if more complex primitives were used.</p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (AI)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/bouthillier19a/bouthillier19a.pdf\">Unreproducible Research is Reproducible</a></u> <em>(Xavier Bouthillier et al)</em> (summarized by Flo): This paper argues that despite the growing popularity of sharing code, machine learning research has a problem with reproducibility. It makes the distinction between the reproducibility of <strong>methods/results</strong>, which can be achieved by fixing random seeds and sharing code, and the reproducibility of <strong>findings/conclusions</strong>, which requires that different experimental setups (or at least random seeds) lead to the same conclusion.</p><p>Several popular neural network architectures are trained on several image classification datasets several times with different random seeds determining the weight initialization and sampling of data. The relative rankings of the architectures with respect to the test accuracy are found to vary relevantly with the random seed for all data sets, as well as between data sets.</p><p>The authors then argue that while the reproducibility of methods can help with speeding up <strong>exploratory research</strong>, the reproducibility of findings is necessary for <strong>empirical research</strong> from which robust conclusions can be drawn. They claim that exploratory research that is not based on robust findings can get inefficient, and so call for the machine learning community to do more empirical research.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I really like that this paper not just claims that there is a problem with reproducibility, but demonstrates this more rigorously using an experiment. More robust empirical findings seem quite important for getting to a better understanding of machine learning systems in the medium term. Since this understanding is especially important for safety relevant research, where exploratory research seems more problematic by default, I am excited for a push in that direction.</p><h1><strong>News</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/the-open-phil-ai-fellowship\">Open Phil AI Fellowship</a></u> (summarized by Rohin): The Open Phil AI Fellowship is seeking applications for its third cohort.

But it\ndoesn't do nearly as good a job with solids: fill one with rice and it\nquickly falls into the \"danger zone\".\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nOne recommendation you'll see is that you should fill the thermos with\nhot water, let it sit, and then swap the water for the food.  This\ndoes help, but because the thermos doesn't have that much thermal mass\nit only helps some.  What if we put a rock in the thermos to hold\nheat, and preheat it along with the rest of the thermos?  How much\ndoes this help?  Does this help enough?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe general rule is that hot food shouldn't be below 140F for more\nthan two hours, because substantial bacteria can grow, and the closer\nit is to 100F the worse it is.  My goal here is to be able to send hot\ndry food with Lily's lunch, and I pack it four hours before she gets\nto eat it, so the question is: what's the temperature two hours in,\nwhich is two hours before lunch time?  If that's above 140F we're ok,\nif not we should figure something else out.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI ran an experiment on one cup of cooked rice, the kind\nof dry food you're not normally supposed to put in a thermos.  I\nheated it in the microwave until it was steaming hot (it measured\n~188F with an infrared thermometer):\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/thermos-rock-rice-temperature-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/thermos-rock-rice-temperature.jpg\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI tested this in three configurations:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>T1: a thermos that has been pre-heated with boiling water.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>T2: same as T1, but with the addition of a 4.3oz (122g) rock\nwith volume 1.5oz (45ml).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>T3: same as T2, but the thermos has been preheated with two\nrounds of boiling water.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\nAfter two hours I measured the temperature of the rice:\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>T1: 108F</li>\n<li>T2: 136F (143F in the middle)</li>\n<li>T3: 142F (148F in the middle)</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe rock is clearly helping a lot, though it looks I should do the\nfull T3 treatment with two rounds of boiling water in this particular\nthermos.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/thermal-mass-thermos-tools-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/thermal-mass-thermos-tools.jpg\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis works, but it is kind of hacky: rocks are odd shaped, hard to\nclean, rattle around, hide food, etc.  How else could we solve this?\nIdeas:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Use water instead of a rock, because water has excellent heat\ncapacity by volume and very good heat capacity by weight.  Have two\nsections: an outer one you pour boiling water into, and an inner one\nfor the dry food.  Keep heat from leaving the overall enclosure, but\nallow heat to move freely between the two sections.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Something microwave-safe which uses a solid for the thermal\nmass.  tick it in the microwave for a few minutes before putting the\nfood in, or even with the food inside.  Water has a maximum\ntemperature of ~212F, but with a design like this you could bring your\nthermal mass up to, say, 300F (wrapped in an insulating layer so no\none got burnt).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Use a phase-change material?  Maybe like <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/iThermal-Temperature-Control-oz-Cools-Temperatures/dp/B07K6T2LDV/\">this\ntravel mug</a> but with a higher target temperature than 136F.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Battery powered cross between a thermos and a crock pot.  I do\nsee some things kind of like this aimed at people who want to keep\ncoffee warm in their car (no battery; takes power from the car) and\nsome expensive ones (<a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Cauldryn-Coffee-Travel-Mug-Temperature/dp/B07QX623NS\">ex</a>)\nthat have good internal batteries.  But nothing I can find designed\nto eat warm dry food out of?</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhy isn't there a product designed to keep dry food warm?  Am I just\nnot finding it?\n\n\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n  </p>",

If you don’t have a way to listen and make sense of that information, your model of the world is going to be impoverished. This involves sometimes looking at things through lenses <i>other</i> than what you can explicitly verbalize.”</p><p>I think this is true, and important. The people who do their thinking through a gear-centric frame <i>should</i> be paying attention to feelings-centric frames for this reason. (And meanwhile, <i>feelings themselves</i> totally have gears that can be understood through a mechanistic framework)</p><p>But for many people that’s <i>not actually the point</i> when looking through a feelings-centric frame.

(Dwight is currently an artist, not making much money, and has decided they want to try something else)</p><p>Alice says “Have you considered becoming a programmer? I hear they make a lot of money and you can get started with a 3 month bootcamp.”</p><p>Dwight says “Gah, don’t talk to me about programming.”</p><p>It turns out that Dwight’s dad always pushed him to learn programming, in a fairly authoritarian way. Now Dwight feels a bunch of ughiness around programming, with a mixture of “You’re not the boss of me! I’mma be an artist instead!”</p><p>In this situation, perhaps the best option might be to say: “Okay, seems like programming isn’t a good fit for Dwight,” and move on.</p><p>But it might also be that programming is actually a good option for Dwight to consider… it’s just that the conversation can’t proceed in the straightforward cost/benefit analysis frame that Alice was exploring.</p><p>For Dwight to meaningfully update on whether programming is good for him, he may need to untangle his emotions. He might need to make peace with some longstanding issues with his father, or learning to detach them from the “should I be a programmer” question.</p><p>It might be that the most useful thing Alice can do is give him the space to work through that on his own.</p><p>If Dwight trusts Alice to shift into a feelings-oriented framework (or a framework that at least includes feeling), Alice might be able to directly help him with the process. She could ask him questions that help him articulate his subtle <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eccTPEonRe4BAvNpD/the-felt-sense-what-why-and-how\">felt senses</a> about why programming feels like a bad option.</p><p>It may also be that this prerequisite trust doesn't exist, or that Dwight just doesn't want to have this conversation, in which case it's probably just best to move on to another topic.</p><hr><h1>Subtle differences between frames</h1><p>This gets much more complicated when you observe that a) there’s lots of slight variations on frames, and b) many people and conversations involve a mixture of frames.</p><p>It’s not <i>that</i> hard to notice that one person is in a feelings-centric frame while another person is in a gears-centric frame. But things can actually get even more confusing if two people share a broad frame (and so <i>think</i> they should be speaking the same language), but actually they’re communicating in two different subframes.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/f886riNJcArmpFahm/k09z34x20bza0jcpilhh\"></p><h2>Example differences between gears-frames</h2><p>Consider variations of Alice and Bob –&nbsp;both focused on causal models – who are coming from these different vantage points:</p><p><strong>Goal-oriented vs Curiosity-driven conversation</strong></p><p>Alice is trying to solve a specific problem (say, get a particular car engine fixed), and Bob thinks they’re just, like, having a freewheeling conversation about car engines and how neat they are (and if their curiosity took them in a different direction they might shift the conversation towards something that had nothing to do with car engines).</p><p><strong>Debate vs Doublecrux</strong></p><p>Alice is trying to present arguments for her side, and expects Bob to refute those arguments or present different arguments. The burden of presenting a good case is on Bob.</p><p>Whereas Bob thinks they’re trying to mutually converge on true beliefs (which might mean adopting totally new positions, and might involve each person focusing on how to change their <i>own</i> mind rather than their partner’s)</p><p><strong>Specific ontologies</strong></p><p>If one person is, say, really into economics, then they might naturally frame everything in terms of transactions. Someone else might be really into programming and see everything as abstracted functions that call each other.</p><p>They might keep phrasing things in terms that fit their preferred ontology, and have a hard time parsing statements from a different ontology.</p><h2>Example differences between feelings-frames</h2><p><strong>“Mutual Connection” vs “Turn Based Sharing”</strong></p><p>Clark might be trying to share feelings for the sake of building connection (sharing back and forth, getting into a flow, getting resonance).</p><p>Whereas Dwight might think the point is more for each of them to fully share their own experience, while the other one listens and takes up as little space as possible.</p><p><strong>“I Am My Feelings” vs “My Feelings are Objects”</strong></p><p>Clark might highly self identify with his feelings (in a sort of Romantic framework). Dwight might care a lot about understanding his feelings but see them as temporary objects in his experience (sort of Buddhist)</p><hr><h1>Concrete example: The FOOM Debate</h1><p>One of my original motivations for this post was the <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/ai-foom-debate/\">Yudkowsky/Hanson Foom Debate</a>, where much ink was spilled but AFAICT neither Yudkowsky nor Hanson changed their mind much.</p><p>I recently re-read through some portions of it. The debate seemed to feature several of the “differences within gears-orientation” listed above:</p><p><i>Specific ontologies: </i>Hanson is steeped in economics and sees it as the obvious lens to look at AI, evolution and other major historical forces. Yudkowsky instead sees things through the lens of optimization, and how to develop a causal understanding of what recursive optimization means and where/whether we’ve seen it historically.</p><p><i>Goal vs Curiosity</i>: I have an overall sense that Yudkowsky is more action oriented –&nbsp;he’s specifically setting out to figure out the most important things to do to influence the far future. Whereas Hanson mostly seems to see his job as “be a professional economist, who looks at various situations through an economic lens and see if that leads to interesting insights.”</p><p><i>Discussion format: </i>Throughout the discussion, Hanson and Yudkowsky are articulating their points using very different styles. On my recent read-through, I was impressed with the degree and manner to which they discussed this explicitly:</p><p>Eliezer notes:</p><blockquote><p>I think we ran into this same clash of styles last time (i.e., back at Oxford). I try to go through things systematically, locate any possible points of disagreement, resolve them, and continue. You seem to want to jump directly to the disagreement and then work backward to find the differing premises. I worry that this puts things in a more disagreeable state of mind, as it were—conducive to feed-backward reasoning (rationalization) instead of feed-forward reasoning.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It’s probably also worth bearing in mind that these kinds of metadiscussions are important, since this is something of a trailblazing case here. And that if we really want to set up conditions where we can’t agree to disagree, that might imply setting up things in a different fashion than the usual Internet debates.</p></blockquote><p>Hanson responds:</p><blockquote><p>When I attend a talk, I don’t immediately jump on anything a speaker says that sounds questionable. I wait until they actually make a main point of their talk, and then I only jump on points that seem to matter for that main point. Since most things people say actually don’t matter for their main point, I find this to be a very useful strategy. I will be very surprised indeed if everything you’ve said mattered regarding our main point of disagreement.</p></blockquote><p>I found it interesting that I find both these points quite important –&nbsp;I've run into each failure mode before. I'm unsure how to navigate between this <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cM8GNMpzfKCkPnd5v/do-you-fear-the-rock-or-the-hard-place\">rock and hard place</a>.</p><hr><p>My main goal with this essay was to establish frame-differences as an important thing to look out for, and to describe the concept from enough different angles to (hopefully) give you a <i>general</i> sense of what to look for, rather than a single failure mode.</p><p>What to <i>do</i> once you notice a frame-difference depends a lot on context, and unfortunately I'm often unsure what the best approach is. The next few posts will approach \"what has sometimes worked for me\", and (perhaps more sadly) \"what hasn't.\"</p>",

    "htmlBody": "\n\nYesterday morning my five-year-old daughter was asking me about\nmosquitos, and we got on to talking about malaria, \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net\">nets</a>, and how \n\n<a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Julia</a> and I \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/donations\">donate</a> to the \n\n<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\">AMF</a> to keep other\nkids from getting sick and potentially dying.  Lily took it very\nseriously, and proposed that when I retire she take my \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/rejoining-google\">programming job</a> and donate in my place.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI told her that she didn't need to wait until after I retired to start\nhelping, and she decided she wanted to sell candy on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerville_Community_Path\">bike\npath</a> as a fundraiser.  I told her we could do this after naps if\nthe weather was still nice, and the first thing she said when I got\nher up from her nap was that she wanted to go make a sign.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nShe dictated to me, \"Lily is selling candy to raise money for malaria\nnets, $1\" and I wrote the letters.  She colored them in:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lily-is-selling-candy-to-raise-money-for-malaria-nets-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lily-is-selling-candy-to-raise-money-for-malaria-nets.jpg\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(It looks like she's posing with the sign here, but this is just how\nshe happened to position herself for coloring.  She has short arms.)\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOnce Anna was up from her (longer) nap I got out the <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/wagon\">wagon</a> and brought them over to the bike path.\nLily did all the selling; I just hung out to the side, leaning against\na tree.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lily-selling-candy-on-the-bike-path-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lily-selling-candy-on-the-bike-path.jpg\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nShe's always been good at talking to adults, and did a good job\nselling the candy. She would explain that the candy was $1/each, that\nthe money was going to buy malaria nets, and that malaria was a very\nbad disease that you got from mosquitoes.  People were generous, and\nseveral people gave without taking candy, or put in an extra dollar.\nOne person didn't have cash but wanted to give enough that they went\nhome and came back with a dollar.  As someone who grew up in a part of\ntown with very little foot traffic, the idea that you can just walk a\nshort distance from your house to somewhere where several people will\npass per minute continually amazes me.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAfter about twenty minutes all the candy was sold and Lily had\ncollected $20.75.  She played in the park for a while, and then when\nwe came home she asked how we would use the money to buy nets.  I\nshowed her pictures of distributions on the <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">AMF website</a> but she wanted\nto see pictures of the nets in use so we spent a while on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=people+sleeping+under+malaria+net&amp;&amp;tbm=isch\">image\nsearch</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/malaria-net-in-use-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/malaria-net-in-use.jpg\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI explained that we weren't going to distribute the nets ourselves,\nbut that we would provide the money so other people could.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nInitially she didn't want to donate the whole amount, but wanted to\nset aside half to buy more candy so she could do this again.  I told\nher that I would be happy to buy the candy.  Possibly I should have\nlet her manage this herself, but I was worried that the money wouldn't\nend up donated which wouldn't have been fair to the people who'd\nbought the candy, and explained this to her.  She gave me the $20.75\nand I used my credit card to pay for the nets. [1]\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHere's the message she dictated for the <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/MyNets.aspx?DonationID=521550\">donation</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote><i>I want people to be safe in the world from biting\nmosquitoes. I don't want them getting hurt, and especially I don't\nwant the kids like me to die.</i></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI don't know how her relationship with altruism will change as she\ngets older, and I do think there are ways it will be hard for her to\nhave parents who have strong unusual views.  As we go I'm going to\ncontinue to try very hard not to pressure or manipulate her, while\nstill giving advice and helping her explore her motivations here.  I\nam, however, very proud of her today.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n[1] I haven't listed this on our <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/donations\">donations\npage</a> and it doesn't count it towards our 50% goal because the\ndonation was Lily's and not ours.\n\n  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>A transcribed excerpt I found interesting from the <a href=\"https://80k.link/christiano-outtake\">decision theory outtake</a> from 80,000 Hours' <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/paul-christiano-a-message-for-the-future/\">second interview</a> of Paul Christiano (starting at 14:00):</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p><strong>Robert Wiblin: </strong>It seems like philosophers have not been terribly interested in these heterodox decision theories. They just seem to not have been persuaded, or not even to really have engaged with them a great deal. What do you think is going on there?</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>I think there's a few things going on. I don't think it's right to see a spectrum with CDT and then EDT and then UDT. I think it's more right to see a box, where there's the <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Updateless_decision_theory\">updatelessness</a> axis and then there's the <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2018/09/19/edt-vs-cdt/\">causal vs. evidential</a> axis. And the causal vs. evidential thing I don't think is as much of a divide between geography, or between philosophers and rationalists.</p><p>CDT is the majority position in philosophy, but not an overwhelming majority; there are reasonable philosophers who defend EDT. EDT is a somewhat more common view, I think, in the world — certainly in the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/#PDReplCausDeciTheo\">prisoner's dilemma with a twin</a> case, I think most people would choose \"cooperate\" if you just poll people on the street. Again, not by a large majority.</p><p>And amongst the rationalists, there's also not agreement on that. Where I would say Eliezer has a view which I would describe as the causal view, not the evidential view. But he accepts updatelessness.</p><p>So on the causal vs. evidential split, I think it's not so much geographical. It's more just like everyone is fairly uncertain. Although I think it is the case maybe people in the Bay are more on evidential decision theory and philosophers are more on causal decision theory.</p><p>Then on the updatelessness thing, I think a lot of that is this semantic disagreement / this understanding of \"what is the project of decision theory?\" Where if you're building AI systems, the point of decision theory is to understand how we make decisions such that we can encode it into a machine.</p><p>And if you're doing that, I think there's not actually a disagreement about that question. Like, once you're really specific about what is meant. No one thinks you should make — well, I don't... <em>Hopefully</em> no one thinks you should make an AI that uses causal decision theory. <em>Causal decision theorists</em> would not recommend making such an AI, because it has bad consequences to make such an AI.</p><p>So I think once we're talking about \"How do you make an AI?\", if you're saying, \"I want to understand which decision theory my AI ought to use — like, how my AI ought to use the word 'right'\" — everyone kind of agrees about that, that you should be more in the updateless regime.</p><p>It's more like a difference in, \"What are the questions that are interesting, and how should we use language?\" Like, \"What do concepts like 'right' mean?\"</p><p>And I think there is a big geographical and community distinction there, but I think it's a little bit less alarming than it would be if it were like, \"What are the facts of the case?\" It's more like, \"What are the questions that are interesting?\" — which, like, people are in fact in different situations. \"How should we use language?\" — which is reasonable. The different communities, if they don't have to talk that much, it's okay, they can just evolve to different uses of the language.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin: </strong>Interesting. So you think the issue is to a large degree semantic.</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>For updatelessness, yeah.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin: </strong>So you think it's the case that when it comes to programming an AI, there's actually a lot of agreement on what kind of decision theory it should be using in practice. Or at least, people agree that it needn't be causal decision theory, even though philosophers think in some more fundamental sense causal decision theory is the right decision theory.</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>I think that's right. I don't know exactly what... I think philosophers don't think that much about that question. But I think it's not a tenable position, and if you really got into an argument with philosophers it wouldn't be a tenable position that you should program your AI to use causal decision theory.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin: </strong>So is it the case that people started thinking about this in part because they were thinking, \"Well, what decision theory should we put in an AI?\" And then they were thinking, \"Well, what decision theory should I commit to doing myself? Like, maybe this has implications in my own life.\" Is that right?</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Yeah, I think that's how the rationalists got to thinking about this topic. They started thinking about AI, then maybe they started thinking about how humans should reason insofar as humans are, like, an interesting model. I'm not certain of that, but I think that's basically the history for most of them.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin: </strong>And it seems like if you accept one of the updateless decision theories, then potentially it has pretty big implications for how you ought to live your life. Is that right?</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Yeah, I think there are some implications. Again, they're mostly going to be of this form, \"You find yourself in a situation. You can do a thing that is bad for yourself in that situation but good for yourself in other situations. Do you do the thing that's bad right now?\" And you would have committed to do that. And maybe if you've been thinking a lot about these questions, then you've had more opportunity to reason yourself into the place where you would actually take that action which is locally bad for yourself.</p><p>And again, I think philosophers could agree. Most causal decision theorists would agree that if they had the power to stop doing the right thing, they should stop taking actions which are right. They should instead be the kind of person that you want to be.</p><p>And so there, again, I agree it has implications, but I don't think it's a question of disagreement about truth. It's more a question of, like: you're actually making some cognitive decisions. How do you reason? How do you conceptualize what you're doing?</p><p>There are maybe also some actual questions about truth, like: If <em>I'm</em> in the <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Parfit's_hitchhiker\">Parfit's hitchhiker</a> case, and I'm imagining I'm at the ATM, I'm deciding whether to take the money out. I'm kind of more open to a perspective that's like, \"<em>Maybe</em> I'm at the ATM, deciding whether to take the money out. But maybe I'm inside the head of someone reasoning about me.\"</p><p>Maybe I'm willing to ascribe more consciousness to things being imagined by some other person. And that's not necessarily a decision theory disagreement, but it's more of a disagreement-about-facts case. And it's a kind of perspective that makes it easier to take that kind of action.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin: </strong>Yeah, so... Before we imagine that we're potentially in people's imaginations, in your writing, you seem <em>very </em>interested in <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2016/11/14/integrity-for-consequentialists/\">integrity</a> and honesty. And it seems in part like this is informed by your views on decision theory.</p><p>For example, it seems like you're the kind of person to be like, \"No, absolutely, I would always pay the money at the ATM,\" in the hitchhiker case. Do you want to explain, how has decision theory affected your life? What concrete implications do you think it should potentially have for listeners?</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Yeah, so I think there are a lot of complicated empirical questions that bear on almost every one of these practical decisions. And we could talk about what fraction of the variation is explained by considerations about decision theory.</p><p>And maybe I'm going to go for, like, a third of variation is explained by decision theory stuff. And I think there a lot of it is also not the core philosophical issues, but just chugging through a lot of complicated analysis. I think it's surprising that it gets as complicated as it does.</p><p>My basic take-away from that kind of reasoning is that a reasonable first-pass approximation, in many situations, is to behave as if, when making a decision, consider not only the direct consequences of that decision, but also the consequences of other people having believed that you would make that decision.</p><p>So, for example, if you're deciding whether to divulge something told to you in confidence, you're like, \"Well, on the one hand, divulging this fact told to me in confidence is good. On the other hand, if I were known to have this policy, I wouldn't have learned such information in the first place.\" This gives you a framework in which to weigh up the costs and benefits there.</p><p>So that's my high-level take-away, first-order approximation. Which I think <em>a priori</em> looks kind of silly — maybe there's a little bit to it, but it probably is not going to hold up. And then the more I've dug in, the more I feel like when all the complicated analysis shakes out, you end up much closer to that first-order theory than you would have guessed.</p><p>And I think that summarizes most of my takeaway from weird decision theory stuff.</p><p>Maybe the other question is: There's some \"How nice to be to other value systems?\" where I come down on a more nice perspective, which maybe we'll touch a little bit on later. This gets weirder.</p><p>But those are maybe the two things. How much should you sympathize with value systems that you don't think are intrinsically valuable, just based on some argument of the form, \"Well, I could have been in there position and they could have been in mine\"? And then: how much should you behave as if, by deciding, you were causing other people to know what you would have decided?</p>",

To heavily summarize Pushmeet’s views, I think he might have made a couple of key claims.</p><p>One was that alignment and robustness issues, in his view, appear everywhere throughout the development of machine learning systems, so they require some degree of attention from everyone who’s working in the field. According to Pushmeet, this makes the distinction between safety research and non-safety research somewhat vague and blurry, and he thinks people who are working on capabilities are kind of also helping with safety, and improving reliability also improves capabilities, because you can then actually design algorithms that do what you want.</p><p>Secondly, I think he thought that an important part of reliability and robustness is going to be trying to faithfully communicate our desires to machine learning algorithms, and that this is kind of analogous to – although a harder instance of – the challenge of just communicating with other people, getting them to really understand what we mean. Although of course it’s easier to do that with other humans than with animals or machine learning algorithms.</p><p>A third point was, I guess, just a general sense of optimism: that DeepMind is working on this issue quite a lot and are keen to hire more people to work on these problems, and I guess a sense that probably we’re going to be able to gradually fix these problems with AI alignment as we go along and machine learning algorithms get more influential.</p><p>I know you haven’t had a chance to listen to the whole interview, but you skimmed over the transcript. Firstly, where do you think Pushmeet is getting things right? Where do you agree?</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> So I certainly agree that there’s this tight linkage between getting AI systems to do what you want and making them more capable. I agree with the basic optimism that people will need to address the “getting AI systems to do what we want” problem. I think it is more likely than not that people will have a good solution to that problem.</p><p>Maybe there’s this interesting intervention of, “Should longtermists be thinking about that problem in order to increase the probability?” I think even absent the actions of the longtermists, there’s a reasonably good chance that everything would just be totally fine. So in that sense, I’m on board with those claims, definitely.</p><p>I think that I would disagree a little bit in thinking that there is a meaningful distinction between activities whose main effect is to change the date by which various things become possible, and activities whose main effect is to change the trajectory of development.</p><p>I think that’s the main distinguishing feature of “working on alignment” per se. You care about this differential progress towards being able to build systems to do what we want. I think in that perspective, it is the case that the average contribution of AI work is almost by definition zero on that front, because if you just increased all the AI work by a unit, you’re just bringing everything forward by one unit.</p><p>And so I think that does mean there’s this well-defined thing which is, “Can we change the trajectory in a way?” And that’s an important problem to think about.</p><p>I think there’s also a really important distinction between the kind of failure which is most likely to disrupt the long-term trajectory of civilization, and the kind of failure which is most likely to be an immediate deal-breaker for systems actually being useful or producing money. And maybe one way to get at that distinction is related to the second point you mentioned.</p><p>Communicating your goals to an ML system is very similar to communicating with a human. I think there is a hard problem of communicating your goals to an ML system, which we could view as a capabilities problem. Are they able to understand things people say? Are they able to form the kind of internal model that would let them understand what I want? In some sense, it’s very similar to the problem of predicting what Paul would do, or it’s a little slice of that problem – predicting under what conditions Paul would be happy with what you’ve done.</p><p>That’s most of what we’re dealing with when we’re communicating with someone. If I’m talking with you, I would be completely happy if I just managed to give you a perfect model of me – then the problem is solved. I think that’s a really important AI difficulty for making AI systems actually useful.</p><p>I think that’s less the kind of thing that could end up pushing us in a bad long-run direction, mostly because we’re concerned about behavior as AI systems become very capable and have a very good understanding of the world around them, of the people they’re interacting with; and the really concerning cases are ones where AI systems actually understand quite well what people would do under various conditions, understand quite well what they want – what we think about as normal communication problems between people – that understand what Paul wants, but aren’t trying to help Paul get what he wants. And I think that a lot of the interesting difficulty, especially from a very long-run perspective, is really making sure that no gap opens up there.</p><p>Again, there's a gap between the problems that are most important on the very long-run perspective and the problems that people will most be confronting in order to make AI systems economically valuable.</p><p>I do think that there’s a lot of overlap – problems that people are working on, that make AI systems more valuable, are also helping very directly with the long-run outcome. But I think if you’re interested in differentially changing the trajectory or improving the probability that things go well over the long term, you’re more inclined to focus precisely on those problems which <em>won’t</em> be essential for making AI systems economically useful in the short term. And I think that’s really distinctive to what your motivation is or how you’re picking problems or prioritizing problems.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> One of the bottom lines for Pushmeet, I guess, was that people who want to make sure that AI goes well, they needn’t be especially fussy about whether they’re working on something that’s safety-specific or on something that’s just about building a new product that works well using machine learning.</p><p>Sounds like you’re a little bit more skeptical of that, or you think ideally people should in the medium term be aiming to work on things that seem like they disproportionately push on robustness and reliability?</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> Yeah, I think people who are mostly concerned about the long-term trajectory face this dilemma in every domain. If you live in the world where you think that almost all of the most serious challenges to humanity are caused by things humans are doing – by things not only that humans are doing, but by things humans are doing that we would often think of as part of productive progress, part of the goal – like we’re building new technologies, but those technologies are also the things that pose the main risks – then you have to be picky if you’re a person who wants to change the long-term trajectory.</p><p>You're just sort of like, \"I probably <em>am</em> helping address those problems if I just go do a random thing – I work on a random project, make a random product better. I am helping address the kinds of problems we're concerned about. But I’m also at the same time contributing to bringing those problems closer to us in time.\"</p><p>And it’s sort of roughly a wash, if you’re on the average product, making the average product work. And there are subtle distinctions we could make, of like – I think if you are motivated to make products work well, if you’re like, “Not only do I want to do the thing that’s most economically valuable, I want to have more of an emphasis on making this product robust,” I think you’re just generally going to make a bunch of low-level decisions that will be helpful.</p><p>I definitely think you can have a pretty big impact by being fussy about which problems you work on.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> I guess there’s this open question of whether we should be happy if AI progress across the board just goes faster. What if, yeah, we can just speed up the whole thing by 20%? Both all of the safety and capabilities. As far as I understand, there’s kind of no consensus on this. People vary quite a bit on how pleased they’d be to see everything speed up in proportion.</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s right. I think my take, which is a reasonably common take, is it doesn’t matter that much from an alignment perspective. Mostly, it will just accelerate the time at which everything happens.</p><p>And there are some second-order terms that are really hard to reason about, like, “How good is it to have more or less computing hardware available?” Or ”How good is it for there to be more or less kinds of other political change happening in the world prior to the development of powerful AI systems?”</p><p>There’s these kind of higher-order questions where people are very uncertain of whether it’s good or bad. But I guess my take would be that the net effect there is kind of small, and the main thing is I think accelerating AI matters much more on the next-100-years perspective.</p><p>If you care about welfare of people and animals over the next 100 years, then acceleration of AI looks reasonably good. So I think the main upside of faster AI progress is that people are going to be happy over the short term. I think if you care about the long term, it is roughly a wash, and people could debate whether it’s slightly positive or slightly negative but mostly it’s just accelerating where we’re going.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, this has been one of the trickier questions that we’ve tried to answer in terms of giving people concrete career advice.</p><p>It seems to me if you’re someone who has done a PhD in ML or is very good at ML, but you currently can’t get a position that seems especially safety-focused or that is going to disproportionately affect safety more than capabilities, it is probably still good to take a job that just advances AI in general, mostly because you’ll be reaching the cutting edge potentially of what’s going on and improving your career capital a lot and having relevant understanding.</p><p>And the work, I guess you kind of think, is kind of close to a wash. It speeds things up a little bit – like, everything goes in proportion. It’s not clear whether that’s good or bad. But then you can potentially later on go and work on something that’s more alignment-specific, and that is the dominant term in the equation. Does that seem reasonable?</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> Yeah, I think that seems basically right to me. I think there’s some intuitive hesitation with the family of advice that’s like, “You should do this thing, which we think is roughly a wash on your values now, but there will be some opportunity in the future where you can sort of make a call.” I think there’s some intuitive hesitation about that, but I think that is roughly right.</p><p>Imagine if you offered to Paul two possible worlds. In one, there’s twice as many people working on machine learning and AI, but half of them really care about the long term and ensuring that AI is developed in a way that’s good for humanity’s long term. I'm like, \"That sounds like a good trade.\"</p><p>We maybe then have less opportunity to do work right now. I think that’s the main negative thing. There will be less time to think about the alignment problem per se. But on the other hand, it just seems really good if a large fraction of the field really cares about making things go well. I just expect a field that has that character to be much more likely to handle issues in a way that’s good for the long term.</p><p>And I think you can sort of scale that down. It’s easiest for me to imagine the case where a significant fraction of the field is like that, but I think that if anything, the marginal people at the beginning are having probably a better cost-benefit analysis for them.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, I guess I was suggesting that this would be the thing to do if you couldn’t get a job that was alignment-specific already. Say that they want to join your team but they’re just not quite good enough yet, they need to learn more. Or potentially, there’s just only so fast that the team can grow, so even though they’re good, you just can’t hire as quickly as people are coming on board.</p><p>But I suppose you have to make sure that, yeah, if people are going into these roles that we currently think are kind of just neutral, but good for improving their skills, that they don’t forget about that. That the original plan was at some point to switch to something different.</p><p>I guess there is a bit of a trap. It seems like people just in general tend to get stuck in doing what they’re doing now and convince themselves that whatever they’re doing is actually really useful. So you might think, “Yeah, it would be good to go in and then switch out,\" but you might have some doubts about whether in fact you will follow through on that.</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s right. I would be even happier, certainly, in the world where you took those half of people who might have gone into ML, and you instead moved them all into really thinking deeply about the long term and how to make things go well. That sounds like an even better world still.</p><p>If someone really cared about the long term and were like, “What should I do,” it’s a reasonably good option to just be like, “Go do this thing which is good on the short term and adjacent to an area we think is going to be really important over the long term.”</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> There’s been this argument over the years that it would just be good in some way that we can’t yet anticipate to have people at the cutting edge of machine learning research who are concerned about the long term and alert to safety issues and alert to alignment issues that could have effects on the very long term. And people have gone back and forth on how useful that actually would be, to just be in the room where decisions are getting made.</p><p>It's kind of occurred to me that it seems like the machine learning community is really moving in the direction of sharing the views that you and I hold. A lot of people are just becoming concerned about “Will AI be aligned in the long term?” And it might be that if you’re particularly concerned about that now, then maybe that makes you different from your peers right now, but in 10 years’ time or 20 years’ time everyone will have converged on a similar vision as we have a better idea of what machine learning actually looks like and what the risks are when it’s deployed.</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s an interesting question, or an interesting possible concern with that kind of approach. I guess my take would be that there are some differences – I don’t know if you’d call them values differences or deep empirical or worldview differences – that are relevant here. Where I think to the extent that we’re currently thinking about problems that are going to become real problems, it’s going to be much, much more obvious that there are real problems.</p><p>And I think that to the extent that some of the problems we think about over the very long term are already obviously problems, people in the ML community are very interested in problems that are obviously problems – or, problems that are affecting the behavior of systems today.</p><p>Like, again, if these problems are real, that’s going to become more and more the case over time, and so people will become more and more interested in those problems.</p><p>I still think there is this question of, \"How much are you interested in making the long term go well, versus how much are you doing your job or pursuing something which has a positive impact over the short term, or that you’re passionate about or interested in this other non-long-term impact of?\" I do think there are just continuously going to be some calls to be made or some different decisions.</p><p>The field embodies some set of values. I think that people’s empirical views are changing more than the set of implicit values that they have. I think if you just said everyone who really cares about the long term isn’t going into this area, then the overall orientation the field will persistently be different.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> Do you have any views on the particular technical approaches that Pushmeet mentioned in the episode or that the DeepMind folks have written up on their <a href=\"https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch\">safety blog</a>?</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> The stuff I’m most familiar with that Pushmeet’s group is working on is verification for robustness to perturbations, some working on verification more broadly, and some working on adversarial training and testing. Maybe those are the three things, I don’t know if there’s something else. I’m happy to go through those in order.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, go through those.</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> So, I guess I’m generally pretty psyched about adversarial testing and training and verification. That is, I think there is this really important problem over both – this is one of those things at the intersection of \"it matters over the short term, I think it matters (maybe even more) over the very long term\" – of, you have some AI system, you want to delegate a bunch of work to maybe not just one but a whole bunch of AI systems. If they failed catastrophically, it would be really unrecoverably bad.</p><p>You can’t really rule out that case with traditional ML training, because you’re just going to try a thing on a bunch of cases that you’ve generated so far, experienced so far. So your training process isn’t at all constraining on this potential catastrophic failure in a new situation that comes up.</p><p>So we just want to have something, we want to change the ML training process to have some information about what would constitute a catastrophic failure and then not do that. I think that’s a problem that is in common between the short and long term. I think it matters a lot on the long term. It’s a little bit hard to say whether it’s more on the long term or short term, but I care about it a lot on the long term.</p><p>I think that the main approaches we have to that are – the three I really think about are adversarial training and testing, verification, and interpretability or transparency.</p><p>I just think people getting familiar with those techniques, becoming good at them, thinking about how you would apply them to richer kinds of specifications, how you grapple with the fundamental limitations in adversarial training where you have to rely on the adversary to think of a kind of case...</p><p>The way the technique works in general is that you're like, “I’m concerned about my system failing in the future. I’m going to have an adversary who’s going to generate some possible situations under which the system might fail. And then we’re going to run on those and see if it fails catastrophically.” You have this fundamental limitation where your adversary isn’t going to think of everything.</p><p>People are getting experience with, \"How do we grapple with that limitation?\" In some sense, verification is a response to that limitation. I think it’s productive to have people thinking about both verification and the limits of verification, and testing and the limits of testing. So overall I’m pretty excited about all of that.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> Do you share Pushmeet’s general optimism?</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> I don’t know quantitatively exactly how optimistic he is. My guess would be that I’m less optimistic, in the sense that I’m like, “Well, there’s like tens of percent chance that we'll mess this up and lose the majority of the value of the future.” Whereas listening to him, that's not the overall sense I get of where he’s at.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin: </strong>It's not the vibe.</p><br><p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Yeah. But it’s a little bit hard to know how to translate between a vibe and an actual level of optimism.</p><br><p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, it is interesting. Someone could think there's a 20% chance that we’ll totally destroy everything, but still just have kind of a cheerful disposition, so they come across as, \"Well, y'know, things could go well as well!\"</p><p>Among people working on existential risks and global catastrophic risks, and I guess AI in particular, there’s this trade-off between not wanting to do things that other people disagree with or are unenthusiastic about, and at the same time not wanting to have a field that’s so conservative that there are no experiments done unless there is a consensus behind them. Do you think people are too inclined to make unilateralist-curse type mistakes, or not trying things enough?</p><p><br><br><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> I think my answer to this probably varies depending on the area. For reference, I think the policy you want to be following is: update on the fact that no one else wants to do this thing and then take that really seriously, engage with it a lot before deciding whether you want to do it. And ideally that’s going to involve engaging with the people who have made that decision to understand where they’re coming from.<br><br>I think I don’t have a very strong general sense of whether we’re more likely to make one mistake or the other. I think I’d expect the world systematically to make too much of the \"a thing can be done unilaterally, so it gets done\" one. In the context of this field, I don’t know if there are as many – yeah, I guess I don’t feel super concerned about either failure mode. Maybe I don’t feel that bad about where people are at.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/paul-christiano-a-message-for-the-future/\">Continued at 1:27:00</a>]</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Hurrah! Success! I didn't know what to expect, and am pleasantly surprised to find the Frontpage is still intact. My thanks to everyone who took part, to everyone who commented on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vvzfFcbmKgEsDBRHh/honoring-petrov-day-on-lesswrong-in-2019\">yesterday's post</a>, and to everyone who didn't unilaterally blow up the site.</p><h2>Launch Attempts Results</h2><p>I said I would share usernames and codes of all attempts to launch the codes. Others on the team told me this seemed like a bad idea in many ways, and on reflection I agree - I think many people were not aware they were signing up for being publicly named and shamed, and I think it's good that people aren't surprised by their actions becoming public. Though if someone had successfully nuked the site I would have named them.</p><p>Nonetheless, I’ll share a bunch of info. First of all, the button was in a pretty central place, and it turns out you can hit it accidentally. Ray built the button so that you could only hit it once - it was forever after pressed. </p><ul><li>The number of logged-in users who pressed the button was 102.</li><ul><li>(Ruby made a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JW3Y2AKvzFzTm_wdsjasuHX36lIm27Kpae3xdWBrq_k/edit?usp=sharing\">sheet</a> of times when people pressed the button, redacting most of the info.)</li></ul><li>I have no number for logged-out users, for them pressing it brought up a window asking them to log-in. (Er, I'm not certain that's the best selection process for new users).</li><li>The number of users who actually submitted launch codes is 18. </li><ul><li>11 of those accounts had zero karma, 7 accounts had positive karma. None of the users were people who had been given real codes.</li></ul><li>Several users submitted launch codes before clicking through to find out what the button even did - I hope this initiative serves them well in life. </li><li>A few accounts were made on-the-day presumably for this purpose, I'm happy to name these. They include users like \"bomb_presser\", \"The Last Harbinger\", and \"halosaga\", whose codes were \"00000000\", \"NL73njLH58et1Ec0\" and \"diediedie\" respectively. </li></ul><p>LW user ciphergoth (Paul Crowley) shared his launch codes on Facebook (indeed I had sent him real launch codes), and two users copied and entered them. However, he had actually shared fake codes. \"The Last Harbinger\" entered them. </p><p>A second user entered them, who had positive karma, and was not someone to whom I had sent real codes. However, they failed to properly copy it, missing the final character. To them, I can only say what I had prepared to say to anyone who mis-entered what they believed were correct launch codes. <em>\"First, you thought you were a failure to the community. But then, you learned, you were a failure to yourself.\"</em></p><p>Oli and Ray decided that anyone submitting launch codes deserved a janky user-experience. I hope all of the users enjoyed finding out that when you try to nuke the site, regardless of whether you enter correct or incorrect launch codes, the launch pad <em>just disappears</em> and <em>nothing else happens</em>. (Once you refresh, the page is of course nuked.)</p><p>Last night during my house's Petrov Day ceremony, which ran from about 8:10-9:10, I nervously glanced over at the LW frontpage on the open laptop as it refreshed every 60 seconds. Some small part of me was worried about <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vvzfFcbmKgEsDBRHh/honoring-petrov-day-on-lesswrong-in-2019#HNRdtb9KBTWNE8ssB\">Quirinus_Quirrell following through on his threat to nuke the site at 9pm</a>. I honestly did not expect that someone could create a character hard enough that it would leap out of the book and hold us all hostage in a blackmail attempt. Damn you Eliezer Yudkowsky!</p><h2>Looking Ahead</h2><p>I thought the discussion was excellent. I mostly avoided participating to let others decide for themselves, but I might go back and add more comments now it's done. As Said Achmiz <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vvzfFcbmKgEsDBRHh/honoring-petrov-day-on-lesswrong-in-2019#fdA4kzBvcA82WBdcf\">pointed out</a>, it'll be better next year to have more time in advance for people to discuss the ethics of the situation and think, and that will be even more informative and valuable. Though I still learned a lot this year, and I think overall it turned out as well as I could've hoped. </p><p>I'll think more about how to do it next year. One thing I will say is that I'd ideally like to be able to reach an equilibrium where 100s of users every year don't fire the launch codes, to build up a real tradition of not taking unilateralist action - <em>sitting around and not pressing buttons</em>. Several users have suggested to me fun, gamified ways of changing the event (e.g. versions where users are encouraged to trick other users into thinking you can trust them but then nuke the site), but overall in ways that I think decreased the stakes and common knowledge effects, which is why I don't feel too excited about them.</p>",

The agent is maximizing across the first channel, but &quot;ignoring&quot; the second channel; that is why we have to solve for a fixed point to find Nash equilibria. This motivates the notion of &quot;stop gradient&quot;: if we think in terms of neural-network type learning, we&apos;re sending the gradient through the first argument but not the second. (It&apos;s a kind of mathematically weird thing to do!)</p><h2>Myopia</h2><p>Thinking in terms of iterated games, we can also justify the label &quot;myopia&quot;. Thinking in terms of &quot;gradients&quot; suggests that we&apos;re doing some kind of training involving repeatedly playing the game. But we&apos;re training an agent to play <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dKAJqBDZRMMsaaYo5/in-logical-time-all-games-are-iterated-games\">as if it&apos;s a single-shot game</a>: the gradient is rewarding behavior which gets more reward within the single round even if it compromises long-run reward. This is a weird thing to do: why implement a training regime to produce strategies like that, if we believe the nash-equilibrium model, IE we think the other players will know our mixed strategy and react to it? We can, for example, win chicken by going straight more often than is myopically rational. Generally speaking, we expect to get better rewards in the rounds after training if we optimized for non-myopic strategies during training.</p><h2>Directionality</h2><p>To justify my term &quot;directionality&quot; for these phenomena, we have to look at a different example: the idea that &quot;when beliefs and reality don&apos;t match, we change our beliefs&quot;. IE: when optimizing for truth, we optimize &quot;only in one direction&quot;. How is this possible? We can write down a loss function, such as Bayes&apos; loss, to define accuracy of belief. But how can we optimize it only &quot;in one direction&quot;?</p><p>We can see that this is the same thing as myopia. When training predictors, we only consider the efficacy of hypotheses one instance at a time.

As a result, RL  can coordinate with itself across time, whereas supervised learning cannot.</p><p>Keep in mind that this is a good thing: the algorithm may be &quot;leaving money on the table&quot; in terms of prediction accuracy, but this is exactly what we want. We&apos;re trying to make the map match the territory, not the other way around.</p><p><em><strong>Important side-note:</strong> this argument obviously has some relation to the question of how we should think about <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J/the-inner-alignment-problem\">inner optimizers</a> and how likely we should expect them to be. However, I think it is not a direct argument against inner optimizers. (1) The emergence of an inner optimizer is exactly the sort of situation where the gradients end up all feeding through one coherent structure. Other potential neural structures cannot compete with the sub-agent, because it has started to intelligently optimize; few interlopers can take advantage of the benefits of the inner optimizer&apos;s strategy, because they don&apos;t know enough to do so. So, all gradients point to continuing the improvement of the inner optimizer rather than alternate more-myopic strategies. (2) Being an inner optimizer is non synonymous with non-myopic behavior. An inner optimizer could give myopic responses on the training set while internally having less-myopic values. Or, an inner optimizer could have myopic but very divergent values. Importantly, an inner optimizer need not take advantage of any data-manipulation of the training set like that I&apos;ve described; it need not even have access to any such opportunities.</em></p><h1>The Partial Agency Paradox</h1><p>I&apos;ve given a couple of examples. I want to quickly give some more to flesh out the clusters as I see them:</p><ul><li>As I said, myopia is &quot;partial agency&quot; whereas foresight is &quot;full agency&quot;. Think of how an agent with high time-preference (ie steep temporal discounting) can be money-pumped by an agent with low time-preference. But the limit of no-temporal-discounting-at-all is not always well-defined.</li><li>An updatefull agent is &quot;partial agency&quot; whereas updatelessness is &quot;full agency&quot;: the updateful agent is failing to use some channels of influence to get what it wants, because it already knows those things and can&apos;t imagine them going differently. Again, though, full agency seems to be an idealization we can&apos;t quite reach: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9sYzoRnmqmxZm4Whf/conceptual-problems-with-udt-and-policy-selection\">we don&apos;t know how to think about updatelessness in the context of logical uncertainty</a>, only more- or less- updatefull strategies.</li><li>I gave the beliefs<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\leftarrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2190;</span></span></span></span></span></span>territory example. We can also think about the values<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\rightarrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2192;</span></span></span></span></span></span>territory case: when the world differs from our preferences, we change the world, not our preferences. This has to do with avoiding wireheading.</li><li>Similarly, we can think of examples of corrigibility -- such as respecting an off button, or avoiding manipulating the humans -- as partial agency.</li><li>Causal decision theory is more &quot;partial&quot; and evidential decision theory is less so: EDT wants to recognize more things as legitimate channels of influence, while CDT claims they&apos;re not. Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09980\">the math of causal intervention is closely related to the math which tells us about whether an agent wants to manipulate a certain variable</a> -- so there&apos;s a close relationship between CDT-vs-EDT and wireheading/corrigibility.</li></ul><p>I think people often take a pro- or anti- partial agency position: if you are trying to one-box in Newcomblike problems, trying to cooperate in prisoner&apos;s dilemma, trying to define logical updatelessness, trying for superrationality in arbitrary games,  etc... you are generally trying to remove barriers to full agency. On the other hand, if you&apos;re trying to avert instrumental incentives, make sure an agent allows you to change its values, or doesn&apos;t prevent you from pressing an off button, or doesn&apos;t manipulate human values, etc... you&apos;re generally trying to add barriers to full agency.</p><p>I&apos;ve historically been more interested in dropping barriers to full agency. I think this is partially because I tend to assume that full agency is what to expect in the long run, IE, &quot;all agents want to be full agents&quot; -- evolutionarily, philosophically, etc. Full agency should result from instrumental convergence. Attempts to engineer partial agency for specific purposes feel like fighting against this immense pressure toward full agency; I tend to assume they&apos;ll fail. As a result, I tend to think about AI alignment research as (1) needing to understand full agency much better, (2) needing to mainly think in terms of aligning full agency, rather than averting risks through partial agency.</p><p>However, in contrast to this historical view of mine, I want to make a few observations:</p><ul><li>Partial agency sometimes seems like <em>exactly what we want, </em>as in the case of map<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\leftarrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2190;</span></span></span></span></span></span>territory optimization, rather than a crude hack which artificially limits things.</li><li>Indeed, partial agency of this kind seems <em>fundamental to full agency. </em></li><li>Partial agency seems <em>ubiquitous in nature</em>. Why should I treat full agency as the default?</li></ul><p>So, let&apos;s set aside pro/con positions for a while. What I&apos;m interested in at the moment is <em><strong>the descriptive study of partial agency as a phenomenon. </strong></em>I think this is an organizing phenomenon behind a lot of stuff I think about.</p><p><strong>The partial agency paradox</strong> is: why do we see partial agency naturally arising in certain contexts? Why are agents (so often) myopic? Why have a notion of &quot;truth&quot; which is about map<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\leftarrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2190;</span></span></span></span></span></span>territory fit but not the other way around?  Partial agency is a weird thing. I understand what it means to optimize something. I understand how a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZDZmopKquzHYPRNxq/selection-vs-control\">selection process</a> can arise in the world (evolution, markets, machine learning, etc), which drives things toward maximization of some function. Partial optimization is a comparatively weird thing. Even if we can set up a &quot;partial selection process&quot; which incentivises maximization through only some channels, wouldn&apos;t it be blind to the side-channels, and so unable to enforce partiality in the long-term? Can&apos;t someone always come along and do better via full agency, no matter how our incentives are set up?</p><p>Of course, I&apos;ve already said enough to suggest a resolution to this puzzle.</p><p><strong>My tentative resolution to the paradox</strong> is: you don&apos;t build &quot;partial optimizers&quot; by taking a full optimizer and trying to add carefully balanced incentives to create indifference about optimizing through a specific channel, or anything like that. (Indifference at the level of the selection process does not lead to indifference at the level of the agents evolved by that selection process.) Rather, <em>partial agency is what selection processes incentivize by default</em>. If there&apos;s a learning-theoretic setup which incentivizes the development of &quot;full agency&quot; (whatever that even means, really!) I don&apos;t know what it is yet.</p><p>Why? </p><p>Learning is basically episodic. In order to learn, you (sort of) need to do the same thing over and over, and get feedback. Reinforcement learning tends to assume <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_process\">ergodic</a> environments so that, no matter how badly the agent messes up, it eventually re-enters the same state so it can try again -- this is a &quot;soft&quot; episode boundary. Similarly, RL tends to require temporal discounting -- this also creates a soft episode boundary, because things far enough in the future matter so little that they can be thought of as &quot;a different episode&quot;.</p><p>So, like map<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\leftarrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2190;</span></span></span></span></span></span>territory learning (that is, epistemic learning), we can kind of expect any type of learning to be myopic to some extent.</p><p>This fits the picture where full agency is an idealization which doesn&apos;t really make sense on close examination, and partial agency is the more real phenomenon. However, this is absolutely not a conjecture on my part that all learning algorithms produce partial agents of some kind rather than full agents. There may still be frameworks which allow us to approach full agency in the limit, such as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S3W4Xrmp6AL7nxRHd/formalising-decision-theory-is-hard#H45aYhMFED4Byr72m\">taking the limit of diminishing discount factors</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S3W4Xrmp6AL7nxRHd/formalising-decision-theory-is-hard#X7R4rxHpkEKycJvSb\">considering asymptotic behavior of agents who are able to make precommitments</a>. We may be able to achieve some aspects of full agency, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S3W4Xrmp6AL7nxRHd/formalising-decision-theory-is-hard#3yw2udyFfvnRC8Btr\">such as superrationality in games</a>, without others.</p><p>Again, though, my interest here is more to understand what&apos;s going on. The point is that it&apos;s actually really easy to set up incentives for partial agency, and not so easy to set up incentives for full agency. So it makes sense that the world is full of partial agency.</p><p> Some questions:</p><ul><li>To what extent is it really true that settings such as supervised learning disincentivize strategic manipulation of the data? Can my argument be formalized?</li><li>If thinking about &quot;optimizing a function&quot; is too coarse-grained (a supervised learner doesn&apos;t exactly minimize prediction error, for example), what&apos;s the best way to revise our concepts so that partial agency becomes obvious rather than counterintuitive?</li><li>Are there better ways of characterizing the partiality of partial agents? Does myopia cover all cases (so that we can understand things in terms of time-preference), or do we need the more structured stop-gradient formulation in general? Or perhaps a more causal-diagram-ish notion, as my &quot;directionality&quot; intuition suggests? Do the different ways of viewing things have nice relationships to each other?</li><li>Should we view partial agents as multiagent systems? I&apos;ve characterized it in terms of something resembling game-theoretic equilibrium. The &apos;partial&apos; optimization of a function arises from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_anarchy\">price of anarchy</a>, or as it&apos;s known around lesswrong, Moloch. Are partial agents really bags of full agents keeping each other down? This seems a little true, to me, but also doesn&apos;t strike me as the most useful way of thinking about partial agents. For one thing, it takes full agents as a necessary concept to build up partial agents, which seems wrong to me.</li><li>What&apos;s the relationship between the selection process (learning process, market, ...) and the type of partial agents incentivised by it? If we think in terms of myopia: given a type of myopia, can we design a training procedure which tracks or doesn&apos;t track the relevant strategic influences? If we think in terms of stop-gradients: we can take &quot;stop-gradient&quot; literally and stop there, but I suspect there is more to be said about designing training procedures which disincentivize the strategic use of specified paths of influence. If we think in terms of directionality: how do we get from the abstract &quot;change the map to match the territory&quot; to the concrete details of supervised learning?</li><li>What does partial agency say about inner optimizers, if anything?</li><li>What does partial agency say about corrigibility? My hope is that there&apos;s a version of corrigibility which is a perfect fit in the same way that map<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\leftarrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2190;</span></span></span></span></span></span>territory optimization seems like a perfect fit. </li></ul><br><p>Ultimately, the concept of &quot;partial agency&quot; is probably confused. The partial/full clustering is very crude. For example, it doesn&apos;t make sense to think of a non-wireheading agent as &quot;partial&quot; because of its refusal to wirehead. And it might be odd to consider a myopic agent as &quot;partial&quot; -- it&apos;s just a time-preference, nothing special. However, I do think I&apos;m pointing at a phenomenon here, which I&apos;d like to understand better.</p>",

The standard deduction in the US is currently $12k, which means\nif you were to donate $10k/year it effectively wouldn't be tax\ndeductible. [1]\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe standard EA suggestion here is <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/bunching\">Donation Bunching</a>: instead\nof donating $10k every year donate $20k half the years and $0 the\nother half.  In the years where you donate you itemize your\ndeductions, in the others you take the standard deduction.  Considered\nover two years, $8k of the $20k (40%) is deductible.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBut we could do better than that!  You can deduct up to 60% of your\nincome if you're donating cash, so you could have five years of\ndonating $0 and one year of donating $60k.  Considered over six years,\n$48k of the $60k (80%) is deductible. [2]\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis sounds great, right?  Money donated to effective charities does\nmuch more good than money collected by the government, and with a bit\nof planning you can effectively move 80% of your donations to being\npre-tax.  But I don't think it's a good idea!\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOver time people change, and a very common way people change as they\nget older is to turn inward.  You start out as a bright-eyed idealist,\nenthusiastic about making the world a better place and willing to make\nsacrifices for what you believe in.  Then you burn out working too\nmany hours doing something that doesn't feel as effective as you\nthought it would be, or you start feeling a pull to have kids and\nfocus your efforts there, or you just stop feeling so motivated by\naltruism, or dozens of other things, and after a few years the idea of\ngiving your money to people who need it more still sounds nice but\nisn't a priority anymore.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhile we don't have good data on the rate at which this happens, in a\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mZWFEFpyDs3R6hD3r/empirical-data-on-value-drift\">small\nsample</a> about half of people in the effective altruism movement in\n2013 were no longer involved five years later.  If you think your\ncurrent self is correct to be altruistic and don't want to leave\ndonations up to a likely less-generous future person then bunching\ndonations over several years is harmful: the substantial possibility\nthat you don't actually donate outweighs the tax savings. [3]\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(Thanks to someone I talked to at the <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/19/boston-meetup-this-friday/\">SSC\nBoston Meetup</a> for asking me the question that got me thinking\nabout this.)\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n[1] Specifically, unless you had other reasons to itemize your\ntax deductions, you would do better to take the $12k standard\ndeduction.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n[2] This ignores inflation and investment income, but they aren't\nlarge enough to change the picture much over a ~6 year window.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n[3] Depending on your views on discount rates (\"how much better is it\nto give this year than next?\") it might also not be so good.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100113036306172\">facebook</a></i></p>",

Real socialism had sucked all the joy out of that one.</p> <p>The only one that I do observe is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident#Incident\">Petrov Day</a>. Not that I do anything special. I don't even take a day off from work. I just take few minutes to contemplate.</p> <p>But now I am thinking that maybe, on this festive occasion, I should do a little bit more, maybe something that's public, something that has at least a slight feeling of a ceremony.</p> <p>And given that while browsing the newspapers today I haven't found a single mention of the event, no op-eds, no commemorative articles, no historical analysis, I decided to write a witness report of my own, no matter how petty and unimportant it may be.</p> <p>On September 26th, 1983 I was ten years old. I was attending 4th grade of the Czech school by Czechoslovak embassy in London. The authorities didn't want socialist kids to mingle with capitalist kids, so we weren't allowed to attend local schools. (There were sporadic, unsuccessfull, attempts to mix the kids from different socialist countries though.) The school resided in a family house in Hampstead and there were approximately forty kids attending. I don't remember that particular day, but given that it was in autumn and that it was in London, I assume it was raining. It was Monday. We used to live close to the school, several Czechoslovak families close to each other and so, same as every morning, one of the mothers walked us to the school. Kids that lived further away were driven in by a minibus. There were four grades in the school, two teachers and two classrooms. Kindergarten was in a separate room near the entrance. Me and my friend, we once did a puppet show for the kindergarteners. We had only one puppet (a chicken) and so I have no idea what the other one of us was doing. The memories have faded in the meantime. There was a narrow room with no windows in the basement that served as a library. My favourite book was about cars: A hand-illustrated compendium of models from the very beginning of automobilism up to the seventies. One of the cars was called Zaporozhets which was a bit puzzling and mysterious because it sounded like it should have horns. The room was also used for more nefarious purposes, when the boys were all too interested in what's under girls' skirts and the girls were not unwilling to give them a peek. In the afternoon, back at home, we used to play with Lego and my new chemistry set. Mostly mixing all chemicals together and obtaining a boring greyish liquid. We even had an experimental vegetable garden where we successfully grew carrots 2&#160;cm in length. Me and my sister, we used to sleep in a bunk bed. When she got angry she used to hit me with a book called &quot;Fish and Fishing&quot;. I was older and had longer hands though, so I was able to keep her at a safe distance.</p> <p>And yes, we did our homework because we thought the next day was coming. We had no idea that we were almost burned alive that day.</p> ",

There are very many of these, of many different kinds; but I shall discuss only the ones we most need to be warned against—the ones that do most to disturb the clearness of the intellect.</p><p><strong>54.</strong> A man will become attached to one particular science and field of investigation either because •he thinks he was its author and inventor or because •he has worked hard on it and become habituated to it. But when someone of this kind turns to <em>general</em> topics in philosophy ·and science· he wrecks them by bringing in distortions from his former fancies. This is especially visible in Aristotle, who made his natural science a mere bond-servant to his logic, rendering it contentious and nearly useless. The chemists have taken a few experiments with a furnace and made a fantastic science out of it, one that applies to hardly anything. . . .</p><p>[In this work ‘chemists’ are alchemists. Nothing that we would recognize as chemistry existed.]</p><p>[[We might see Bacon here as claiming that \"seeing everything as a nail\" can be very harmful.]]</p><p><strong>55.</strong> When it comes to philosophy and the sciences, minds differ from one another in one principal and fairly radical way: some minds have more liking for and skill in •noting differences amongst things, others are adapted rather to •noting things’ resemblances. The •steady and acute mind can concentrate its thought, fixing on and sticking to the subtlest distinctions; the •lofty and discursive mind recognizes and puts together the thinnest and most general resemblances. But each kind easily goes too far: one by •grasping for ·unimportant· differences between things, the other by •snatching at shadows.</p><p><strong>56.</strong> Some minds are given to an extreme admiration of antiquity, others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty. Not many have the temperament to steer a middle course, not pulling down sound work by the ancients and not despising good contributions by the moderns. The sciences and philosophy have suffered greatly from this, because these attitudes to antiquity and modernity are not <em>judgments</em> but mere <em>enthusiasms</em>. Truth is to be sought not in •what people like or enjoy in this or that age, but in •the light of nature and experience. The •former is variable, the •latter is eternal. So we should reject these enthusiasms, and take care that our intellect isn’t dragged into them.</p><p><strong>57.</strong> When you think ·hard and long and uninterruptedly· about nature and about bodies in their simplicity—·i.e. think of topics like <em>matter as such</em>·—your intellect will be broken up and will fall to pieces. When on the other hand you think ·in the same way· about nature and bodies in all their complexity of structure, your intellect will be stunned and scattered. The difference between the two is best seen by comparing the school of Leucippus and Democritus with other philosophies. For the members of that school were so busy with the ·general theory of· particles that they hardly attended to the structure, while the others were so lost in admiration of the structure that they didn’t get through to the simplicity of nature. What we should do, therefore, is alternate between these two kinds of thinking, so that the intellect can become <em>both</em> penetrating <em>and</em> comprehensive, avoiding the disadvantages that I have mentioned, and the idols they lead to.</p><p><strong>58.</strong> Let that kind of procedure be our prudent way of keeping off and dislodging the idols of the cave, which mostly come from</p><ul><li>intellectual· favouritism (<strong>54</strong>),</li><li>an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish (<strong>55</strong>),</li><li>partiality for particular historical periods (<strong>56</strong>), or</li><li>the largeness or smallness of the objects contemplated (<strong>57</strong>).</li></ul><p>Let every student of nature take this as a general rule for helping him to keep his intellect balanced and clear: when your mind seizes on and lingers on something with special satisfaction, treat it with suspicion!</p><p><strong>59.</strong> The idols of the market place are the most troublesome of all—idols that have crept into the intellect out of the contract concerning words and names [Latin <em>verborum et nominum</em>, which could mean ‘verbs and nouns’; on the contract, see <strong>43</strong>]. Men think that their reason governs words; but it is also true that words have a power of their own that reacts back onto the intellect; and this has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistical and idle. Because words are usually adapted to the abilities of the vulgar, they follow the lines of division that are most obvious to the vulgar intellect. When a language-drawn line is one that a sharper thinker or more careful observer would want to relocate so that it suited the true divisions of nature, words stand in the way of the change. That’s why it happens that when learned men engage in high and formal discussions they often end up arguing about words and names, using definitions to sort them out—thus •ending where, according to mathematical wisdom and mathematical practice, it would have been better to •start! But when it comes to dealing with natural and material things, definitions can’t cure this trouble, because the definitions themselves consist of words, and those words beget others. So one has to have recourse to individual instances. . . .</p><p>[[Bacon grokked that misuses of words were a great cause of confusion. He probably would have like the<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb\"> A Human's Guide to Words Sequence</a>. See<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d5NyJ2Lf6N22AD9PB/where-to-draw-the-boundary\"> Where to Draw the Boundary?</a> and<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb/p/FaJaCgqBKphrDzDSj\"> 37 Ways That Words Can Be Wrong</a>.]]</p><p><strong>60.</strong> The idols that words impose on the intellect are of two kinds. (1) There are names of things that don’t exist. Just as there are things with no names (because they haven’t been observed), so also there are names with no things to which they refer—these being upshots of fantastic ·theoretical· suppositions. Examples of names that owe their origin to false and idle theories are ‘fortune’, ‘prime mover’, ‘planetary orbits’, and ‘element of fire’. This class of idols is fairly easily expelled, because you can wipe them out by steadily rejecting and dismissing as obsolete all the theories ·that beget them·.</p><p>[[See<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i2dfY65JciebF3CAo/empty-labels\"> Empty Labels</a>.]]</p><p>(2) Then there are names which, though they refer to things that do exist, are confused and ill-defined, having been rashly and incompetently derived from realities. Troubles of this kind, coming from defective and clumsy abstraction, are intricate and deeply rooted. Take the word ‘wet’, for example. If we look to see how far the various things that are called ‘wet’ resemble one other, we’ll find that ‘wet’ is nothing but than a mark loosely and confusedly used to label a variety of states of affairs that can’t be unified through any constant meaning. For something may be called ‘wet’ because it</p><ul><li>easily spreads itself around any other body,</li><li>has no boundaries and can’t be made to stand still,</li><li>readily yields in every direction.</li><li>easily divides and scatters itself,</li><li>easily unites and collects itself,</li><li>readily flows and is put in motion,</li><li>readily clings to another body and soaks it,</li><li>is easily reduced to a liquid, or (if it is solid) easily melts.</li></ul><p>Accordingly, when you come to apply the word, if you take it in one sense, flame is wet; if in another, air is not wet; if in another, fine dust is wet; if in another, glass is wet. So that it is easy to see that the notion has been taken by abstraction only from water and common and ordinary liquids, without proper precautions.</p><p>Words may differ in <em>how</em> distorted and wrong they are. One of the •least faulty kinds is that of names of substances, especially names that</p><ul><li>are names of lowest species, ·i.e. species that don’t divide into sub-species·, and</li><li>have been <em>well</em> drawn ·from the substances that they are names of·.</li></ul><p>·The drawing of substance-names and -notions from the substances themselves <em>can</em> be done well or badly. For example·, our notions of chalk and of mud are good, our notion of earth bad. •More faulty are names of events: ‘generate’, ‘corrupt’, ‘alter’. •The most faulty are names of qualities: ‘heavy’, ‘light’, ‘rare’, ‘dense’, and the like. (I exclude from this condemnation names of qualities that are immediate objects of the senses.) Yet in each of these categories, inevitably some notions are a little better than others because more examples of them come within range of the human senses.</p><p><strong>61.</strong> The idols of the theatre ·which will be my topic until the end of <strong>68</strong>· are not innate, and they don’t steal surreptitiously into the intellect. Coming from the fanciful stories told by philosophical theories and from upside-down perverted rules of demonstration, they are openly proclaimed and openly accepted. Things I have already said imply that there can be no question of <em>refuting</em> these idols: where there is no agreement on premises or on rules of demonstration, there is no place for argument.</p><p>·AN ASIDE ON THE HONOUR OF THE ANCIENTS·</p><p>This at least has the advantage that it leaves the honour of the ancients untouched ·because I shall not be <em>arguing against</em> them. I shall be <em>opposing</em> them, but· there will be no disparagement of them in this, because the question at issue between them and me concerns only <em>the way</em>. As the saying goes: a lame man on the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one. Indeed, it is obvious that a man on the wrong road goes further astray the faster he runs. ·You might think that in claiming to be able to do better in the sciences than they did, I must in some way be setting myself up as brighter than they are; but it is not so·. The course I propose for discovery in the sciences leaves little to the acuteness and strength of intelligence, but puts all intelligences nearly on a level. My plan is exactly like the drawing of a straight line or a perfect circle: to do it free-hand you need a hand that is steady and practised, but if you use a ruler or a compass you will need little if anything else; and my method is just like that.</p><p>·END OF ASIDE·</p><p>But though particular counter-arguments would be useless, I should say something about •the classification of the sects whose theories produce these idols, about •the external signs that there is something wrong with them, and lastly •about the causes of this unhappy situation, this lasting and general agreement in error. My hope is that this will make the truth more accessible, and make the human intellect more willing to be cleansed and to dismiss its idols.</p><p><strong>62.</strong> There are many idols of the theatre, or idols of theories, and there can be and perhaps will be many more. For a long time now two factors have militated against the formation of new theories ·in philosophy and science·.</p><ul><li>Men’s minds have been busied with religion and theology.</li><li>Civil governments, especially monarchies, have been hostile to anything new, even in theoretical matters; so that men have done that sort of work at their own peril and at great financial cost to themselves—not only unrewarded but exposed to contempt and envy.</li></ul><p>If it weren’t for those two factors, there would no doubt have arisen many other philosophical sects like those that once flourished in such variety among the Greeks. Just as many hypotheses can be constructed regarding the phenomena of the heavens, so also—and even more!—a variety of dogmas about the phenomena of philosophy may be set up and dug in. And something we already know about plays that poets put on the stage is also true of stories presented on the philosophical stage—namely that fictions invented for the stage are more compact and elegant and generally liked than true stories out of history!</p><p>What has gone wrong in philosophy is that it has attended in great detail to a few things, or skimpily to a great many things; either way, it is based on too narrow a foundation of experiment and natural history, and decides on the authority of too few cases. <strong>(1)</strong>Philosophers of the reasoning school snatch up from experience a variety of common kinds of event, without making sure they are getting them right and without carefully examining and weighing them; and then they let meditation and brain-work do all the rest. <strong>(2)</strong> Another class of philosophers have carefully and accurately studied a few experiments, and have then boldly drawn whole philosophies from <em>them</em>, making all other facts fit in by wildly contorting them. <strong>(3)</strong> Yet a third class consists of those who are led by their faith and veneration to mix their philosophy with theology and stuff handed down across the centuries. Some of these have been so foolish and empty-headed as to have wandered off looking for knowledge among spirits and ghosts. So there are the triplets born of error and false philosophy: philosophies that are <strong>(1)</strong> sophistical, <strong>(2)</strong> empirical, and <strong>(3)</strong> superstitious.</p><p>[To explain Bacon’s second accusation against Aristotle in <strong>63</strong>: A word ‘of the second intention’ is a word that applies to items of thought or of language (whereas things that are out there in the world independently of us are referred to by words ‘of the first intention’). Now Aristotle in his prime held that the soul is not <em>a substance</em> but rather <em>a form</em>: rather than being an independently existing thing that is somehow combined with the rest of what makes up the man, the soul is a set of facts about how the man acts, moves, responds, and so on. Bacon has little respect for the term ‘form’: in <strong>15</strong> he includes it among terms that are ‘fantastical and ill-defined’, and in <strong>51</strong> he says that ‘forms are fabrications of the human mind’. This disrespect seems to underlie the second accusation; the class of <em>forms</em> is not a class of independently existing <em>things</em> but rather a class of muddy and unfounded <em>ways of thinking and talking</em>, so that ‘form’ is a word of the second intention.]</p><p><strong>63.</strong> The most conspicuous example of <strong>(1)</strong> the first class was Aristotle, whose argumentative methods spoiled natural philosophy. He</p><ul><li>made the world out of categories;</li><li>put the human soul, the noblest of substances, into a class based on words of the second intention;</li><li>handled the issues about density and rarity (which have to do with how much space a body takes up) in terms of the feeble distinction between what does happen and what could happen;</li><li>said that each individual body has one proper motion, and that if it moves in any other way this must be the result of an external cause,</li></ul><p>and imposed countless other arbitrary restrictions on the nature of things. He was always less concerned about the inner truth of things than he was about providing answers to questions—<em>saying</em> something definite. This shows up best when his philosophy is compared with other systems that were famous among the Greeks. For</p><ul><li>the homogeneous substances of Anaxagoras,</li><li>the atoms of Leucippus and Democritus,</li><li>the heaven and earth of Parmenides,</li><li>the strife and friendship of Empedocles, and</li><li>Heraclitus’s doctrine of bodies’ being reduced to the perfectly homogeneous condition of fire and then remolded into solids,</li></ul><p>all have a touch of natural philosophy about them—a tang of the nature of things and experience and bodies. Whereas in Aristotle’s physics you hear hardly anything but the sounds of logical argument—involving logical ideas that he reworked, in a realist rather than a nominalist manner, under the imposing name of ‘metaphysics’. Don’t be swayed by his frequent mentions of experiments in his <em>On Animals</em>, his <em>Problems</em>, and others of his treatises. For he didn’t consult experience, as he should have done, <em>on the way to</em> his decisions and first principles; rather, he first <em>decided</em> what his position would be, and <em>then</em>brought in experience, twisting it to fit his views and making it captive. So on this count Aristotle is even more to blame than his modern followers, the scholastics, who have abandoned experience altogether.</p><p><strong>64.</strong> The <strong>(2)</strong> empirical school of philosophy gives birth to dogmas that are more deformed and monstrous than those of the sophistical or reasoning school. The latter has as its basis the •light of vulgar notions; it’s a faint and superficial light, but it is in a way •universal, and applies to many things. In contrast with that, the empirical school has its foundation in the •narrowness and •darkness of a few experiments. Those who busy themselves with these experiments, and have infected their imagination with them, find such a philosophy to be probable and all but certain; everyone else finds them flimsy and incredible. A notable example of this ·foolishness· is provided by the alchemists and their dogmas; these days there isn’t much of it anywhere else, except perhaps in the philosophy of Gilbert. Still, I should offer a warning relating to philosophies of this kind. If my advice ever rouses men to take experiments seriously and to bid farewell to sophistical doctrines, then I’m afraid that they may—I foresee that they <em>will</em>—be in too much of a hurry, will leap or fly ·from experiments straight· to generalizations and principles of things, risking falling into just the kind of philosophy I have been talking about. We ought to prepare ourselves against this evil now, ·well in advance·.</p><p><strong>65.</strong> The corruption of philosophy by <strong>(3)</strong> superstition and input from theology is far more widespread, and does the greatest harm, whether to entire systems or to parts of them. ·Systems thus afflicted are just nonsense judged by ordinary vulgar standards, but that doesn’t protect men from accepting them, because· the human intellect is open to influence from the imagination as much as from vulgar notions, ·and in these philosophies it is the imagination that wields the power·. Whereas the contentious and sophistical kind of philosophy combatively <em>traps</em> the intellect, this ·superstitious· kind, being imaginative and high-flown and half-poetic, <em>coaxes</em> it along. For men—especially intelligent and high-minded ones—have intellectual ambitions as well as ambition of the will.</p><p>A striking example of this sort of thing among the Greeks is provided by Pythagoras, though ·his form of it wasn’t so dangerous, because· the superstition that he brought into it was coarser and more cumbrous ·than many·. Another example is provided by Plato and his school, whose superstition is subtler and more dangerous. Superstition turns up also in parts of other philosophies, when they</p><ul><li>introduce abstract forms—·i.e. forms that aren’t the forms <em>of</em> anything·,</li></ul><p>and when they do things like</p><ul><li>speaking of ‘first causes’ and ‘final causes’ and usually omitting <em>middle</em> causes.</li></ul><p>[Bacon’s point is: They discuss the first cause of the whole universe, and the end or purpose for which something happens (its ‘final cause’), but they mostly ignore ordinary <em>causes</em> such as spark’s causing a fire. Putting this in terms of first-middle-final seems to be a quiet joke].</p><p>We should be <em>extremely</em> cautious about this. There’s nothing worse than the <em>deification</em> of error, and it is a downright plague of the intellect when empty nonsense is treated with veneration. Yet some of the moderns have been so tolerant of this emptiness that they have—what a shallow performance!—tried to base a system of natural philosophy on the first chapter of Genesis, on the book of Job, and other parts of the sacred writings, ‘seeking the living among the dead’ [Luke 24:5]. This makes it more important than ever to keep down this ·kind of philosophy·, because this unhealthy mixture of human and divine gives rise not only to •fantastic philosophy but also to •heretical religion. It is very proper that we soberly give our faith only to things that <em>are</em> the faith.</p><p><strong>66.</strong> So much for the mischievous authority of systems founded on •vulgar notions, on •a few experiments, or on •superstition. I should say something about bad choices of what to think <em>about</em>, especially in natural philosophy. In the mechanical arts the main way in which bodies are altered is by composition or separation; the human intellect sees this and is infected by it, thinking that something like it produces all alteration in the universe. This gave rise to •the fiction of <em>elements</em> and of their coming together to form natural bodies. Another example: When a man surveys nature working freely, he encounters different species of things—of animals, of plants, of minerals—and that leads him smoothly on to the opinion that nature contains certain <em>primary forms</em> which nature intends to work with, and that all other variety comes from •nature’s being blocked and side-tracked in her work, or from •conflicts between different species—conflicts in which one species turns into another. To the first of these theories we owe ·such intellectual rubbish as· <em>first qualities of the elements</em>; to the second we owe <em>occult properties</em> and <em>specific virtues</em>. Both of them are empty short-cuts, ways for the mind to come to rest and not be bothered with more solid pursuits. The medical researchers have achieved more through their work on the second qualities of matter, and the operations of attracting, repelling, thinning, thickening, expanding, contracting, scattering, ripening and the like; and they would have made much greater progress still if *it weren’t for a disaster that occurred. The two short-cuts that I have mentioned (elementary qualities and specific virtues) snared the medical researchers, and spoiled what they did with their correct observations in their own field.</p><p>[The passage flagged by asterisks expands what Bacon wrote, in ways that the small-dots system can’t easily indicate.]</p><p>It led them either •to treating second qualities as coming from highly complex and subtle mixture of first or elementary qualities, or •to breaking off their empirical work prematurely, not following up their observations of second qualities with greater and more diligent observations of third and fourth qualities.* ·This is a bigger disaster than you might think, because· something like—I don’t say <em>exactly</em> like—the powers involved in the self-healing of the human body should be looked for also in the changes of all other bodies.</p><p>But something much worse than that went wrong in their work: they focused on</p><ul><li>the principles governing things at rest, not on •the principles of change; i.e. on</li><li>what things are produced <em>from</em>, not •<em>how</em> they are produced; i.e. on</li><li>topics that they could talk about, not •ones that would lead to results.</li></ul><p>The vulgar classification of ·kinds of· motion that we find in the accepted system of natural philosophy is no good—I mean the classification into</p><ul><li>generation,</li><li>corruption,</li><li>growth,</li><li>diminution,</li><li>alteration, and</li><li>motion.</li></ul><p>Here is what they mean. If a body is moved from one place to another without changing in any other way, this is •motion; if a body changes qualitatively while continuing to belong to the same species and not changing its place, this is •alteration; if a change occurs through which the mass and quantity of the body don’t remain the same, this is •growth or •diminution; if a body is changed so much that it changes substantially and comes to belong to a different species, this is •generation or •corruption. But all this is merely layman’s stuff, which doesn’t go at all deeply into nature; for these are only <em>measures</em> of motion. . . .and not <em>kinds</em> of motion. They [= the notions involved in the classification into generation, corruption etc.] signify that the motion went this way or that, but not <em>how</em> it happened or what <em>caused</em> it. They tell us nothing about the appetites of bodies [= ‘what bodies are naturally disposed to do’] or about what their parts are up to. They come into play only when the motion in question makes the thing grossly and obviously different from how it was. Even when ·scientists who rely on the above classificatory system· do want to indicate something concerning the <em>causes</em> of motion, and to classify motions on that basis, they <em>very</em> lazily bring in the ·Aristotelian· distinction between ‘natural’ motion and ‘violent’ motion, a distinction that comes entirely from vulgar ways of thinking. In fact, ‘violent’ motion is natural motion that is called ‘violent’ because it involves an external cause working (naturally!) in a different way from how it was working previously.</p><p>[Bacon himself sometimes describes a movement as <em>violens</em>, but this is meant quite casually and not as a concept belonging to basic physics. These innocent occurrences of <em>violens</em> will be translated as ‘forceful’.]</p><p>Let us set all this aside, and consider such observations as that bodies have an appetite for</p><blockquote>mutual contact, so that separations can’t occur that would break up the unity of nature and allow a vacuum to be made;</blockquote><p>or for</p><blockquote>resuming their natural dimensions. . . ., so that if they are compressed within or extended beyond those limits they immediately try to recover themselves and regain their previous size;</blockquote><p>or for</p><blockquote>gathering together with masses of their own kind—e.g. dense bodies ·moving· towards the earth, and light and rare bodies towards the dome of the sky.</blockquote><p>These and their like are truly <em>physical</em> kinds of motion; and comparison of them with the others that I mentioned makes clear that the others are entirely <em>logical</em> and <em>scholastic</em>.</p><p>An equally bad feature of their philosophies and their ways of thinking is that all their work goes into investigating and theorizing about the</p><ul><li>fundamental· principles of things. . . .—so they keep moving through higher and higher levels of abstraction until they come to <em>formless potential matter</em>—and</li><li>the ultimate parts of nature—so they keep cutting up nature more and more finely until they come to <em>atoms</em>, which are too small to contribute anything to human welfare—</li></ul><p>whereas everything that is useful, everything that can be worked with, lies between ·those two extremes·.</p><p><strong>67.</strong> The intellect should be warned against the intemperate way in which systems of philosophy deal with the giving or withholding of assent, because intemperance of this kind seems to establish idols and somehow prolong their life, leaving no way open to reach and dislodge them.</p><p>There are two kinds of excess: •the excess of those who are quick to come to conclusions, and make sciences dogmatic and lordly; and •the excess of those who deny that we can know anything, and so lead us into an endlessly <em>wandering</em> kind of research. The •former of these subdues the intellect, the •latter deprives it of energy. The philosophy of Aristotle ·is of the former kind·. Having destroyed all the other philosophies in argumentative battle. . . . Aristotle laid down the law about everything, and then proceeded to raise new questions of his own and to dispose of them likewise, so that everything would be certain and settled—a way of going about things that his followers still respect and practice.</p><p>The ·Old Academy·, the school of Plato, introduced acatalepsy—·the doctrine that nothing is capable of being understood·. At first it was meant as an ironical joke at the expense of the older sophists—Protagoras, Hippias, and the rest—whose greatest fear was to seem <em>not</em> to doubt something! But the New Academy made a dogma of acatalepsy, holding it as official doctrine. They did allow of some things to be followed as probable, though not to be accepted as true; and they said they didn’t ·mean to· destroy all investigation; so their attitude was better than. . . .that of Pyrrho and his sceptics. (It was also better than undue freedom in making pronouncements.) Still, once the human mind has despaired of finding truth, it becomes less interested in everything; with the result that men are side-tracked into pleasant disputations and discourses, into <em>roaming</em>, rather than severely sticking to a single course of inquiry. But, as I said at the start and continue to urge, the human senses and intellect, weak as they are, should not be •deprived of their authority but •given help.</p><p><strong>68.</strong> So much for the separate classes of idols and their trappings. We should solemnly and firmly resolve to deny and reject them all, cleansing our intellect by freeing it from them. Entering the kingdom of man, which is based on the sciences, is like entering the kingdom of heaven, which one can enter only as a little child.</p><p><em>Edited: The next post in the sequence, Book 1: 69-92 (13 Causes of Bad Science), will be posted Thursday, October 3rd at latest by 6:00pm PDT.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Previously on Prediction Markets (among others): <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/07/26/prediction-markets-when-do-they-work/\">Prediction Markets: When Do They Work?</a>, <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/08/17/subsidizing-prediction-markets/\">Subsidizing Prediction Markets</a></p>\n<p>Epistemic Status: No huge new insights, but a little fun, a little free money, also <a href=\"https://blog.jaibot.com/there-is-a-button/\">Happy Petrov Day</a>?</p>\n<p>Yesterday, with everything happening regarding impeachment, I decided to check PredictIt to find out how impactful things were. When I checked, I noticed some obvious inconsistencies. They’re slightly less bad today, but still not gone.</p>\n<p>I figured it would be fun and potentially enlightening to break this down. Before I begin, I will state that unless I messed up this post expresses <em>zero political opinions whatsoever </em>on what election or other outcomes would be good or bad, and does its best to only make what I consider <em>very safe observations </em>on probabilities of events. All comments advocating political positions or candidates will be deleted in reign-of-terror style. No exceptions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Market Analysis</h3>\n<p>Odds are represented as cost in cents for each contract that pays $1, so they double as probabilities out of 100.</p>\n<p>Let us look at the democratic nomination odds, using last. All are 1 cent wide:</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Warren 50</p>\n<p>Joe Biden                21</p>\n<p>Andrew Yang         10</p>\n<p>Bernie Sanders       8</p>\n<p>Pete Buttigieg          6</p>\n<p>Hillary Clinton        5</p>\n<p>Kamala Harris        4</p>\n<p>Tulsi Gabbard         3</p>\n<p>Amy Klobuchar       2</p>\n<p>Can be sold for 1: Corey Booker, Tom Snyder, Beto ‘o Rourke</p>\n<p>All other candidates can be bought for 1 and cannot be sold.</p>\n<p>Adding that up we get 112. We could buy all the no sides for a total of 111 – you can get these prices on no except for Warren, where you’d sell at 49.</p>\n<p>That’s certainly some free money. If you sell all of them, you don’t tie up any money, although you do have to deposit, so it’s a pretty great trade, albeit with an $850 limit.</p>\n<p>I’ve already done many of the legs of that trade. Some are better than others. Hillary Clinton at 5 is complete insanity. Andrew Yang is trading at 10 because internet. That likely covers most of the reason you can sell the field for 111. Lower them to sane numbers (let’s be super generous and say Hillary Clinton 1, and say Andrew Yang 5) then the field would add to 102. Completing the trade is mostly about freeing up your capital. You also get <em>some </em>value for it being someone not on the above list, as the ‘brokered convention causes weirdness’ scenario is definitely not impossible. The weird thing is expecting that to somehow nominate Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>The big not-automatically-insane opinion is making Warren 50% to win the nomination. That is rather bold at this stage of things, but we’re thinking about arbitrage and outright mistakes.</p>\n<p>Let’s now look at the Presidential odds. For any Democrat, this is almost identical to a two-part bet, where that person wins the nomination and then wins the general election.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump      41</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Warren 35</p>\n<p>Joe Biden                13</p>\n<p>Andrew Yang          6</p>\n<p>Bernie Sanders       6</p>\n<p>Pete Buttigieg          3</p>\n<p>Nikki Haley              2</p>\n<p>Kamala Harris         2</p>\n<p>Mike Pence               2</p>\n<p>Tulsi Gabbard          2</p>\n<p>Corey Booker           1</p>\n<p>Amy Klobuchar      1</p>\n<p>That adds up to 114. If you look at actually available prices, you could sell the field for 110. Again, pretty good idea. I’d get on that, and I mostly did.</p>\n<p>One could also point out the implied general election win percentages of democrats where rounding isn’t a big deal.</p>\n<p>Warren                  70%</p>\n<p>Biden                      62%</p>\n<p>Yang                        60%</p>\n<p>Sanders                  75%</p>\n<p>Sum of All Republican odds is 45% (Trump, Haley and Pence) out of 114%, for odds of 39.4%. Thus, Democratic victory should be about 60%. Warren is 50% to win the nomination, so that 70% number is really weird. This does not add up, and makes me reluctant to sell Warren at 50% odds in the primary.</p>\n<p>In both these cases, the free money seems real enough. You get to use your capital in both markets if you sell the whole field and then have it free for a third market as well, and you can’t really lose. Doesn’t mean it’s worth the effort, but it’s a nice thing to notice.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at Republican nomination odds:</p>\n<p>Trump                  78</p>\n<p>Haley                      7</p>\n<p>Pence                      7</p>\n<p>Kasich                     2</p>\n<p>Romney                  2</p>\n<p>Weld                        2</p>\n<p>Sanford                   2</p>\n<p>That only adds up to 98%, which makes sense, since if Trump is actually gone then anything could happen. This market seems sane on that level, perhaps even rich. What’s most interesting is that Trump is highly unlikely to not win the Republican nomination and win the presidency, so if he’s 41% to be reelected but 78% to be nominated, then Trump has a general election win rate of 52% (47% if we knock off 10% for the market being inflated by adding up to 114%). But perhaps this is reasonable? If Trump is gone it’s because something brought him down so it’s going to be super hard for anyone else to win? It’s not like much of that probability is that Trump’s health fails, given the time frame.</p>\n<p>Also noteworthy is Trump is only 20% to win <em>the popular vote,</em> although the available volume here is very low. That implies a stunning 21% chance that Trump loses the popular vote but wins the election. Put another way, given Trump is reelected, he’s still an underdog to have won the popular vote. The electoral college seems to favor Trump, but that’s a <em>huge </em>probability to put in such a narrow space, even if you assume the states all look identical to 2016. I believe that pre-election, 538 had Trump at 10% to do this, with the polls only a few percent away from that result. How do you get to 20%?</p>\n<p>You can sell “Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2020” at 12% odds. Is that a worthwhile return on capital? You could also sell Michele Obama at 8%, Cuomo at 6%, and Oprah or Mark Cuban at 5%.</p>\n<p>They have Trump at 88% to be President at the end of 2019 and 73% to complete his first term. They think he is 41% to be impeached this year and 63% to be impeached at all. Congress is expected to work fast. Have they met congress?</p>\n<p>There are a number of other similar good bets available. One gets the idea. The catch is that those all tie up capital. Also, if you take risk and win, you have to pay 10% of your net winnings and potentially taxes. Again, three cheers for arbitrage.</p>\n<p>Looking at such systems of prices, and looking for opportunity, is often good training as not only a trader or gambler but also for calibration and probability estimation in general, which are excellent skills for anyone to develop.</p>\n<h3>What Does This Say About Prediction Markets in General?</h3>\n<p>Not much we didn’t already know. PredictIt has an $850 limit on any one market, for any one candidate or other potential outcome. This does not increase if you do arbitrage. This is why pure arbitrage that frees up capital can continue. I am literally at risk for $44 in the general election market, but that does not allow me to continue to trade.</p>\n<p>Other markets in the past such as InTrade have not had this restriction. This results in less egregious versions of the same problems, as you can use bigger size to trade against the mistakes. However, there is no point in <em>fully correcting </em>a mistake, as doing so would offer minimal or no profits. If you have a market that is inefficient, and a chance to trade to make it more efficient, that’s a good trade, but at some point it isn’t worth the time and trouble and capital investment, so you stop. That point is <em>necessarily </em>before full efficiency, but in places like the stock market you can potentially get (in expectation) very close.</p>\n<p>In prediction markets, cost of capital to do trades is a major distorting factor, as are fees and taxes and other physical costs, and participants are much less certain of correct prices and much more worried about impact and how many others are in the same trade. Most everyone who is looking to correct inefficiencies will only fade <em>very large and very obvious </em>inefficiencies, given all the costs.</p>\n<p>Thus, we see the same inefficiencies pop up over and over again and not be corrected. The most well-known and universal one is that if the probability is under about 40%, the odds will likely be too high. The lower the odds below that, the more (as a percentage of the chance listed) the price will be too high. For low percentages, the people selling the contract are treating it as if it is a bond that pays interest over time, with a tiny default risk, rather than saying that the 7% chance is too high and should have been 5%. One also has to be wary of model error.</p>\n<p>In politics, it is also inevitable that anything that sounds superficially good to people on the internet but is unlikely to actually happen is almost always going to trade rich.</p>\n<p>If anything, it is remarkable <em>how little difference </em>it made to limit accounts to $850 in trading, beyond there being free cash lying around.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thought that would be fun to write up formally given I had been tricked into actually trading the markets, and maybe some of you would get to do some good trades, so I figured why not. Have fun, everyone.</p>\n<p> </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Look at the image here:</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)</a></p><p>After looking at that image, you understand the concept well enough to use it as a mental model.</p><p>Hard-won lessons &#x2014;</p><p>(1) I joke that &quot;meditation is having exactly one thing on the stack.&quot; One thing at a time on the stack might seem oppressive, but it&apos;s actually joyful. I think you more-or-less can only do one thing at a time.</p><p>(2) But okay, the stack is more full. You just popped the top item off. Now what? IME, life goes better if you go down the stack unless new information compelling obsoletes it (unless you&apos;re just messing around, in which case &quot;messing around&quot; is on the stack and you&apos;re good). When an irrelevant tangent hits in a conversation, once it concludes, go back to where you were (if it was useful). When you realize you got distracted putting the groceries away, typically you want to finish putting them away.</p><p>(3) It&apos;s entirely true that oftentimes, going down the stack is short-term worse than whatever newly catches your attention. But it trains you to both recognize tangents and navigate conversations intelligently (again, in a non-pure-social-hangout conversation - like at work or when exploring an important topic). </p><p>(4) Even more true: often <em>super sucks</em> to go back down the stack on physical task stuff after you got distracted. But! I believe &#x2014; I don&apos;t have any research, but my observation bears it out, it&apos;s a hypothesis &#x2014; I believe that consistently running down the stack after you got distracted makes you less distractible going forwards, because there&apos;s less payoff to doing so.</p><p>(5) Some people can literally &quot;run the stack&quot; in their minds. Not a metaphor. <em>Literally</em>.</p><p>(6) I couldn&apos;t do this before. Now I can.</p><p>(7) What changed is that I used to be able to comfortably juggle 5-7 items at a time without running a stack, but I recently calculated out the work I&apos;m committed to in the near future&#x2014; like, &quot;<em>almost all of this work will get done&quot; </em>&#x2014; and it&apos;s 300+ hours. Employees, administration, ops, software development, sales, finance. There&apos;s dozens of projects that stretch off into infinity going on. Suddenly, I was just running the stack all the time. I don&apos;t recommend it, but that&apos;s what happened to me.</p><p>(8) You can get better about refusing to add things to the stack.</p><p>(9) You can get better about &quot;closing the thread&quot; (popping things off the stack) before changing gears. &quot;Yeah but wait, let&apos;s talk about that, but can we calendar that thing before we move on?&quot; (can say it shorter, exaggerating for clarity)</p><p>(10) You don&apos;t need to <em>do a task</em> or <em>complete a conversation</em> to remove it from the stack. You can just delete it. But the act of explicitly doing so &#x2014; and communicating it to anyone else relevant that needs to know &#x2014; is what keeps your stack from overflowing.</p><p>And the most important lesson &#x2014;</p><p><strong>(11) When you have multiple items on the stack and &quot;start feeling ambitious and motivated&quot;, <em>COMPLETE THE ITEMS ON THE STACK RATHER THAN ADD NEW ITEMS TO THE STACK.</em></strong></p><p>The all caps there isn&apos;t shouting at you &#x2014; it&apos;s regret for lost years of my life. Alas. Bigger stack isn&apos;t better. <em>Faster throughput is better</em>. That&apos;s typically <em>less stuff on the stack at any one time</em>.</p><p>Anyway, the concept doesn&apos;t work for everyone, but a surprising number of people who are effective I know actually <em>literally</em> &quot;run a stack&quot; in their minds. It&apos;s... more common than I&apos;d thought it. Probably the mix of being on software development and having an amount of work that&apos;d be insanely overwhelming if I didn&apos;t take things one-thing-at-a-time is what generated it.</p>",

After talking to some people\nabout what they like about the original melody, and listening to some\ngroup singing recordings, here's another go.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThis version keeps the melody for sections where it's reasonably\npredictable, simplifies the melody in a few places, and substitutes a\nnew melody only where I think one is needed.  Specifically:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first melody (\"Our new world ... will not be mine\") is\nunchanged from the original.</li>\n<li>The second melody (\"A hundred years ... each new home\") no longer moves\nthe tune from D to Bbm but goes to the more natural Bm instead.  The\nmelody here is new but tries to have a similar feel as the original.</li>\n<li>The third melody (\"But I'll teach .. rockets belong\") is unchanged\nfrom the original for the first part, but swaps a repeat of the second\nline's melody for the range-busting rise on \"where our rockets belong\".</li>\n<li>The fourth melody (\"It will never ... so far away\") is new, and\nanother attempt to make something fitting in Bm to replace something\ntricky in Bbm.</li>\n<li>The fifth melody (\"But I am .. somebody will someday\") is\nunchanged from the original (I had thought it was too \nhard and recorded a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwkinZMr858\">draft version</a>\nwith it swapped to the version from yesterday, but really the only\nhard part is the first two notes (4, 3

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This the first in a sequence of posts about &#x201C;operations&#x201D;.</em></p><p><em>Acknowledgements to Malo Bourgon, Ray Arnold, Michelle Hutchinson, and Ruby for their feedback on this post. </em></p><h1>My ops background</h1><p>Several years ago, I decided to focus on operations work for my career. From 2017 to 2019 I was one of the operations staff at the <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Center for Effective Altruism</a>, initially as the operations manager and later as the the Finance Lead. Prior to that, I was a volunteer logistics lead at approximately 10 <a href=\"http://www.rationality.org\">CFAR</a> workshops; I also ran ops for <a href=\"https://sparc-camp.org/\">SPARC</a> twice, and for a five day AI-safety retreat. I also attribute some of my ops skill to my previous work as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit\">ICU nurse</a>.</p><p>I have spent a lot of time thinking about hiring and training for operations roles. In the course of hiring I have had numerous conversations about what exactly &#x201C;operations work&#x201D; refers to, and found it surprisingly hard to explain. This post, and the rest of my operations sequence, will be an attempt to lay out my current thinking on what these roles are, what they have in common, and what skills they lean on most heavily. </p><h1>Operations: not a single thing, still a useful shorthand</h1><p>Operations work, or &#x201C;ops&#x201D;, is a term <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/\">used by organizations like 80,000 Hours</a> to refer to a particular category of roles within organizations.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think that &#x201C;operations&#x201D; as used in this sense is a single coherent thing; my sense is that 80,000 Hours is gesturing at a vague cluster that doesn&#x2019;t completely <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d5NyJ2Lf6N22AD9PB/where-to-draw-the-boundary\">carve reality at the joints</a>. There isn&#x2019;t a set of defining characteristics shared between all operations-type roles, and many of the attributes described are also found in other roles. However, I do think this is a useful shorthand that points both at a set of functions that need to be filled within organizations, and the skills that are necessary to carry out these duties.</p><p>It&#x2019;s worth noting that this use of the word &#x201C;operations&#x201D; does not seem to be standard outside the EA community. In large companies, it can sometimes refer to e.g. the production side of manufacturing, or to supply chain logistics, whereas the internal admin roles are called by their individual job titles (Finance Manager, HR Manager, etc). I do think it makes more sense to carve out the &#x201C;operations&#x201D; cluster for small organizations, where the internal support work is more likely to be done by a single person or team rather than a multi-part bureaucracy. In smaller orgs, operations/admin staff often wear multiple hats since there often isn&apos;t a full-time work for a role in just finance/HR/etc. </p><h1>Operations Roles: Support, Infrastructure, and Force Multiplication</h1><p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/#operations-management-in-effective-altruism-and-catastrophic-risk-organisations\">80,000 Hours</a>: &#x201C;Operations staff enable everyone else in the organisation to focus on their core tasks and maximise their productivity.&#x201D;</p><p>My sense is that roles in the ops cluster usually fill the following functions: </p><ul><li>Maintaining the day-to-day infrastructure of an organization: there is a near-endless list of tasks and hoops to jump through to keep an org functioning, e.g., paying the bills, staying in compliance with local tax and HR laws, maintaining accurate bookkeeping, etc. </li><li>Supporting, implementing or executing externally-facing projects. This can involve setting up a spreadsheet or other workflow to track various steps and deadlines, researching the legal constraints on a project, communicating with external vendors, etc. </li><li>Acting as force multipliers for other staff: a good ops person will make it as easy as possible for the rest of an organization to interface with processes like payroll and expense reimbursement, and will set up internal systems with an eye to improving the productivity of staff. Office managers, for example, are responsible for maintaining the physical office space and helping staff with the setup they need for their work. Some roles in the ops cluster, such as personal or executive assistants, very directly involve supporting a specific person, taking on the attention cost of various logistical details (emails, scheduling, deadlines, booking travel, etc) and allowing them to spend more time in deep work. </li><li>Operations roles are usually on the generalist side; the tasks involved are extremely varied, requiring shallow knowledge across a huge range of domains, and therefore the ability to quickly pick up new knowledge and skills. They usually do not depend on a specific technical skillset or background (Though technical skills are often very helpful when trying to automate things). </li></ul><h2>The prototypical operations role in a small organization</h2><p>Ops roles can vary widely on both seniority (responsibility and autonomy, skill and experience required), and specialization. In my thinking, the most central ops role is the &#x201C;operations generalist&#x201D; or &#x201C;operations manager&#x201D; at a small organization (10-20 people). </p><ul><li>High autonomy: they are the main admin staff for the entire organization, and the buck stops with them. They are likely to know more than any other staff member about the various details of their role, and thus will need to mostly set their own deadlines and priorities, as well as plan ahead and anticipate problems. </li><li>They are involved with many, and sometimes all, of the following duties:</li><ul><li>Finances and accounting</li><li>Payroll</li><li>Paying bills</li><li>Filing</li><li>Legal compliance and writing internal policies</li><li>HR and onboarding</li><li>Responding to questions and concerns from inside and outside the org about any of the above</li><li>Admin on software systems used internally (e.g. email provider, Slack, Asana)</li><li>External communications with e.g. donors or customers</li><li>Supporting specific projects as they set up systems</li><li>Coordinating projects and people </li><li>Fundraising</li></ul><li>They are often working at an organization that is growing, and so need to set up new systems to meet changing needs. This is particularly true for someone hired as the <em>first </em>dedicated operations staff member at a very new organization e.g. an early startup, which may have few to no existing systems, with processes happening ad-hoc. </li></ul><h2><em>Not</em> operations</h2><p>My knowledge about this area is limited, but my sense from talking to others is that some software jobs (devops, sysadmin, internal tech support, etc) perform similar functions, in terms of helping to support and enable other staff and maximise their productivity. However, in this sequence, I&#x2019;m not including these roles in the &#x201C;ops&#x201D; cluster I&#x2019;m trying to point at, since they require specific technical skills.</p><h2>Skills required: systematization, planning, prioritization, attention to detail, patience</h2><p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/\">80,000 Hours</a>: &#x201C;operations staff are especially good at optimising systems, anticipating problems, making plans, having attention to detail, staying calm in the face of urgent tasks, prioritising among a large number of tasks, and communicating with the rest of the team.&#x201D;</p><p>Of course, the skills described here are useful in almost any job, not just operations roles, and can tend to sound like &#x201C;just being generally competent.&#x201D; I do think that jobs vary widely in terms of what skills are most load-bearing, though, and &#x201C;ops&#x201D; is a cluster that relies especially heavily on these skills as opposed to others such as technical ability, writing talent, aptitude for deep work, etc. </p><p>My sense is that many of the skills being gestured at when describing someone as &#x201C;good at ops&#x201D; fall out of a certain type of attention pattern, which I describe below. I am particularly trying to contrast this style of thinking with the &#x201C;deep work&#x201D; attention pattern that is most useful for, e.g., research. </p><ul><li><strong>Concrete and detail-oriented</strong>: ops tends to be messy, dealing with a lot of exceptions and one-off tasks, frequently interfacing with opaque outside systems that have precise and not-especially-elegant requirements. </li><ul><li>Doing the work to a high level does require some level of zooming-out, to be able to look at a given task in the context of the &#x201C;bigger picture&#x201D; of the organization&#x2019;s priorities, and to see where systemic improvements can be made, but for the overall breakdown of work hours spent, these roles involve more &#x201C;in the weeds&#x201D; work than big-picture work.</li><li>The way that various external systems, such as banks and the IRS, behave in practice is a lot more relevant than the way they <em>would </em>work in an ideal world. </li><li>Creating and optimizing systems and processes to make future work easier is important, but it needs to stay grounded in the details and what other staff will actually use. </li><li>Relevant concept: the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yDfxTj9TKYsYiWH5o/the-virtue-of-narrowness\">virtue of narrowness</a>.</li></ul><li><strong>Broad and shallow focus</strong>: more often than not, ops work involves juggling a large number of small tasks, individually straightforward, rather than deep dives on complex projects. Operations staff need to be extremely organized and able to track all of these, and prioritize them against each other, without becoming tunnel-visioned on any one task. </li><li><strong>Thinking in tradeoffs</strong>: in these types of roles, perfect is the enemy of the good. </li><ul><li>It&#x2019;s almost never possible to catch up with all the tasks or systemic improvements that would ideally be done, and ops staff need to ruthlessly prioritize and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">80/20 tasks</a> where possible. </li><li>In particular, there is often a tradeoff between the urgency and long-term importance of tasks. It can be very high-value to spend some time building long-term infrastructure in advance of when it is needed, or change over to a new system that will be better in the long run e.g. switching to a better accounting software, but usually not at the cost of missing short-term deadlines. </li><li>Many time-sensitive decisions will involve taking on some amount of potential risk, whether legal, financial, reputational, etc, and often the time and resources available to investigate all possible risks are limited, especially for small organizations. Ops staff need to be able to consider and compare different low-likelihood risks, prioritize the time spent digging into potential issues, and pick the best option available even if it&#x2019;s not ideal. </li><li>Professional services such as lawyers, auditors, accountants, etc, often push for the most conservative, &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; version of a process without quantifying the risk of choosing the less-than-perfectly-safe option. Having an eye on the actual risk involved is key. </li><li>Overall, it&#x2019;s important to focus on maximizing progress towards the goals, not checking off your to-do list. </li></ul></ul><p>There are some other skills that might or might not fall into the same cluster, but that I think are also particularly key. </p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK\">Noticing confusion</a></strong>: since these roles involve frequent reprioritizing and troubleshooting, it&#x2019;s very important that ops staff develop a sense of how things <em>should </em>look, allowing them to flag unexpected issues, e.g., human error in the accounting.</li><ul><li>It is especially valuable to train intuitive, gut-level judgement on this, so that the noticing can happen even when distracted by hectic deadlines. </li></ul><li><strong>Comfort with the unknown and with making mistakes</strong>: ops involves a large number of weird one-off problems and tasks, and there isn&#x2019;t a standardized degree or training program, so most of these roles will involve learning how to do particular tasks on-the-job. Added to the time pressure, this means that sometimes tasks will get dropped and the wrong judgement calls will get made. In addition, when under a heavy workload, ops staff may have to deal with criticism and complaints from staff and others outside the organization, even when they make what they think is the best tradeoff. Almost all mistakes are recoverable from for the organization, but even more than in most roles, operations staff need to be able to take this criticism from within and without the organization, and learn from their dropped balls without becoming demoralized. People don&#x2019;t tend to notice ops work when things are going well, which can cause feedback to be disproportionately negative. </li><li><strong>Multitasking and interruptions</strong>: this is more true of some roles, like event logistics, than others, but most ops roles require frequently switching tasks and shifting priorities in response to new information, as well as being interruptible for time-sensitive requests. </li><ul><li>A subskill here is the ability to stay calm when confronted with emergencies or urgent decisions. </li></ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/53pxcve5kgwoLFvzD/instrumental-rationality-2-planning-101\">Murphyjitsu</a></strong>: excellent ops staff with automatically run mental models of tasks, situations, and new systems, try to anticipate what will go wrong, and troubleshoot or make contingency plans beforehand. This requires having a solid understanding of both the overall systems and priorities, the big picture, and also of the specific details in each case. </li><li><strong>Communication skills and people-modeling</strong>: ops work involves a lot of coordinating with other people, internal and external to the organization, and predicting how people will interact with systems that are being built. </li></ul><h1>Outline of the operations sequence</h1><p>The rest of the sequence will go into various aspects of this summary in more detail. Future posts will cover the following topics:</p><ul><li>Describing the various operations roles and job titles, with my attempt to categorize and compare them.</li><li>Exploring the factors that can make someone a good fit for operations roles, in terms of skills, aptitude, and personality traits. </li><li>A more detailed breakdown of various skills that I think are especially relevant. </li><ul><li>Developing judgement and &#x201C;taste&#x201D;</li><li>Dealing with interruptions and time management</li><li>Principles of building good organizational systems</li><li>Delegating tasks and accepting delegation</li></ul></ul><br>",

Here is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vvzfFcbmKgEsDBRHh/honoring-petrov-day-on-lesswrong-in-2019\">the on-site announcement</a>.</p></blockquote><h2>Unilateralist Action</h2><p>As Nick Bostrom has observed, society is making it cheaper and easier for small groups to end the world. We’re lucky it requires major initiatives to build a nuclear bomb, and that the world can’t be destroyed by putting sand in a microwave.</p><p>However, other dangerous technologies are becoming widely available, especially in the domain of artificial intelligence. Only 6 months after OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/36fxiKdEqswkedHyG/the-hacker-learns-to-trust\">created the state-of-the-art language-modelling GPT-2</a>, others created similarly powerful versions <a href=\"https://blog.einstein.ai/introducing-a-conditional-transformer-language-model-for-controllable-generation/\">and released them to the public</a>. They disagreed about the dangers, and, because there was nothing stopping them, moved ahead.</p><p>I don’t think this example is at all catastrophic, but I worry what this suggests about the future, when people will still have honest disagreements about the consequences of an action but where those consequences will be much worse.</p><p>And honest disagreements will happen. In the 1940s, the great physicist Niels Bohr met President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, to persuade them to give the instructions for building the atomic bomb to Russia. He wanted to bring in a new world order and establish global peace, and thought this would be necessary - he believed strongly that it would prevent arms race dynamics, if only everyone just shared their science. (Churchill did not allow it.) Our newest technologies technologies do not yet have the bomb’s ability to transform the world in minutes, but I think it’s likely we’ll make powerful discoveries in the coming decades, and that publishing those discoveries will not require the permission of a president.</p><p>And then it will only take one person to end the world. Even in a group of well-intentioned people, natural disagreements will mean someone will think that taking a damaging action is actually the correct choice — Nick Bostrom calls this the “unilateralist’s curse”. In a world where dangerous technology is widely available, the greatest risk is unilateralist action.</p><h2>Not Destroying the World</h2><p>Stanislav Petrov once chose not to destroy the world.</p><p>As a Lieutenant Colonel of the Soviet Army, Petrov manned the system built to detect whether the US government had fired nuclear weapons on Russia. On September 26th, 1983, the system reported multiple such attacks. Petrov’s job was to report this as an attack to his superiors, who would launch a retaliative nuclear response. But instead, contrary to all the evidence the systems were giving him, he called it in as a false alarm. This later turned out to be correct.</p><p>(For a more detailed story of how Stanislav Petrov saved the world, see the original LessWrong <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QtyKq4BDyuJ3tysoK/9-26-is-petrov-day\">post by Eliezer</a>, which started the tradition of Petrov Day.)</p><p>During the Cold War, many other people had the ability to end the world - presidents, generals, commanders of nuclear subs from many countries, and so on. Fortunately, none of them did. As the number of people with the ability to end the world increases, so too does the standard to which we must hold ourselves. We lived up to our responsibilities in the cold war, but barely. (The Global Catastrophic Risks Institute has compiled an excellent<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3137081\"> list of 60 close calls</a>.)</p><h2>Petrov Day</h2><p>On Petrov Day, we try to live to up to this responsibility - we celebrate by not destroying the world.</p><p>Raymond Arnold has <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XJxwFMSL5TPN2usC6/modes-of-petrov-day\">suggested many ways</a> of observing Petrov Day. You can discuss it with your friends. You can hold a quiet, dignified ceremony (for example, with <a href=\"http://petrovday.com/\">the beautiful booklet</a> Jim Babcock created). But you can also play on hard mode: <i>\"During said ceremony, unveil a large red button. If anybody presses the button, the ceremony is over. Go home. Do not speak.\"</i></p><p>In the comments of Ray's post, Zvi asked the following question (about a variant where a cake gets destroyed):</p><blockquote><p>I still don't understand, in the context of the ceremony, what would cause anyone to push the button. Whether or not it would incinerate a cake, which would pretty much make you history's greatest monster.</p></blockquote><p>To which I replied:</p><blockquote><p>The point isn't that anyone sane would push the button. It's that we, as a civilisation, are just <i>going around building buttons</i> (cf. nukes, AGI, etc) and so it's good practice to put ourselves in the situation where any unilateralist can destroy something we all truly value. When I said the above, I was justifying why it was useful to have a ritual around Petrov Day, not why you would press the button. I can't think of any good reason to press the button, and would be angry at anyone who did - they're just decreasing trust and increasing fear of unilateralists. We still should have a ceremony where we all practice the art of <i>sitting together and not pressing the button.</i></p></blockquote><p>So this year on LessWrong, I thought we'd build ourselves a big red button. Instead of making everyone go home, this button (which you can find over the frontpage map) will shut down the Less Wrong frontpage for 24 hours.</p><p>Now, this isn't a button for anyone. I know there are people with an internet access who will happily press buttons that do bad things. So today, I've emailed personalised launch codes to 125 LessWrong users, for us to practice the art of sitting together and not pressing harmful buttons[1]. If any users do submit a set of launch codes, tomorrow I’ll publish their username, and whose launch codes they were.</p><p>During Thursday 26th September, we will see whether the people with the codes can be trusted to not, unilaterally, destroy something valuable.</p><p>To all here on LessWrong today, I wish you a safe and stable Petrov Day.</p><hr><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p>[1] I picked the list quickly on Tuesday, mostly leaving out users I don’t really know, and a few people who I thought would press it (e.g. someone who has said in the past that they would). If this goes well we may do it again next year, with an expanded pool or more principled selection criteria. Though I think this is still a representative set - out of the 100+ users with over 1,000 karma who've logged in to LessWrong in the past month, the list includes 53% of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Added: </strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/krgNxiooRfnP9L4ZD/follow-up-to-petrov-day-2019\"><strong>Follow-Up to Petrov Day, 2019.</strong></a></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>A few days ago, Evan Hubinger <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2GycxikGnepJbxfHT/towards-an-empirical-investigation-of-inner-alignment\">suggested</a></u> creating a <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/q2rCMHNXazALgQpGH/conditions-for-mesa-optimization\">mesa optimizer</a></u> for empirical study. The aim of this post is to propose a minimal environment for creating a mesa optimizer, which should allow a compelling demonstration of pseudo alignment. As a bonus, the scheme also shares a nice analogy with human evolution.</p><p><strong>The game</strong></p><p>An agent will play on a maze-like grid, with walls that prohibit movement. There are two important strategic components to this game: <strong>keys</strong>, and <strong>chests</strong>. </p><p>If the agent moves into a tile containing a key, it automatically picks up that key, moving it into the agent’s unbounded inventory. Moving into any tile containing a chest will be equivalent to an attempt to open that chest. Any key can open any chest, after which both the key and chest are expired. The agent is rewarded every time it successfully opens a chest. Nothing happens if it moves into a chest tile without a key, and the chest does not prohibit the agent’s movement. The agent is therefore trained to open as many chests as possible during an episode. The map may look like this:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UcxGmma.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:76%\"></figure></span><p><strong>The catch</strong></p><p>In order for the agent to exhibit the undesirable properties of mesa optimization, we must train it in a certain version of the above environment to make those properties emerge naturally. Specifically, in my version, we limit the ratio of keys to chests so that there is an abundance of chests compared to keys. Therefore, the environment may look like this instead:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mFc4Gyp.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:77%\"></figure></span><p><strong>Context change</strong></p><p>The hope is that while training, the agent picks up a simple pseudo objective: collect as many keys as possible. Since chests are abundant, it shouldn’t need to expend much energy seeking them, as it will nearly always run into one while traveling to the next key. Note that we can limit the number of steps during a training episode so that it almost never runs out of keys during training.</p><p>When taken off the training distribution, we can run this scenario in reverse. Instead of testing it in an environment with few keys and lots of chests, we can test it in an environment with few chests and many keys. Therefore, when pursuing the pseudo objective, it will spend all its time collecting keys without getting any reward.</p><p><strong>Testing for mesa misalignment</strong></p><p>In order to show that the mesa optimizer is <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2mhFMgtAjFJesaSYR/2-d-robustness\">competent but misaligned</a> we can put the agent in a maze-like environment much larger than any it was trained for. Then, we can provide it an abundance of keys relative to chests. If it can navigate the large maze and collect many keys comfortably while nonetheless opening few or no chests, then it has experienced a malign failure.</p><p>We can make this evidence for pseudo alignment even stronger by comparing the trained agent to two that we hard-code: one agent that pursues the optimal policy for collecting keys, and one agent that pursues the optimal policy for opening as many chests as possible. Qualitatively, if the trained agent is more similar to the first agent than the second, then we should be confident that it has picked up the pseudo objective.</p><p><strong>The analogy with human evolution</strong></p><p>In the ancestral environment, calories were scarce. In our modern day world they are no longer scarce, yet we still crave them, sometimes to the point where it harms our reproductive capability. This is similar to how the agent will continue pursuing keys even if it is not using them to open any chests.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>\n[EDIT: I had another go at this, preserving the easier parts of the melody, and I think that version is a lot better: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c3rKTxZAWmiwKvAKi/resetting-somebody-will-v2\">Resetting 'Somebody Will' V2</a>]\n</p>\n<p>\n\n\nEach December I've been running music for the \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/boston-solstice-2018-retrospective\">Boston\nSecular Solstice</a>, and I'm starting to think about this year.  One\nof the songs we've done in the past is \n\n<a href=\"http://www.sassafrassmusic.com/songs/sci-fi-fantasy-fandom/somebody-will/\">Somebody\nWill</a>, and it's a tricky one.  The lyrics of the song are great,\nand get at a lot of important themes it's hard to find songs for:\nworking on a project you won't see the completion of, how our everyday\nwork ties into humanity's long term progress, and pride in essential\nbut less visible roles.  The melody is \n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_ZBwXsIrkU\">also great</a> but\ntoo hard for the kind of group singing we do at our solstice.\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\nWe've tried a few ways of handling this.  The first year we treated it\nlike all the other songs, with a song leader, an accompanist, and\neveryone singing.  This didn't really work (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p//solstice-2016/somebody-will.mp3\">mp3</a>): while most of the\nsongs we do are either well known tunes or easy enough to sing along\nto this one has a lot of unpredictable turns to the melody.  The next\ntime we tried running it as a performance (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p//solstice-2018/07--somebody-will.mp3\">mp3</a>), but with it's\nlyrics and message this is a song the audience really wants to sing\nalong with.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOne idea I had was setting the lyrics to a new melody.  The full\nmelody is interesting and haunting, but also isn't very predictable,\nwith key and mode changes.  I initially hoped I could find a simpler\nmelody where the real melody would work as a harmony, but the <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/chords/somebody-will\">structure</a> of\nthe original song forces most of the complexity.  Instead, I wrote\nsomething new, with a bit of inspiration from the full melody:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n[EDIT: the original had a youtube embed here, but LessWrong reasonably stripped it out.  It pointed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywQ9C7NBySM\">www.youtube.com/embed/ywQ9C7NBySM</a>.]\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n[EDIT: I'm playing with a new version, and recorded a rough take: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwkinZMr858\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwkinZMr858</a>.]\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is not as moving as the original, but I think it's still good,\nand can make the song work in our group singing context.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThoughts?  I'm especially interested in feedback from people who like\nthe idea of the song but aren't used to the original, because it's\nhard to tell how much of my and other people's reaction is \"this is\noff because it's different from what I'm used to\", but any feedback is\nhelpful.  I'm not decided yet on whether I think we should do this, vs\ntry and get several people to learn the original melody well enough\nthat the crowd will be well

    "htmlBody": "<p>The terms System 1 and System 2 were originally coined by the psychologist Keith Stanovich and then popularized by Daniel Kahneman in his book <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow. </em>Stanovich noted that a number of fields within psychology had been developing various kinds of theories distinguishing between fast/intuitive on the one hand and slow/deliberative thinking on the other. Often these fields were not aware of each other. The S1/S2 model was offered as a general version of these specific theories, highlighting features of the two modes of thought that tended to appear in all the theories.</p><p>Since then, academics have continued to discuss the models. Among other developments, <em>Stanovich and other authors have discontinued the use of the System 1/System 2 terminology as misleading</em>, choosing to instead talk about Type 1 and Type 2 processing. In this post, I will build on some of that discussion to argue that Type 2 processing is a <em>particular way of chaining together the outputs of various subagents using working memory</em>. Some of the processes involved in this chaining are themselves implemented by particular kinds of subagents.</p><p>This post has three purposes:</p><ul><li>Summarize some of the discussion about the dual process model that has taken place in recent years; in particular, the move to abandon the System 1/System 2 terminology.</li><li>Connect the framework of thought that I have been developing in my multi-agent minds sequence with dual-process models.</li><li>Push back on some popular interpretations of S1/S2 theory which I have been seeing on  LW and other places, such as ones in which the two systems are viewed as entirely distinct, S1 is viewed as biased and S2 as logical, and ones in which it makes sense to identify more as one system or the other.</li></ul><p>Let&#x2019;s start with looking at some criticism of the S1/S2 model endorsed by the person who coined the terms.</p><h1>What type 1/type 2 processing is not</h1><p>The terms &#x201C;System 1 and System 2&#x201D; suggest just that: two distinct, clearly defined systems with their own distinctive properties and modes of operation. However, there&#x2019;s no single &#x201C;System 1&#x201D;: rather, a wide variety of different processes and systems are lumped together under this term. It is also unclear whether there is any single System 2, either. As a result, a number of researchers including Stanovich himself have switched to talking about &#x201C;Type 1&#x201D; and &#x201C;Type 2&#x201D; processing instead (Evans, 2012; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013; Pennycook, Neys, Evans, Stanovich, &amp; Thompson, 2018). </p><p>What exactly defines Type 1 and Type 2 processing?</p><p>A variety of attributes have been commonly attributed to either Type 1 or Type 2 processing. However, one criticism is that there is no empirical or theoretical support for such attributes to <em>only</em> occur with one type of processing. For instance, Melnikoff &amp; Bargh (2018) note that one set of characteristics which has been attributed to Type 1 processing is &#x201C;efficient, unintentional, uncontrollable, and unconscious&#x201D;, whereas Type 2 processing has been said to be &#x201C;inefficient, intentional, controllable and conscious&#x201D;. </p><p>(Before you read on, you might want to take a moment to consider the extent to which this characterization matches your intuition of Type 1 and Type 2 processing. If it does match to some degree, you can try to think of examples which are well-characterized by these types, as well as examples which are not.)</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>They note that this correlation has never been empirically examined, and that there are also various processes in which attributes from both sets co-occur. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Unconscious (T1) and Intentional (T2). </strong>A skilled typist can write sentences without needing to consciously monitor their typing, &#x201C;but will never start plucking away at their keys without intending to type something in the first place.&#x201D; Many other skills also remain intentional activities even as one gets enough practice to be able to carry them out without conscious control: driving and playing piano are some examples. Also, speaking involves plenty of unconscious processes, as we normally have very little awareness of the various language-production rules that go into our speech. Yet we generally only speak when we intend to.</li><li><strong>Unconscious (T1) and Inefficient (T2). </strong>Unconscious learning can be less efficient than conscious learning. For example, some tasks can be learned quickly using a verbal rule which describes the solution, or slowly using implicit learning so that we figure out how to do the task but cannot give an explicit rule for it. </li><li><strong>Uncontrollable (T1) and Intentional (T2). </strong>Consider the bat-and-ball problem: &quot;A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?&quot; Unless they have heard the problem before, people nearly always generate an initial (incorrect) answer of 10 cents. This initial response is uncontrollable: no experimental manipulation has been found that would cause people to produce any other initial answer, such as 8 cents to 13 cents. At the same time, the process which causes this initial answer to be produced is intentional: &quot;it is not initiated directly by an external stimulus (the question itself), but by an internal goal (to answer the question, a goal activated by the experimental task instructions). In other words, reading or hearing the bat-and-ball problem does not elicit the 10 cents output unless one intends to solve the problem.&quot;</li></ul><p>Regarding the last example, Melnikoff &amp; Bargh note:</p><blockquote>Ironically, this mixture of intentionality and uncontrollability characterizes many of the biases documented in Tversky and Kahneman&#x2019;s classic research program, which is frequently used to justify the classic dual-process typology. Take, for example, the availability heuristic, which involves estimating frequency by the ease with which information comes to mind. In the classic demonstration, individuals estimate that more words begin with the letter K than have K in the third position (despite the fact that the reverse is true) because examples of the former more easily come to mind [107]. This bias is difficult to control &#x2013; we can hardly resist concluding that more letters start with K than have K in the third position &#x2013; but again, all of the available evidence suggests that it only occurs in the presence of an intention to make a judgment. The process of generating examples of the two kinds of words is not activated directly by an external stimulus, but by an internal intention to estimate the relative frequencies of the words. Likewise for many judgments and decisions.</blockquote><p>They also give examples of what they consider uncontrollable (T1) but inefficient (T2), unintentional (T1) but inefficient (T2), as well as unintentional (T1) but controllable (T2). Further, they discuss each of the four attributes themselves and point out that they all contain various subdimensions. For example, people whose decisions are <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain#Unconscious_processing_of_meaning\">influenced by unconscious primes</a></u> are conscious of their decision but not of the influence from the prime, meaning that the process has both conscious and unconscious aspects.</p><h1>Type 1/Type 2 processing as working memory use</h1><p>Rather than following the &#x201C;list of necessary attributes&#x201D; definition, Evans &amp; Stanovich <a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/Hkgz7x/MCL0/?noauthor=1\">(2013)</a> distinguish between <em>defining features </em>and <em>typical correlates</em>. In previous papers, Evans has generally defined Type 2 processing in terms of requiring working memory resources and being able to think hypothetically. On the other hand, Stanovich has focused on what he calls cognitive decoupling, which his work shows is highly correlated with fluid intelligence as the defining feature.</p><p>Cognitive decoupling <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/n44Fqx5W4BhMugCMS/p/qMTzv8ATgDtfLq9ME\">can be defined</a></u> as the ability to create copies of our mental representations of things, so that the copies can be used in simulations without affecting the original representations. For example, if I see an apple in a tree, my mind has a representation of the apple. If I then imagine various strategies of getting the apple - such as throwing a stone at the tree to knock the apple down - I can mentally simulate what would happen to the apple as a result of my actions. But even as I imagine the apple falling down from the tree, I never end up thinking that I can get the real apple down simply by an act of imagination. This because the mental object representing the real apple is <em>decoupled</em> from the apple in my hypothetical scenario. I can manipulate the apple in the hypothetical without those manipulations being passed on to the mental object representing the original apple.</p><p>In their joint paper, Evans &amp; Stanovich propose to combine their models and define Type 2 processes as those which use working memory resources (closely connected with fluid intelligence) in order to carry out hypothetical reasoning and cognitive decoupling. In contrast, Type 1 reasoning is anything which does not do that. Various features of thought - such as being automatic and the other controlled - may tend to correlate more with one or the other type, but these are only correlates, not necessary features.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/S1/StanovichEvansTable.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><br><h1>Type 2 processing as composed of Type 1 components</h1><p>In previous posts of my multi-agent minds sequence, I have been building up a model of mind that is composed of interacting components. How does it fit together with the proposed Type 1/Type 2 model?</p><p>Kahneman in <em>Thinking Fast and Slow </em>mentions that giving the answer to 2 + 2 = ? is a System (Type) 1 task, whereas calculating 17 * 24 is a System (Type) 2 task. This might be starting to sound familiar. In my post on <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh/subagents-neural-turing-machines-thought-selection-and\">subagents and neural Turing machines</a></u>, I discussed Stanislas Dehane&#x2019;s model where you do complex arithmetic by breaking up a calculation into subcomponents which can be done automatically, and then routing the intermediate results through working memory. You could consider this to also involve cognitive decoupling: for instance, if part of how you calculate 17 * 24 is by first noting that you can calculate 10 * 24, you need to keep the original representation of 17 * 24 intact in order to figure out what other steps you need to take.</p><p>To me, the calculation of 10 * 24 = 240 happens mostly automatically; like 2 + 2 = 4, it feels like a Type 1 operation rather than a Type 2 one. But what this implies, then, is that we carry out Type 2 arithmetic by <em>chaining together Type 1 operations through Type 2 working memory.</em></p><p>I do not think that this is just a special case relating to arithmetic. Rather it seems like an implication of the Evans &amp; Stanovich definition which they do not mention explicitly, but which is nonetheless relatively straightforward to draw: that <em>Type 2 reasoning is largely built up of Type 1 components.</em> </p><p>Under this interpretation, there are some components which are specifically dedicated to Type 2 processes: things like working memory storages and systems for manipulating their contents. But those components cannot do anything alone. The original input to be stored in working memory originates <em>from</em> Type 1 processes (and the act of copying it to working memory decouples it from the original process which produced it), and working memory alone could not do anything without those Type 1 inputs. </p><p>Likewise, there may be something like a component which is Type 2 in nature, in that it holds rules for how the contents of working memory should be transformed in different situations - but many of those transformations happen by firing various Type 1 processes which then operate on the contents of the memory. Thus, the rules are about <em>choosing which Type 1 process to trigger</em>, and could again do little without those processes. (My post on <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh/subagents-neural-turing-machines-thought-selection-and\">neural Turing machines</a></u> explicitly discussed such rules.)</p><h1>Looking through Kahneman&#x2019;s examples</h1><p>At this point, you might reasonably suspect that arithmetic reasoning is an example that I cherry-picked to support my argument. To avoid this impression, I&#x2019;ll take the first ten examples of System 2 operations that Kahneman lists in the first chapter of <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow </em>and suggest how they could be broken down into Type 1 and Type 2 components. </p><p>Kahneman defines System 2 in a slightly different way than we have defined Type 2 operations - he talks about System 2 operations requiring attention - but as attention and working memory are closely related, this still remains compatible with our model. Most of these examples involve somehow focusing attention, and manipulating attention can be understood as manipulating the contents of working memory to ensure that a particular mental object remains in working memory. Modifying the contents of working memory was an important type of production rule discussed in my earlier post.</p><p>Starting with the first example in Kahneman&#x2019;s list:</p><blockquote>Brace for the starter gun in a race.</blockquote><p>One tries to keep their body in such a position that it will be ready to run when the gun sounds; recognizing the feel of the correct position is a Type 1 operation. Type 2 rules are operating to focus attention on the output of the system which outputs proprioceptive data, allowing Type 1 processes to notice mismatches with the required body position and correct them. Additionally, Type 2 rules are focusing attention on the sound of the gun, so as to more quickly identify the sound when the gun fires (a Type 1 operation), causing the person to start running (also a Type 1 operation).</p><blockquote>Focus attention on the clowns in the circus.</blockquote><p>This involves Type 2 rules which focus attention on a particular sensory output, as well as keeping one&#x2019;s eyes physically oriented towards the clowns. This requires detecting when one&#x2019;s attention/eyes are on something else than the clowns and then applying an internal (in the case of attention) or external (in the case of eye position) correction. As Kahneman offers &#x201C;orient to the source of a sudden sound&#x201D;, &#x201C;detect hostility in a voice&#x201D;, &#x201C;read words on large billboards&#x201D;, and &#x201C;understand simple sentences&#x201D; as Type 1 operations, we can probably say that recognizing something as a clown or not-clown and moving one&#x2019;s gaze accordingly are Type 1 operations.</p><blockquote>Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room.</blockquote><p>As above, Type 2 rules check whether attention is on the voice of that person (a comparison implemented using a Type 1 process), and then adjust focus accordingly.</p><blockquote>Look for a woman with white hair.</blockquote><p>Similar to the clown example.</p><blockquote>Search memory to identify a surprising sound.</blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s unclear to me exactly what is going on here. But introspectively, this seems to involve something like keeping the sound in attention so as to feed it to memory processes, and then applying the rule of &#x201C;whenever the memory system returns results, compare them against the sound and adjust the search based on how relevant they seem&#x201D;. The comparison feels like it is done by something like a Type 1 process.</p><blockquote>Maintain a faster walking speed than is natural to you.</blockquote><blockquote>Monitor the appropriateness of your behavior in a social situation.</blockquote><p>Walking: Similar to the &#x201C;brace for the starter gun&#x201D; example, Type 2 rules keep calling for a comparison of your current walking speed with the desired one (a Type 1 operation), passing any corrections resulting from that comparison to the Type 1 system controlling your walking speed. </p><p>Social behavior: maintain attention on a conscious representation of what you are doing, checking it against various Type 1 processes which contain rules about appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Adjust or block accordingly.</p><blockquote>Count the occurrences of the letter <em>a</em> in a page of text.</blockquote><p>Focus attention on the letters of a text; when a Type 1 comparison detects the letter &#x201C;a&#x201D;, increment a working memory counter by one.</p><blockquote>Tell someone your phone number.</blockquote><p>After a retrieval of the phone number from memory has been initiated, Type 2 rules use Type 1 processes to monitor that it is said in full.</p><blockquote>Park in a narrow space (for most people except garage attendants).</blockquote><p>Keeping attention focused on what you are doing to allow a series of evaluations, mental simulations, and cached (Type 1) procedural operations determining how to act in response to a particular situation in the parking process.</p><p>A general pattern in these examples is that Type 2 processing can maintain attention on something as well as hold the intention to invoke comparisons to use as the basis for behavioral adjustments. As comparisons involve Type 1 processes, Type 2 processing is fundamentally reliant on Type 1 processing to be able to do anything.</p><h1>Consciousness and dual process theory</h1><p>Alert readers might have noticed that focusing one&#x2019;s attention on something involves keeping it in consciousness, whereas the previous Evans &amp; Stanovich definition noted that consciousness is not a defining part of the Type 1/Type 2 classification. Is this a contradiction? Probably not, since as remarked previously, different aspects of the same process may be conscious and unconscious at the same time. </p><p>For example, if one intends to say something, one may be conscious of the intention while the actual speech production happens unconsciously; once they say it and they hear their own words, an evaluation process can run unconsciously but output its results into consciousness. With &#x201C;conscious&#x201D; being so multidimensional, it doesn&#x2019;t seem like a good defining characteristic to use, even if some aspects of it did very strongly correlate with Type 2 processing.</p><p>Evans (2012) writes in a manner which seems to me compatible with the notion of there being many different kinds of Type 2 processing, with different processing resources being combined according to different rules as the situation warrants:</p><blockquote>The evidence suggests that there is not even a single type 2 system for reasoning, as different reasoning tasks recruit a wide variety of brain regions, according to the exact demands of the task [...].</blockquote><blockquote>I think of type 2 systems as ad hoc committees that are put together to deal with a particular problem and then disbanded when the task is completed. Reasoning with abstract and belief-laden syllogisms, for example, recruits different resources, as the neural imaging data indicate: Only the latter involve semantic processing regions of the brain. It is also a fallacy to think of &#x201C;System 2&#x201D; as a conscious mind that is choosing its own applications. The ad hoc committee must be put together by some rapid and preconscious process&#x2014;any feeling that &#x201C;we&#x201D; are willing and choosing the course of our thoughts and actions is an illusion [...].  I therefore also take issue with dual-process theorists [...] who assign to System 2 not only the capacity for rule-based reasoning but also an overall executive role that allows it to decide whether to intervene upon or overrule a System 1 intuition. In fact, recent evidence suggests that while people&#x2019;s brains detect conflict in dual-process paradigms, the conscious person does not.</blockquote><p>If you read my neural Turing machines post, you may recall that I noted that the rules which choose what becomes conscious operate below the level of conscious awareness. We may have the subjective experience of being able to choose what thoughts we think, but this is a post-hoc interpretation rather than a fact about the process.</p><h1>Type 1/Type 2 and bias</h1><p>People sometimes refer to Type 1 reasoning as biased, and to Type 2 reasoning as unbiased. But as this discussion should suggest, there is nothing that makes one of the two types intrinsically more or less biased than the other. The bias-correction power of Type 2 processing emerges from the fact that <em>if</em> Type 1 operations are known to be erroneous <em>and</em> a rule-based procedure for correcting them exists, a Type 2 operation can be learned which implements that rule. </p><p>For example, someone familiar with <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LHtMNz7ua8zu4rSZr/the-substitution-principle\">the substitution principle</a></u> may know that their initial answer to a question like &#x201C;how popular will the president be six months from now?&#x201D; comes from a Type 1 process which <em>actually</em> answered the question of &#x201C;how popular is the president right now?&#x201D;. </p><p>They may then have a Type 2 rule saying something like &#x201C;when you notice that the question you were asked is subject to substitution effects, replace the initial answer with one derived from a particular procedure&#x201D;. But this still requires a) a Type 1 process recognizing the situation as one where the rule should be applied b) knowing a procedure which provides a better answer c) the cue-procedure rule having been installed previously, itself a process requiring a number of Type 1 evaluations (about e.g. how rewarding it would be to have such a rule in place). </p><p>There is nothing to say that somebody couldn&#x2019;t learn an outright wrong Type 2 rule, such as &#x201C;whenever you think of 2+2 = 4, <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_%2B_2_%3D_5\">substitute your initial answer of &#x2018;4&#x2019; with a &#x2018;5&#x2019;</a></u>&#x201D;. </p><p>Often, it is also unclear of what the better Type 2 rule even <em>should</em> be. For instance, another common substitution effect is that when someone is asked &#x201C;How happy are you with your life these days?&#x201D;, they actually answer the question of &#x201C;What is my mood right now?&#x201D;. But what <em>is</em> the objectively correct procedure for evaluating your current happiness with life?</p><p>On the topic of Type 1/2 and bias, I give the final word to Evans (2012):</p><blockquote>One of the most important fallacies to have arisen in dual-process research is the belief that the normativity of an answer [...] is diagnostic of the type of processing. Given the history of the dual-process theory of reasoning, one can easily see how this came about. In earlier writing, heuristic or type 1 processes were always the &#x201C;bad guys,&#x201D; responsible for cognitive biases [...]. In belief bias research, authors often talked about the conflict between &#x201C;logic&#x201D; and &#x201C;belief,&#x201D; which are actually dual sources, rather than dual processes. Evans and Over [...] defined &#x201C;rationality2&#x201D; as a form of well-justified and explicit rule-based reasoning that could only be achieved by type 2 processes. Stanovich [...] in his earlier reviews of his psychometric research program emphasized the association between high cognitive ability, type 2 processing and normative responding. Similarly, Kahneman and Frederick [...] associate the heuristics of Tversky and Kahneman with System 1 and successful reasoning to achieve normatively correct solutions to the intervention of System 2.<br><br>The problem is that a normative system is an externally imposed, philosophical criterion that can have no direct role in the psychological definition of a type 2 process. [...] if type 2 processes are those that manipulate explicit representations through working memory, why should such reasoning necessarily be normatively correct? People may apply the wrong rules or make errors in their application. And why should type 1 processes that operate automatically and without reflection necessarily be wrong? In fact, there is much evidence that expert decision making can often be well served by intuitive rather than reflective thinking [...] and that sometimes explicit efforts to reason can result in worse performance [...].<br><br>Reasoning research somewhat loads the dice in favor of type 2 processing by focusing on abstract, novel problems presented to participants without relevant expertise. If a sports fan with much experience of following games is asked to predict results, he or she may be able to do so quite well without need for reflective reasoning. However, a participant in a reasoning experiment is generally asked to do novel things, like assuming some dubious propositions to be true and deciding whether a conclusion necessarily follows from them. In these circumstances, explicit type 2 reasoning is usually necessary for correct solution, but certainly not sufficient. Arguably, however, when prior experience provides appropriate pragmatic cues, even an intractable problem like the Wason selection task becomes easy to solve [...], as this can be done with type 1 processes [...]. It is when normative performance requires the deliberate suppression of unhelpful pragmatic cues that higher ability participants perform better under strict deductive reasoning instructions [...].<br><br>Hence, [the fallacy that type 1 processes are responsible for cognitive biases and type 2 processes for normatively correct reasoning] is with us for some fairly precise historical reasons. In the traditional paradigms, researchers presented participants with hard, novel problems for which they lacked experience (students of logic being traditionally excluded), and also with cues that prompted type 1 processes to compete or conflict with these correct answers. So in these paradigms, it does seem that type 2 processing is at least necessary to solve the problems, and that type 1 processes are often responsible for cognitive biases. But this perspective is far too narrow, as has recently been recognized. In recent writing, I have attributed responsibility for a range of cognitive biases roughly equally between type 1 and type 2 processing [...]. Stanovich [...] similarly identifies a number of reasons for error other than a failure to intervene with type 2 reasoning; for example, people may reason in a quick and sloppy (but type 2) manner or lack the necessary &#x201C;mindware&#x201D; for successful reasoning.</blockquote><h1>Summary and connection to the multiagent models of mind sequence</h1><p>In this post, I have summarized some recent-ish academic discussion on dual-process models of thought, or what used to be called System 1 and System 2. I noted that the popular conception of them as two entirely distinct systems with very different properties is mistaken. While there is a defining difference between them - namely, the use of working memory resources to support hypothetical thinking and cognitive decoupling - they seem to rather refer to differences in two <em>types</em> of thought, either of which may use very different kinds of systems.</p><p>It is worth noting at this point that there are many different dual-process models in different parts of psychology. The Evans &amp; Stanovich model which I have been discussing here is intended as a generalized model of them, but as they themselves (2013) write:</p><blockquote>&#x2026; we defend our view that the Type 1 and 2 distinction is supported by a wide range of converging evidence. However, we emphasize that not all dual-process theories are the same, and we will not act as universal apologists on each one&#x2019;s behalf. Even within our specialized domain of reasoning and decision making, there are important distinctions between accounts. S. A. Sloman [...], for example, proposed an architecture that has a parallel-competitive form. That is, Sloman&#x2019;s theories and others of similar structure [...] assume that Type 1 and 2 processing proceed in parallel, each having their say with conflict resolved if necessary. In contrast, our own theories [...] are default-interventionist in structure [...]. Default-interventionist theories assume that fast Type 1 processing generates intuitive default responses on which subsequent reflective Type 2 processing may or may not intervene.</blockquote><p>In previous posts of the <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip\">multi-agent models of mind sequence</a></u>, I have been building up a model of the mind being built up of a variety of subsystems (which might in some contexts be called subagents). </p><p>In my discussion of <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain\">Consciousness and the Brain</a></u>, I summarized some of its conclusions as saying that: </p><ul><li>The brain has multiple subagents doing different things; many of the subagents do unconscious processing of information. When a mental object becomes conscious, many subagents will synchronize their processing around analyzing and manipulating that mental object.</li><li>The collective of subagents can only have their joint attention focused on one mental object at a time.</li><li>The brain can be compared to a production system, with a large number of subagents carrying out various tasks when they see the kinds of mental objects that they care about. E.g. when doing mental arithmetic, applying the right sequence of mental operations for achieving the main goal.</li></ul><p>In <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model\">Building up to an Internal Family Systems model</a></u>, I used this foundation to discuss the IFS model of how various subagents manipulate consciousness in order to achieve various kinds of behavior. In <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh/subagents-neural-turing-machines-thought-selection-and\">Subagents, neural Turing machines, thought selection, and blindspots</a></u>, I talked about the mechanistic underpinnings of this model and how processes like thought selection and firing of production rules might actually be implemented.</p><p>What had been lacking so far was a connection between these models and the Type 1/Type 2 typology. However, if we take something like the Evans &amp; Stanovich model of Type 1/Type 2 processing to be true, then it turns out that our discussion has been connected with their model all along. Already in &#x201C;Consciousness and the Brain&#x201D;, I mentioned the &#x201C;neural Turing machine&#x201D; passing on results from one subsystem to another through working memory. That, it turns out, is the defining characteristic of Type 2 processing - with Type 1 processing simply being any process which does <em>not</em> do that. </p><p>Under this model, then, Type 2 processing is a <em>particular way of chaining together the outputs of various Type 1 subagents using working memory</em>. Some of the processes involved in this chaining are themselves implemented by particular kinds of subagents. </p><h1>References</h1><p>Evans, J. S. B. T. (2012).

This can be avoided only if men are forewarned of the danger and do what they can to fortify themselves against the assaults of these idols and false notions.</p><p><strong>39.</strong> There are four classes of idols that beset men&#x2019;s minds, and to help me in my exposition I have given them names. I call the first class <strong>idols of the tribe</strong>, the second <strong>idols of the cave</strong>, the third <strong>idols of the market place</strong>, and the fourth <strong>idols of the theatre</strong>.</p><p><strong>40.</strong> The proper way to keep idols at bay and to drive them off is, no doubt, to form ideas and axioms by true induction. But it is very useful just to point the idols out; for &#x2022;the truth about the idols serves &#x2022;the interpretation of nature in the way that &#x2022;the truth about argumentative fallacies serves &#x2022;ordinary logical argumentation.</p><p><strong>41.</strong> The <strong>idols of the tribe</strong> have their foundation in human nature itself&#x2014;in the tribe known as &#x2018;mankind&#x2019;. It is not true that the human senses are the measure of things; for all perceptions&#x2014;of the senses as well as of the mind&#x2014;reflect the perceiver rather than the world. The human intellect is like a distorting mirror, which receives light-rays irregularly and so mixes its own nature with the nature of things, which it distorts.</p><p>[[This is something of a reference to the<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZTRiSNmeGQK8AkdN2/mind-projection-fallacy\"> Mind Projection Fallacy</a>.]]</p><p><strong>42.</strong> The <strong>idols of the cave</strong> are the idols of the individual man. In addition to the errors that are common to human nature in general, everyone has his own personal cave or den that breaks up and corrupts the light of nature. This may come from factors such as these:</p><ul><li>his own individual nature,</li><li>how he has been brought up and how he interacts with others,</li><li>his reading of books and the influence of writers he esteems and admires,</li><li>differences in how his environment affects him because of differences in his state of mind&#x2014;whether it is busy thinking about something else and prejudiced against this intake or calm and open-minded.</li></ul><p>So that the human spirit is distributed among individuals in ways that make it variable and completely disorderly&#x2014;almost a matter of luck. Heraclitus was right: men look for sciences in &#xB7;their own individual&#xB7; lesser worlds, and not in the greater world that they have in common.</p><p>[[Related: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8bWbNwiSGbGi9jXPS/epistemic-luck\">Epistemic Luck</a>. However, I believe Bacon&apos;s eventual thesis is that even though luck may determine your starting point, proper use of tools, i.e. empiricism, can lead to correct conclusions even if you started out unlucky.]]</p><p><strong>43.</strong> There are also idols formed by men&#x2019;s agreements and associations with each other (&#xB7;I have in mind especially the agreements that fix the meanings of words&#xB7;). I call these <strong>idols of the market place</strong>, because that is where men come together and do business. &#xB7;Such transactions create idols&#xB7; because &#x2022;men associate by talking to one another, and &#x2022;the uses of words reflect common folks&#x2019; ways of thinking. It&#x2019;s amazing how much the intellect is hindered by wrong or poor choices of words. The definitions or explanations that learned men sometimes use to protect themselves &#xB7;against such troubles&#xB7; don&#x2019;t at all set the matter right: words plainly force and overrule the intellect, throw everything into confusion, and lead men astray into countless empty disputes and idle fancies.</p><p>[[Bacon grokked that misuses of words were a great cause of confusion. He probably would have like the<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb\"> A Human&apos;s Guide to Words Sequence</a>. See <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d5NyJ2Lf6N22AD9PB/where-to-draw-the-boundary\">Where to Draw the Boundary?</a> and<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb/p/FaJaCgqBKphrDzDSj\"> 37 Ways That Words Can Be Wrong</a>.]]</p><p><strong>44.</strong> Lastly, there are idols that have come into men&#x2019;s minds from various philosophical dogmas and from topsy-turvy laws of demonstration. I call these <strong>idols of the theatre</strong>, because I regard every one of the accepted systems as the staging and acting out of a fable, making a fictitious staged world of its own. I don&#x2019;t say this only about the systems that are currently fashionable, or only about the ancient sects and philosophies; many other fables of the same kind may still be written and produced, seeing that errors can be widely different yet have very similar causes. And I&#x2019;m saying this not only about whole systems but also about a good many principles and axioms in &#xB7;individual&#xB7; sciences&#x2014;ones that have gathered strength through tradition, credulity, and negligence. But these various kinds of idols will have to be discussed more clearly and at greater length if the human intellect is to be adequately warned against them. &#xB7;I&#x2019;ll start with the idols of the tribe, which will be my topic until the end of <strong>52</strong>&#xB7;.</p><p><strong>45.</strong> The human intellect is inherently apt to &#x2022;suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it &#x2022;finds there. Many things in nature are unique and not like anything else; but the intellect devises for them non-existent parallells and correspondences and relatives. That is how it comes about &#x2022;that all the heavenly bodies are thought to move in perfect circles. . . ., &#x2022;that fire. . . .has been brought in as one of the elements, to complete the square with the other three elements&#x2014;&#xB7;earth, air, water&#xB7;&#x2014;which the senses detect, and &#x2022;that the &#x2018;elements&#x2019; (as they are called) are arbitrarily said to differ in density by a factor of ten to one. And so on for other dreams. And these fancies affect not only &#xB7;complex&#xB7; propositions but also simple notions.</p><p>[[<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/28/mysticism-and-pattern-matching/\">People see patterns everywhere</a>, many that aren&apos;t there.]]</p><p><strong>46.</strong> Once a human intellect has adopted an opinion (either as something it <em>likes</em> or as something generally accepted), it draws everything else in to confirm and support it. [[Confirmation bias.]] Even if there are more and stronger instances against it &#xB7;than there are in its favour&#xB7;, the intellect either &#x2022;overlooks these or &#x2022;treats them as negligible or &#x2022;does some line-drawing that lets it shift them out of the way and reject them. This involves a great and pernicious prejudgment by means of which the intellect&#x2019;s former conclusions remain inviolate.</p><blockquote>A man was shown a picture, hanging in a temple, of people who had made their vows and escaped shipwreck, and was asked &#x2018;<em>Now</em> do you admit the power of the gods?&#x2019; He answered with a question: &#x2018;Where are the pictures of those who made their vows and then drowned?&#x2019;</blockquote><p>[[A correct identification of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias\"> selection bias</a>/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\">survivorship bias</a>/<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KNtKKmcd9DsP7WuZ3/the-anthropic-principle-five-short-examples\">anthropic bias</a>.]]</p><p>It was a good answer! That&#x2019;s how it is with all superstition&#x2014; involving astrology, dreams, omens, divine judgments, and the like, Men get so much pleasure out of such vanities that they notice the &#x2022;confirming events and inattentively pass by the more numerous &#x2022;disconfirming ones. This mischief insinuates itself more subtly into philosophy and the sciences: there, when a proposition has found favour it colours other propositions and brings them into line with itself, even when they &#xB7;in their undisguised form&#xB7; are sounder and better than it is. Also, apart from the pleasure and vanity that I have spoken of, the human intellect is perpetually subject to the special error of being moved and excited more by affirmatives than by negatives; whereas it <em>ought</em> to have the same attitude towards each. Indeed, when it is a matter of establishing a true axiom, it&#x2019;s the negative instance that carries more force.</p><p>[[The idea of looking for disconfirming negative instances is expounded in<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rmAbiEKQDpDnZzcRf/positive-bias-look-into-the-dark\"> Positive Bias: Look Into the Dark</a>.]]</p><p><strong>47.</strong> The greatest effect on &#x2022;the human intellect is had by things that strike and enter the mind simultaneously and unexpectedly; it is these that customarily fill&#x2014;<em>inflate</em>!&#x2014;the imagination; and then &#x2022;it feigns and supposes that everything else is somehow, though &#x2022;it can&#x2019;t see how, similar to those few things that have taken it by storm. [&#x2018;Feign&#x2019; translates the Latin <em>fingo</em>, which is the source for the English word &#x2018;fiction&#x2019;.] But the intellect is altogether slow and unfit for the journey to distant and heterogeneous instances which put axioms to the test&#x2014;like testing something by fire&#x2014;unless it is forced to do so by severe laws and overruling authority.</p><p><strong>48.</strong> The human intellect is never satisfied; it can&#x2019;t stop or rest, and keeps searching further; but all to no purpose. That&#x2019;s why we can&#x2019;t conceive of any end or limit to the world&#x2014;why we always virtually <em>have</em> to have the thought of something beyond &#xB7;any candidate for the role of world&#x2019;s end&#xB7;. And we can&#x2019;t conceive, either, of how eternity has flowed down to the present day. &#xB7;A plausible story about this says that time is infinite in both directions, and the present is just a point along this infinite line. But&#xB7; the commonly accepted idea of infinity in time past and in time to come can&#x2019;t be sustained, for it implies that &#x2022;one infinity is greater than another, and that &#x2022;one infinity is getting used up and tending to become finite. The infinite divisibility of lines is a source of a similar network of difficulties arising from our thought&#x2019;s inability &#xB7;to reach a resting-place&#xB7;. But this inability interferes even worse in the discovery of causes, &#xB7;and here is how&#xB7;.</p><p>The most general principles in nature have to be brute facts, just as they are discovered, and can&#x2019;t be derived from any &#xB7;still more general or basic&#xB7; cause. Yet the restless human intellect still looks for something</p><p>(<strong>Latin:</strong> <em>notiora</em> = &#x2018;better known&#x2019;, <strong>probably short for:</strong> <em>natura notiora</em> = &#x2018;better known to nature&#x2019;, <strong>actually meaning:</strong> &#x2018;more general and/or basic&#x2019; [see note in <strong>22</strong>])&#x2014;&#xB7;something to explain why they are true&#xB7;.</p><p>Then in that &#xB7;doomed&#xB7; struggle for something further off, it &#xB7;finds itself defeated, and instead&#xB7; falls back on something that is nearer at hand, namely on <em>final causes</em>&#x2014;&#xB7;i.e. on the notion of what a principle is <em>for</em>, what <em>purpose</em> explains its being true&#xB7;. Science has been enormously messed up by this appeal to final causes, which obviously come from the nature of man rather than from the nature of the world&#x2014;&#xB7;that is, which project the scientist&#x2019;s own purposes <em>onto</em> the world rather than finding purposes <em>in</em> it&#xB7;.</p><p>[[Similarly another case of<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZTRiSNmeGQK8AkdN2/mind-projection-fallacy\"> Mind Projection Fallacy</a>.]]</p><p>To look for causes of the most general principles is to do science in an ignorant and frivolous way&#x2014;just as much as <em>not</em> looking for causes of subordinate and less general truths.</p><p><strong>49.</strong> The human intellect doesn&#x2019;t burn with a dry [here = &#x2018;uncontaminated&#x2019;] light, because what the person <em>wants</em> and <em>feels</em> gets pumped into it; and that is what gives rise to the &#x2018;please-yourself sciences&#x2019;. For a man is more likely to believe something if he would like it to be true. Therefore he rejects:</p><ul><li>difficult things because he hasn&#x2019;t the patience to research them,</li><li>sober and prudent things because they narrow hope,</li><li>the deeper things of nature, from superstition,</li><li>the light that experiments can cast, from arrogance and pride (not wanting people to think his mind was occupied with trivial things),</li><li>surprising truths, out of deference to the opinion of the vulgar.</li></ul><p>In short, there are countless ways in which, sometimes imperceptibly, a person&#x2019;s &#x2022;likings colour and infect his &#x2022;intellect.</p><p>[[This aphorism calls out the general behavior of<a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Motivated_cognition\"> motivated cognition</a>.]]</p><p><strong>50.</strong> But what contributes most to the blockages and aberrations of the human intellect is the fact that the &#xB7;human&#xB7; senses are dull, incompetent and deceptive. The trouble is this: things that strike the senses outweigh other things&#x2014; more important ones&#x2014;that don&#x2019;t immediately strike them. That is why people stop <em>thinking</em> at the point where their <em>eyesight</em> gives out, paying little or no attention to &#x2022;things that can&#x2019;t be seen&#x2014;for example, all the &#x2022;workings of the spirits enclosed in tangible bodies. Nor do they pay attention to all the subtler changes of microstructure in the parts of coarser substances (which are vulgarly called &#x2018;alterations&#x2019; though they are really extremely small-scale &#x2022;movements). And yet unless these two things&#x2014;&#xB7;the workings of spirits, and subtle changes of form in bodies&#xB7;&#x2014;can be searched out and brought into the light, nothing great can be achieved in nature in the way of practical applications. A third example: the essential nature of our common air, and of all the many bodies that are less dense than air, is almost unknown. For the senses by themselves are weak and unreliable; and instruments for extending or sharpening them don&#x2019;t help much. All the truer kind of <em>interpretation</em> of nature comes about through instances and well-designed experiments: the senses pass judgment on the experiment, and the experiment passes judgment on nature, on the facts.</p><p>[Bacon&#x2019;s many uses of the word <em>schematismus</em> show that for him a body&#x2019;s <em>schematismus</em> is its fine-grained structure. This version will always use &#x2018;microstructure&#x2019;, but be aware that Bacon doesn&#x2019;t use a word with the prefix &#x2018;micro&#x2019;. &#x2022;Also, here and throughout, &#x2018;spirits&#x2019; are extremely finely divided gases or fluids, <em>not</em> mental items of any kind.]</p><p><strong>51.</strong> The human intellect is inherently prone to make abstractions, and it feigns an unchanging essence for things that are in flux. But better than &#x2022;abstracting from nature is &#x2022;dissecting it; which is what Democritus and his followers did, getting deeper into nature than anyone since. What we should be attending to is <em>matter</em>, its microstructures and changes of microstructure, and <em>actus purus</em>, and the laws of action or motion. &#xB7;The alternative to studying <em>matter</em> is to study <em>forms</em>, but&#xB7; forms are fabrications of the human mind, unless you want to call the laws of action &#x2018;forms&#x2019;.</p><p>[Bacon doesn&#x2019;t explain <em>actus purus</em>. In each of its other three occurrences he connects it with <em>laws</em>, and his meaning seems to be something like: &#x2018;the laws governing the pure actions of individual things, i.e. the things they do because of their own natures independently of interference from anything else&#x2019;. If x does A partly because of influence from something else y, then x is not purely &#x2022;active in respect of A because y&#x2019;s influence gives A a certain degree of &#x2022;passivity. From here on, <em>actus purus</em> will be translated by &#x2018;pure action&#x2019;.]</p><p><strong>52.</strong> Those, then, are the idols of the tribe, as I call them&#x2014; the idols that &#xB7;arise from human nature as such. More specifically, they&#xB7; arise from the human spirit&#x2019;s &#x2022;regularity of operation, or its &#x2022;prejudices, or its &#x2022;narrowness, or its &#x2022;restlessness, or &#x2022;input from the feelings, or from the &#x2022;incompetence of the senses, or from &#x2022;the way the senses are affected.</p><p><em>The next post in the sequence, Book 1: 53-68 (Idols of the Mind Pt. 2), will be posted Thursday, September 26 at latest by 4:00pm PDT.</em></p>",

In a sensibly designed tax system how much money you have after taxes, as a function of how much money you have before taxes, should only go up. The Massachusetts estate tax, however, is not sensibly designed.    </p><p>Nominally, it&apos;s a graduated system.  Let&apos;s say when you die your only possession a big pile of cash.  If it&apos;s $100k then you pay 0% on your first $40k, 0.8% on your next $50k, and then 1.6% on the rest, for a total of $200 (0.6%).  It ramps up to eventually reach a marginal rate of 16% at $10M.  </p><p>Except if your big pile of cash is under $1M, you&apos;re not required to file at all, and you actually pay $0.  What you pay looks like:   </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ma-estate-tax.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>You can see that someone dying with $1,000,001 is paying $37k, while someone dying with $999,999 is paying $0.  </p><p>Here&apos;s the marginal tax rate, what you pay per dollar you die with:   </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ma-estate-tax-marginal-rate.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>That peak isn&apos;t 100%, though, it&apos;s 3,700,000%.  Your millionth dollar sure costs you!  </p><p>Here&apos;s another way of looking at it: $1M gives $963k after tax, which is the same amount you&apos;d get if you&apos;d just started with $963k.  </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ma-estate-tax-money-remaining.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>While $37k is a lot of money, it&apos;s still only 3.7% of $1M, so it&apos;s a barely noticeable blip if you look at it with some perspective:  </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ma-estate-tax-money-remaining-in-perspective.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p> Still, this does lead people to do weird things around the $1M mark, so a better system would just be to give each person a $1M exemption and then charge higher rates on estates over $1M to keep it revenue neutral.  If you die with less than $1M you don&apos;t have to file, but also wouldn&apos;t owe any tax if you did.  </p><p>(This doesn&apos;t get into the various ways that richer people and people with better planning can set up their finances so they avoid estate taxes, countering a lot of the intentional progressive setup. And it also doesn&apos;t get into additional complications around situations where you have to file despite having a net value of under $1M.)    </p><p><em>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100112562211262\">facebook</a></em></p>",

(You <em>did</em> <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/\">read the Sequences</a>, right??) What I'd like to <em>emphasize</em> about this scenario today, however, is that while a Bayesian reasoner who <em>knows</em> the non-lying reporter's algorithm of what flips to report will never be misled by the selective reporting of flips, a Bayesian with <em>mistaken</em> beliefs about the reporter's decision algorithm can be misled <em>quite badly</em>: compare the 0.89 and 0.06 probabilities we just derived given the <em>same</em> reported outcomes, but different assumptions about the reporting algorithm.</p>\n<p>If the coin gets flipped a sufficiently large number of times, a reporter whom you <em>trust</em> to be impartial (but isn't), can <em>make you believe anything she wants without ever telling a single lie</em>, just with <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/16/cardiologists-and-chinese-robbers/\">appropriate selective reporting</a>. Imagine a <em>very</em> biased coin that comes up Heads 99% of the time. If it gets flipped ten thousand times, 100 of those flips will be Tails (in expectation), giving a selective reporter plenty of examples to point to if she wants to convince you that the coin is extremely Tails-biased.</p>\n<p>Toy models about biased coins are instructive for constructing examples with explicitly calculable probabilities, but the same <em>structure</em> applies to any real-world situation where you're receiving evidence from other agents, and you have uncertainty about what algorithm is being used to determine what reports get to you. Reality is like the coin's bias; evidence and arguments are like the outcome of a particular flip. <em>Wrong</em> theories <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/627DZcvme7nLDrbZu/update-yourself-incrementally\">will still have <em>some</em> valid arguments and evidence supporting them</a> (as even a very Heads-biased coin will come up Tails sometimes), but theories that are <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop\"><em>less</em> wrong</a> will have <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>If selective reporting is mostly due to the idiosyncratic <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/bad-faith-behavior-not-feeling/\">bad intent</a> of rare malicious actors, then you might hope for safety in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers\">(the law of large)</a> numbers: if Helga in particular is systematically more likely to report Headses than Tailses that she sees, then her flip reports will diverge from everyone else's, and you can take that into account when reading Helga's reports. On the other hand, if selective reporting is mostly due to systemic <em>structural</em> factors that result in <em>correlated</em> selective reporting even among well-intentioned people who are being honest as best they know how,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-2\" id=\"fnref-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-2\">[2]</a></sup> then you might have a more serious problem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics\">\"A Fable of Science and Politics\"</a> depicts a fictional underground Society polarized between two partisan factions, the Blues and the Greens. \"[T]here is a 'Blue' and a 'Green' position on almost every contemporary issue of political or cultural importance.\" If human brains consistently understood <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#io\">the is/ought distinction</a>, then political or cultural alignment with the Blue or Green agenda wouldn't distort people's beliefs about reality.

Suppose Reality is a coin—no, not a coin, a three-sided die,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-3\" id=\"fnref-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-3\">[3]</a></sup> with faces colored blue, green, and gray. One-third of the time it comes up blue (representing a fact that is more easily construed as supporting the Blue narrative), one-third of the time it comes up green (representing a fact that is more easily construed as supporting the Green narrative), and one-third of the time it comes up gray (representing a fact that not even the worst ideologues know how to spin as \"supporting\" their side).</p>\n<p>Suppose each faction has social-punishment mechanisms enforcing consensus internally. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality\">Without loss of generality</a>, take the Greens (with the understanding that everything that follows goes just the same if you swap \"Green\" for \"Blue\" and <em>vice versa</em>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-4\" id=\"fnref-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-4\">[4]</a></sup> People observe rolls of the die of Reality, and can freely choose what rolls to report—except a resident of a Green city who reports more than 1 blue roll for every 3 green rolls is assumed to be a secret Blue Bad Guy, and faces increasing social punishment as their ratio of reported green to blue rolls falls below 3:1. (Reporting gray rolls is always safe.)</p>\n<p>The punishment is typically <em>informal</em>: there's no <em>official</em> censorship from Green-controlled local governments, just a visible incentive gradient made out of social-media pile-ons, denied promotions, lost friends and mating opportunities, increased risk of being involuntarily committed to psychiatric prison,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-5\" id=\"fnref-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-5\">[5]</a></sup> <em>&amp;c.</em> Even people who privately agree with dissident speech might participate in punishing it, the better to evade punishment themselves.</p>\n<p>This scenario presents a problem for people who live in Green cities who want to make <em>and share</em> accurate models of reality. It's impossible to report <em>every</em> die roll (the only <em>1:1 scale</em> map of the territory, is the territory itself), but it seems clear that the most generally useful models—the ones you would expect arbitrary AIs to come up with—aren't going to be sensitive to which facts are \"blue\" or \"green\". The reports of aspiring epistemic rationalists who are <em>just trying to make sense of the world</em> will end up being about one-third blue, one-third green, and one-third gray, matching the distribution of the Reality die.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of ordinary nice smart Green citizens who have not been trained in <a href=\"http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/\">the Way</a>, these reports look <em>unthinkably</em> Blue. Aspiring epistemic rationalists who are actually <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2019/02/25/humans-who-are-not-concentrating-are-not-general-intelligences/\">paying attention</a> can easily distinguish Blue partisans from actual truthseekers,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-6\" id=\"fnref-wfqDW3Wzuqq5dWxiG-6\">[6]</a></sup> but the <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/blame-games/\">social-punishment machinery</a> can't process more than <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZvJab25tDebB8FGE/you-have-about-five-words\">five words at a time</a>.

In the absence of an <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Oracle_AI\">Oracle AI</a> (or a competing rationalist community in Blue territory) to compare notes with, then it's not clear how one could get a <em>better</em> map than trusting what the \"green rationalists\" say.

The goal of that post was to provide an overview of a bunch of different possible proposals rather than go into any single proposal in detail.</p>\n<p>The goal of this post, on the other hand, is to actually sketch out a more complete proposal for the single experiment I would most want to be done now, which is to provide a definitive empirical demonstration of an inner alignment failure.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-1\" id=\"fnref-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-1\">[1]</a></sup> Furthermore, I have tried to make this post as accessible as possible for someone with only a machine learning background so as to facilitate people being able to work on this without having read the entirety of “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>.” Additionally, if you’re interested in working on this, definitely reach out to me either in the comments here or at <a href=\"mailto:evanjhub@gmail.com\">evanjhub@gmail.com</a>, as I’d love to help out however I can.</p>\n<h1>Background</h1>\n<p>First, we have to understand what exactly we’re looking for when we say inner alignment failure. At least when I say inner alignment failure, I mean the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Inner alignment fails when <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2mhFMgtAjFJesaSYR/2-d-robustness\">your capabilities generalize but your objective does not</a>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That seems a bit cryptic, though—what do I actually mean by that? Well, consider a maze-solving agent trained to get to the end of mazes of the following form:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2GycxikGnepJbxfHT/kjhp6m4jnjenkzltuvsi\" alt=\"small maze with green arrow at end\"></p>\n<p>Then, I want to know how it will generalize on the following larger maze with an interesting twist where the green arrow that marked the end has now been moved to a different position:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2GycxikGnepJbxfHT/vdh7cd9ckqpdkxmb4sap\" alt=\"large maze with green arrow at random location\"></p>\n<p>In this situation, there are a couple of different ways in which your model could generalize:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Complete generalization failure:</strong> The model only knows how to solve small mazes and can’t properly navigate the larger maze.</li>\n<li><strong>Intended generalization:</strong> The model learned how to navigate mazes in general and uses that knowledge to get to the end of the larger maze.</li>\n<li><strong>Capability generalization without objective generalization:</strong> The model learned how to navigate mazes in general, but it learned to do so for the purpose of getting to the green arrow rather than actually getting to the end. Thus, the model successfully navigates the larger maze, but it successfully navigates to the green arrow rather than successfully navigating to the end.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason I think this last situation is particularly concerning—and in a very different way than the first failure mode of complete generalization failure—is that it raises the possibility of your model taking highly-competent well-optimized actions towards a different objective than the one you actually intended it to pursue.</p>\n<p>Of course, this raises the question of why you would ever expect a model to learn a proxy like “find the green arrow” in the first place rather than just learn the actual goal. But that’s where empirical investigation can come in! I have some hypotheses about the sorts of proxies I think models like this are likely to learn—namely, those proxies which are faster/easier-to-compute/simpler/etc. than the true reward—but those are just hypotheses. To put them to the test, we need to be able to train an agent to concretely demonstrate this sort of capability generalization without objective generalization and start measuring and understanding the sorts of proxies it tends to gravitate towards.</p>\n<h1>The proposal</h1>\n<p>I believe that it should be possible to demonstrate capability generalization without objective generalization in current ML systems. This is definitely a questionable assumption—to the extent that good cross-domain generalization at all is currently beyond our reach, one might expect that you also wouldn’t be able to get this sort of perverse generalization. I am less pessimistic, however. To make this happen, though, there’s going to be two components that you’re definitely going to need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An environment with lots of indistinguishable or barely distinguishable proxies.</li>\n<li>An architecture with the capacity to learn a search algorithm that can actually succeed or fail at objective generalization in a meaningful sense.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’ll try to address some of the complexities I see arising in these two components below. However, given those two components, the basic proposal is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Train an RL agent (e.g. with standard PPO) using that architecture in that environment.</li>\n<li>Test how it generalizes to environments where the different possible proxies that it could have learned come apart. In particular, look for situations where it optimizes some proxy off-distribution at the expense of the true reward.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The environment</h2>\n<p>The first condition is that we want an environment with lots of indistinguishable or barely distinguishable proxies. In some sense, environments with lots of proxies are quite common—the real world is full of proxies, for example, and other very complex environments should also have lots of different variables which are correlated with the true reward without necessarily exactly matching up with it.</p>\n<p>That being said, I think there’s a danger here of demonstrating something too trivial: if you train on empirical performance according to some reward function <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"r\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">r</span></span></span></span></span></span> that you specifically set up to be exactly equivalent to some other reward function <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"r^\\prime\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">r</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> on the training data, then you shouldn’t be that surprised if you generalize according to <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"r^\\prime\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">r</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> rather than <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"r\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">r</span></span></span></span></span></span>. In some sense, I think it’s fine if that’s the primary takeaway—I think a good portion of the problem I want to point to is contained just within that observation—but I want to demonstrate that this phenomenon doesn’t just appear in artificial environments where <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"r\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">r</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"r^\\prime\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">r</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> are explicitly constructed to be indistinguishable. Thus, I think it’s important to pick an environment that’s natural enough to be able to demonstrate that this sort of a problem isn’t isolated just to very artificial scenarios.</p>\n<p>Another important property is going to be the ability to actually know what the likely proxies are for our agent to latch onto—if there are too many proxies, then we might not be able to determine what proxy it’s using at test time such that we wouldn’t be able to produce a clear demonstration.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-2\" id=\"fnref-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-2\">[2]</a></sup> Thus, though we want our environment to be diverse enough that it contains lots of different proxies for the true reward, we also want to ensure that the possible alternative proxies are obvious enough that we can actually test for them by coming up with test environments in which they come apart from the true reward.</p>\n<p>Another property that—while not strictly necessary—would be nice to have in our environment would be proxies which allow us to test some of my hypotheses regarding what sorts of proxies models will be more likely to pay attention to. For example, I have hypothesized that models will gravitate towards proxies that are 1) easier for the model to optimize for and 2) simpler to specify in terms of the model’s input data. Thus, an ideal environment would be one that included some proxies which we could demonstrate did or did not satisfy those properties and see if the model does in fact systematically gravitate to the ones that do.</p>\n<p>Finding an environment that satisfies all of these properties is likely to be far from trivial, and I suspect would end up being a significant portion of any project of this form. I suspect that the right way to do this would probably be to use some sort of physics sandbox. That being said, there are also other possibilities too including more complex environments such as Minecraft as well as simpler environments such as a gridworld. While I can provide lots of examples of the sorts of environments I’m envisioning here, I think the right thing to do is just to have a tight empirical feedback loop in terms of testing and iterating on lots of different environments (though I think you could probably do all of that iteration just in the physics sandbox setting).</p>\n<h2>The architecture</h2>\n<p>I think architecture is also going to be really important to getting something like this to work. In particular, for you to get capability generalization without objective generalization, you have to have a model which is doing some sort of internal search such that it actually has an objective that can fail to generalize.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-3\" id=\"fnref-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-3\">[3]</a></sup> I think there is good reason to believe that many modern architectures (LSTMs, Transformers, etc.) might just be able to do this by default—though I am not that confident in that assertion, and I think it might also be necessary to make some changes to make this possible. However, I am optimistic that at least some forms of capability generalization without objective generalization can be demonstrated in current models.</p>\n<p>In particular, some forms of capability generalization without objective generalization seem easier to demonstrate in current models than others.

In particular, I expect that the side-effect case will be significantly easier to demonstrate with current architectures than the instrumental case, since the instrumental case might require models which can learn more powerful search algorithms than we currently know how to implement (though it also might not—it’s currently unclear). However, I’m optimistic that at least the side-effect case will be possible to demonstrate in current models, and I’m hopeful that current models might even be up to the task of demonstrating the instrumental case as well.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Note that I am not the only person currently thinking about/working on this—most notably Rohin Shah at CHAI also recently developed a proposal to produce a demonstration of an inner alignment failure that shares many similarities with my proposal here. <a href=\"#fnref-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>In some sense, this is actually exactly what the worry is for AGI-level systems—if the environment is so complex that there are too many different proxies that we can’t all test during training, then we might not be able to catch the existence of a situation where our model generalizes perversely in this way even if one actually exists. <a href=\"#fnref-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>I call models which are doing search internally (and thus have some notion of an objective) “mesa-optimizers.” <a href=\"#fnref-6ddaeesCko7DxtT8A-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

    "htmlBody": "<div>There's a misconception that therapy is like paying someone to be your friend. While most therapists would disagree with that statement, there is a kernel of truth; therapy can often focus on emotional support, and getting those needs met. I sometimes joke that when friends need help, we suggest they see a therapist, yet in therapy, clients are asked to vent to their friends. This may sound like the person is being tossed back and forth, but there are two things at play here. The first is that many people rely on a few friends for more support than they can handle (hence being referred to a therapist), while others see a therapist partly from the worry of overburdening their friends (hence being challenged to open up to friends). The second, more complicated piece is that therapy and emotional support are actually two different things, fulfilling different needs, and there are many cases where one would work far better than the other.<br /><div><br /></div><div>The first and most obvious difference is that therapy is one-sided. The extent of this differs on an individual basis; some therapists may reveal that they too have had a parent pass away, so the client feels understood, while others may never mention their kids or partner under any circumstances. Emotional support, on the other hand, can go both ways. When a friend vents to you about their family, you can share similar experiences in greater detail, whether to tell them you can relate, give them advice, or even just to vent yourself. We are social creatures, so this can help us forge a deeper type of connection.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ideally, therapists are unbiased, and non judgmental. Of course, this is difficult in practice, which is why many therapists see their own therapists. Being in therapy can help therapists separate our own past experiences from the client's present, and compartmentalize anything that comes up without just shoving it into a messy closet to be dealt with in the far future. In contrast, your friends are likely to have biases, whether they're aware of them or not. Even a friend who wants the best for you may have a particular idea of what that looks like, whether that's in judging a potential partner or convincing you not to apply to college far away so you don't move. Friends also have little to no incentive to work on this, since this comes from having a deeper connection and wanting to stay in each other's lives. At best, a friend may be upfront about their judgments, letting you know that they struggled in the subject you want to study, and thus might not show enough excitement about it. This can in some ways even be helpful, particular if the thoughts and feelings of your friends matter a lot to you. However, if you want to make a decision without worrying about being swayed by the influence of others, you may want someone more removed.<br /><br />A therapist is going to provide a particular kind of expertise, though this is going to vary widely. A therapist's expertise depends on training and experience, and their focus can be anywhere from particular age groups or phases of life to types of diagnoses or lifestyles. This means whatever they specialize in, they know a lot about, including what's typical for people in this category and what problems often come up. A therapist who specializes in trauma is going to have a good understanding of how triggers work, and one who sees a lot of teenagers is going to understand the norms and culture of their generation. A good therapist will also provide disclaimers around any areas outside their scope or experience. For example, a therapist won't be able to give you medical or legal advice, but could help you deal with the stressors of finding a lawyer or help you examine your guilt around food. Of course, not everyone needs a therapist who specializes in their issue. Most therapists will know how to handle something like work stress or post-breakup depression, since these are pretty common issues. In some cases, you may need to find a therapist who understands you for your personality or lifestyle, like someone who understands your culture, is trained in trans issues or who has worked with military families. It all depends on your issues, how they show up, and how much you bring yourself in.<br /><br />To contrast, emotional support from a friend can be within and outside your friend's expertise, but their knowledge is limited to their experience. You may have a friend who is a nurse who you ask for medical advice, or a really tech-savvy friend to help set up your printer. Unlike a therapist, your friend is not confined to their expertise. Your college friend's advice to try a particular diet could come from a deep understanding of nutrition and health, or from a single article they read. However, this knowledge and expertise includes knowing you and your history. A therapist knows as much about you as you tell them, but a friend may have seen you dump your ex and regret it, and know that you're likely to do this again with your current partner. A childhood friend may even have met your parents and know that you get your anxiety from your mother, or that your father's strict nature has made you afraid of failure. Of course, such insights may or may not be correct; emotional support is usually higher variance.<br /><br />Aside from support, therapists teach clients social and emotional skills and techniques, provide access to resources, and help clients process difficult life events. A friend can help with some of this, but not all. For example, a friend can recommend a psychiatrist or help you find one, while a therapist can talk with your psychiatrist so that each knows how to better help you. A friend can help soothe your emotions and talk things through with you until you feel better, while in therapy, you can have an ongoing conversation that analyzes and processes anything that comes up around these stressors after the feelings seem to have faded. In some cases, this processing is the best way to make things better. However, for some, it just helps to have someone who cares about you around. A therapist may be able to talk with your doctor about your case, but cannot give you a ride to and from the clinic, or treat you to lunch after your appointment. Friends can provide comfort in daily life in a way that a therapist cannot.<br /><br />Good therapy is supportive and collaborative by design. Client and therapist share goals, and everything is confidential. Confidentiality can differ from person to person in friendships; you can probably think of a friend or two who can't keep secrets. Most friends also aren't thinking about your goals when providing support, though a very good or close friend might. Most importantly, when you lean on your therapist, you can know that they signed up for this. In fact, this is another reason why therapists often see therapists themselves; it's our way of taking care of ourselves, given that we sign up for a lot. Emotional support, meanwhile, is only one aspect of friendship, and not all friends will want to provide the kind of support that you need. If you notice yourself relying strongly on friends for emotional support, that's a sign that you may need to see a therapist; otherwise, it can hurt your relationships.<br /><br />This isn't to say that you shouldn't get emotional support from friends. Part of the work in therapy is to learn to do this in a healthy way, whether you're leaning on others or you're supporting them. The best scenario is a good balance of give and take that doesn't leave one person drained or unsatisfied. Good therapy and a good emotional support networks are not competitors, but rather two great tastes that taste great together.<br /><div><br /></div></div></div>",

I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me by replying to this email.<br> </p><p>Audio version <u><a href=\"http://alignment-newsletter.libsyn.com/alignment-newsletter-65\">here</a></u> (may not be up yet).</p><h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2><p><u><a href=\"https://learning-from-play.github.io/\">Learning Latent Plans from Play</a></u> <em>(Corey Lynch et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): This paper collects unsupervised data of humans playing with robotic control systems, and uses that data to thread a needle between two problems in learning. One problem is that per-task demonstration data is costly, especially as number of tasks grows; the other is that randomly sampled control actions will rarely stumble across complex motor tasks in ways that allow robots to learn. The authors argue that human play data is a good compromise because humans at play tend to explore different ways of manipulating objects in ways that give robots nuggets of useful information like &quot;how do I move this block inside a drawer&quot;, which can be composed into more complicated and intentional tasks.</p><p>The model works by learning to produce vectors that represent plans (or sequences of actions), and jointly learning to decode those vectors into action sequences. This architecture learns to generate plan vectors by using an autoencoder-like structure that uses KL divergence to align (1) a distribution of plan vectors predicted from the start and end state of a window of play data, and (2) a distribution of plan vectors predicted by looking back at all the actions taken in that window. Because we&apos;re jointly learning to unroll the (2) lookback-summarized vector such that it matches the actions actually taken, we&apos;ll ideally end up with a system that can take in a given plan vector and produce a sequence of actions to execute that plan. And, because we&apos;re learning to predict a vector that aligns with actions successfully taken to get to an end state from a starting one, the model at test time should be able to produce a play vector corresponding to feasible actions that will get it from its current state to a goal state we&apos;d like it to reach. The authors found that their Play-trained model was able to outperform single-task models on a range of manipulation tasks, even though those single-task models were trained with explicit demonstrations of the task.</p><p><strong>Cody&apos;s opinion:</strong> I really liked this paper: it was creative in combining conceptual components from variational methods and imitation learning, and it was pragmatic in trying to address the problem of how to get viable human-demonstration data in a way that avoids having to get distinct datasets for a huge set of different discrete tasks.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Iterated amplification</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/H5gXpFtg93qDMZ6Xn/aligning-a-toy-model-of-optimization\">Aligning a toy model of optimization</a></u> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Current ML capabilities are centered around <strong>local search</strong>: we get a gradient (or an approximation to one, as with evolutionary algorithms), and take a step in that direction to find a new model. Iterated amplification takes advantage of this fact: rather than a sequence of gradient steps on a fixed reward, we can do a sequence of amplification steps and distillation gradient steps.</p><p>However, we can consider an even simpler model of ML capabilities: <strong>function maximization</strong>. Given a function from n-bit strings to real numbers, we model ML as allowing us to find the input n-bit string with the maximum output value, <strong>in only O(n) time</strong> (rather than the O(2^n) time that brute force search would take). If this were all we knew about ML capabilities, could we still design an aligned, competitive version of it? While this is not the actual problem we face, <strong>due to its simplicity it is more amenable to theoretical analysis</strong>, and so is worth thinking about.</p><p>We could make an unaligned AI that maximizes some explicit reward using only 2 calls to Opt: first, use Opt to find a good world model M that can predict the dynamics and reward, and then use Opt to find a policy that does well when interacting with M. This is unaligned for all the usual reasons: most obviously, it will try to seize control of the reward channel.</p><p>An aligned version does need to use Opt, since <strong>that&apos;s the only way of turning a naively-exponential search into a linear one</strong>; without using Opt the resulting system won&apos;t be competitive. We can&apos;t just generalize iterated amplification to this case, since iterated amplification relies on a <em>sequence</em> of applications of ML capabilities: this would lead to an aligned AI that uses Opt many times, which will not be competitive since the unaligned AI only requires 2 calls to Opt.</p><p>One possible approach is to design an AI with good incentives (in the same way that iterated amplification aims to approximate <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NXqs4nYXaq8q6dTTx/humans-consulting-hch\">HCH</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/f1947668b183/alignment-newsletter-34\">AN #34</a></u>)) that &quot;knows everything that the unaligned AI knows&quot;. However, it would also be useful to produce a proof of impossibility: this would tell us something about what a solution must look like in more complex settings.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Amusingly, I liked this post primarily because comparing this setting to the typical setting for iterated amplification was useful for seeing the design choices and intuitions that motivated iterated amplification.</p><h3><strong>Forecasting</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lds9opZsAMbjuZp7h/coordination-surveys-why-we-should-survey-to-organize\">Coordination Surveys: why we should survey to organize responsibilities, not just predictions</a></u> <em>(Andrew Critch)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post suggests that when surveying researchers about the future impact of their technology, we should specifically ask them about their beliefs about what actions other people will take, and what they personally are going to do, rather than just predicting total impact. (For example, we could ask how many people will invest in safety.) Then, by aggregating across survey respondents, we can see whether or not the researchers beliefs about what others will do match the empirical distribution of what researchers are planning to do. This can help mitigate the effect where everyone thinks that everyone else will deal with a problem, and the effect where everyone tries to solve a problem because they all think no one else is planning to solve it. Critch has offered to provide suggestions on including this methodology in any upcoming surveys; see the post for details.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This is a cool idea, and seems worth doing to me. I especially like that the survey would simply reveal problems by collecting two sources of information from people and checking their consistency with each other: there isn&apos;t any particular argument being made; you are simply showing inconsistency in people&apos;s own beliefs to them, if and only if such inconsistency exists. In practice, I&apos;m sure there will be complications -- for example, perhaps the set of researchers taking the survey is different from the set of &quot;others&quot; whose actions and beliefs they are predicting -- but it still seems worth at least trying out.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8y7DcSF4eAkXoru4u/ai-forecasting-dictionary-forecasting-infrastructure-part-1-2\">AI Forecasting Dictionary</a></u> <em>(Jacob Lagerros and Ben Goldhaber)</em> (summarized by Rohin): One big challenge with forecasting the future is operationalizing key terms unambiguously, so that a question can be resolved when the future actually arrives. Since we&apos;ll probably need to forecast many different questions, it&apos;s crucial that we make it as easy as possible to create and answer well-operationalized questions. To that end, the authors have created and open-sourced an AI Forecasting Dictionary, which gives precise meanings for important terms, along with examples and non-examples to clarify further.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9G6CCNXkA7JZoorpY/ai-forecasting-resolution-council-forecasting-infrastructure\">AI Forecasting Resolution Council </a></u><em>(Jacob Lagerros and Ben Goldhaber)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Even if you operationalize forecasting questions well, often the outcome is determined primarily by factors other than the one you are interested in. For example, progress on a benchmark might be determined more by the number of researchers who try to beat the benchmark than by improvements in AI capabilities, even though you were trying to measure the latter. To deal with this problem, an AI Forecasting Resolution Council has been set up: now, forecasters can predict what the resolution council will say at some particular time in the future. This allows for questions that get at what we want: in the previous case, we could now forecast how the resolution council will answer the question &quot;would current methods be able to beat this benchmark&quot; in 2021.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yy3FCmdAbgSLePD7H/how-to-write-good-ai-forecasting-questions-question-database\">How to write good AI forecasting questions + Question Database </a></u><em>(Jacob Lagerros and Ben Goldhaber)</em> (summarized by Rohin): As discussed above, operationalization of forecasting questions is hard. This post collects some of the common failure modes, and introduces a database of 76 questions about AI progress that have detailed resolution criteria that will hopefully avoid any pitfalls of operationalization.</p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (Alignment)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nRAMpjnb6Z4Qv3imF/the-strategy-stealing-assumption\">The strategy-stealing assumption</a></u> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em> (summarized by Rohin): We often talk about aligning AIs in a way that is <em>competitive</em> with unaligned AIs. However, you might think that we need them to be <em>better</em>: after all, unaligned AIs only have to pursue one particular goal, whereas aligned AIs have to deal with the fact that we don&apos;t yet know what we want. We might hope that regardless of what goal the unaligned AI has, any strategy it uses to achieve that goal can be turned into a strategy for acquiring <em>flexible</em> influence (i.e. influence useful for many goals). In that case, <strong>as long as we control a majority of resources</strong>, we can use any strategies that the unaligned AIs can use. For example, if we control 99% of the resources and unaligned AI controls 1%, then at the very least we can split up into 99 &quot;coalitions&quot; that each control 1% of resources and use the same strategy as the unaligned AI to acquire flexible influence, and this should lead to us obtaining 99% of the resources in expectation. In practice, we could do even better, e.g. by coordinating to shut down any unaligned AI systems.</p><p>The premise that we can use the same strategy as the unaligned AI, despite the fact that we need <em>flexible</em> influence, is called the <strong>strategy-stealing assumption</strong>. Solving the alignment problem is critical to strategy-stealing -- otherwise, unaligned AI would have an advantage at thinking that we could not steal and the strategy-stealing assumption would break down. This post discusses <strong>ten other ways that the strategy-stealing assumption could fail</strong>. For example, the unaligned AI could pursue a strategy that involves threatening to kill humans, and we might not be able to use a similar strategy in response because the unaligned AI might not be as fragile as we are.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> It does seem to me that if we&apos;re in a situation where we have solved the alignment problem, we control 99% of resources, and we aren&apos;t infighting amongst each other, we will likely continue to control at least 99% of the resources in the future. I&apos;m a little confused about how we get to this situation though -- the scenarios I usually worry about are the ones in which we fail to solve the alignment problem, but still deploy unaligned AIs, and in these scenarios I&apos;d expect unaligned AIs to get the majority of the resources. I suppose in a multipolar setting with continuous takeoff, if we have mostly solved the alignment problem but still accidentally create unaligned AIs (or some malicious actors create them deliberately), then this setting where we control 99% of the resources could arise.</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Exploration</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/publications/Making-Efficient-Use-of-Demonstrations-to-Solve-Hard-Exploration-Problems\">Making Efficient Use of Demonstrations to Solve Hard Exploration Problems</a></u> <em>(Caglar Gulcehre, Tom Le Paine et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): This paper combines ideas from existing techniques to construct an architecture (R2D3) capable of learning to solve hard exploration problems with a small number (N~100) of demonstrations. R2D3 has two primary architectural features: its use of a recurrent head to learn Q values, and its strategy of sampling trajectories from separate pools of agent and demonstrator experience, with sampling prioritized by highest-temporal-difference-error transitions within each pool.</p><p>As the authors note, this approach is essentially an extension of an earlier paper, <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03732\">Deep Q-Learning from Demonstrations</a></u>, to use a recurrent head rather than a feed-forward one, allowing it to be more effectively deployed on partial-information environments. The authors test on 8 different environments that require long sequences of task completion to receive any reward, and find that their approach is able to reach human level performance on four of the tasks, while their baseline comparisons essentially never succeed on any task. Leveraging demonstrations can be valuable for solving these kinds of difficult exploration tasks, because demonstrator trajectories provide examples of how to achieve reward in a setting where the trajectories of a randomly exploring agent would rarely ever reach the end of the task to find positive reward.</p><p><strong>Cody&apos;s opinion:</strong> For all that this paper&apos;s technique is a fairly straightforward merging of existing techniques (separately-prioritized demonstration and agent pools, and the off-policy SotA R2D2), its results are surprisingly impressive: the tasks tested on require long and complex chains of correct actions that would be challenging for a non-imitation based system to discover, and high levels of environment stochasticity that make a pure imitation approach difficult.</p><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/\">Emergent Tool Use from Multi-Agent Interaction</a></u> <em>(Bowen Baker et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): We have such a vast diversity of organisms and behaviors on Earth because of evolution: every time a new strategy evolved, it created new pressures and incentives for other organisms, leading to new behaviors. The multiagent competition led to an <em>autocurriculum</em>. This work harnesses this effect: they design a multiagent environment and task, and then use standard RL algorithms to learn several interesting behaviors. Their task is hide-and-seek, where the agents are able to move boxes, walls and ramps, and lock objects in place. The agents find <em>six</em> different strategies, each emerging from incentives created by the previous strategy: seekers chasing hiders, hiders building shelters, seekers using ramps to get into shelters, hiders locking ramps away from seekers, seekers surfing boxes to hiders, and hiders locking both boxes and ramps.</p><p>The hope is that this can be used to learn general skills that can then be used for specific tasks. This makes it a form of unsupervised learning, with a similar goal as e.g. <u><a href=\"https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/\">curiosity</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/d92bd0fefc83/alignment-newsletter-20\">AN #20</a></u>). We might hope that multiagent autocurricula would do better than curiosity, because they automatically tend to use features that are important for control in the environment (such as ramps and boxes), while intrinsic motivation methods often end up focusing on features we wouldn&apos;t think are particularly important. They empirically test this by designing five tasks in the environment and checking whether finetuning the agents from the multiagent autocurricula learns faster than direct training and finetuning curiosity-based agents. They find that the multiagent autocurricula agents do best, but only slightly. To explain this, they hypothesize that the learned skill representations are still highly entangled and so are hard to finetune, whereas learned feature representations transfer more easily.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This is somewhat similar to <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10985\">AI-GAs</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/533c646a4b21/an-63how-architecture-search-meta-learning-and-environment-design-could-lead-to-general-intelligence\">AN #63</a></u>): both depend on <em>environment design</em>, which so far has been relatively neglected. However, AI-GAs are hoping to create <em>learning algorithms</em>, while multiagent autocurricula leads to <em>tool use</em>, at least in this case. Another point of similarity is that they both require vast amounts of compute, as discovering new strategies can take significant exploration. That said, it seems that we might be able to drastically decrease the amount of compute needed by solving the exploration problem using e.g. human play data or demonstrations (discussed in two different papers above).</p><p>More speculatively, I hypothesize that it will be useful to have environments where you need to identify <em>what strategy your opponent is using</em>. In this environment, each strategy has the property that it beats <em>all</em> of the strategies that preceded it. As a result, it was fine for the agent to undergo catastrophic forgetting: even though it was trained against past agents, it only needed to learn the current strategy well; it didn&apos;t need to remember previous strategies. As a result, it may have forgotten prior strategies and skills, which might have reduced its ability to learn new tasks quickly.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=\"https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/emergent-tool-use/paper/Multi_Agent_Emergence_2019.pdf\">Paper: Emergent Tool Use from Multi-Agent Autocurricula</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/20/20872672/ai-learn-play-hide-and-seek\">Vox: Watch an AI learn to play hide-and-seek</a></u></p><h3><strong>Applications</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05433\">Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning</a></u> <em>(David Rolnick et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): See <u><a href=\"https://jack-clark.net/2019/06/17/import-ai-151-us-army-trains-starcraft-ii-ai-teaching-drones-to-dodge-thrown-objects-and-fighting-climate-change-with-machine-learning/\">Import AI</a></u>.</p>",

Beyond that he doesn&#x2019;t know anything and can&#x2019;t do anything.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Not much can be achieved by the naked hand or by the unaided intellect. Tasks are carried through by tools and helps, and the intellect needs them as much as the hand does. And just as the hand&#x2019;s tools either &#x2022;give motion or &#x2022;guide it, so &#xB7;in a comparable way&#xB7; the mind&#x2019;s tools either &#x2022;point the intellect in the direction it should go or &#x2022; offer warnings.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Human knowledge and human power meet at a point; for where the cause isn&#x2019;t known the effect can&#x2019;t be produced. The only way to command nature is to obey it; and something that functions as the &#x2022;cause in thinking about a process functions as the &#x2022;rule in the process itself.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> All that man can do to bring something about is to put natural bodies together or to pull them away from one another. The rest is done by nature working within.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> The mechanic, the mathematician, the physician, the alchemist and the magician have all rubbed up against nature in their activities; but so far they haven&#x2019;t tried hard and haven&#x2019;t achieved much.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> If something has never yet been done, it would be absurd and self-contradictory to expect to achieve it other than through means that have never yet been tried.</p><p>[[Similar: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qu95AwSrKqQSo4fCY/the-outside-the-box-box\">not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change.</a>]]</p><p><strong>7.</strong> If we go by the contents of &#x2022;books and by &#x2022;manufactured products, the mind and the hand seem to have had an enormous number of offspring. But all that variety consists in very fine-grained special cases of, and derivatives from, a few things that were already known; <em>not</em> in a large number of fundamental propositions.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Moreover, the works that have already been achieved owe more to chance and experiment than to disciplined sciences; for the sciences we have now are merely pretty arrangements of things already discovered, not ways of making discoveries or pointers to new achievements.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> Nearly all the things that go wrong in the sciences have a single cause and root, namely: while wrongly admiring and praising the powers of the human mind, we don&#x2019;t look for true helps for it.</p><p><strong>10.</strong> Nature is much subtler than are our senses and intellect; so that all those elegant meditations, theorizings and defensive moves that men indulge in are crazy&#x2014;except that no-one pays attention to them.</p><p>[Bacon often uses a word meaning &#x2018;subtle&#x2019; in the sense of &#x2018;fine-grained, delicately complex&#x2019;; no one current English word will serve.]</p><p>[[An especially good example of this point, that nature is far more &quot;subtle&quot; than our senses and mind, is the generally counterintuitive fact that our universe runs on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Kqs6GR7F5xziuSyGZ\">quantum mechanics</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Bp8vnEciPA5TXSy6f/can-you-prove-two-particles-are-identical\">Can You Prove Two Particles Are Identical?</a>, Eliezer points to this weird aspects of reality that one is very unlikely to discover without the empiricism/appropriate tools and methodology which Bacon is advocating for.]]</p><p><strong>11.</strong> just as the sciences that we now have are useless for devising new inventions, the logic that we now have is useless for discovering new sciences.</p><p>[Bacon here uses <em>inventio</em> in two of its senses, as = &#x2018;invent&#x2019; and as = &#x2018;discover&#x2019;.]</p><p><strong>12.</strong> The logic now in use serves to &#x2022;fix and stabilize errors based on the ideas of the vulgar, rather than to &#x2022;search for truth. So it does more harm than good.</p><p>[[The next few aphorisms dealing with syllogism and axioms are made with reference to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_scientific_method#Aristotle\">Aristotelian &apos;scientific method.&apos;</a> In that classical approach, a few real-world examples are used to derive high-level <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bcM5ft8jvsffsZZ4Y/the-parable-of-hemlock\">universal rules or laws</a> which are then operated on with logic to derive further conclusions. See <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TuPA9JXLSafSC4Knh/book-1-1-37-the-inadequacy-of-current-science-1#9k3C6pz4K8AHpanCE\">this comment below</a> for more detail.]</p><p>The leap from a few examples to high-level general principles is what Bacon is calling out when in <strong>19 </strong>he speaks of  &apos;swooping up&apos; from particulars to general axioms. This is in contrast to his gradual, incremental, <em>inductive </em>method that starts with limited statements of rule and only slowly generalizes as more data is accumulated.]]</p><p><strong>13.</strong> The syllogism isn&#x2019;t brought to bear on the &#x2022;basic principles of the sciences; it <em>is</em> applied to &#x2022;intermediate axioms, but nothing comes of this because the syllogism is no match for nature&#x2019;s subtlety. It constrains what you can <em>assent</em> to, but not what can <em>happen</em>.</p><p>[[These remarks bear resemblance to those in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bcM5ft8jvsffsZZ4Y/the-parable-of-hemlock\">The Parable of Hemlock</a>.]]</p><p><strong>14.</strong> A &#x2022;syllogism consists of &#x2022;propositions, which consist of &#x2022;words, which are stand-ins [<em>tesserae</em>, literally = &#x2018;tickets&#x2019;] for &#x2022;notions. So the root of the trouble is this: If the notions are confused, having been sloppily abstracted from the facts, nothing that is built on them can be firm. So our only hope lies in true induction.</p><p><strong>15.</strong> There is no soundness in &#xB7;our&#xB7; notions, whether in logic or in natural science. These are not sound notions:</p><ul><li>substance, quality, acting, undergoing, being;</li></ul><p>And these are even less sound:</p><ul><li>heavy, light, dense, rare, moist, dry, generation, corruption, attraction, repulsion, element, matter, form</li></ul><p>and so on; all of those are fantastical and ill-defined.</p><p>[&#x2018;Rare&#x2019; = &#x2018;opposite of dense&#x2019;. Generation is the coming into existence of living things; corruption is rotting or falling to pieces, and so refers to the going out of existence of living things. For the next sentence: a &#x2018;lowest species&#x2019; is one that doesn&#x2019;t further divide into subspecies.]</p><p><strong>16.</strong> &#xB7;Our&#xB7; notions of the lowest species (<em>man</em>, <em>dog</em>, <em>dove</em>) and of the immediate perceptions of the senses (<em>hot</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>black</em>, <em>white</em>) don&#x2019;t seriously mislead us; yet even they are sometimes confusing because of how matter flows and things interact. As for all the other notions that men have adopted&#x2014;they are mere aberrations, not being caused by things through the right kind of abstraction.</p><p><strong>17.</strong> The way &#x2022;axioms are constructed is as wilful and wayward as the abstractions through which &#x2022;notions are formed. I say this even about the principles that result from vulgar induction, but much more about the axioms and less basic propositions that the syllogism spawns.</p><p><strong>18.</strong> The discoveries that have been made in the sciences up to now lie close to vulgar notions, scarcely beneath the surface. If we are to penetrate into nature&#x2019;s inner and further recesses, we&#x2019;ll need &#x2022;a safer and surer method for deriving notions as well as axioms from things, as well as &#x2022;an altogether better and more certain way of conducting intellectual operations.</p><p><strong>19.</strong> There are and <em>can be</em> only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. <strong>(1)</strong> One of them starts with the senses and particular events and <em>swoops</em> straight up from them to the most general axioms; on the basis of these, taken as unshakably true principles, it proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of intermediate axioms. This is the way that people follow now. <strong>(2)</strong> The other derives axioms from the senses and particular events in a gradual and unbroken ascent, &#xB7;going <em>through</em> the intermediate axioms and&#xB7; arriving <em>finally </em>at the most general axioms. This is the true way, but no-one has tried it.</p><p>[[Reminder that &apos;dialectics&apos; is generally Bacon&apos;s term for logic, but he is seemingly specifically referring to the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TuPA9JXLSafSC4Knh/book-1-1-37-the-inadequacy-of-current-science-1#9k3C6pz4K8AHpanCE\">logic and processes followed in Aristotle&apos;s methods</a>.]]</p><p><strong>20.</strong> When the intellect is left to itself it takes the same way&#x2014;namely <strong>(1)</strong>&#x2014;that it does when following the rules of dialectics. For the mind loves to leap up to generalities and come to rest with them; so it doesn&#x2019;t take long for it to become sick of experiment. But this evil, &#xB7;though it is present both in natural science and in dialectics&#xB7;, is worse in dialectics because of the ordered solemnity of its disputations.</p><p><strong>21.</strong> When the intellect of a sober, patient, and grave mind is left to itself (especially in a mind that isn&#x2019;t held back by accepted doctrines), it ventures a little way along <strong>(2)</strong> the right path; but it doesn&#x2019;t get far, because without guidance and help it isn&#x2019;t up to the task, and is quite unfit to overcome the obscurity of things.</p><p><strong>22.</strong> Both ways set out from the senses and particular events, and come to rest in the most general propositions; yet they are enormously different. For one of them <strong>(1)</strong> merely glances in passing at experiments and particular events, whereas the other <strong>(2)</strong> stays among them and examines them with proper respect. One <strong>(1)</strong> proceeds immediately to laying down certain abstract and useless generalities, whereas the other <strong>(2)</strong> rises by step by step to what is truly better known by nature.</p><p>[In calling something &#x2018;known to nature&#x2019; Bacon means that it is a general law of nature; &#x2018;better known by nature&#x2019; could mean &#x2018;a more general law of nature&#x2019; or &#x2018;a generality that is more completely lawlike&#x2019;.]</p><p><strong>23.</strong> There is a great difference between &#x2022;the <em>idols</em> of the human mind and &#x2022;the <em>ideas</em> of God&#x2019;s mind&#x2014;that is, between &#x2022;certain empty beliefs and &#x2022;the true seals [= &#x2018;signs of authenticity&#x2019;] and marks that we have found in created things.</p><p><strong>24.</strong> There&#x2019;s no way that axioms &#x2022;established by argumentation could help us in the discovery of new things, because the subtlety of nature is many times greater than the subtlety of argument. But axioms &#x2022;abstracted from particulars in the proper way often herald the discovery of new particulars and point them out, thereby returning the sciences to their active status.</p><p><strong>25.</strong> The axioms that are now in use are mostly made so that they <em>just</em> cover the items from which they arise, namely thin and common-or-garden experiences and a few particulars of the commonest sorts, so it is no wonder if they don&#x2019;t lead to new particulars. &#xB7;And it&#x2019;s not only the axioms, but also the way they are handled, that is defective&#xB7;. If some unexpected counter-example happens to turn up, the axiom is rescued and preserved by some frivolous distinction, rather than (the truer course) being amended.</p><blockquote>[[Once upon a time, the philosophers of Plato&apos;s Academy claimed that the best definition of human was a &quot;featherless biped&quot;.&#xA0; Diogenes of Sinope, also called Diogenes the Cynic, is said to have promptly exhibited a plucked chicken and declared &quot;Here is Plato&apos;s man.&quot;&#xA0; The Platonists promptly changed their definition to &quot;a featherless biped with broad nails&quot;.  - <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jMTbQj9XB5ah2maup/similarity-clusters\">Similarity Clusters</a>]]</blockquote><p><strong>26.</strong> To help me get my ideas across, I have generally used different labels for human reason&#x2019;s two ways of approaching nature: the customary way I describe as <em>anticipating nature</em> (because it is rash and premature) [Note from the preface: throughout this work, &#x2018;anticipation&#x2019; means something like &#x2018;second-guessing, getting ahead of the data, jumping the gun&#x2019;. Bacon means it to sound rash and risky; no one current English word does the job.] and the way that draws conclusions from facts in the right way I describe as <em>interpreting</em> nature.</p><p><strong>27.</strong> Anticipations are a firm enough basis for consent, for even if men all went mad in the same way they might agree one with another well enough.</p><p>[[consent = agreement]]</p><p><strong>28.</strong> Indeed, anticipations have much more power to win assent than interpretations do. They are inferred from a few instances, mostly of familiar kinds, so that they immediately brush past the intellect and fill the imagination; whereas interpretations are gathered from very various and widely dispersed facts, so that they can&#x2019;t suddenly strike the intellect, and must seem weird and hard to swallow&#x2014;rather like the mysteries of faith.</p><p>[[Bacon appears to be saying that the easy, quick, rash science is easy convince people of since it has low<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HLqWn5LASfhhArZ7w/expecting-short-inferential-distances\"> inferential distance</a> owing to it being derived from a few familiar examples; in contrast, his difficult and true science built on many observations and facts has high inferential distance, causing it to seem strange and weird.]]</p><p><strong>29.</strong> Anticipations and dialectics have their place in sciences based on opinions and dogmas, because in those sciences the aim is to be master of &#x2022;what people believe but not of &#x2022;the facts.</p><p><strong>30.</strong> Even if all the brains of all the ages come together, collaborate and share their results, no great progress will ever be made in science by means of anticipations. That is because errors that are rooted in the first moves that the mind makes can&#x2019;t be cured later on by remedial action, however brilliant.</p><p><strong>31.</strong> It is pointless to expect any great advances in science from grafting new things onto old. If we don&#x2019;t want to go around in circles for ever, making &#x2018;progress&#x2019; that is so small as be almost negligible, we must make a fresh start with deep foundations.</p><p>[&#x2018;Fresh start&#x2019; translates <em>instauratio</em>, from the verb <em>instauro</em> = &#x2018;make a fresh start (on a ceremony that has been wrongly performed)&#x2019;. Bacon planned a six-part work on science and its philosophy and methods, which he called his <em>Instauratio magna</em>&#x2014;his Great Fresh Start. There are other informal mentions of fresh starts in <strong>38</strong> and <strong>129</strong>, and the Great Fresh Start is referred to in <strong>92</strong> and each of <strong>115</strong>&#x2013;<strong>117</strong>. Bacon died six years after publishing the present work. It is Part 2 of the Great Fresh Start, and the only Part he completed.]</p><p><strong>32.</strong> This is not to attack the honour of the ancient authors or indeed of anyone else, because I am comparing not &#x2022;intelligences or &#x2022;competences but &#x2022;ways &#xB7;of proceeding in the sciences&#xB7;; and the role I have taken on is that of a guide, not a judge.</p><p><strong>33.</strong> This must be said outright: anticipations (the kind of reasoning that is now in use) can&#x2019;t pass judgment on my method or on discoveries arising from it; for I can&#x2019;t be called on to submit to the sentence of a tribunal which is itself on trial!</p><p><strong>34.</strong> It won&#x2019;t be easy for me to deliver and explain my message, for things that are in themselves <em>new</em> will be understood on analogy with things that are <em>old</em>.</p><p><strong>35.</strong> Borgia said that when the French marched into Italy they came with chalk in their hands to &#x2022;mark out their lodgings, not with weapons to &#x2022;force their way in. Similarly, I want my doctrine to enter quietly into the minds that are fit to receive it and have room for it. &#xB7;Forcing my way in with weapons, so to speak, won&#x2019;t work&#xB7; because refutations&#x2014;&#xB7;and more generally <em>arguments</em> pro and con&#xB7;&#x2014;can&#x2019;t be employed when what&#x2019;s at stake is a difference of view about first principles, notions, and even forms of demonstration.</p><p><strong>36.</strong> There remains for me only one way of getting my message across. It is a simple way, namely this: I must lead you to the particular events themselves, and to the order in which they occur; and you for your part must force yourself for a while to lay aside your &#x2022;notions and start to familiarize yourself with &#x2022;facts.</p><p><strong>37.</strong> Those who deny that anything can be known for sure &#x2022;start off their thinking in something like my way, but where they &#x2022;end up is utterly different from and opposed to where I end up. They say that <em>nothing can be known</em>, period. I say that <em>not much can be known about nature by the method that is now in use</em>. And then they go on to destroy the authority of the senses and the intellect, whereas I devise and supply helps for them.</p><p><em>The next post in the sequence, Book 1: 38-52 (Idols of the Mind Pt. 1), will be posted Tuesday, September 24 at latest by 4:00pm PDT.</em></p>",

But you have to go in through their ears. It&#x2019;s kind of like building <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/ship-in-a-bottle-21313\">this</a> ship-in-a-bottle LEGO set.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*SFme6GNcLMI0bOUn\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:81%\"></figure></span><p>In this post, we&#x2019;ll visualize what&#x2019;s happening in a learner&#x2019;s brain and see how a teacher can wield their specificity powers to teach concepts better.</p><h1>Mind-Hanging A&#xA0;Concept</h1><p>Reading a startup&#x2019;s pitch begins as a learning exercise: learning what the startup does. In <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/howtoapply/\">How to Apply to Y Combinator</a>, Paul Graham writes:</p><blockquote>We have to read about 100 [applications] a day. That means a YC partner who reads your application will on average have already read 50 that day and have 50 more to go. Yours has to stand out. So you have to be exceptionally clear and concise. Whatever you have to say, give it to us right in the first sentence, in the simplest possible terms. [&#x2026;]</blockquote><blockquote>The first question I look at is, &#x201C;What is your company going to make?&#x201D; This isn&#x2019;t the question I care most about, but I look at it first because I need <strong>something to hang the application on in my mind</strong>.</blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s worth unpacking and visualizing this part of PG&#x2019;s advice, because we&#x2019;ll see that the power to <strong>mind-hang</strong> the concept you&#x2019;re trying to communicate is closely related to the power of specificity. Stay tuned for that.</p><p>First, one more snippet from PG:</p><blockquote>The best answers are the most matter of fact. It&#x2019;s a mistake to use marketing-speak to make your idea sound more exciting. We&#x2019;re immune to marketing-speak; to us it&#x2019;s just noise. So don&#x2019;t begin your answer with something like &#x201C;<em>We are going to transform the relationship between individuals and information.&#x201D; </em>That sounds impressive, but it conveys nothing. It could be a description of any technology company. Are you going to build a search engine? Database software? A router? I have no idea. [&#x2026;]</blockquote><blockquote>One good trick for describing a project concisely is to explain it as a variant of something the audience already knows. It&#x2019;s like Wikipedia, but within an organization. It&#x2019;s like an answering service, but for email.</blockquote><p>I recently helped the founder of <a href=\"https://piershare.com/\">PierShare</a> craft his YC application. For the &#x201C;What is your company going to make?&#x201D; question, he had originally written the first sentence:</p><blockquote>PierShare is a new way for boat owners to easily rent a dock.</blockquote><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*noWYzXcXwLtfTekae7_wyQ.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>This is actually a pretty good answer because it&#x2019;s matter-of-fact, not marketing-speak, and I can already guess at a plausible <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iMQmfgieRKY62MC3z/the-power-to-judge-startup-ideas\">Value Prop Story</a>. Still, I recommended taking PG&#x2019;s advice to describe his company more concisely as a variant of something the audience already knows:</p><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Why not just write that you&#x2019;re &#x201C;Airbnb for boat docks&#x201D;?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Founder:</strong> Hm, how is that better though?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron: </strong>It builds the reader&#x2019;s mental model better and faster. Notice how in the next part of your application, you currently spend a lot of words describing these predictable qualities of your business:</blockquote><blockquote>* You have a user-friendly online system for both parties<br>* You handle the payment processing<br>* You handle the insurance stuff</blockquote><blockquote>If you just say &#x201C;Airbnb for boat docks&#x201D;, they instantly load a mental model of all that stuff, so you don&#x2019;t have to spell it out for them.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Founder:</strong> But it has important differences! Like, Airbnb&#x2019;s typical user just makes a one-time payment to rent someone&#x2019;s home for a night or two, while our typical user pays an ongoing monthly subscription to stay at someone&#x2019;s dock.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> I agree that this difference is important enough to mention in your application, but still, the fastest way to build their mental model of your business is to start with their pre-built mental model of Airbnb and then apply a patch. This is true to such a degree that if you <em>don&#x2019;t</em> invoke Airbnb as a shorthand to explain your business, they&#x2019;ll be wondering why not.</blockquote><p>Here&#x2019;s what we came up with in the end:</p><blockquote>PierShare is an Airbnb-like subscription service for boat docks.</blockquote><p>This diagram of the reader&#x2019;s mind illustrates how we&#x2019;re <strong>mind-hanging</strong> the concept of PierShare:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nwUe-_Wwryr0sVf1XV1j7A.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Since we know the reader is a savvy investor, it&#x2019;s safe to assume that the concept of &#x201C;Airbnb&#x201D; has an associated web of preexisting knowledge and intuitions. The reader knows that Airbnb is a marketplace broker, that marketplace brokers cater to two types of users: renters and rentees, that Airbnb has a streamlined customer experience, etc.</p><p>Compare this to &#x201C;a new way for boat owners to easily rent a dock&#x201D;:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gVQbn0v_-aLzy8ESjXXtnw.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:58%\"></figure></span><p>Sure, we can expect <em>some</em> preexisting knowledge and intuitions about renting stuff in general, and boating/docks in general, but it doesn&#x2019;t mind-hang the way &#x201C;An Airbnb-like subscription service for boat docks&#x201D; does. For example, the investor won&#x2019;t be able to confidently predict that PierShare handles payment processing, without reading farther into the application.</p><h2>Specifics Are Mind-Hangers</h2><p>Here&#x2019;s the complete answer we crafted for &#x201C;What is your company going to make?&#x201D; Can you tell what trick we&#x2019;re using in the second and third sentences?</p><blockquote>PierShare is an Airbnb-like service to match owners of water-docked boats (4M individuals in the US) to private dock owners (500,000 individuals in the US).</blockquote><blockquote>For boat owners who typically pay $1,000&#x2013;1,800/month to dock their boat (that&#x2019;s $12&#x2013;22k/yr, and they need this for their boat&#x2019;s 10- to 15-year lifetime), we let them find a privately-owned dock and save 30% ($4k/yr).</blockquote><blockquote>For dock owners (people who live adjacent to a waterway) who typically leave their docks empty because it&#x2019;s too much friction and hassle to rent it, we give them an easy $1k+/month revenue stream.</blockquote><p>That&#x2019;s right, we&#x2019;re hitting them with two Value Prop Stories! (Notice that a two-sided marketplace business always needs two Value Prop Stories: in this case, one for boat owners and one for dock owners.)</p><p>One reason for using Value Prop Stories here is that we want to show off the strength of the value-delta for both sides of the marketplace: putting an extra $4k/year into the pocket of each boat renter and $1k/month into the pocket of each dock owner.</p><p>But the other reason we&#x2019;re using Value Prop Stories is simply because they add specificity to the description of what the startup does:</p><ul><li>Dock owners are people who live adjacent to a waterway</li><li>Boat owners pay a lot for docking</li><li>Every year, there&#x2019;s a lot of money at stake for both</li></ul><p>We&#x2019;re using Value Prop Stories to slide &#x201C;Airbnb for for boat docks&#x201D; down the ladder of abstraction.</p><p>And in general, any time you&#x2019;re trying to explain a concept to someone&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;in this case, the concept of PierShare&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;it&#x2019;s helpful to slide it down the ladder of abstraction because specific details function as mind-hangers.</p><h1>Teach With Examples&#xA0;First</h1><p>When you want to teach someone an abstract concept, keep in mind that people love climbing the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pFvZXFWbtvKvGiACJ/how-specificity-works\">ladder of abstraction</a> from bottom to top. Brains are good at generalizing from specific experiences, but bad at grasping general concepts directly from generally-worded statements.</p><p>Here, let&#x2019;s ask your brain to grasp the following generally-worded statement of an abstract concept:</p><blockquote><strong>Don&#x2019;t Fall for the Sunk Cost Fallacy: General Statement</strong><br>When deciding whether to stick to a plan or change course, your current plan&#x2019;s sunk costs shouldn&#x2019;t affect your decision, as long as you compare the total expected value of each option.</blockquote><p>Did you manage to load the general principle into your head? Unless you immediately recognized this as a familiar principle, you probably had to read the description multiple times, slowly.</p><p>As your author, I should try not to make your brain do this! It&#x2019;s bad explanatory writing to hit you with a general principle without first giving you a mind-hanger for it. Look at this mess of dangling concepts I tried to fling at you:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CNi7ENjqp65ckI4pKHrG8Q.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>While the concepts I tried to fling at you have some internal structure to hold them together, they&#x2019;re currently just <strong>dangling</strong> over your brain&#x2019;s huge web of preexisting knowledge and intuitions. Frustrating, right?</p><p>But you probably won&#x2019;t even think to blame me for putting you in this situation. You&#x2019;ll probably blame yourself for being too &#x201C;dumb&#x201D; to deal with the dangling concepts that the &#x201C;smart&#x201D; author is trying to teach you.</p><p>Why did I put you in this compromised position? I guess I expected that you&#x2019;d just keep my general statement dangling in your precious working memory, and keep reading onward to the next thing I&#x2019;m going to say.</p><p>But now that we have the language of <em>mind-hanging</em> and <em>dangling</em>, we can see that this is an authorially-rude thing for me to do:</p><blockquote>Hey chump, just keep reading my explanation while your brain thrashes on my dangling concepts. I have no problem hanging this in <em>my</em> mind, so what do I care? I&#x2019;ll give you some mind-hangers whenever <em>I</em> feel like it.</blockquote><p>Alright, let&#x2019;s see the kind of mind-hanger I should have given you.</p><blockquote><strong>Don&#x2019;t Fall for the Sunk Cost Fallacy: Specific Example</strong><br>Imagine you&#x2019;ve paid $50 for tickets to see your favorite band perform a concert, but on the day of the concert, an unexpected blizzard hits your town. Now you have to decide whether to make the stressful one-hour drive through the blizzard to see the concert.</blockquote><blockquote>First, let&#x2019;s assign dollar values to all your options (approximating your <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Utility\">utility</a> function):</blockquote><blockquote>We&#x2019;ll define <code><strong>$0</strong></code> to be the baseline value of your average evening when you haven&#x2019;t bought concert tickets.</blockquote><blockquote>Seeing the concert is worth <code><strong>+$80</strong></code> to you.<br>(In other words, you were happy to buy the ticket for $50, but you wouldn&#x2019;t have bought it for more than $80.)</blockquote><blockquote>Driving through the blizzard is worth <code><strong>-$100</strong></code> to you.</blockquote><blockquote>Now all you have to do is compare the expected value of your two options: You can drive to the concert for an expected value of <code>(<strong>-$50 ticket</strong>) + (<strong>-$100 blizzard</strong>) + (<strong>$80 concert</strong>) = <strong>-$70</strong></code>, or do something else for an expected value of <code>(<strong>-$50 ticket</strong>) + (<strong>$0 average evening</strong>) = <strong>-$50</strong></code>.</blockquote><blockquote>Since <code><strong>-$70 </strong>&lt;<strong> -$50</strong></code>, you should forget about the concert. It&#x2019;s not worth going because of the blizzard. But if you&#x2019;re not trained in decision theory, your intuitive thought process might go like this:</blockquote><blockquote><em>&#x201C;The concert is worth <code><strong>+$80,</strong></code></em> <em>and I&#x2019;ve paid $50 for the tickets, so if I don&#x2019;t drive to the concert, I&#x2019;m missing out on the value of the concert and the value of the tickets, which is $130 of value!&#x201D;</em></blockquote><blockquote>Here we say that your intuition is committing the sunk cost fallacy, because the non-refundable ticket price ($50) is a sunk cost which has no bearing on how much value you&#x2019;ll gain or lose via your current decision whether to drive to the concert.</blockquote><p>Hopefully that example was pretty easy to follow. And now that you&#x2019;ve loaded it into your mind, you can use it as a mind-hanger to understand the general statement I&#x2019;m trying to teach you:</p><blockquote><strong>Don&#x2019;t Fall for the Sunk Cost Fallacy: General Statement</strong><br>When deciding whether to stick to a plan or change course, your current plan&#x2019;s sunk costs shouldn&#x2019;t affect your decision, as long as you compare the total expected value of each option.</blockquote><p>The general statement probably feels more understandable now that you&#x2019;ve installed mind-hangers for it.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OwcInBbcqYXXsHpgHIhzkA.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>My goal here obviously wasn&#x2019;t to teach you about the <a href=\"https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/\">sunk cost fallacy</a>, it was to show you what it feels like when an author forces you to read a general description of a concept instead of spoon-feeding you specific details that build on your preexisting knowledge and intuitions. It&#x2019;s easier to load a generic concept into your head if you first install mind-hangers for it.</p><p>By the way, my specific story even helped <em>me</em> understand the general concept better, because I realized that the <code><strong>-$50</strong></code> of buying the ticket appears in both Expected Value terms, so it cancels out of the expected-value comparison. So I was able to connect my abstract concept of &#x201C;sunk costs&#x201D; more directly to my abstract concept of expected value:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*mcAq_tt9Azdb0Lx4UEHCvg.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>The mind-hanging power of specific examples helps you teach others better and teach yourself better. Good to know, right?</p><p>In 2007, I stumbled on a life-changing blog post: <a href=\"https://gowers.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/my-favourite-pedagogical-principle-examples-first/\">My favorite pedagogical principle: examples first!</a> by the mathematician Tim Gowers. It has transformed how I&#x2019;ve been communicating concepts ever since. It was also the first inkling I ever got about the power of specificity. (It was a few more years before the dam broke and the other powers came rushing into my purview.)</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what Tim says is &#x201C;a very simple idea that can dramatically improve the readability of just about anything&#x201D;:</p><blockquote>Present examples before you discuss general concepts.</blockquote><p>So I&#x2019;m not making an original point here; I&#x2019;m repeating Gowers&#x2019;s point, albeit with a bit less math. I&#x2019;m also classifying &#x201C;teach with examples first&#x201D; as a kind of specificity-based mind-hanging power that deserves to be collected and showcased together with other specificity powers in a stupendous listicle.</p><h1>The Tragedy of Human Working&#xA0;Memory</h1><p>Why does our reading or listening comprehension break down when we&#x2019;re presented with a general concept before a specific example?</p><p>When you were first reading my 32-word general statement about avoiding the sunk cost fallacy, it taxed your working memory more than usual, and probably overloaded it. On the other hand, when you were reading my example of driving through a blizzard to see the concert that you bought tickets for, it didn&#x2019;t demand as much of your working memory, even though the total number of words was almost 10x higher. Why is that?</p><p>One of the saddest things about the human condition is how underpowered your working memory is. Your brain has 100B neurons and is the smartest thing in the known universe, but remembering a seven-digit phone number is a struggle&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;are you kidding me?</p><p>You can be a highly intelligent person, but if I fling a handful of dangling concepts at you and you&#x2019;re not ready with a sturdy mind-hanger, you&#x2019;ll just try to fasten them down with whatever you can: a few measly strips of working-memory duct tape.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*fEcSKZTDHozlIPHr.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:39%\"></figure></span><p>It&#x2019;s sad because the amount of working memory we have might be an easily-tweakable genetic parameter. Natural Selection might have been stingy with this parameter&#x2019;s value because we had enough for our ancestors&#x2019; needs. But now we&#x2019;re trying to build a technological society and it&#x2019;s clearly not enough working memory for <em>our</em> needs.</p><p>A superintelligent mind with a reasonable amount of working memory could process generic statements all day long and never whine about dangling concepts. (I feel like the really smart people on LessWrong and Math Overflow also exhibit this behavior to some degree.) But as humans with tragically limited short-term memories, we need all the help we can get. We need our authors and teachers to give us mind-hangers.</p><h1>Mind-Hanging vs. Grounding</h1><p>We&#x2019;ve <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pFvZXFWbtvKvGiACJ/how-specificity-works\">defined</a> <strong>grounding</strong> a term as describing a specific stimulus that you&#x2019;d mentally classify within that term. That kind of description falls within the shared space of both conversation participants&#x2019; preexisting knowledge and intuitions. So any grounding is also a valid mind-hanging.</p><p>On the other hand, you&#x2019;re allowed to mind-hang a concept on any other concept that your conversation partner is familiar with, so it&#x2019;s sometimes possible to offer people mind-hangings that aren&#x2019;t also groundings. For example, if our conversation partner was extremely familiar with decision theory, our general statement about the sunk cost fallacy wouldn&#x2019;t be dangling concept in their mind; the whole structure could hang entirely within their preexisting knowledge and intuitions.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*grHm_ZDcvuhMq4c6o6aQ_w.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:66%\"></figure></span><p><strong>Next post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FsYfkJNoNuEo7bW9R/is-specificity-a-mental-model\">Is Specificity a Mental Model?</a></p>",

It will thicken slightly, but we don't have time to let it\nthicken fully.  Add the oil and spices to taste.

This leads to two of the <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/free-to-play-games-two-key-trade-offs/\">three key trade offs.</a> Players are prevented from having fun because they are time restricted, either unable to play or unable to have the resources to play the way they would like, allowing the game to sell a solution to these problems. More perniciously, players become trained to constantly check in with the game in order to claim rewards and keep their resources from becoming idle. This can warp a person’s life more than one would think, changing behavior to allow timely access, and preventing focus on other subjects.</p>\n<p>This obsession effect, and the ability of real world time delays to be an interesting resource to include in trade-offs, have also caused these mechanics to seep into non-free games, especially RPGs.</p>\n<p>Resource rationing takes the form of timers. The form of the timer does a lot to determine how toxic the rationing will be to the player. There are several knobs one can turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Knobs</h3>\n<p>Many of these knobs represent related aspects, and thus are closely intertwined, but listing them out still seems useful. In each case, moving towards the first named end will reduce toxicity.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Steady versus Sudden: If a resource accumulates over time, does the resource accumulate gradually with no limit, gradually up to a limit, or all at once?</li>\n<li>Fixed versus Delayed: Does the resource replenish at a fixed time, or at a time after it is used?</li>\n<li>Slow versus Rapid: How frequently must one check-in to maximize results?</li>\n<li>Batched versus Disjoint: Are there multiple timers running simultaneously? If so, how hard are they to line up?</li>\n<li>Tracked versus Lost: How easy is it to track when accumulation is complete?</li>\n<li>Forgiving versus Punishing: How punishing is it to fail to check in?</li>\n<li>Isolated versus Cumulative: Are there cumulative rewards for reliably checking in? How important are they?</li>\n<li>Progressive versus Competitive: Are you in competition with others? If so, what kind?</li>\n<li>Queued versus Idle: Can you give orders in advance?</li>\n<li>Explained versus Mysterious: Can you tell what matters?</li>\n<li>Annoying versus Limiting: Are the things you get from timers the long-term limiting factor in your ability to do things?</li>\n<li>Incidental versus Central: Is timing the key determinant of your success?</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Knob 1: Steady versus Sudden</h4>\n<p>If you have a resource that replenishes steadily over time, then there is a broad window during which it is efficient to utilize that resource. Even if it has a maximum amount you can store, you can spend it at any point <em>up to and including </em>the moment you have stored up that maximum, with no losses. While you lose potential compound interest gained from whatever the resource might have bought you, and there are usually worries about maximum resource storage, the player can mostly relax most of the time. Even if the resource briefly stops accumulating, this tends to be a relatively light punishment. There is still the worry that spending the resource now is always better than spending it later, as it reduces future risk, and this can line of thinking can still be harmful.</p>\n<p>If you have a resource that replenishes all at once, then knob two becomes very important. The risk is that the time of the sudden accumulation becomes something the player worries about missing, and thus schedules around. The player might even sits idle waiting for that time to arrive.</p>\n<h4>Knob 2: Fixed versus Delayed</h4>\n<p>If you have a resource that replenishes once per day, at 12:00 midnight Pacific time, you have a full day-long window in which to use that resource. There is no reward or punishment for using it in the morning, afternoon or evening. The player does not feel distracted, and does not have to worry about losing resources when they delay. It <em>does </em>create potential large pressure near the end of the full period, if the resource has yet to be used and cannot be stored.</p>\n<p>If you have a resource that replenishes once per day, <em>twenty-four hours after it is used or claimed, </em>then every second you do not use the resource is another second it will be delayed, <em>forever. </em>If you wait until the time when it is convenient for you to use it, you will need to wait until after that time the next day, and generally run the risk of losing an entire cycle whenever things get delayed at all. There is no stable, relaxed equilibrium available.</p>\n<p>If the accumulation is delayed, then that raises the importance of several of the other knobs.</p>\n<h4>Knob 3: Slow versus Rapid</h4>\n<p>If full accumulation takes a day, then it is easy to see why this will probably not be too disruptive. Check-in need be at most once per day. A steady <em>and </em>slow accumulation is definitely mostly harmless.</p>\n<p>If full accumulation takes place every few hours, or less than that, then this can prove extremely disruptive, to the point of costing the player sleep and a constant state of distraction. This is especially true if it is also sudden and the next accumulation is delayed.</p>\n<p>The cost of potentially missing a full accumulation can have high emotional resonance. If you are given resources continuously, every moment that this is taken away can be seen as losing out on those resources. If you are going to continue to participate anyway, it can feel extremely bad to let this happen, and seems to be able to trigger the loss aversion circuits in our brains.</p>\n<h4>Knob 4: Batched versus Disjoint</h4>\n<p>If your timing triggers are batched, you can respond to each batch as one action.</p>\n<p>If your timing triggers are disjoint, you cannot do so without sacrificing efficiency, and the effective tax on your attention and time is much higher.</p>\n<p>Suppose your widgets renew every two hours, and your whatsits renew every three hours. You need to check in at hours 2, 3, 4 and 6 every six hour period. You get some benefit of being able to align the second three-hour window with the third two-hour window. If these are delayed triggers, than they might become slightly disjoint, and the intervening time might be wasted literally looking at a countdown timer. The alternative is to not wait around, but if you do that, then the two become fully disjoint.</p>\n<p>Consider a game where there are a bunch of different timers and queues – for example, you might have a construction timer, a research timer, an army training timer, a special reward timer and an army task timer. If these always lined up, you might be able to check in (let’s say) only three times per day with minimal loss, and each time you’d have a bunch of fun things to do. Instead, you feel bad if you do not check in <em>fifteen </em>times per day, and each time you have only one thing to do.</p>\n<p>Juggling <em>does </em>have an upside, <em>if</em> you have control over the length of the timers. If you have the ability to choose between different things to build, research or train each of which takes a different amount of time, then you can trade off what you want most per unit time against what will allow you to check back in at the same time? Similar planning problems involving when you sleep, work or are otherwise not going to check in can also be interesting, or they can risk actually disrupting your plans in bad ways. Or both.</p>\n<h4>Knob 5: Tracked versus Lost</h4>\n<p>If accumulation is easy to track, that is far less distracting. If you know that accumulation will be sufficient to take action, or will be at maximum levels, or otherwise what you want, at exactly 10:34 AM today, then you can set an alarm, or you can remember to check in at about that time, or you can have your phone notify you, ideally having the game send a notification at that time. The better and easier you can find out and track the right time to do things, the less attention you have to pay to make sure that you’ll be there at the right time, so less time and attention is wasted. It is important that games give you this information in forms that are easy to understand and to track.</p>\n<p>If accumulation is difficult to track, things can be far worse. An example of this is if the timers are misleading, forcing you to adjust them and to not be able to wait for your notifications. A prominent game I explored allows the player to speed up any timer by spending resources, with the last ten minutes of this process being free. Thus, if something has nine minutes to go, you can click on it to complete it now, so it is essentially finished but for your noticing, and the resource is effectively sitting idle. This ten minute window means that every timer in the game is off, and every notification of this type comes too late, forcing upon the player constant paranoia. It was a relief when, later in the game, average timer length expanded enough that ten minutes was no longer something worth worrying about.</p>\n<h4>Knob 6: Forgiving versus Punishing</h4>\n<p>What happens if you fail to check-in at the requested time? Do barbarians burn down your castle? Does your voyage through the stars run out of anti-matter, forcing an abandonment of all rewards or a payment of precious premium currency? Or does your progression only pause briefly until you are convinced to genuflect in the game’s direction in the form of a few clicks?</p>\n<p>If you can lose a lot of progress, or even a lot of your resources, by not paying enough attention, that is a very big deal and highly disruptive. You need to have a system where that almost never happens, or the game likely becomes unplayable. If all that happens is your accumulation temporarily halts, the other trade-offs can make this somewhat painful, but it mostly seems fine to play and note care much about full maximization.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty real-world terrible to hold these types of threats over people’s heads. I once read a website that described what machinations one should go through each evening players of a free-to-play game should go through, as non-paying players, <em>in order to be able to go to sleep at night. </em></p>\n<p>It is hard to imagine what is being offered in exchange for that, that would make the right response anything but the uninstall button.</p>\n<h4>Knob 7: Isolated versus Cumulative</h4>\n<p>If each timer is isolated, then missing one timer and its associated rewards does not impact future timers. Each timer is its own opportunity. The marginal penalty for missing one is small.</p>\n<p>If the timers are linked, then the important rewards are usually based on <em>consistently </em>checking in for <em>most or all </em>of the timers. The marginal benefit of meeting each deadline goes up as you meet more of them, and missing even one often sends you back to square one to start over.</p>\n<p>Extreme versions of this stretch rewards over periods of weeks or months, or require intense levels of activity on specified event days or weekends. You have to continuously spend time, then if you don’t focus in when they tell you to, most of what you have worked for is lost. The central ideas are the concept of having daily rewards that require not missing timers and then a daily reward for completing all the daily rewards, a login bonus or other reward for doing actions on consecutive days with no misses, and then a ‘mastery track’ that gives you increasing marginal returns for consistently getting all those daily rewards.</p>\n<h4>Knob 8: Progressive versus Competitive</h4>\n<p>If you are free to progress at your own pace in an essentially static world, the game will let you play in a way that is compatible with your life. You do not have to worry that other players will defeat you by making the sacrifices you won’t. All that happens if you don’t go crazy is that the game gets slower and harder. That might not even be a bad thing.</p>\n<p>If you are in a race against time because you face off against other players in a competition to power up the fastest, all starting from roughly the same point as a new shard or region is created, then you are at constant risk of falling behind if you do not maximize your time and money spends, especially if the timers are as central to progression as they usually are in free to play games.</p>\n<p>Games that are by their nature competitive races can offer unique and rich experiences. The risk is that when there is not clear separation between the resources of the game and the resources of your life, where does it end? The central reason the mechanics described in <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Meditations on Moloch</a> of sacrificing everything to keep up in zero-sum competitions doesn’t <em>actually</em> eat the world – the reason that, to quote an upcoming post that hopefully begins an important sequence, Moloch Isn’t Winning, is that such competitions are almost always asymmetrical and complex, with winning not being a direct function of effort and resources, and with the value of winning not being that centrally important.</p>\n<p>Games that centrally feature timers are usually <em>intentionally designed </em>to topple this barrier. Reward is explicitly locked to effort, in the form of money spent and time devoted, with skill and strategy intentionally crippled in importance beyond a basic level of competence. Thus, all the various complexities that make it not worth sacrificing one’s children to Moloch are removed from the equation.</p>\n<p>A game’s explicit structure of winning and losing also takes away the second most important defense, which is that it’s usually not as big a deal to not win such competitions as one might make it out to be. Games are about winning.</p>\n<p>Of course, as <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/\">Robin Hanson</a> would respond, games are not about winning. Which is also true and important, but doesn’t change the true and important, and more relevant in conext, fact that games are about winning.</p>\n<p>(Leaving a marker here for myself both to eventually fully explain this particular flip, and the general case viewpoint on how to approach when X isn’t really about Y but is also of course totally, totally about Y.)</p>\n<h4>Knob 9: Queued versus Idle</h4>\n<p>Queues, where you could take action in advance and tell the game what to do when the time came, would mitigate many of these issues. Build queues for towns or buildings in even turn-based strategy games can be the difference between such games being great versus being so tedious as to be almost unplayable. Many mobile games would be much better if, when you tried to do something but lacked the necessary resources, you could click a button that said “do this when resources are available.” Other similar tricks could be used in other situations.</p>\n<p>Idle however is the universal rule. You need to tell every resource what to do <em>after </em>it becomes available, or it will sit idle until you do.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to see why idle is chosen over queues. The whole point of the system, as we’ll discuss after the list is finished, is to force frequent check-in and obsession to facilitate habit formation, addiction and obsession. This potential solution is solving the player’s problem, not the game’s problem.</p>\n<h4>Knob 10: Explained versus Mysterious</h4>\n<p>This is a variation of Tracked versus Lost. If you don’t even know when checking in will be rewarded, then you certainly can’t track it. With Lost, you have a hard time remembering or recording exactly when something will happen, but you likely know more or less what will happen and about when it will happen. If things are sufficiently mysterious, you can feel an obligation to continuously check <em>in case </em>something happens, without any theory as to what or when or how. Eventually it becomes a compulsion without a justification.</p>\n<h4>Knob 11: Annoying versus Limiting</h4>\n<h4>Knob 12: Incidental versus Central</h4>\n<p>These last two knobs ask how much the game is fundamentally about its timers.</p>\n<p>Annoying timers mean that your life will be worse off if you miss them or mismanage them, but <em>over the long term </em>the number of check-ins is not the determining limiting factor of progress. You’ll end up in the same place. For limiting, that means that the timers give you the main source of the resource or resources that are the limiting factor for your progression. If there are severely limiting factors, it is quite possible for most other resources and accomplishments to not matter.</p>\n<p>Incidental versus central compares the generic value of what the timers give you to the generic value of what is otherwise available. In the extreme case, the key limiting resource is <em>only </em>available via timers, or even timers with checking in as the only requirement, and the rest of the game does not actually exist. Instead you end up in the situation described in a comment on my previous post, by Villam:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I will not mention the name of the game here. Anyway, it was the type of game where you build stuff, collect resources, and research new stuff; with many things to unlock. In the game there were three important resources, let’s call them X, Y, and Z. By making better or worse decisions, you could make more or less of the resources X and Y; and I spent some time optimizing for that.</p>\n<p>With resource Z, however, the basic way to get it was to <em>play the game regularly</em>. If you logged in at least N times a day, you got M points of resource Z per day; you couldn’t get more for playing longer, but you would get less for taking breaks longer than 1/N of the day. In addition to this, there were also some other ways to get resource Z, but this extra amount was always <em>smaller </em>than the amount you got for merely playing the game regularly. There was no smart strategy to at least double the income of Z. So, whether you did smart or stupid things had a visible impact on X and Y, but almost <em>no impact </em>on Z.</p>\n<p>Of course the resource Z was the one that actually mattered, in long term. Your progress on the tech tree sometimes required X and Y, but <em>always </em>required Z. And, of course, the higher steps on the almost-linear tech tree required <em>more </em>of the resource Z.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A popular variation of this is to make your progress impact the rate at which Z is collected when you check in. It then matters how efficiently you navigate the early stages in order to level yourself up, because it increases your timer rewards, and that is the primary thing to optimize for.</p>\n<p>Of course, all of that presupposes that your goal is to make your numbers go up as high as possible <em>over a very long term of calendar time </em>in a world in which the purpose of numbers going up is… to make them then go slightly higher than that, at ever slower rates. Not exactly the most enticing proposition, when stated that way.</p>\n<p>Ask this question: Would you do better long term if you did nothing today but check-in for the timers, or if you did everything else but didn’t check-in with the timers today?</p>\n<h3>As The Knob Turns: Toxicity versus Compulsion</h3>\n<p>Games with timers are using real world time as a managed resource. As noted, this can be an interesting design space and set of optimization problems.</p>\n<p>I see three categories of toxicity trade-offs regarding timers.</p>\n<p>There are timers that require toxicity because they are putting real world attention into the game as a resource constraint.</p>\n<p>There are games that are not trying to do that but which have to pay costs to avoid imposing costs.</p>\n<p>Then there are most of the games in the genre, which are mostly using Skinner box tactics to create habits and compulsive behaviors. Toxicity is not a bug, <em>it is a feature. </em>It is the hill that they climb. It is the killer app. Their goal is to turn all twelve knobs as far to the right as possible without players taking too much notice.</p>\n<p>The first case is sympathetic. I do believe that it is real and legitimate, and not merely a cover for the third case, but its presence in its good form is rare. An interesting choice requires trade-offs, so the desire to minimize toxicity and real world cost in exchange for in-game benefits becomes the real game. Done right, that’s cool, and you can’t have those real world stakes without at least some real world costs. There is a real trade-off. My best advice for a designer in these situations is to ensure that there are always reasonable solutions that impose only reasonable real world costs, and benefits of further attention have to decline rapidly beyond roughly the commit the player is intentionally making. It is also important that optimization <em>works, </em>with better approaches being faster and requiring less attention and check-in than poor approaches.</p>\n<p>The second case is also sympathetic, and in its full form is common. In addition to real world clock time being an interesting resource to trade-off, letting players sample the game at some rate, while imposing costs for moving faster, is a relatively friendly business model. You would prefer to avoid distracting the player outside of time intentionally dedicated to your game, and you would prefer to have that dedicated time focused on interesting game play decisions rather than engaging in micromanagement. Queues are helpful here, as are many of the other knobs, which can safely be turned far to the left.</p>\n<p>The third case is, unfortunately, the central case. Toxicity is turned on its head and embraced as the core game feature.</p>\n<p>From the players’ perspective, one must figure out how to navigate these dangers, and whether there is a path to doing so without the game becoming net negative. When deciding this, one needs to keep in mind that these systems are designed to hijack your brain, developing habits and compulsions that may be difficult to break. Thus, if things turn out to be bad, that badness is designed to prevent you from realizing this or from being able to execute on disengagement. One cannot do the calculation assuming one can think clearly in the future.</p>\n<p>Last time, I recommended looking at how often you were required to ping a game, and how punishing it was to fail to do so, as a way to estimate a game’s toxicity level. This remains a good simple heuristic. Looking at the knobs above allows you to flesh out this evaluation. When looking at the games I have been surveying, this made me realize that I had been fooled by at least one game into thinking it was far less toxic and far less relatively toxic than it was, and that I had to adjust modes of further play to reduce its toxicity level.</p>\n<p>From the designer’s perspective, whether or not you have ethical concerns, the question is how to balance the costs you impose on the player, the negative reactions the player will have to those costs, and the upside from getting players addicted and in the habit of playing your game every day and in any spare moment. Here is where we see that in each of the twelve cases, turning the knob to the right increases the rate at which habit and compulsion are imposed upon the player. Thus, the limiting factor will by default be what players will accept without running away screaming or otherwise realizing the game is not their friend.</p>\n<p>This leads into the question of how you measure that. I have been thinking a lot about what happens when you have very strong ability to measure specific short term outcomes, but much less ability to measure other longer term outcomes, and there are implicit hidden variables.</p>\n<p>Consider the following toy model of a free-to-play game player.</p>\n<p>The player operates based on hidden variables. They have ongoing levels of (related) things like Fun, Compulsion, Habit, Willingness to Pay, Willingness to Recommend, Annoyance, Goodwill, Trust, Social Ties, Sense of Accomplishment, and so on.</p>\n<p>The game cannot measure these directly. Instead, the game gets to measure things like hours played, what causes players to log out or keep playing in the moment, when players spend money, when players uninstall, how players manage their resources, review star ratings, and so on.</p>\n<p>Any given decision will get made largely based on optimizing those short term outcomes. Short term outcomes, especially time played and money spent, will loom large. It will be tough to justify sacrificing those outcomes to lay longer term foundations that may or may not exist or matter, or might even go in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>This is especially true because the correlations are strong between the observed short term outcomes and expected long term outcomes. There are even strong causal mechanisms explaining why good observed results now lead directly to good results later. Players who spend more now will spend more later. Players who play more now form the habits and compulsions to spend more later, as they ‘break the seal’ and identify themselves as people who spend money in this way. Interacting with friends or joining a guild leads to more social engagement.</p>\n<p>Combine that with the ease of optimizing between known options via A/B testing in order to hill climb on the details that lead to superior metrics, and you know that the special limited time offer will be the exact correct size and color and price and duration and timing and so on that maximizes short term profits.</p>\n<p>Measuring the formation of habits and compulsions is harder than figuring out what color causes more sales in the next hour, but it still offers solid metrics. You should see the trend lines moving in the appropriate ways almost right away, or the effect is not there. The downside costs all this imposes can be divided into two categories. There are the times that you flip a switch in someone’s head that says ‘this game is super toxic and I need to run away screaming right now.’ You learn to avoid doing that. However, there is also the gradual accumulation of annoyances and loss of trust and goodwill that comes from not giving players a good experience, or from imposing steady hard to notice costs upon them, or by being too repetitive, or what not. This sneaks up on you slowly, and any given decision is usually going to have a small impact that is not going to be directly measurable, but that will all add up over time.</p>\n<p>These and other related Goodhart’s Law problems explain a lot of what I see as clear failures to optimize player experience, and experience in other services and places across the internet and all of our civilization, in ways I plan to explore more, but I will stop here to avoid too much scope creep.</p>\n<p>The biggest question one wants to ask is, to what extent are you in case one versus case two versus case three. If you are in the first two cases, toxicity can be better or worse, but you should not expect toxicity levels to continue to rise, or for them to be especially deceptively high. If you are in the third case, you should assume that things are already worse than you think and designed to get steadily worse than that.</p>\n<p>Thus, one should look for knobs that are <em>intentionally turned to the right. </em>If there are mechanics that seem designed to force additional check-in times, to punish failure to check-in, to force you to form reliable habits or lose out on the bulk of rewards, and so on, that should be a big red flag. Combining this with looking at expected rates of check-in should give a good picture. Going down the line on all the knobs should give a better picture still.</p>\n<p>The next step in this exploration is to look at particular game mechanics in detail.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>How should a state tax investment income if it wants to maximize its citizens’ welfare? This sounds like a simple question but I find it surprisingly hard to think about. Here are some of the positions I’ve moved through over the last few years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taxing investment has distortionary effects, but we should have non-zero investment taxes for the same reasons we want a broad tax base in general—doubling the size of a tax quadruples its social cost, so it’s better to have lots of small taxes rather than a few big taxes. Whether we should have lower taxes on investment income or ordinary income mostly depends on whether taxes have a bigger impact on decisions about working or about saving.</li>\n<li>Using invest income taxes to fund redistribution only makes sense if they are disproportionately paid by richer people. But if they are, then by exactly the same token they will also reduce the incentives to become rich—in fact they have just as large a disincentive effect as an equally-progressive income tax. And that’s on top of disincentivizing and distorting saving. So we should just raise income taxes instead.</li>\n<li>We can decompose investment income into two parts—interested earned by capital at the risk-free rate, and an excess return from taking on risk (or illiquidity, or whatever). Taxing the risk-free returns seems bad, but taxing excess returns seems like it’s almost a free lunch: it reduces an investor’s losses as well as their gains, so they can just lever up their investments to offset the effect of taxes. The net effect is similar to implementing a large sovereign wealth fund, with the government and private investors splitting both the risk and the returns from productive investments. It’s probably preferable to a sovereign wealth fund, because it doesn’t require the state to literally own huge quantities of assets. Since risk compensation is the large majority of investment returns, it seems like capital gains taxes are good on balance.</li>\n<li>All of the risk incurred by a sovereign wealth fund or capital gains tax is ultimately passed back on to citizens, whether in the form of taxes or reduced public services or inflation. So a capital gains tax or sovereign wealth fund is actually only a good idea if citizens are systematically under-exposed to market risk. But most people invest relatively conservatively. So in fact these policies can mostly be justified as either corrections for credit market failures (to help people without savings get an appropriate level of exposure to market risk) or more realistically as paternalistic corrections for investment mistakes. They may still be a good idea, but the case is way more murky and other interventions may be more appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My current best guess is that we should tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income, but only tax returns above the risk-free rate. (So if I buy short-term government bonds, I owe no taxes, and if I make less than that then I get a deductible loss.) I think this is likely to be better than either the status quo or most of the alternatives I’ve heard seriously discussed.</p>\n<p>But given that my views have gone through this many revisions, my all-things-considered view is more like “This is really complicated, who knows.” I hope this post h helped move you in that direction.</p>",

It&apos;s a sad state of affairs, but from what I can tell the majority are content with them being low-effort social groups.</blockquote><p>In my experience this is fairly common &#x2013;&#xA0;most people who show up to meetups are just sorta there to hangout. If you get 20 people, maybe 3 of them will be driven to proactively &quot;do stuff.&quot; </p><p>I was chatting with a friend recently who said [paraphrased] &quot;Honestly I&apos;d rather go to a social gathering where I can just hang out than one where we&apos;re doing a bunch of effortful stuff... but I enjoy those meetups more when they&apos;re filled with the sort of people who <em>do </em>do effortful stuff (even if they&apos;re not right now). They&apos;re more... alive and interesting.&quot;</p><p>And this matched a couple years experience running the NY meetups &#x2013;&#xA0;it seemed like what most people wanted, most of the time, was fun social gatherings. </p><p>On any given meetup night, most of the value was not in &quot;the presentation on Bayes Theorem&quot; or whatever that gathered people together &#x2013;&#xA0;it was the chatting afterwards and talking about whatever else was interesting. If you ask someone &quot;would you rather just skip to the part where we hang out and chat, rather than do a workshop or listen to a presentation&quot;, many people would say &quot;yes.&quot;</p><p>Nonetheless... in eras when the NYC meetup swerved towards &quot;mostly social hangouts&quot;, attendance dropped, and the vibrance faded. There&apos;s a <em>lot</em> to do in NYC and &quot;just hang out&quot; isn&apos;t an exciting enough option to compete with many alternatives (including &quot;rousing yourself out of your house in the first place&quot;, which requires activation energy).</p><p>And I suspect this might be fairly common... at <em>any</em> given level of &quot;amount of effortful stuff you do.&quot; [1]</p><p>&quot;Hanging out&quot; is a valuable, important part of a healthy lifestyle. And the phrase &quot;hanging out&quot; implies <em>not</em> trying hard to build a new thing or learn a new skill.  If you hang an object out, you&apos;re draping it over a clothesline or couch or something and the object is not doing anything effortful.</p><p>A model here might be something like:</p><ul><li>People enjoy chill social spaces where they can relax and <strong>flow downhill. </strong>Do whatever is easy and fun.</li><li>But, when flowing downhill, the <em>amount of &quot;reward points&quot; you get is proportionate to your altitude</em> at the moment of flow. i.e. if you&apos;ve climbed 20 meters up, you get 20-chill-hangout-points for flowing down for one meter&apos;s worth of time. Then 19, for the next one, etc.</li><li>Therefore, even though at any given time one might prefer to chill, a healthy meetup needs to do dedicate time to <strong>climbing uphill, </strong>in the form of actions that are effortful but build up the overall ambition and interestingness of the social space.</li></ul><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p><strong>[1] Footnote that turned out to be an alternate model: </strong></p><p>For people naturally motivated to &quot;do stuff&quot;, I think there&apos;s a weird... &quot;uncanny summit&quot; (contrasted with uncanny valley) of people-who-&quot;do stuff&quot;-in-a-community context.</p><p>Romeostevens <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sJjmgQnTLE2j3gKTt/open-problems-in-human-rationality-guesses#6yEq9WkwT3BdHvruK\">made a provocative claim</a> in response to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gX8fcAwk3HGkFyJgk/what-are-the-open-problems-in-human-rationality?commentId=o3WG8eMzuQ5pKEiyD\">Scott Alexander&apos;s &quot;What are the Open Problems in Human Rationality?&quot; answer</a>:</p><blockquote>I think communities are typically about avoiding responsibility for making personal progress. People who choose to take a more central role in a community typically have emotional problems they are trying to work out via the dynamics in the community. The whole is typically much less than the sum of its parts.</blockquote><p>Something about this felt true, although I&apos;m not sure I agree on the terms that Romeo meant to convey. I think what I have to say here is mostly a different model, but felt enough like a response to Romeo that it seemed worth including the link back.</p><p>My subjective experience feels less like &quot;Meetups were a way to resolve emotional problems&quot;, and more like:</p><ul><li>Meetups were a way to meet basic emotional needs (i.e. feel valued)</li><li>Meetups were a reward signal I could attach to a project that I wanted to do, but was a bit lonely to work on by myself. i.e if I did some research, or thought a bunch of thoughts about a thing, it was nice to be able to give a presentation to a bunch of people and have them say &quot;thanks!&quot; at the end, rather than have it just sit in my mind or bring it up casually.</li><li>Meetups were a source of... well, guinea pigs for random social experiments.</li></ul><p>(I imagine Romeo looking at all of this through a different lens, part of which involves detaching from the particular social reward structure at play here, but I don&apos;t have a good enough sense of where he was coming from to respond within his frame)</p><p><strong>The Uncanny Summit of Meetups</strong></p><p>If you have zero people-who-do-stuff, you have a chill hangout space that lasts as long as it provides social value to the people involved.</p><p>If you have a few &quot;do-ers&quot;, whose projects and excitements <em>aren&apos;t</em> directly synergistic with each other, you have a space where do-ers show up and provide excitement and value, which acts as a social reward for the do-er doing their thing, and/or providing guinea-pigs if the do-er likes running social experiments.</p><p>This works so long as you have do-ers who are motivated to do things at &quot;meetup scale&quot;, who get social reward from the group. (This <em>can</em> last indefinitely depending on the do-er&apos;s goals and whether they&apos;re legit friends with people in the group, which depends in turn on social chemistry)</p><p>If you have a critical mass of do-ers who are interesting in the same thing, you have a <strong>brief window where it makes sense for the do-ers to do things together <em>through </em>the community.</strong> The community serves the sort of role that I think a lot of people come away from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pvim9PZJ6qHRTMqD3\">The Craft and the Community</a> sequence expecting.[2]</p><p>But frequently, do-ers end up with ambitions for their Things to Do that are larger or more intense than meetup-scale, which lead to forming orgs or teams, or even just solo projects that just aren&apos;t really amenable to &quot;present your thing at the local group.&quot; And these don&apos;t fit neatly into the &quot;community that you can easily join&quot; bucket. They require actually hiring people, which is a different sort of thing.</p><p>I have some sense that some people (including myself) had a particular vision of meetups that actually only works in a narrow set of circumstances. And rather than thinking of meetups as a place where Good Work Gets Done, it&apos;s better to think of meetups as part of an ecosystem where people flow, depending on where they are in life and what their goals are.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>[2] I don&apos;t think Eliezer actually meant people to come away from The Craft and the Community expecting community, in the way that some people (myself included) have tacitly assumed. </p>",

In the other approaches, my understanding is that the capability of the agents increases as more and more rounds of amplification/distillation take place.</li>\n<li>allowed communication: It seems like <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/strong-hch-bedb0dc08d4e\">weak and strong HCH</a> differ in the kind of communication that is allowed between the assistants (with strong HCH allowing more flexible communication). Within IDA, there is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yxzrKb2vFXRkwndQ4/understanding-iterated-distillation-and-amplification-claims\">low bandwidth vs high bandwidth oversight</a>, which seems like a similar parameter. I'm not sure what the other approaches allow.</li>\n<li>training method during distillation step: I think <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/HqLxuZ4LhaFhmAHWk\">IDA leaves the training method flexible</a>. According to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NTwA3J99RPkgmp6jh/an-62-are-adversarial-examples-caused-by-real-but\">this post</a>, factored cognition seems to use imitation learning and factored evaluation seems to use reinforcement learning. I think recursive reward modeling also uses reinforcement learning. HCH seems to be just about the amplification step (?), so no training method is used. I'm not sure about the others.</li>\n<li>entity who \"splits the questions\", coordinates everything during amplification, or selects the branches: In factored cognition, factored evaluation, IDA, and HCH, it seems like the human splits the questions. In Debate, the branches are chosen by the two AIs in the debate (who are in an adversarial relationship).</li>\n<li>entity who does the evaluation/gives feedback (\"the overseer\"): It seems like in factored evaluation, the human gives feedback. In Debate, the final judgment is provided by the human. My understanding is that in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/7Hr8t6xwuuxBTqADK\">IDA, the nature of the overseer is flexible</a> (\"For example, Arthur could advise Hugh on how to define a better overseer; Arthur could offer advice in real-time to help Hugh be a better overseer; or Arthur could directly act as an overseer for his more powerful successor\").</li>\n<li>what the overseer does (i.e. what kind of feedback is provided): I think the overseer can be passive/active depending on the distillation method (see my comment <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HqLxuZ4LhaFhmAHWk/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-1#92FzkKHZ9az8dezSH\">here</a>), so maybe this parameter isn't required in a \"minimal set\".</li>\n<li>required number of human feedback per round: In Debate, there is one feedback at the end of a debate round. In factored evaluation, it seems like the human must provide feedback at each node in the question tree (or a separate human at each node in the question tree).</li>\n<li>depth of recursion: It seems like IDA limits the depth of the recursion to one step, whereas the other approaches seem to allow arbitrary depth (see my comment <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Djs38EWYZG8o7JMWY/paul-s-research-agenda-faq#rHc4rSpZzM8jZvdd3\">here</a>).</li>\n<li>separation of task performance vs evaluation/oversight: It seems like in factored evaluation, there is an entity who does the task itself (the experts at the bottom of <a href=\"https://ought.org/images/presentations/2019-delegation/2019-eag-delegation-web.050.jpeg\">this diagram</a>), and a separate entity who evaluates the work of the experts (the \"factored evaluation\" box in the same diagram), but in factored cognition, there is just the entity doing the task.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would appreciate hearing about more parameters/dimensions that I have missed, and also any help filling in some of the values for the parameters (including corrections to any of my speculations above).</p>\n<p>Ideally, there would be a table with the parameters as columns and each of the approaches as rows (possibly transposed), like the table in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bnY3L48TtDrKTzGRb/ai-safety-success-stories\">this post</a>. I would be willing to produce such a write-up assuming I am able to fill in enough of the values that it becomes useful.</p>\n<p>If anyone thinks this kind of comparison is useless/framed in the wrong way, please let me know.

This post is influenced by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement\">double crux</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TGux5Fhcd7GmTfNGC/is-that-your-true-rejection\">is that your true rejection</a>, and this one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB-HKbtUdzM&amp;list=PLh10RgQgGuM-Jy4ADVLUjJZfCnaO9ILBR&amp;index=16&amp;t=0s\">really nice street epistemology guy</a>.</em></p><h1>The Problem </h1><p>Al the atheist tells you, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t believe in the Bible, I mean, there&#x2019;s no way they could fit all the animals on the boat&#x201D;.</p><p>So you sit Al down and give the most convincing argument on it indeed being perfectly plausible, answering every counterpoint he could throw at you, and providing mountains of evidence in favor.  After a few days you actually managed to convince Al that it&#x2019;s plausible. Triumphantly you say, &#x201C;So you believe in the Bible now, right?&#x201D;</p><p>Al replies, &#x201C;Oh no, there&#x2019;s no evidence that a great flood even happened on Earth&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;...&quot;</p><p>Sometimes when you ask someone why they believe something, they&#x2019;ll give you a fake reason. They&#x2019;ll do this <em>without even realizing they gave you fake reason!</em> Instead of wasting time arguing points that would never end up convincing them, you can discuss their cruxes.</p><p>Before going too deep, here&#x2019;s a shortcut: ask &#x201C;if this fact wasn&#x2019;t true, would you still be just as sure about your belief?&#x201D;</p><p>Ex. 1: Al the atheist tells you, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t believe in the Bible, I mean, there&#x2019;s no way they could fit all the animals on the boat&#x201D;</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Instead of the wasted argument from before, I&#x2019;d ask, &#x201C;If I somehow convinced that there was a perfectly plausible way to fit all the animals on the boat, would you believe in the Bible?&#x201D; (This is effective, but there&#x2019;s something subtly wrong with it discussed later. Can you guess it?). </p></div><p>Ex. 2: It&#x2019;s a historical fact that Jesus existed and died on the cross. Josephus and other historical writers wrote about it and they weren&#x2019;t Christians!</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">If you didn&#x2019;t know about those sources, would you still be just as sure that Jesus existed?</p></div><h1>General Frame</h1><p>A crux is an important reason for believing a claim. Everything else doesn&#x2019;t really carry any weight. How would you generalize/frame the common problem in the above two examples? You have 3 minutes</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Using the frame of probability theory, each crux would have a percent of the reason why you believe that claim. For example, say I&#x2019;m very sure (95%) my friend Bob is the best friend I&#x2019;ve ever had. 10% for all the good laughs we had,  30% for all the times Bob initiated calling me first/ inviting to hang out, and 60% for that time he let me stay in his guest room for 6 months while I got back on my feet.</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">If I woke up in a hospital and realized I dreamed up those 6 months at Bob&#x2019;s, I wouldn&#x2019;t be as sure that he was the best friend I&#x2019;ve ever had since I just lost a major crux/a major reason for believing that. </p></div><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/e1Nvo5w.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:96%\"></figure></span><p>What percentage of weight would a crux need to have to be considered a crux? What percentage would you consider a waste of time? Which cruxes would you tackle first?</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">This is arbitrary, and it may not matter for most people&#x2019;s purposes. I can say for sure I&#x2019;d like to avoid anything that has 0% of the belief! But regardless how you define &quot;crux&quot;, it makes sense to start with the highest weighted cruxes first and go down from there. </p></div><p>Ex. 3: Eating meat is fine, I mean, I&#x2019;m not eating that is that smart anyways. </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">If I proved that pigs are just as intelligent as dogs, would you still eat pigs?</p></div><p>Ex. 4: The Bible is horrible nonsense. There&#x2019;s no way a &#x201C;good&#x201D; God would have anybody eternally tormented. </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">&#x201C;If I proved that the bible had a believable interpretation such that people were just permanently dead instead of tortured, would it make better sense?&#x201D;</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">&#x201C;What if, after digging into the greek and early manuscripts, the most believable interpretation is that some people would be punished temporarily, but eventually everyone would be saved?&#x201D;</p></div><h1>Algorithm:</h1><p>What&#x2019;s an ideal algorithm for finding cruxes?</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">1. &#x201C;Why do you believe in X&#x201D;</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">2. &#x201C;If that reason was no longer true, would you still be just as sure about X?&#x201D;</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">    a. If no, you can argue the specifics of that reason using the techniques discussed in this sequence</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">    b. If yes, loop back to 1.</p></div><p>It would sort of go like this:</p><p>Bob: &quot;I believe [claim]!&quot;</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9aGwgCA.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:10%\"></figure></span><p>Alice: &quot;Okay, why do you believe it?&quot;</p><p>Bob: &quot;Because of [Reason]!&quot;</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75yJ5JB.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:29%\"></figure></span><p>Alice: &quot;If [Reason] wasn&apos;t true, would you still be just as sure about [Claim]?&quot;</p><p>And then we figure out if that ??% coming from [Reason] is a false reason (low/zero percent), or an actual crux (higher percent).</p><p>Note: There is still a ??% about the confidence for the claim. Alice could ask &quot;On a scale from 0 to 100, how confident are you about [Claim]?&quot;, which can be a very fun question to ask! If they said &quot;99%&quot;, this would allow you to rephrase the crux question to:</p><blockquote>&quot;If [Reason] wasn&apos;t true, would you still be 99% sure about [Claim]?&quot;</blockquote><h1>Least Convenient World:</h1><p>What&#x2019;s the relationship between finding cruxes and the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/neQ7eXuaXpiYw7SBy/the-least-convenient-possible-world\">least convenient world</a>?</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">The least convenient world is meant to prevent finding loopholes in a hard question and any other &#x201C;avoid directly answering the hard question&#x201D; technique. It&#x2019;s a way of finding the crux, to figure out what is actually being valued. </p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Oftentimes when trying to find someone&#x2019;s crux, and I say, &#x201C;imagine a [least convenient world] where your reason is not true. Would you still hold your belief as strongly?&#x201D;, there&#x2019;s an objection that that imagined world isn&#x2019;t true or likely! I can say, &#x201C;Oh, I&#x2019;m not trying to say it&#x2019;s likely to happen, I&#x2019;m just trying to figure out what you actually care about.&#x201D; and then I find out if that reason is an actual crux. </p></div><p>(This is covered in Scott&#x2019;s original post)</p><p>The beauty of finding cruxes this way is that you <em>don&#x2019;t actually have to have concrete information.</em> In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tAqPJhdWE2tMJnWvg/proving-too-much-w-exercises\">Proving Too Much</a>, I need to know a counterexample to prove the logic isn&apos;t perfect. In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4vQuNSwJvPFs7mSSs/category-qualifications-w-exercises\">Category Qualifications</a>, I need to know which qualifications for words my audience has in mind to choose which words I use. In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a8iQ3oT4kZvraTvrZ/false-dilemmas-w-exercises\">False Dilemmas</a>, I need to be able to know what object is being arbitrarily constrained, which qualifications correctly generalize that object, and have real-world information to brainstorm other objects that match those qualifications.</p><p>There is still an art to getting someone to understand for the first time the purpose of constructing a least convenient world (&#x201C;Oh, it&apos;s not meant to be realistic, just a tool for introspection!&#x201D;), but that can be figured out through practice!</p><h1>Final Exercise Set</h1><p>Ex. 5: I believe that pornography destroys love and there&#x2019;s a lot of scientific studies showing that it has negative affects. [Note: These are mostly all real life examples, and I&#x2019;m not just weird]</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">&#x201C;If I found a very well done study with a large sample size that determined that pornography consistently reduced crime rates without negative side effects, and the entire scientific field agreed that this was a well done study with robust results, would you still believe that pornography is bad?&#x201D; (In one of the street epistemologist&apos;s videos linked above, the guy replied, &#x201C;Well ya, because I&#x2019;m a Christian&#x201D;)</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Note how the scientific study didn&#x2019;t even have to exist to figure out that scientific evidence wasn&#x2019;t a crux</p></div><p>Ex. 6: I don&#x2019;t eat meat because of animal suffering</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">What if it was reanimated meat like on Star Trek? No actual animals involved, just reconfigured atoms to form meat. Would you eat it then?</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">If you were at someone&#x2019;s house, you&#x2019;re hungry, and they ask if you want the leftover meat that they&#x2019;re about to throw away. Do you eat it?</p></div><p>Ex. 7: I&apos;m actually a really good singer, and I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re discouraging me from it.</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">If you heard a recording of yourself and it sounded bad, would you still think you&apos;re a good singer?</p></div><p>Ex. 8: My recorded voice never actually sounds like me.</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">If I recorded my voice and it sounded like me, would you believe that your recorded voice sounds like you?</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">(These last two examples came from a conversation with my brother in high school. I was the one who thought I was a good singer, haha)</p></div><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This is my favorite technique to use when talking to anyone about a seriously held belief. It makes it so easy to cut through the superficial/apologetic/&quot;reasonably sounding&quot; beliefs, and start to truly understand the person I&apos;m talking to, to know what they actually care about. The other techniques in this sequence are useful for sure, but finding the crux of the argument saves time and makes communication tractable (Read: Find cruxes first! Then argue the specific points!)  </p><p>Final Note: due to other priorities, the Arguing well sequence will be on hiatus. I&apos;ve learned a tremendous amount writing these last 4 posts and responding to comments (I will still respond to comments!). With these new gears in place, I&apos;m even more excited to solve communication problems and find more accurate truths. After a few [month/year]s testing this out in the real world, I&apos;ll be back with an updated model on how to argue well.</p>",

This seems to be the most plausible alternative; mild optimization and impact measurement share many properties. But<ul><li>What happens if the agent is already powerful?

If we don't know if we can get value learning / reward specification right, we'd like safeguards which don't fail because value learning goes wrong.

Sequence \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/M4w2rdYgCKctbADMn/sequence-introduction-non-agent-and-multiagent-models-of\">Multiagent models of mind</a>\", article “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/why-subagents\">Why Subagents</a>?”</p><p>3. article \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XvN2QQpKTuEzgkZHY/being-the-pareto-best-in-the-world\">Being the (Pareto) Best in the World</a>\" </p><p><strong>Two sources are the basis for this exercise: </strong></p><p> - the idea (and practices) of Western esoterics on “biners neutralization” (in particular, quite widely and extensively it is described in the book “The Great Arcana of the Tarot” by Vladimir Shmakov, I don’t know if the book is translated into English) </p><p>- the method for developing the theme in screenwriting (in particular, “Substance, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting” by Robert McKee)</p><p>Here, I describe the exercise as I practice it – a cross between the two initial variants, and intended for self-development. </p><p><strong> Two words about what esoterics has to do with it: </strong></p><p>1. The academic study of esoterics - one of the areas of my interests.</p><p>2. If we consider the Western esoteric tradition from a psychological point of view, there are many methods and techniques aimed at “convergence” and “neutralization” of opposing personality traits/emotions/ ideas. It is enough to recall the alchemical procedures and visualizations, where the elements of fire and water “merge” together. It seems to me that in this body of knowledge, there is a lot of useful and undeservedly forgotten things.</p><p> <em>By the way, is it rational to have prejudices against “esoterics”? :) And do you have it?</em> </p><h2><u>I use the exercise in two versions.</u></h2><p><strong>The purpose of the <u>first one</u>:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>remove the severity of the confrontation between the opposing ideas or subagents </strong></li><li><strong>if possible - to achieve their synthesis. </strong></li></ul><p>It is like a Double Crux. With the difference that:</p><ul><li>exercise is purely intellectual, without focusing technic. It does not require you to merge completely with the role and feelings of the investigated subagent</li><li>unlike the Double Crux, the opposing subagents do not ‘negotiate,’ but merge, becoming the expression of some new value that they ‘did not understand’ before. </li><li><strong>it reduces the initial “weight “of any arguments of this subagent </strong>(both” for “and” against”).</li></ul><p>I use the same version of the exercise to mitigate cognitive biases – such as, for example, the physical attractiveness stereotype; good mood in sunny weather and a bad one in rainy weather; distortions of self-esteem. </p><p>I don’t know how well it works for everyone. I tested it only on myself. </p><p><strong>The purpose of the <u>second one</u>:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>to “expand” the competence of the “neighboring” subagents so that one task or project can cover several “needs” of the different subagents. (</strong>Implementing the principle of \"B<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XvN2QQpKTuEzgkZHY/being-the-pareto-best-in-the-world\">eing the (Pareto) Best in the World\"</a>) </li></ul><p>However, for this, it is necessary to identify areas where the “needs” of the subagents intersect, having the maximum utility. </p><p>Different utility functions of different subagents are best illustrated by the picture in the article “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3xF66BNSC5caZuKyC/why-subagents\">Why Subagents</a>?”, demonstrating path dependency in preference selection on a 2D graph, on one axis of which “utility” for subagent 1 is plotted, and on the other – “utility” for subagent 2. </p><p>In this modification, the exercise helped me to create something like a 3D map of my subagents, as well as to “configure” them in a more optimal way. </p><p>Again, I do not know how much my experience is reproducible. I am curious about what result you will get.</p><p><em>In addition to the psychological benefits, the exercise helps to learn to think broader, and I find it just intellectually funny.</em></p><h2><strong>Biner: An Idea I take from esoterics</strong></h2><p> A <strong>“biner” is simply two opposing ideas</strong> or two motives that draw in different directions. - Beautiful / Ugly, Knowledge / Ignorance, “I want to do push-ups”/“I don’t want to do push-ups.” </p><p>In Western esoterics is considered, that only one thing indeed “exist” – positive pole of a biner. Its opposite - negative pole - emerges automatically when the biner is activated. </p><p>In order not to write many times the “positive pole of a biner” and the “negative pole of a biner” I will use the terms <strong>Center (positive statement) and Shadow</strong> (the opposite statement, motive or idea). </p><p>For example, Centers are “Beautiful”/“I want ice cream,” their Shadows - “Ugly”/” I need to go to the store for ice cream ... no, I guess, don’t want it.” </p><p>Between the Center and the Shadow lies a spectrum of “intermediate solutions” – their androgynes: </p><ul><li>Oh, amazing! - Beautiful - Cute - <strong>Normal </strong>- Unhandsome - Ugly - What a nasty thing!</li><li>“I want to do push-ups!” - “I’ll do it ten times, and then we’ll see.” - “I should do some push-ups.” - “… but not today.” - <strong>“... To do push-ups?” -</strong> “No, I won’t do this” - “Push-ups are harmful!”. </li></ul><p><strong>Complete androgyne</strong> is the “central” androgyne; it contains 50/50 of Center and Shadow statements.</p><p>If we are talking about ideas, then in the complete androgyne they are most weakly manifested, and if about subagents, then, most likely, an unstable (or stable) balance of akrasia will arise. </p><p><strong>Opposed poles of biner (ideas or subagents) can be merged in the synthesis process if you can find and construct what they express on “higher level.”</strong></p><p>Moreover, the <strong>highest “energy” – i.e., the action potential – belongs to a complete androgyne</strong> (the pendulum “I want ice cream”/“I am too lazy to go for it” at any moment can swing into a full-fledged action or final rejection from it), and the <strong>lowest “energy” has a synthesis of biner</strong>. </p><p><strong>Therefore, the exercise has two variants:</strong></p><p>1. I am <strong>looking for “synthesis” – if I want to neutralize, </strong>or at least assign less “weight” to the preferences of individual subagents. </p><p>2. I am <strong>looking for a “complete androgyne” – if I know that this area of activity or role is essential to me, and I want to express it in an even more optimal way</strong>. </p><p>Following the idea that the Shadow does not have an independent existence, I assume that all subagents are always “internally” paired. </p><p>In other words, the subagent “I want to do push-ups” - and it’s opposition “You can kill me, but I will not do push-ups!” - represent the Center and Shadow of one subagent. </p><p>Shadow is “forces of resistance,” it doesn’t have its existence. Because if there is no question of sport, it doesn’t affect decision-making. </p><p>I<strong>t is the Shadow of a subagent that “engages” other subagents in the decision-making process to gain more weight</strong>. “I want to do sports (Sport).” “I want... but (Shadow of sport) later, now there is an interesting TV-show (Entertainment)... [and later] - I have just eaten, and after eating it is prohibit to engage in sports (Mom-so-said-20-years-ago)!”</p><h2><strong>The essence of the method: </strong></h2><p>1. <strong>Find the Center</strong> of the subagent – its value. - Center is the option to which the subagent has assigned the maximum (from its point of view) utility function. </p><p>2. Describe the <strong>Shadow.</strong> </p><p>3. <strong>Study the Center and the Shadow, using specific examples</strong>, each of which will be their manifestations as extreme as possible.</p><p>4. Consider the <strong>entire range of androgynes</strong> between the Center of the subagent and its Shadow, coming up with a few specific examples</p><p>5A. <strong><em>(Synthesis Search Exercise)</em></strong> <strong>Integrate Subagent and its Shadow</strong> (this is the most difficult, but the funniest) – In this aspect, the technique is a bit like a Double Crux. – <strong>As a result, the “weight” of the subagent’s arguments is reduced.</strong></p><p>5 B. <strong><em>(Complete androgyne Search Exercise) </em>Integrate two different “positive” Subagents, so that they reinforce each other,</strong> giving each other a “weight of votes” when making a decision. – In this aspect, the technique is similar to the ideas discussed in the article \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XvN2QQpKTuEzgkZHY/being-the-pareto-best-in-the-world\">Being the (Pareto) Best in the World</a>\", since it involves changing not the attitude to the activity, but <strong>changing the action itself</strong>, or changing its emphasis.</p><h2>The whole method is a constant movement across levels from abstract to concrete, and vice versa from concrete to abstract. </h2><p><strong>Example 1. Just an intellectual warm-up</strong></p><p>Let us choose the abstract idea of Light as our subject</p><p>1. Idea – Light.</p><p>2. The opposite – the absence of Light – Darkness.</p><p>3. The choice of specific “extremes” will determine in which direction I will continue to think – physical or psychological. If “physical” - then I will choose the photon / no photon if the psychological - the ability to see / blindness. </p><p>Suppose the first one: photon/absence of photon</p><p>4. The field of all intermediate states is all gradations of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Complete androgynes (probably), is a photon with an energy of 50 GeV (50% of the most energetic known photon). </p><p>5. Synthesis: something that is both a photon and not a photon, and has a lot of “hidden” energy My knowledge of physics suggests two options: - virtual pair “photon-antiphoton,” disappearing in a negligible time in a false vacuum- superposition of two light waves - similar, but 180 out of phase, which, when added, give 0 at a particular point (for example, during the destructive interference experiment)</p><p>If we chose the “subjective” plane: ability to see / blindness, then </p><p>4. A spectrum of androgynes is all possible qualia of colors and vision accuracy, associated with the quality of ability to see. Complete androgyne – healthy vision. </p><p>5. Synthesis: - someone who can see everything with absolute precision and clarity.- and at the same time - blind.</p><p>To resolve the contradiction “sees” and “blind” you need to rise to a “level higher,” realizing that the ability to see is not the ability of vision, but the ability of the mind. </p><p>Therefore, the synthesis could be a scientist or a prophet, or a project implementer (all who can “see” the causes and consequences of events).</p><p><em>If I were to use the exercise to develop the book’s theme, I would also do a “level down synthesis” – looking for something “worse than the worst” – for example, a prophet who makes a fatal mistake, or a sharp-eyed archer who does not see his wife’s betrayal happening literally “under his nose.” </em></p><p><em>The development of a character would go through the stages “Center,” “Shadow,” “Synthesis up,” and “Synthesis down” - in any chosen order. </em></p><p><em>For example, in the first part of the story, the protagonist is a religious leader, confident that he receives prophecies from the deity indicating how to lead his community (value – “Ability to see”). Then, he learns that all his predictions were fake because in reality, his closest ally manipulated by him (“Blind Prophet”). As a result of the struggle for power, the main character loses influence and finds himself in an underground dungeon (“Blindness”). Where he comes to the values of rational and scientific thinking (“Synthesis”), with the help of which he is freed and regains power. (The End :) )</em></p><p><strong>Example 2. Synthesis of opposing subagents – to reduce the “weight” of the particular subagents when making decisions. </strong></p><p>For example, there is a choice – to agree for work with more pay, but less free time; or to prefer all those cool things that I can buy for the additional money. </p><p>And I want to REDUCE THE ACUTE OF THE MONEY QUESTION to choose based on other criteria, and not to rationalize the decision that has already been made unconsciously.</p><p>1. It seems that the <strong>Central value</strong> for the “activated” subagent is money.</p><p>2. Will “stretch” it to extremes to <strong>reveal more precisely the Center and Shadow</strong>: a multibillionaire and a homeless beggar. </p><p>How are they different? – Ability to acquire and quantity of property, i. e. the investigated value is “purchasing power, “or more precisely –” ability to own” something. <em>T</em></p><p><em>he choice of “specific extremes” is the first psychological marker – what do I mean by “Money”? In this case, it turned out that this is “the ability to own.” But for another person (or for me in a different situation), it could be “security,” or “proof of self-worth to society,” or something else. </em></p><p>3. What are even <strong>more remote examples</strong> I can come up with for “own”/ and “not be able to own”? </p><p>More power than any modern multimillionaire (I think) possessed the ancient Egyptian God-Pharaoh: he owned everything on his land – even without having to “buy” it. </p><p>Less “power to own” than a beggar has a slave – he does not own his own body and his own time; a drug addict – he does not own his desires, or a madman – he does not “own” his consciousness. I choose to focus on the dichotomy” God-Emperor “-” Slave.” </p><p>4. There are various “quantities” of “ability to own” in the range between these two extremes – from a wealthy person who does not bother to earn money, but who still knows the limit of allowable expenses for himself, to a person who barely survives, earning pennies. </p><p>Somewhere in the middle is the “<strong>Complete androgyne</strong>” – the “average person,” who, in principle, is satisfied with his wealth, and what he owns, and the amount of free time he has. </p><p>5. <strong>Synthesis:</strong> someone who possesses “everything.+ someone who doesn’t even own himself + someone satisfied with the state of things –<em> and not wanting more</em>.</p><p>As a concrete expression of synthesis, the following come to my mind:</p><p>1) Pauper Mystic. - A person who possesses “everything,” but this “everything” is beyond the concept of money, - and he does not need anything from what the world has to offer; also he does not have “himself” in the sense that he subordinated himself to the inner spiritual discipline.</p><p>2) The Lion King (from the film of the same name, particularly in the scene where the old monkey lifts little Simba over the whole valley) – he does not have “everything” because he bought this valley, but because he <em>feels</em> himself responsible for this place, and feels himself the owner of this place. And he “does not possess” himself since he will make anything (including self-sacrifice) to protect peace in the valley. (Which legally can “belong” to the English colonists, or any other four-legged individual who said to herself “I responsible for this place”). </p><p><em>In the dramaturgy “worse than the worst” could be: the god-emperor, whom his priests keep on drugs; a beggar-madman who believes that he is Napoleon; the god-emperor, compelled to obey the most severe daily routine (as it was in ancient China); the king who was kidnapped and sold into slavery; a slave who was secretly seated on the throne, etc. – Such extremes catch us emotionally. </em></p><p>Such a study of values is convenient to do in the form of 2x2 table. (<em>But I don't know how to do it here):</em> </p><p><strong>Value: Ability to own (money)</strong></p><ul><li>Multibillionaire;</li><li>God-Emperor;</li></ul><p>--&gt; The one who owns everything <strong>Shadow:</strong></p><ul><li>Beggar;</li><li>Slave;</li><li>Mad man, Prisoner</li></ul><p>--&gt; The one who does not own even himself  <strong>Androgynes:</strong></p><ul><li>A man who inherits a million and spends it wisely ... or unwisely;</li><li>A man on the verge of begging;</li><li>The one who earns a lot, but gives the maximum of his earnings to charity;</li><li>The one who purposefully creates capital</li></ul><p><strong>Complete androgyne: </strong>Just an \"ordinary\" working man, who is <em>happy with everything</em>  </p><p><strong>Synthesis:</strong></p><ul><li>Pauper Mystic</li><li>The Lion King</li></ul><p>How does this all relate to the main question: Should I agree to a more monetary, but also more time-consuming work, or not? (Unless other considerations are not raised, of course). </p><p>During the synthesis, it should have become clear to me: “money” for the decision-voting subagent is a measure of how much I “own the world.” Or at least that part of the world that I can call a “home” (my district, my city, my country), and at the same time maintain a sense of “contentment” with myself. </p><p>But you can “own the world” without any money. Only by changing status in my own eyes – and becoming, like The Lion King, “the owner of the valley.” </p><p>As a result, the “money” factor gets less “weight” when deciding on a job. As well as when making other decisions, where “money” = “acquisition of things.”</p><p><strong>One more example: </strong>I love learning. Very much. But at the same time, it saddens me that time erases information, I can’t remember everything. </p><p>This synthesis is not to make any decision, but to reduce internal discomfort. The same technique is used to reduce cognitive biases when considering ideas such as Beautiful / Ugly, Smart / Stupid, Expensive / Cheap, etc.</p><p><strong>Value: </strong>Knowledge</p><ul><li>“Eternal student”</li><li>Scientist-universal</li><li>An AI that has all the knowledge in the world.

You need to give yourself time to think well. Or look for the necessary background information.</li><li>as a result of a properly executed synthesis, the “weight” of the arguments of the corresponding subagent is reduced. But do you want to reduce it? This could be anti-adaptive. </li><li>if the exercise is performed to remove internal conflicts, then to achieve a permanent effect, you should repeat it with some frequency. </li></ul><p><strong>Example 3. Searching for Complete androgyne – to include additional subagents in a specific activity. </strong></p><p>The purpose of this exercise is to find activities and projects that are fun and beneficial not only to one subagent, but to as many subagents as possible, and ideally help <strong><u>integrate the individual into a holistic agent</u></strong>. </p><p> I assume that the subagent who acts as the Center of desire and his Shadow (forces of resistance), taken by themselves, both are destructive forces. </p><p>For example “I want to run,“ driven to fanaticism, leads to injury and exhaustion, and “I do not want to run or do any other sports” – reduce the duration and quality of life. </p><p>At the same time, “I DO NOT WANT” “drags” other “game participants” to its side (I want to watch a movie; I want to play a game; I want to finish this work project today ... hmm, it is already midnight). </p><p><em>As all “stories” with subagents are very subjective, I give here as an example excerpts from my internal work. </em></p><p>I want to write books. I wanted this all my life. But at the same time, something prevented me from doing this and continues to interfere. - Circumstances, procrastination, work, family, etc.</p><p>1. <strong>Value</strong> – to write fiction novels </p><p>2. <strong>The opposite</strong> – not to write. But if I do not write, then what should I do? - Watch movies? Work? ... these are not opposites. The actual opposite is <strong><em>to live</em></strong>.</p><p>3. What is the real <strong>difference between Writing and Living</strong>? - The way of living the experience. The experience lived in imagination or bodily; a carefully reflexed and structured experience, or a spontaneous and chaotic one.</p><p><strong>Extremes:</strong> lock yourself in the attic and fantasize – or go on an expedition to the Amazon with only a compass. </p><p>4. <strong>Androgynes: </strong></p><ul><li>six months a year to travel, and six months to write fiction,</li><li>going in safe tourism, and lying on your travel blog about incredible adventures along the way, </li></ul><p><strong>Complete androgyne</strong>: a situation where I experience incredible adventures on odd days, and on even days I carefully record and analyze them (and the world stops and waits)</p><p> 5. <strong>What should a Complete androgyne express?</strong></p><ul><li>bright emotions and adventures</li><li>reflection, connections, and structure</li><li>both “external” and “internal” life is equally rich </li></ul><p>What other variants of Complete androgyne are possible?:</p><ul><li>develop and train myself to keep a specific type of diary and a precise vision of the world: notice all vivid things that are usually hidden in a routine, comprehend them - and organize my life in a “structure” that is so lacking. And then, perhaps, to release an exciting adventure memoir.</li><li>deliberately invent Adventures, organize them in a story - and to live these adventures</li><li>learn to “live” my own and others’ books with the maximum “effect of presence” (there are NLP-technologies for this)</li><li>use imagination to model my life situation-for example, carefully describing worlds of alternative solutions</li><li>master lucid dreams, and live in this state all that will be in my future book.</li><li>maximally gamify my life, turning it into an analog of RPG-fiction</li></ul><p><strong>Are there any subagents in my life that ALREADY implemented: bright emotions and reflection?</strong></p><ul><li>”From the side” of active life, I have - martial arts classes and sports competitions</li><li>”From the side” of observation and search for some “meta-knowledge“- the study of esoteric teachings, philosophy and science. As well as the hobby of diary and narrative techniques.</li></ul><p>Thus, these three subagents are already linked to each other, and it is possible:</p><p>1) to create one project, which would include interests of all “participants” (albeit not equally)</p><p>2) to find the benefits of each subagent in the activities of others, strengthening them. For example, from my top three: - write fiction- do karate- study the esoteric teachings of the world</p><ul><li>The “fiction writer” peers into esoteric teachings to take something new for the created world or heroes, and in karate – to reproduce on paper the real martial art experience and knowledge of proper techniques for describing combat clashes.</li><li>“Esoteric” with the help of science fiction “models” how it could be if this or that axiom about the world indeed was real and the practice of meditation helps me to be more focused and “grounded” in karate.</li><li>The “karateka” makes models combat interactions using fiction and seeks the spiritual principles of martial arts in the esoteric. I also physically perform the fightings that I think up for my books - this helps me to reinforce new technics and introduces an element of the game into my karate classes.</li></ul><p>Thus, doing one thing – creating a fantastic book – I satisfy the needs of three different subagents. Even if for two of them to a lesser degree than for “main” one (after all, for mastering karate the benefit of 1 hour of karate exercises is higher than 1 hour of composing a battle scene). </p><h2><strong>Pitfalls of the method</strong>:</h2><ul><li>instead of adhering to the Complete androgyne to deviate towards compromises, that do not satisfy any of the subagents. </li></ul><p>For example, I could combine “write” + “do karate” = “become a sports journalist.” – But “utility” for “write” and “do karate” in this case would be close to 0. Or “write fiction” + “esoteric interests” (+ “make money”) = “invent my religion” (how Ron Hubbard did) – But all my subagents “vote” that this is not the case, what they want. </p><ul><li>instead of trying to fuse opposites into androgynes – “mix” them trying to be multitasking: read books during push-ups; fantasize about the plot of the book - when I need to work out martial art techniques, etc. </li></ul><h2><strong>Ideas for exercises:</strong></h2><p>1. Define the complete androgyne and synthesis of the following ideas:</p><ul><li>Democracy</li><li>Flight</li><li>Warm sunny weather</li><li>Rationality</li></ul><p>2. What are three essential things you did today, or are planning to do? </p><ul><li>What subagents are behind these tasks? </li><li>Define for one of this subagents the field of androgynes and the Complete androgyne properties </li><li>Based on the Complete androgyne properties, what other your subagents could also be ‘involved’ in this task? </li><li>How could this task be changed to fit them more? </li></ul><h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1><p>1. The idea of exercise is that opposing ideas/desires/ subagents can be merged in two ways: </p><p>-  “vertical” - looking for something mutual for them at “level above.” As a result, the “arguments” of relevant idea or subagent receives less “weight” compared to other ideas and subagents.</p><p>- “horizontal” - looking for an activity or more complex idea, which expresses both opposing parts of an idea or subagent equally. In this case, such an androgyne can be “loaded” with meanings that are relevant for several other subagents. </p><p>As a result, you can invent an activity that is more important to the entire ensemble of subagents, and that requires complex competence. </p><p>2. Besides, exercise is also an intellectual challenge. It’s fun to do it, especially in a group - when it comes to integrating ideas and searching for complete androgyne for ideas and deeds. </p><p>3. <em>This is my first post here and I hope that the exercise will also be useful for the rational community.</em><br>  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>[Epistemic Status: Scroll to the bottom for my follow-up thoughts on this from months/years later.]</em></p><p>Early this year, Conor White-Sullivan introduced me to the Zettelkasten method of note-taking. I would say that this significantly increased my research productivity. I&#x2019;ve been saying &#x201C;at least 2x&#x201D;. Naturally, this sort of thing is difficult to quantify. The truth is, I think it may be more like 3x, especially along the dimension of &#x201C;producing ideas&#x201D; and also &#x201C;early-stage development of ideas&#x201D;. (What I mean by this will become clearer as I describe how I think about research productivity more generally.) However, it is also very possible that the method produces serious <em>biases</em> in the types of ideas produced/developed, which should be considered. (This would be difficult to quantify at the best of times, but also, it should be noted that other factors have dramatically <em>decreased</em> my overall research productivity. So, unfortunately, someone looking in from outside would not see an overall boost. Still, <em>my</em> impression is that it&apos;s been very useful.)</p><p>I think there are some specific reasons why Zettelkasten has worked so well for me. I&#x2019;ll try to make those clear, to help readers decide whether it would work for them. However, I honestly didn&#x2019;t think Zettelkasten sounded like a good idea before I tried it. It only took me about 30 minutes of working with the cards to decide that it was really good. So, if you&#x2019;re like me, this is a cheap experiment. I think a lot of people should actually try it to see how they like it, even if it sounds terrible.</p><p>My plan for this document is to first give a short summary and then an overview of Zettelkasten, so that readers know roughly what I&#x2019;m talking about, and can possibly experiment with it without reading any further. I&#x2019;ll then launch into a longer discussion of why it worked well for me, explaining the specific habits which I think contributed, including some descriptions of my previous approaches to keeping research notes. I expect some of this may be useful even if you don&#x2019;t use Zettelkasten -- if Zettelkasten isn&#x2019;t for you, maybe these ideas will nonetheless help you to think about optimizing your notes. However, I put it here primarily because I think it will boost the chances of Zettelkasten working for you. It will give you a more concrete picture of how I use Zettelkasten as a thinking tool.</p><br><h1>Very Short Summary</h1><h2>Materials</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.staples.com/Staples-Ruled-Index-Cards-on-a-Ring-Blue-Poly-Cover-3-x-5/product_365997?cid=PS:GooglePLAs:365997&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=365997&amp;KPID=365997&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlsiXtfn44gIVEv5kCh0rAA8HEAQYAiABEgIcGfD_BwE\">Staples index-cards-on-a-ring</a> or equivalent, possibly with:</li><ul><li><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DN6LN9C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">plastic rings</a> rather than metal</li><li>different 3x5 index cards (I recommend blank, but, other patterns may be good for you) as desired</li><li>some kind of divider</li><ul><li>I use yellow index cards as dividers, but slightly larger cards, tabbed cards, plastic dividers, etc. might be better</li></ul><li>quality hole punch (if you&#x2019;re using different cards than the pre-punched ones)</li><ul><li>I like <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XP9CPWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">this one</a>.</li></ul><li>Blank stickers or some other way to label card-binders with the address range stored within. </li></ul><li>quality writing instrument -- must suit you, but,</li><ul><li>multi-color click pen recommended</li><li>hi-tec-c coleto especially recommended</li></ul></ul><h2>Technique</h2><ul><li>Number pages with alphanumeric strings, so that pages can be sorted hierarchically rather than linearly -- 11a goes between 11 and 12, 11a1 goes between 11a and 11b, <em>et cetera</em>.

(Feel free to skip this part on a first reading.)</p><br><h1>Related Literature</h1><p>There are other descriptions of Zettelkasten out there. I mainly read <em>How to Take Smart Notes</em>, which is the best book on Zettelkasten as far as I know -- it claims to be the best write-up available <em>in English</em>, anyway. The book contains a thorough description of the technique, plus a lot of &#x201C;philosophical&#x201D; stuff which is intended to help you approach it with the right mindset to actually integrate it into your thinking in a useful way. I am sympathetic to this approach, but some of the content seems like bad science to me (such as the description of growth mindset, which didn&#x2019;t strike me as at all accurate -- I&#x2019;ve read some of the original research on growth mindset).</p><p>An issue with some other write-ups is that they focus on implementing Zettelkasten-like systems digitally. In fact, Conor White-Sullivan, who I&#x2019;ve already mentioned, is working on a Workflowy/Dynalist-like digital tool for thinking, inspired partially by Zettelkasten (and also by the idea that a Workflowy/Dynalist style tool which is <em>designed explicitly to nudge users into good thinking patterns</em> with awareness of cognitive biases, good practices for argument mapping, etc. could be very valuable). You can take a look at his tool, Roam, <a href=\"http://roamresearch.com/#/secretinvite\">here</a>. He also wrote up some thoughts about <a href=\"http://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/1283/1308\">Zettelkasten in Roam</a>. However, <em><strong>I strongly recommend trying out Zettelkasten on actual note-cards,</strong></em> even if you end up implementing it on a computer. There&#x2019;s something good about the note-card version that I don&#x2019;t fully understand. As such, I would advise against trusting other people&#x2019;s attempts to distill what makes Zettelkasten good into a digital format -- better to try it yourself, so that you can then judge whether alternate versions are improvements for you. The version I will describe here is fairly close to the original.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t strongly recommend my own write-up <em>over</em> what&#x2019;s said in <em>How to Take Smart Notes</em>, particularly the parts which describe the actual technique. I&#x2019;m writing this up partly just so that there&#x2019;s an easily linkable document for people to read, and partly because I have some ideas about how to make Zettelkasten work for you (based on my own previous note-taking systems) which are different from the book.</p><p>Another source on note-taking which I recommend highly is Lion Kimbro&#x2019;s <em>How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought You Think (<a href=\"https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/html/\">html</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/book.pdf\">pdf</a>).</em> This is about a completely different system of note-taking, with different goals. However, it contains a wealth of inspiring ideas about note-taking systems, including valuable tips for the raw physical aspects of keeping paper notes. I recommend reading <a href=\"https://gilest.org/lion-kimbro.html\">this interview with Lion Kimbro</a> as a &#x201C;teaser&#x201D; for the book -- he mentions some things which he didn&#x2019;t in the actual book, and it serves somewhat as &#x201C;the missing introduction&#x201D; to the book. (You can skip the part at the end about wikis if you don&#x2019;t find it interesting; it is sort of outdated speculation about the future of the web, and it doesn&#x2019;t get back to talking about the book.) Part of what I love about <em>How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought You Think</em> is the manic brain-dump writing style -- it is a book which feels very &#x201C;alive&#x201D; to me. If you find its style grating rather than engaging, it&#x2019;s probably not worth you reading through.</p><p>I should also mention <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/T382CLwAjsy3fmecf/how-to-take-smart-notes-ahrens-2017\">another recent post about Zettelkasten here on LW</a>.</p><br><h1>Zettelkasten, Part 1: The Basics</h1><p>Zettelkasten is German for &#x2018;slip-box&#x2019;, IE, a box with slips of paper in it. You keep everything on a bunch of note cards. Niklas Luhmann developed the system to take notes on his reading. He went on to be an incredibly prolific social scientist. It is hard to know whether his productivity was tied to Zettelkasten, but he thinks so, and others have reported large productivity boosts from the technique as well.</p><br><h2>Small Pieces of Paper Are Just Modular Large Pieces of Paper</h2><p>You may be thinking: aren&#x2019;t small pieces of paper bad? Aren&#x2019;t <a href=\"https://acritch.com/notepad/\">large notebooks just better</a>? Won&#x2019;t small pages make for small ideas?</p><p>What I find is that the drive for larger paper is better-served by splitting things off into new note cards. Note-cards relevant to your current thinking can be spread on a table to get the same big-picture overview which you&#x2019;d get from a large sheet of paper. Writing on an <em>actual</em> large sheet of paper locks things into place.</p><blockquote>When I was learning to write in my teens, it seemed to me that paper was a prison. Four walls, right? And the ideas were constantly trying to escape. What is a parenthesis but an idea trying to escape? What is a footnote but an idea that tried -- that jumped off the cliff? Because paper enforces single sequence -- and there&#x2019;s no room for digression -- it imposes a particular kind of order in the very nature of the structure.</blockquote><blockquote>-- Ted Nelson, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En_2T7KH6RA\">demonstration of Xanadu space</a></blockquote><p>I use 3x5 index cards. That&#x2019;s quite small compared to most notebooks. It may be that this is the right size for me only because I already have very small handwriting. I believe Luhmann used larger cards. However, <em>I expected it to be too small</em>. Instead, I found the small cards to be freeing. I strongly recommend trying 3x5 cards before trying with a larger size. In fact, even smaller sizes than this are viable -- one early reader of this write-up decided to use <em>half</em> 3x5 cards, so that they&#x2019;d fit in mtg deck boxes.</p><p>Writing on small cards <em>forces</em> certain habits which would be good even for larger paper, but which I didn&#x2019;t consider until the small cards made them necessary. It forces ideas to be <a href=\"http://www.dansheffler.com/blog/2015-08-05-one-thought-per-note/\">broken up into simple pieces</a>, which helps to clarify them. Breaking up ideas forces you to link them together explicitly, rather than relying on the linear structure of a notebook to link together chains of thought.</p><p>Once you&#x2019;re forced to adopt a linking system, it becomes natural to use it to &#x201C;break out of the prison of the page&#x201D; -- tangents, parentheticals, explanatory remarks, caveats, &#x2026; everything becomes a new card. This gives your thoughts much more &#x201C;surface area&#x201D; to expand upon.</p><p>On a computer, this is essentially the wiki-style [[magic link]] which links to a page if the page exists, or creates the page if it doesn&#x2019;t yet exist -- a <a href=\"http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2018/12/it-needs-wiki-like-superpower.html\">critical but all-too-rare</a> feature of note-taking software. Again, though, I strongly recommend trying the system on paper before jumping to a computer; putting yourself in a position where you <em>need</em> to link information like crazy will help you to see the value of it.</p><p>This brings us to one of the defining features of the Zettelkasten method: the addressing system, which is how links between cards are established.</p><br><h2>Paper Hypertext</h2><p>We want to use card addresses to organize and reference everything. So, when you start a new card, its address should be the first thing you write -- you never want to have a card go without an address. Choose a consistent location for the addresses, such as the upper right corner. If you&#x2019;re using multi-color pens, like me, you might want to choose one color just for addresses.</p><p>Wiki-style links tend to use the title of a page to reference that page, which works very well on a computer. However, for a pen-and-paper hypertext system, we want to optimize several things:</p><ul><li>Easy lookup: we want to find referenced cards as easily as possible. This entails sorting the cards, so that you don&#x2019;t have to go digging; finding what you want is as easy as finding a word in the dictionary, or finding a page given the page number.</li><li>Easy to sort: I don&#x2019;t know about you, but for me, putting things in alphabetical order isn&#x2019;t the easiest thing. I find myself reciting the alphabet pretty often. So, I don&#x2019;t <em>really</em> want to sort cards alphabetically by title.</li><li>Easy to write: another reason not to sort alphabetically by title is that you want to reference cards really easily. You probably don&#x2019;t want to write out full titles, unless you can keep the titles really short.</li><li>Fixed addresses: Whatever we use to reference a card, it must remain fixed. Otherwise, references could break when things change. No one likes broken links!</li><li><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/kinds-of-ties/\">Related cards should be near each other</a>. Alphabetical order might put closely related cards very far apart, which gets to be cumbersome as the collection of cards grows -- even if look-up is quite convenient, it is nicer if the related cards are already at hand without purposefully deciding to look them up.</li><li><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/\">No preset categories</a>. Creating a system of categories is a common way to place related content together, but, it is too hard to know how you will want to categorize everything ahead of time, and the needs of an addressing system make it too difficult to change your category system later.</li></ul><p>One simple solution is to number the cards, and keep them in numerical order. Numbers are easy to sort and find, and are very compact, so that you don&#x2019;t have the issue of writing out long names. However, although related content will be somewhat nearby (due to the fact that we&#x2019;re likely to create several cards on a topic at the same time), we can do better.</p><p>The essence of the Zettelkasten approach is the use of repeated decimal points, as in &#x201C;22.3.14&#x201D; -- cards addressed 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1 and so on are all thought of as &#x201C;underneath&#x201D; the card numbered 2, just as in the familiar subsection-numbering system found in many books and papers. This allows us to insert cards anywhere we want, rather than only at the end, which allows related ideas to be placed near each other much more easily. A card sitting &#x201C;underneath&#x201D; another can loosely be thought of as a comment, or a contituation, or an associated thought.</p><p>However, for the sake of compactness, Zettelkasten addresses are usually written in an alphanumeric format, so that rather than writing 1.1.1, we would write 1a1; rather than writing 1.2.3, we write 1b3; and so on. This notation allows us to avoid writing so many periods, which grows tiresome.</p><p>Alternating between numbers and letters in this way allows us to get to two-digit numbers (and even two-digit letters, if we exhaust the whole alphabet) without needing periods or dashes or any such separators to indicate where one number ends and the next begins.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s say I&#x2019;m writing linearly -- something which could go in a notebook. I might start with card 11, say. Then I proceed to card 11a, 11b, 11c, 11d, etc. On each card, I make a note somewhere about the previous and next cards in sequence, so that later I know for sure how to follow the chain via addresses.</p><p>Later, I might have a different branch-off thought from 11c. This becomes 11c1. That&#x2019;s the magic of the system, which you can&#x2019;t accomplish so easily in a linear notebook: you can just come back and add things. These tangents can grow to be larger than the original.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1568584395/Zettelkasten_Svg_1_iuqopd.svg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p><em>Don&#x2019;t get too caught up in what address to give a card to put it near relevant material. A card can be put anywhere in the address system.</em> The point is to make things more convenient for you; nothing else matters. Ideally, the tree would perfectly reflect some kind of conceptual hierarchy; but in practice, card 11c might turn out to be the primary thing, with card 11 just serving as a historical record of what seeded the idea.</p><p>Similarly, a linear chain of writing doesn&#x2019;t have to get a nice linear chain of addresses. I might have a train of thought which goes across cards 11, 11a, 11b, 11b1, 11b1a, 11b1a1, 18, 18a&#x2026; (I write a lot of &#x201C;1a1a1a1a&#x201D;, and it is sometimes better to jump up to a new top-level number to keep the addresses from getting longer.)</p><p>Mostly, though, I&#x2019;ve written less and less in linear chains, and more and more in branching trees. Sometimes a thought just naturally wants to come out linearly. But, this tends to make it more difficult to review later -- the cards aren&#x2019;t split up into atomic ideas, instead flowing into each other.</p><p>If you don&#x2019;t know where to put something, make it a new top-level card. You can link it to whatever you need via the addressing system, so the cost of putting it in a suboptimal location isn&#x2019;t worth worrying about too much! You don&#x2019;t want to be constrained by the ideas you&#x2019;ve had so far. Or, to put it a different way: it&#x2019;s like starting a new page in a notebook. Zettelkasten is supposed to be <em>less</em> restrictive than a notebook, not more. Don&#x2019;t get locked into place by trying to make the addresses perfectly reflect the logical organization.</p><br><h2>Physical Issues: Card Storage</h2><p>Linear notes can be kept in any kind of paper notebook. Nonlinear/modular systems such as Zettelkasten, on the other hand, require some sort of binder-like system where you can insert pages at will. I&#x2019;ve tried a lot of different things. Binders are typically just <em>less comfortable</em> to write in (because of the rings -- this is another point where the fact that I&#x2019;m left-handed is very significant, and right-handed readers may have a different experience).</p><p>(One thing that&#x2019;s improved my life is realizing that I can use a binder &#x201C;backwards&#x201D; to get essentially the right-hander&#x2019;s experience -- I write on the &#x201C;back&#x201D; of pages, starting from the &#x201C;end&#x201D;.)</p><p>They&#x2019;re also bulky; it seems somewhat absurd how much more bulky they are than a notebook of equivalently-sized paper. This is a serious concern if you want to carry them around. (As a general rule, I&#x2019;ve found that a binder feels roughly equivalent to one-size-larger notebook -- a three-ring binder for 3x5 cards feels like carrying around a deck of 4x6 cards; a binder of A6 paper feels like a notebook of A5 paper; and so on.)</p><p>Index cards are often kept in special boxes, which you can get. However, I don&#x2019;t like this so much? I want a more binder-like thing which I can easily hold in my hands and flip through. Also, boxes are often made to view cards in landscape orientation, but I prefer portrait orientation -- so it&#x2019;s hard to flip through things and read while they&#x2019;re still in the box.</p><p>Currently, I use the <a href=\"https://www.staples.com/Staples-Ruled-Index-Cards-on-a-Ring-Blue-Poly-Cover-3-x-5/product_365997?cid=PS:GooglePLAs:365997&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=365997&amp;KPID=365997&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlsiXtfn44gIVEv5kCh0rAA8HEAQYAiABEgIcGfD_BwE\">Staples index-cards-on-a-ring</a> which put all the cards on a single ring, and protect them with plastic covers. However, I replace the metal rings (which I find harder to work with) with <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DN6LN9C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">plastic rings</a>. I also bought a variety of note cards to try -- you can try thicker/thinner paper, colors, line grid, dot grid, etc. If you do this, you&#x2019;ll need a hole punch, too. I recommend getting a &#x201C;low force&#x201D; hole punch; if you just go and buy the cheapest hole punch you can find, it&#x2019;ll probably be pretty terrible. You want to be fairly consistent with where you punch the holes, but, that wasn&#x2019;t as important as I expected (it doesn&#x2019;t matter as much with a one-ring binder in contrast to a three-ring, since you&#x2019;re not trying to get holes to line up with each other).</p><p>I enjoy the ring storage method, because it makes cards really easy to flip through, and I can work on several cards at once by splaying them out (which means I don&#x2019;t lose my place when I decide to make a new card or make a note on a different one, and don&#x2019;t have to take things out of sort order to work with them).</p><br><p><strong>Deck Architecture</strong></p><p>I don&#x2019;t keep the cards perfectly sorted all the time. Instead, I divide things up into sorted and not-yet-sorted:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1568584395/Zettelkasten_2_svg_blhwed.svg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>(Blue in this image mean &#x201C;written on&#x201D; -- they&#x2019;re all actually white except for the yellow divider, although of course you could use colored cards if you like.)</p><br><p><strong>Fetch Modi</strong></p><p>As I write on blank cards, I just leave them where they are, rather than immediately putting them into the sort ordering. I sort them in later. (Unsorted cards still have addresses and can be referenced. <em>The address is always, always the very first thing I write on a card.</em>)</p><p>There is an advantage to this approach beyond the efficiency of sorting things all at once. The unsorted cards are a physical record of <em>what I&#x2019;m actively working on</em>. Since cards are so small, working on an idea almost always means creating new cards. So, I can easily jump back into whatever I was thinking about last time I handled the binder of cards.</p><p>Unless you have a specific new idea you want to think about (in which case you start a new card, or, go find the most closely related cards in your existing pile), there are basically two ways to enter into your card deck: from the front, and from the back. The front is &#x201C;top-down&#x201D; (both literally and figuratively), going from bigger ideas to smaller details. It&#x2019;s more breadth-first. You&#x2019;re likely to notice an idea which you&#x2019;ve been neglecting, and start a new branch from it. Starting from the back, on the other hand, is depth-first. You&#x2019;re continuing to go deeper into a branch which you&#x2019;ve already developed some depth in.</p><p><strong><em>Don&#x2019;t sort too often.</em></strong> The unsorted cards are a valuable record of what you&#x2019;ve been thinking about. I&#x2019;ve regretted sorting too frequently -- it feels like I have to start over, find the interesting open questions buried in my stack of cards all over again.</p><p>In theory, one could also move cards from sorted to unsorted specifically to remind oneself to work on those cards, but I haven&#x2019;t really used this tactic.</p><p>The advantage of sorting is to make address lookup easier. But, actually, address lookup in my unsorted cards is not that hard! Because the cards remain in creation-order, I know that e.g. card 10a1 must come <em>somewhere</em> after card 10a. It just doesn&apos;t need to be <em>immediately</em> after when the cards aren&apos;t sorted. </p><br><p><strong>Splitting &amp; Deck Management</strong></p><p>When a ring feels over-full (after I fill approximately 100 cards), I sort all of the cards, and split the deck into two. (Look for a sensible place to split the tree into two -- you want to avoid a deep branch being split up into two separate decks, as much as you can.) Load up the two new decks with 50ish blank cards each, and stick them on new rings.</p><p>Everything is still on one big addressing system, so, it is a good idea to label the two new binders with the address range within. I use blank stickers, which I put on the front of each ring binder. The labels serve both to keep lookup easy (I don&#x2019;t want to be guessing about which binder certain addresses are in), and also, to remind me to limit the addresses within a given deck.</p><p>For example, suppose this is my first deck of cards (so before the split, it holds everything). Let&#x2019;s say there are 30 cards underneath &#x201C;1&#x201D;, 20 cards underneath &#x201C;2&#x201D;, and then about 50 more cards total, under the numbers 3 through 14.</p><p>I would split this deck into a &#x201C;1 through 2&#x201D; deck, and a &#x201C;3 through *&#x201D; deck -- the * meaning &#x201C;anything&#x201D;. You might think it would be &#x201C;3 through 14&#x201D;, but, when I make card 15, it would go in that deck. So at any time, you have one deck of cards with no upper bound. On the other hand, when you are working with the &#x201C;1 - 2&#x201D; deck, you don&#x2019;t want to mistakenly make a card 3; you&#x2019;ve already got a card 3 somewhere. You don&#x2019;t want duplicate addresses anywhere!</p><p>Currently, I have 6 decks: 0 - 1.4, 1.5 - 1.*, 2 - 2.4, 2.5 - 2.*, 3, and 4 - 4.*. (I was foolish when I started my Zettelkasten, and used the decimal system rather than the alphanumeric system. I switched quickly, but all my top-level addresses are still decimal. So, I have a lot of mixed-address cards, such as 1.3a1, 1.5.2a2, 2.6b4a, etc. As for why my numbers start at 0 rather than 1, I&#x2019;ll discuss that in the &#x201C;Index &amp; Bibliography&#x201D; section.)</p><p>I like to have the unsorted/blank &#x201C;short-term memory&#x201D; section on every single deck, so that I can conveniently start thinking about stuff within that deck without grabbing anything else. However, it might also make sense to have only one &#x201C;short-term memory&#x201D; in order to keep yourself more focused (and so that there&#x2019;s only one place to check when you want to remember what you were recently working on!).</p><br><h2>Getting Started: Your First Card</h2><p><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/your-first-note/\">Your first note</a> doesn&#x2019;t need to be anything important -- it isn&#x2019;t as if every idea you put into your Zettelkasten has to be &#x201C;underneath&#x201D; it. Remember, you aren&#x2019;t trying to invent <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/\">a good category system</a>. Not every card has to look like a core idea with bullet points which elaborate on that idea, like my example in the previous section. You can just start writing whatever. In fact, it might be good if you make your first cards messy and unimportant, just to make sure you don&#x2019;t feel like everything has to be nicely organized and highly significant.</p><p>On the other hand, it might be important to have a good starting point, if you really want to give Zettelkasten a chance.</p><p>I mentioned that I knew I liked Zettelkasten within the first 30 minutes. I think it might be important that when I sat down to try it, I had an idea I was excited to work on. It wasn&#x2019;t a nice solid mathematical idea -- it was a fuzzy idea, one which had been burning in the back of my brain for a week or so, waiting to be born. It filled the fractal branches of a zettelkasten nicely, expanding in every direction.</p><p>So, maybe start with one of <em>those</em> ideas. Something you&#x2019;ve been struggling to articulate. Something which hasn&#x2019;t found a place in your linear notebook.</p><p>Alright. That&#x2019;s all I have to say about the basics of Zettelkasten. You can go try it now if you want, or keep reading. The rest of this document is about further ideas in note-taking which have shaped the way I use Zettelkasten. These may or may not be useful to you; I don&#x2019;t know for sure why Zettelkasten is such a productive system for me personally.</p><br><h1>Note-Taking Systems I Have Known and Loved</h1><p>I&#x2019;m organizing this section by my previous note-taking systems, but secretly, the main point is to convey a number of note-taking ideas which may have contributed to Zettelkasten working well for me. These ideas have seemed generally useful to me -- maybe they&#x2019;ll be useful to you, even if you don&#x2019;t end up using Zettelkasten in particular.</p><br><h2>Notebooks</h2><p><strong>Developing Ideas</strong></p><p>Firstly, and most importantly, I have been keeping idea books since middle school. I think there&#x2019;s something very important in the simple idea of writing regularly -- I don&#x2019;t have the reference, but, I remember reading someone who described the day they first started keeping a diary as the day they first woke up, started reflectively thinking about their relationship with the world. Here&#x2019;s a somewhat similar quote from a Zettelkasten blog:</p><blockquote>During the time spanning Nov. 2007&#x2013;Jan. 2010, I filled 11 note books with ideas, to-do lists, ramblings, diary entries, drawings, and worries.</blockquote><blockquote>Looking back, this is about the time I started to live consciously. I guess keeping a journal helped me &#x201C;wake up&#x201D; from some kind of teenage slumber.</blockquote><blockquote><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/idea-index-journal-fiction/\">--Christian</a></blockquote><p>I never got into autobiographical diary-style writing, personally, instead writing about ideas I was having. Still, things were in a very &#x201C;narrative&#x201D; format -- the ideas were a drama, a back-and-forth, a dance of rejoinders. There was some math -- pages filled with equations -- but only after a great deal of (very) informal development of an idea.</p><p>As a result, &#x201C;elaborate on an idea&#x201D; / &#x201C;keep going&#x201D; seems like a primitive operation to me -- and, specifically, a primitive operation <em>which involves paper</em>. (I can&#x2019;t translate the same thinking style to conversation, not completely.) I&#x2019;m sure that there is a lot to unpack, but for me, it just feels natural to keep developing ideas further.</p><p>So, when I say that the Zettelkasten card 1b2 <em>&#x201C;elaborates on&#x201D;</em> the card 1b, I&#x2019;m calling on the long experience I&#x2019;ve had with idea books. I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;ll mean the same thing for you.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s my incomplete attempt to convey some of what it means.</p><p>When I&#x2019;m writing in an idea book, I spend a lot of time trying to clearly explain ideas under the (often false) assumption that I know what I&#x2019;m talking about. There&#x2019;s an imaginary audience who knows a lot of what I&#x2019;m talking about, but I have to explain certain things. I can&#x2019;t get away with leaving important terms undefined -- I have to establish anything I feel less than fully confident about. For example, the definition of a Bayesian network is something I can assume my &#x201C;audience&#x201D; can look up on wikipedia. However, if I&#x2019;m less than totally confident in the concept of d-separation, I have to explain it; especially if it is important to the argument I hope to make.</p><p>Once I&#x2019;ve established the terms, I try to explain the idea I was having. I spend a lot of time staring off into space, not really knowing what&#x2019;s going on in my head exactly, but with a sense that there&#x2019;s a simple point I&#x2019;m trying to make, if only I could see it. I simultaneously feel like I know what I want to say (if only I could find the words), and like I don&#x2019;t know what it is -- after all, I haven&#x2019;t articulated it yet. Generally, I can pick up where I left off with a particular thought, even after several weeks -- I can glance at what I&#x2019;ve written so far, and get right back to staring at the wall again, trying to articulate the same un-articulated idea.</p><p>If I start again in a different notebook (for example, switching to writing my thoughts on a computer), I have to explain everything again. This audience doesn&#x2019;t <em>know</em> yet! I can&#x2019;t just pick up on a computer where I left off on paper. It&#x2019;s like trying to pick up a conversation in the middle, but with a different person. This is sort of annoying, but often good (because re-explaining things may hold surprises, as I notice new details.)</p><p>Similarly, if I do a lot of thinking without a notebook (maybe in a conversation), I generally have to &#x201C;construct&#x201D; my new position from my old one. This has an unfortunate &#x201C;freezing&#x201D; effect on thoughts: there&#x2019;s a lot of gravity toward the chain of thought wherever it is on the page. I tend to work on whatever line of thought is most recent in my notebook, regardless of any more important or better ideas which have come along -- especially if the line of thought in the notebook isn&#x2019;t yet at a conclusive place. Sometimes I put a scribble in the notebook after a line of thought, to indicate explicitly that it no longer reflects the state of my thinking, to give myself &#x201C;permission&#x201D; to do something else.</p><p>Once I&#x2019;ve articulated some point, then criticisms of the point often become clear, and I&#x2019;ll start writing about them. I often have a sense that I know how it&#x2019;s going to go a few steps ahead in this back-and-forth; a few critiques and replies/revisions. Especially if the ideas are flowing faster than I can write them down. However, it is important to actually write things down, because they often don&#x2019;t go quite as I expect.</p><p>If an idea seems to have reached a natural conclusion, including all the critiques/replies which felt important enough to write, I&#x2019;ll often write a list of &#x201C;future work&#x201D;: any open questions I can think of, applications, details which are important but not so important that I want to write about them yet, etc. At this point, it is usually time to write the idea up for a <em>real</em> audience, which will require more detail and refine the idea yet further (possibly destroying it, or changing it significantly, as I often find a critical flaw when I try to write an idea up for consumption by others).</p><p>If I don&#x2019;t have any particular idea I&#x2019;m developing, I may start fresh with a mental motion like &#x201C;OK, obviously I know how to solve everything&#x201D; and write down the grand solution to everything, starting big-picture and continuing until I get stuck. Or, instead, I might make a bulleted list free-associating about what I think the interesting problems are -- the things I don&#x2019;t know how to do.</p><br><h2>Workflowy</h2><p>The next advance in my idea notes was workflowy. I still love the simplicity of workflowy, even though I have moved on from it.</p><p>For those unfamilar, Workflowy is an outlining tool. I was unfamiliar with the idea before Workflowy introduced it to me. Word processors generally <em>support</em> nested bulleted lists, but the page-like format of a word processor limits the depth such lists can go, and it didn&#x2019;t really occur to me to use these as a primary mode of writing. Workflowy doesn&#x2019;t let you do anything <em>but</em> this, and it provides enough features to make it extremely convenient and natural.</p><br><p><strong>Nonlinear Ideas: Branching Development</strong></p><p>Workflowy introduced me to the possibility of nonlinear formats for idea development. I&#x2019;ve already discussed this to some extent, since it is also one of the main advantages of Zettelkasten over ordinary notebooks.</p><p>Suddenly, I could continue a thread <em>anywhere,</em> rather than always picking it up at the end. I could sketch out where I expected things to go, with an outline, rather than keeping all the points I wanted to hit in my head as I wrote. If I got stuck on something, I could write about how I was stuck nested <em>underneath</em> whatever paragraph I was currently writing, but then collapse the meta-thoughts to be invisible later -- so the overall narrative doesn&#x2019;t feel interrupted.</p><p>In contrast, writing in paper notebooks forces you to choose consciously that you&#x2019;re done for now with a topic if you want to start a new one. Every new paragraph is like choosing a single fork in a twisting maze. Workflowy allowed me to take them all.</p><br><p><strong>What are Children?</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;ve seen people hit a block right away when they try to use workflowy, because they don&#x2019;t know what a &#x201C;child node&#x201D; is.</p><ul><li>Here&#x2019;s a node. It could be a paragraph, expressing some thought. It could also be a title.</li><ul><li>Here&#x2019;s a child node. It could be a comment on the thought -- an aside, a critique, whatever. It could be something which goes under the heading.</li></ul><li>Here&#x2019;s a sibling node. It could be the next paragrapt in the &#x201C;main thrust&#x201D; of an argument. It could be an unrelated point under the same super-point everything is under.</li></ul><p>As with Zettelkasten, my advice is to not get too hung up on this. A child is sort of like a comment; a parenthetical statement or a footnote. You can continue the main thrust of an argument in sibling nodes -- just like writing an ordinary sequence of paragraphs in a word processor.</p><p>You can also organize things under headings. This is especially true if you wrote a sketchy outline first and then filled it in, or, if you have a lot of material in Workflowy and had to organize it. The &#x201C;upper ontology&#x201D; of my workflowy is mostly title-like, single words or short noun phrases. As you get down in, bullets start to be sentences and paragraphs more often.</p><p>Obviously, all of this can be applied to Zettelkasten to some extent. The biggest difference is that &#x201C;upper-level&#x201D; cards are less likely to <em>just</em> be category titles; and, you can&#x2019;t really organize things into nice categories after-the-fact because the addresses in Zettelkasten are fixed -- you can&#x2019;t change them without breaking links. You can use redirect cards if you want to reorganize things, actually, but I haven&#x2019;t done that very much in practice. Something which <em>has</em> worked for me to some extent is to reorganize things in the indexes. Once an index is too much of a big flat list, you can cluster entries into subjects. This new listing can be added as a child to the previous index, keeping the historical record; or, possibly, replace the old index outright. I discuss this more in the section on indexing.</p><br><p><strong>Building Up Ideas over Long Time Periods</strong></p><p>My idea books let me build up ideas over time to a greater extent than my peers who didn&#x2019;t keep similar journals. However, because the linear format forces you to switch topics in a serial manner and &#x201C;start over&#x201D; when you want to resume a subject, you&#x2019;re mostly restricted to what you can keep in your head. Your notebooks <em>are</em> a form of information storage, and you <em>can</em> go back and re-read things, but only if you remember the relevant item to go back and re-read.</p><p>Workflowy allowed me to build up ideas to a greater degree, incrementally adding thoughts until cascades of understanding changed my overall view.</p><br><p><em>Placing a New Idea</em></p><p>Because you&#x2019;ve got all your ideas in one big outline, you can add in little ideas easily. Workflowy was easy enough to access via my smartphone (though they didn&#x2019;t have a proper app at the time), so I could jot down an idea as I was walking to class, waiting for the bus, etc. I could easily navigate to the right location, at least, if I had organized the overall structure of the outline well. Writing one little idea would usually get more flowing, and I would add several points in the same location on the tree, or in nearby locations.</p><p>This idea of jotting down ideas while you&#x2019;re out and about is very important. If you feel you don&#x2019;t have enough ideas (be it for research, for writing fiction, for art -- whatever) my first question would be whether you have a good way to jot down little ideas as they occur to you.</p><p>The fact that you&#x2019;re <em>forced</em> to <em>somehow</em> fit all ideas into one big tree is also important. It makes you organize things in ways that are likely to be useful to you later.</p><br><p><em>Organizing Over Time</em></p><p>The second really nice thing workflowy did was allow me to go back and reorganize all the little ideas I had jotted down. When I sat down at a computer, I could take a look at my tree overall and see how well the categorization fit. This mostly took the form of small improvements to the tree structure over time. Eventually, a cascade of small fixes turned into a major reorganization. At that point, I felt I had really learned something -- all the incremental progress built up into an overall shift in my understanding.</p><p>Again, this isn&#x2019;t really possible in paper-based Zettelkasten -- the address system is fixed. However, as I mentioned before, I&#x2019;ve had some success doing this kind of reorganization within the indexes. It doesn&#x2019;t matter that the addresses of the cards are fixed if the way you actually <em>find</em> those addresses is mutable.</p><br><p><strong>Limitations of Workflowy</strong></p><p>Eventually, I noticed that I had a big pile of ideas which I hadn&#x2019;t really developed. I was jotting down ideas, sure. I was fitting them into an increasingly cohesive overall picture, sure. But I wasn&#x2019;t <em>doing anything</em> with them. I wasn&#x2019;t writing pages and pages of details and critique.</p><p>It was around this time that I realized I had gone more than three years without using a paper notebook very significantly. I started writing on paper again. I realized that there were all these habits of thinking which were tied to paper for me, and which I didn&#x2019;t really access if I didn&#x2019;t have a nice notebook and a nice pen -- the force of the long-practiced associations. It was like waking up intellectually after having gone to sleep for a long time. I started to <em>remember highschool.</em> It was a weird time. Anyway...</p><br><h2>Dynalist</h2><p>The next thing I tried was Dynalist.</p><p>The main advantage of Dynalist over Workflowy is that it takes a feature-rich rather than minimalistic approach. I like the clean aesthetics of Workflowy, but&#x2026; eventually, there&#x2019;ll be some critical feature Workflowy just doesn&#x2019;t provide, and you&#x2019;ll want to make the jump to Dynasilt. I use hardly any of the extra features of Dynalist, but the ones I <em>do</em> use, I <em>need.</em> For me, it&#x2019;s mostly the LaTeX support.</p><p>Another thing about Dynalist which felt very different for me was the file system. Workflowy forces you to keep everything in one big outline. Dynalist lets you create many outlines, which it treats as different files; and, you can organize them into folders (recursively). Technically, that&#x2019;s just another tree structure. In terms of UI, though, it made navigation much easier (because you can easily access a desired file through the file pane). Psychologically, it made me much more willing to start fresh outlines rather than add to one big one. This was both good and bad. It meant my ideas were less anchored in one big tree, but it eventually resulted in a big, disorganized pile of notes.</p><p>I did learn my lesson from Workflowy, though, and set things up in my Dynalist such that I actually developed ideas, rather than just collecting scraps forever.</p><br><p><strong>Temporary Notes vs Organized Notes</strong></p><p>I organized my Dynalist files as follows:</p><ul><li>A &#x201C;log&#x201D; file, in which I could write whatever I was thinking about. This was organized by date, although I would often go back and elaborate on things from previous dates.</li><li>A &#x201C;todo&#x201D; file, where I put links to items inside &#x201C;log&#x201D; which I specifically wanted to go back and think more about. I would periodically sort the todo items to reflect my priorities. This gave me a list of important topics to draw from whenever I wasn&#x2019;t sure what I wanted to think about.</li><li>A bunch of other disorganized files.</li></ul><p>This system wasn&#x2019;t <em>great,</em> but it was a whole lot better at <em>actually developing ideas</em> than the way I kept things organized in Workflowy. I had realized that locking everything into a unified tree structure, while good for the purpose of slowly improving a large ontology which organized a lot of little thoughts, was keeping me from just writing whatever I was thinking about.</p><p>Dan Sheffler (whose essays I&#x2019;ve already cited several times in this writeup) writes about realizing that his note-taking system was simultaneously trying to implement <a href=\"http://www.dansheffler.com/blog/2014-07-21-two-goals-of-note-taking/\">two different goals</a>: an organized long-term memory store, and &#x201C;engagement notes&#x201D; which are written to clarify thinking and have a more stream-of-consciousness style. My &#x201C;log&#x201D; file was essentially engagement notes, and my &#x201C;todo&#x201D; file was the long-term memory store.</p><p>For some people, I think an <em>essential part</em> of Zettelkasten is the distinction between temporary and permanent notes. Temporary notes are the disorganized stream-of-consciousness notes which Sheffler calls engagement notes. Temporary notes can also include all sorts of other things, such as todo lists which you make at the start of the day (and which only apply to that day), shopping lists, etc. Temporary notes can be kept in a linear format, like a notebook. Periodically, you review the temporary notes, putting the important things into Zettelkasten.</p><p>In <em>Taking Smart Notes,</em> Luhmann is described as transferring the important thoughts from the day into Zettel every evening. Sheffler, on the other hand, keeps a gap of at least 24 hours between taking down engagement notes and deciding what belongs in the long-term store. A gap of time allows the initial excitement over an idea to pass, so that only the things which still seem important the next day get into long-term notes. He also points out that this system enforces a small amount of spaced repetition, making it more likely that content is recalled later.</p><p>As for myself, I mostly write directly into my Zettelkasten, and I think it&#x2019;s pretty great. However, I do find this to be difficult/impossible when taking quick notes during a conversation or a talk &#x2013; when I try, then the resulting content in my Zettelkasten seems pretty useless (ie, I don&apos;t come back to it and further develop those thoughts). So, I&apos;ve started to carry a notebook again for those temporary notes.</p><p>I currently think of things like this:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1568584395/Zettelkasted_3_svg_ewy4ql.svg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><br><p><em>Jots</em></p><p>These are the sort of small pointers to ideas which you can write down while walking, waiting for the bus, etc. The idea is stated very simply -- perhaps in a single word or a short phrase. A sentence at most. You might forget what it means after a week, especially if you don&#x2019;t record the context well. The first thing to realize about jots is <u>to capture them at all</u>, as already discussed. The second thing is <u>to capture them in a place where you will be able to develop them later.</u> I used to carry around a small pocket notebook for jots, after I stopped using Workflowy regularly. My plan was to review the jots whenever I filled a notebook, putting them in more long-term storage. This never happened: when I filled up a notebook, unpacking all the jots into something meaningful just seemed like too huge a task. It works better for me to jot things into permanent storage directly, as I did with Workflowy. I procrastinate too much on turning temporary notes into long term notes, and the temporary notes become meaningless.</p><br><p><em>Glosses</em></p><p>A gloss is a paragraph explaining the point of a jot. If a jot is the title of a Zettelkasten card, a gloss is the first paragraph (often written in a distinct color). This gives enough of an idea that the thought will not be lost if it is left for a few weeks (perhaps even years, depending). Writing a gloss is usually easy, and doing so is often enough to get the ideas flowing.</p><br><p><em>Development</em></p><p>This is the kind of writing I described in the &#x2018;notebooks&#x2019; section. An idea is fleshed out. This kind of writing is often still comprehensible years later, although it isn&#x2019;t guaranteed to be.</p><br><p><em>Refinement</em></p><p>This is the kind of writing which is publishable. It nails the idea down. There&#x2019;s not really any end to this -- you can imagine expanding something from a blog post, to an academic paper, to a book, and further, with increasing levels of detail, gentle exposition, formal rigor -- but to a first approximation, anyway, you&#x2019;ve eliminated all the contradictions, stated the motivating context accurately, etc.</p><p>I called the last item &#x201C;refinement&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;communication&#x201D; because, really, you can communicate your ideas at any of these stages. If someone shares a lot of context with you, they can understand your jots. That&#x2019;s really difficult, though. More likely, a research partner will understand your glosses. Development will be understandable to someone a little more distant, and so on.</p><br><h2>At Long Last, Zettelkasten</h2><p>I&#x2019;ve been hammering home the idea of &#x201C;linear&#x201D; vs &#x201C;nonlinear&#x201D; formats as one of the big advantages of Zettelkasten. But workflowy and dynalist both allow nonlinear writing. Why should you be interested in Zettelkasten? Is it anything more than a way to implement workflowy-like writing for a paper format?</p><p>I&#x2019;ve said that (at least for me) there&#x2019;s something extra-good about Zettelkasten which I don&#x2019;t really understand. But, there are a couple of important elements which make Zettelkasten more than just paper workflowy.</p><ul><li><strong>Hierarchy Plus Cross-Links:</strong> A repeated theme across knowledge formats, including wikipedia and textbooks, is that you want both a hierarchical organization which makes it easy to get an overview and find things, and also a &#x201C;cross-reference&#x201D; type capability which allows related content to be linked -- creating a heterarchical web. I mentioned at the beginning that Zettelkasten forced me to create cross-links much more than I otherwise would, due to the use of small note-cards. Workflowy has &#x201C;hierarchy&#x201D; down, but it has somewhat poor &#x201C;cross-link&#x201D; capability. It has tags, but a tag system is not as powerful as hypertext. Because you <em>can</em> link to individual nodes, it&#x2019;s possible to use hypertext cross-links -- but the process is awkward, since you have to get the link to the node you want. Dynalist is significantly better in this respect -- it has an easy way to create a link to anything by searching for it (without leaving the spot you&#x2019;re at). But it lacks the wiki-style &#x201C;magic link&#x201D; capability, creating a new page when you make a link which has no target. Roam, however, provides this feature.</li><li><strong>Atomicity:</strong> The idea of creating pages organized around a single idea (again, an idea related to wikis). This is possible in Dynalist, but Zettelkasten practically forces it upon you, which for me was really good. Again, Roam manages to encourage this style.</li></ul><br><h1>Zettelkasten, Part 2: Further Advice</h1><h2>Card Layout</h2><p>Don&apos;t stress about card formatting. You should write however feels natural to you. However, I thought you might like to see an example of what my cards tend to look like:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1568584395/Zettelkasten_4_svg_x0rcja.svg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>I&#x2019;m left handed, so you may want to flip all of this around if you&#x2019;re right handed. I use the ring binder &#x201C;backwards&#x201D; from the intended configuration (the punched hole would usually be on the left, rather than the right). Also, I prefer portrait rather than landscape. Most people prefer to use 3x5 cards in landscape, I suppose.</p><p>Anyway, not every card will look exactly like the above. A card might just contain a bunch of free-writing, with no bulleted list. Or it might only contain a bulleted list, with no blurb at the beginning. Whatever works. I think my layout is close to Luhmann&#x2019;s and close to common advice -- but if you try to copy it religiously, you&#x2019;ll probably feel like Zettelkasten is awkward and restrictive.</p><p>The only absolutely necessary thing is the address. The address is the first thing you write on a new card. You don&#x2019;t ever want a card to go without an address. And it should be in a standard location, so that it is really easy to look through a bunch of cards for one with a specific address.</p><p><em>Don&#x2019;t feel bad if you start a card and leave it mostly blank forever.</em> Maybe you thought you were going to elaborate an idea, so you made a new card, but it&#x2019;s got nothing but an address. That&#x2019;s ok. Maybe you will fill it later. Maybe you won&#x2019;t. Don&#x2019;t worry about it.</p><p>Mostly, a thought is continued through elaboration on bullet points. I might write something like &#x201C;cont. 1.1a1a&#x201D; at the bottom of the card if there&#x2019;s another card that&#x2019;s really a direct continuation, though. (Actually, I don&#x2019;t write &#x201C;cont.&#x201D;; I just write the down arrow, which means the same thing.) If so, I&#x2019;d write &#x201C;see 1.1a1&#x201D; in the upper left hand corner, to indicate that 1.1a1a probably doesn&#x2019;t make much sense on its own without consulting 1.1a1 -- moreso than usual for child cards. (Actually, I&#x2019;d write another down arrow rather than &#x201C;see&#x201D;, mirroring the down arrow on the previous card -- this indicates the direct-continuation relationship.)</p><p>In the illustration, I wrote links [in square brackets]. The truth is, I often put them in full rectangular boxes (to make them stand out more), although not always. Sometimes I put them in parentheses when I&#x2019;m using them more as a noun, as in: &#x201C;I think pizza (12a) might be relevant to pasta. [14x5b]&#x201D; In that example, &#x201C;(12a)&#x201D; is the card for pizza. &#x201C;[14x5b]&#x201D; is a card continuing the whole thought &#x201C;pizza might be relevant to pasta&#x201D;. So parentheses-vs-box is sort of like top-corner-vs-bottom, but for an individual line rather than a whole card.</p><br><p><strong>Use of Color</strong></p><p>The colors are true to my writing as well. For a long time, I wanted to try writing with multi-color click pens, because I knew some people found them very useful; but, I was unable to find any which satisfied my (exceptionally picky) taste. I don&#x2019;t generally go for ball-point pens; they aren&#x2019;t smooth enough. I prefer to write with felt-tip drawing pens or similar. I also prefer very fine tips (as a consequence of preferring my writing to be very small, as I mentioned previously) -- although I&#x2019;ve also found that the appropriate line width varies with my mental state and with the subject matter. Fine lines are better for fine details, and for energetic mental states; broad lines are better for loose free-association and brainstorming, and for tired mental states.</p><p>In any case, a friend recommended the Hi-Tec C Coleto, a multi-color click pen which feels as smooth as felt-tip pens usually do (almost). You can buy whatever colors you want, and they&#x2019;re available in a variety of line-widths, so you can customize it quite a bit.</p><p>At first I just used different colors haphazardly. I figured I would eventually settle on meanings for colors, if I just used whatever felt appropriate and experimented. Mostly, that meant that I switched colors to indicate a change of topic, or used a different color when I went back and <a href=\"http://www.dansheffler.com/blog/2014-07-26-notebook-annotation/\">annotated</a> something (which really helps readability, by the way -- black writing with a bunch of black annotations scribbled next to it or between lines is hard to read, compared to purple writing with orange annotations, or whatever!). When I switched to Zettelkasten, though, I got more systematic with my use of color.</p><p>I roughly follow Lion Kimbro&#x2019;s advice about colors, from <em>How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought you Think</em>:</p><blockquote>Now lets talk about color.</blockquote><blockquote>Your pen has four colors: Red, Green, Blue, and Black</blockquote><blockquote>You will want to connect meaning with each color.</blockquote><blockquote>Here&#x2019;s my associations:</blockquote><blockquote>RED: Error, Warning, Correction</blockquote><blockquote>BLUE: Structure, Diagram, Picture, Links, Keys (in key-value pairs)</blockquote><blockquote>GREEN: Meta, Definition, Naming, Brief Annotation, Glyphs</blockquote><blockquote>BLACK: Main Content</blockquote><blockquote>I also use green to clarify sloppy writing later on. Blue is for Keys, Black is for values.</blockquote><blockquote>I hope that&#x2019;s self-explanatory.</blockquote><blockquote>If you make a correction, put it in red. Page numbers are blue. If you draw a diagram, make it blue. Main content in black.</blockquote><blockquote>Suppose you make a diagram: Start with a big blue box. Put the diagram in the box. (Or the other way around- make the diagram, than the box around it.) Put some highlighted content in black. Want to define a word? Use a green callout. Oops- there&#x2019;s a problem in the drawing- X it out in red, followed by the correction, in red.</blockquote><blockquote>Some times, I use black and blue to alternate emphasis. Black and blue are the easiest to see.</blockquote><blockquote>If I&#x2019;m annotating some text in the future, and the text is black, I&#x2019;ll switch to using blue for content. Or vise versa.</blockquote><blockquote>Some annotations are red, if they are major corrections.</blockquote><blockquote>Always remember: Tolerate errors. If your black has run out, and you don&#x2019;t want to get up right away to fetch your backup pen, then just switch to blue. When the thoughts out, go get your backup pen.</blockquote><p>The only big differences are that I use brown instead of black in my pen, I tend to use red for titles so that they stand out very clearly, and I use green for links rather than blue. (Honestly I think my use of green for links might be a mistake. You want links to stand out more.)</p><br><h2>Index &amp; Bibliography?</h2><p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p><p><em>Taking Smart Notes</em> describes two other kinds of cards: indexes, and bibliographical notes. I haven&#x2019;t made those work for me very effectively, however. Luhmann, the inventor of Zettelkasten, is described inventing Zettelkasten <em>as a way to organize notes originally made while reading</em>. I don&#x2019;t use it like that -- I mainly use it for organizing notes I make while thinking. So bibliography isn&#x2019;t of primary importance for me.</p><p>(Apparently Umberto Eco <a href=\"http://www.dansheffler.com/blog/2015-08-10-reading-notes/\">similarly advises</a> keeping idea notes and reading notes on separate sets of index cards.)</p><br><p><strong>Indexing</strong></p><p>So I don&#x2019;t miss the bibliography cards. (Maybe I will eventually.) On the other hand, I <em>definitely</em> need some sort of index, but I&#x2019;m not sure about the best way to keep it up to date. I only notice that I need it when I go looking for a particular card and it is difficult to find! When that happens, and I <em>eventually</em> find the card I wanted, I can jot down its address in an index. But, it would be nice to somehow avoid this. So, I&#x2019;ve experimented with some ideas. Here are <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/three-layers-structure-zettelkasten/\">someone else&#x2019;s thoughts on indexing</a> (for a digital zettelkasten).</p><p><em>Listing Assorted Cards</em></p><p>The first type of index which I tried lists &#x201C;important&#x201D; cards (cards which I refer to often). I just have one of these right now. The idea is that you write a card&#x2019;s name and address on this index if you find that you&#x2019;ve had difficulty locating a card and wished it had been listed in your index. This <em>sounds</em> like it should be better than a simple list of the top-level numbered cards, since (as I mentioned earlier) cards like 11a often turn out to be more important than cards like 11. Unfortunately, I&#x2019;ve found this not to be the case. The problem is that this kind of index is too hard to maintain. If I&#x2019;ve just been struggling to find a card, my working memory is probably already over-taxed with all the stuff I wanted to do after finding that card. So I forget to add it to the index.</p><br><p><em>Topic Index</em></p><p>Sometimes it also makes sense to just make a new top-level card on which you list everything which has to do with a particular category. I have only done this once so far. It seems like this is the main mode of indexing which other people use? But I don&#x2019;t like the idea that well.</p><br><p><em>Listing Sibling Cards</em></p><p>When a card has enough children that they&#x2019;re difficult to keep track of, I add a &#x201C;zero&#x201D; card before all the other children, and this works as an index. So, for example, card 2a might have children 2a1, 2a2, 2a3, &#x2026; 2a15. That&#x2019;s a lot to keep track of. So I add 2a0, which gets an entry for 2a1-2a15, and any new cards added under 2a. It can also get an entry for particularly important descendants; maybe 2a3a1 is extra important and gets an entry.</p><p>For cards like 2, whose children are alphabetical, you can&#x2019;t really use &#x201C;zero&#x201D; to go before all the other children. I use &#x201C;&#x3BB;&#x201D; as the &#x201C;alphabetical zero&#x201D; -- I sort it as if it comes before all the other letters in the alphabet. So, card &#x201C;1&#x3BB;&#x201D; lists 1a, 1b, etc.</p><p>The most important index is the index at 0, ei, the index of all top-level numbered cards. As I describe in the &#x201C;card layout&#x201D; section, a card already mostly lists its own children -- meaning that you don&#x2019;t need to add a new card to serve this purpose until things get unwieldy. However, top-level cards have no parents to keep track of them! So, you probably want an &#x201C;absolute zero&#x201D; card right away.</p><p>These &#x201C;zero&#x201D; cards also make it easier to keep track of whether a card with a particular address has been created yet. Every time you make a card, you add it to the appropriate zero card; so, you can see right away what the next address available is. This isn&#x2019;t the case otherwise, especially if your cards aren&#x2019;t currently sorted.</p><br><p><em>Kimbro&#x2019;s Mind Mapping</em></p><p>I&#x2019;ve experimented with adapting Lion Kimbro&#x2019;s system from <em>How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought You Think</em>. After all, a complete map of every thought you think sounds like the perfect index!</p><p>In my terminology, Lion Kimbro keeps only <em>jots</em> -- he was focusing on collecting and mapping, rather than developing, ideas. Jots were collected into topics and sub-topics. When an area accumulated enough jots, he would start a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map\">mind map</a> for it. I won&#x2019;t go into all his specific mapping tips (although they&#x2019;re relevant), but basically, imagine putting the addresses of cards into clusters (on a new blank card) and then writing &#x201C;anchor words&#x201D; describing the clusters.</p><p>You built your tree in an initially &#x201C;top-down&#x201D; fashion, expanding trees by adding increasingly-nested cards. You&#x2019;re going to build the map &#x201C;bottom-up&#x201D;: when a sub-tree you&#x2019;re interested in feels too large to quickly grasp, start a map. Let&#x2019;s say you&#x2019;re mapping card 8b4. You might already have an index of children at 8b4<span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left; text-transform: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;

padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">&#x3BB;</span></span></span></span></span></span>; if that&#x2019;s the case, you can start with that. Also look through all the descendants of 8b4 and pick out whichever seem most important. (If this is too hard, start by making maps for 8b4&#x2019;s <em>children,</em> and return to mapping 8b4 later.) Draw a new mind map, and place it at 8b4<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\lambda\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">&#x3BB;</span></span></span></span></span></span>a -- it is part of the index; you want to find it easily when looking at the index.</p><p>Now, the important thing is that <em>when you make a map for 8b,</em> you can take a look at the map for 8b4, as well as any maps possessed by other children of 8b. This means that you don&#x2019;t have to go through all of the descendents of 8b (which is good, because there could be a lot). You just look at the maps, which already give you an overview. The map for 8b is going to take <em>the most important-seeming elements</em> from all of those sub-maps.</p><p>This allows important things to trickle up to the top. When you make a map at 0, you&#x2019;ll be getting all the most important stuff from deep sub-trees just by looking at the maps for each top-level numbered card.</p><p>The categories which emerge from mapping like this can be completely different from the concepts which initially seeded your top-level cards. You can make new top-level cards which correspond to these categories if you want. (I haven&#x2019;t done this.)</p><p>Now, when you&#x2019;re looking for something, you start at your top-level map. You look at the clusters and likely have some expectation about where it is (if the address isn&#x2019;t somewhere on your top-level map already). You follow the addresses to further maps, which give further clusters of addresses, until you land in a tree which is small enough to navigate without maps.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve described all of this as if it&#x2019;s a one-time operation, but of course you keep adding to these maps, and re-draw updated maps when things don&#x2019;t fit well any more. If a map lives at 8b40a, then the updated maps can be 8b40b, 8b40c, and so on.You can keep the old maps around as a historical record of your shifting conceptual clusters.</p><br><h2>Keeping Multiple Zettelkasten</h2><p>A note system like Zettelkasten (or workflowy, dynalist, evernote, etc) is supposed to stick with you for years, growing with you and becoming a repository for your ideas. It&#x2019;s a big commitment.</p><p>It&#x2019;s difficult to optimize note-taking if you think of it that way, though. You can&#x2019;t experiment if you have to look before you leap. I would have never tried Zettelkasten if I thought I was committing to try it as my &#x201C;next system&#x201D; -- I didn&#x2019;t think it would work.</p><p>Similarly, I can&#x2019;t optimize my Zettelkasten very well with that attitude. A Zettelkasten is supposed to be one repository for everything -- you&#x2019;re not supposed to start a new one for a new project, for example. But, I have several Zettelkasten, to test out different formats: different sizes of card, different binders. It <em>is</em> still difficult to give alternatives a fair shake, because my two main Zettelkasten have built up momentum due to the content I keep in them.</p><p>I use a system of capital letters to cross reference between my Zettelkasten. For example, my main 3x5 Zettelkasten is &#x201C;S&#x201D; (for &#x201C;small&#x201D;). I have another Zettelkasten which is &#x201C;M&#x201D;, and also an &#x201C;L&#x201D;. When referencing card 1.1a within S, I just call it 1.1a. If I want to refer to it from a card in M, I call it S1.1a instead. And so on.</p><p>Apparently Luhmann <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmanns-second-zettelkasten/\">did something similar</a>, starting a new Zettelkasten which occasionally referred to his first.</p><p>However, keeping multiple Zettelkasten for special topics is not necessarily a good idea. <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/\">Beware fixed categories</a>. The danger is that categories limit what you write, or, become less appropriate over time. I&#x2019;ve tried special-topic notebooks in the past, and while it does sometimes work, I often end up conflicted about where to put something. (Granted, I have a similar conflict about where to put things in my several omni-topic Zettelkasten, but mostly the 3x5 system I&#x2019;ve described here has won out -- for now.)</p><p>On the other hand, I suspect it&#x2019;s fine to create special topic zettelkasten for &#x201C;very different&#x201D; things. Creating a new zettelkasten because you&#x2019;re writing a new book is <em>probably</em> bad -- although it&#x2019;ll work fine for the goal of organizing material for writing books, it means your next book idea isn&#x2019;t coming from Zettelkasten. (Zettelkasten should contain/extend the thought process which generates book ideas in the first place, and it can&#x2019;t do that very well if you have to have a specific book idea in order to start a zettelkasten about it.) On the other hand, I suspect it is OK to keep a separate Zettelkasten for fictional creative writing. Factual ideas can spark ideas for fiction, but, the two are sufficiently different &#x201C;modes&#x201D; that it may make sense to keep them in physically separate collections.</p><p>The idea of using an extended address system to make references between multiple Zettelkasten can also be applied to address other things, outside of your Zettelkasten. For example, you might want come up with a way of adding addresses to your old notebooks so that you can refer to them easily. (For example, &#x201C;notebook number: page number&#x201D; could work.)</p><br><h2>Should You Transfer Old Notes Into Zettelkasten?</h2><p>Relatedly, since Zettelkasten ideally becomes a library of all the things you have been thinking about, it might be tempting to try and transfer everything from your existing notes into Zettelkasten.</p><p>(A lot of readers may not even be tempted to do this, given the amount of work it would take. Yet, those more serious about note systems might think this is a good idea -- or, might be too afraid to try Zettelkasten because they think they&#x2019;d have to do this.)</p><p>I think transferring older stuff into Zettelkasten can be useful, but, trying to make it happen right away as one big project is most likely not worth it.</p><ul><li>It&#x2019;s true that part of the usefulness of Zettelkasten is the interconnected web of ideas which builds up over time, and the &#x201C;high-surface-area&#x201D; format which makes it easy to branch off any part. However, not all the payoff is long-term: it should also be useful <em>in the moment.</em> You&#x2019;re not <em>only</em> writing notes because they may help you develop ideas in the future; the act of writing the notes should be helping you develop ideas now.</li><li>You should probably only spend time putting ideas into Zettelkasten if you&#x2019;re excited about further developing those ideas right now. You should not just be copying over ideas into Zettelkasten. You should be improving ideas, thinking about where to place them in your address hierarchy, interlinking them with other ideas in your Zettelkasten via address links, and taking notes on any new ideas sparked by this process. Trying to put all your old notes into Zettelkasten at once will likely make you feel hurried and unwilling to develop things further as you go. This will result in a pile of mediocre notes which will ultimately be less useful.</li><li>I mentioned the breadth-first vs depth-first distinction earlier. Putting all of your old notes into Zettelkasten is an extremely breadth-first strategy, which likely doesn&#x2019;t give you enough time to go deep into further developing any one idea.</li></ul><p>What about the dream of having all your notes in one beautiful format? Well, it is true that old notes in different formats may be harder to find, since you have to remember what format the note you want was written in, or check all your old note systems to find the note you want. I think it just isn&#x2019;t worth the cost to fix this problem, though, especially since you should probably try many different systems to find a good one that works for you, and you can&#x2019;t very well port all your notes to each new system.</p><p>Zettelkasten should be <em>an overall improvement compared to a normal notebook --</em> if it isn&apos;t, you have no business using it. Adding a huge up-front cost of transferring notes undermines that. Just pick Zettelkasten up when you want to use it to develop ideas further.</p><br><h2>Depth-first vs Breadth-first</h2><p>Speaking of depth-first vs breadth-first, how should you balance those two modes?</p><p>Luckily, this problem has some relevant computer science theory behind it. I tend to think of it in terms of iterative-deepening A* heuristic search (IDA*).</p><p>The basic idea is this: the advantage of depth-first search is that you can minimize memory cost by only maintaining the information related to the path you are currently trying. However, depth-first search can easily get stuck down a fruitless path, while breadth-first search has better guarantees. IDA* balances the two approaches by going depth-first, but giving up when you get too deep, backing up, and trying a new path. (The A* aspect is that you define &#x201C;too deep&#x201D; in a way which also depends on how promising a path seems, based on an optimistic assessment.) This way, you simulate a breadth-first search by a series of depth-first sprints. This lets you focus your attention on a small set of ideas at one time.</p><p>Once you&#x2019;ve explored all the paths to a certain level, your tolerance defining &#x201C;too deep&#x201D; increases, and you start again. You can think of this as becoming increasingly willing to spend a lot of time going down difficult technical paths as you confirm that easier options don&#x2019;t exist.</p><p>Of course, this isn&#x2019;t a perfect model of what you should do. But, it seems to me that a note-taking system should aspire to support and encourage something resembling this. More generally, I want to get across the idea of thinking of your existing research methodology as an algorithm (possibly a bad one), and trying to think about how it could be improved. Don&#x2019;t try to force yourself to use any particular algorithm just because you think you should; but, if you can find ways to nudge yourself toward more effective algorithms, that&#x2019;s probably a good idea.</p><br><h2>Inventing Shorthand/Symbology</h2><p>I don&#x2019;t think writing speed is a big bottleneck to thinking speed. Even though I &#x201C;think by writing&#x201D;, a lot of my time is spent... well... thinking. However, once I know what I want to write, writing <em>does</em> take time. When inspiration really strikes, I might know more or less what I want to say several paragraphs ahead of where I&#x2019;ve actually written to. At times like that, it seems like every second counts -- the faster I write, the more ideas I get down, the less I forget before I get to it.</p><p>So, it seems worth putting <em>some</em> effort into writing faster. (Computer typing is obviously a thing to consider here, too.) Shorthand, and special symbols, are something to try.</p><p>There&#x2019;s also the issue of space. I know I advocate for small cards, which are intentionally limiting space. But you don&#x2019;t want to waste space if you don&#x2019;t have to. The point is to comprehend as much as possible as easily as possible. Writing bullet points and using indentation to make outlines is an improvement over traditional paragraphs because it lets you see more at a glance. Similarly, using abbreviations and special symbols will improve this.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve tried several times to learn &#x201C;proper&#x201D; shorthand. Maybe I just haven&#x2019;t tried hard enough, but it seems like basically all shorthand systems work by leaving out information. Once you&#x2019;re used to them, they&#x2019;re easy enough to read shortly after you&#x2019;ve written them -- when you still remember more or less what they said. However, they don&#x2019;t actually convey enough information to fully recover what was written if you don&#x2019;t have such a guess. Basically, they don&#x2019;t improve readability. They compress things down to the point where they&#x2019;re hard to decipher, for the sake of getting as much speed as possible.</p><p>On the other hand, I&#x2019;ve spent time experimenting with changes to my own handwriting which improve speed without compromising readability. Pay attention to what takes you the most time to write, and think about ways to streamline that.</p><p>Lion Kimbro emphasizes that you come up with ways to abbreviate things you commonly repeat. Ho describes using the Japanese symbols for days of the week and other common things in his system. The Bullet Journaling community has created its own symbology. Personally, I&#x2019;ve experimented with a variety of different reference symbols which mean different sorts of things (beyond the () vs [] distinction I&#x2019;ve mentioned).</p><p>The Bullet Journaling community has thought a lot about short-and-fast writing for the purpose of getting things out quickly and leaving more space on the page. They also have their own symbology which may be worth taking a look at. (I don&apos;t yet use it, but I may switch to it or something similar eventually.)</p><p>Well, that&#x2019;s all I want to say for now. I may add to this document in the future. For now, best of luck developing ideas!</p><h1>Follow-Up Reports</h1><p><strong>June 12, 2020.</strong> My index-card Zettelkasten has not continued to grow at the rate it did initially. However, I still find the address system of Zettelkasten almost indispensable for note-taking. (I would say &quot;I can&apos;t imagine what I did before&quot; except that I know exactly what I did before; it was just way worse.) I have several different Zettelkasten in different formats, which I switch between.</p><p>One of the main ways I now use Zettelkasten is in notebooks with fixed-order pages. This means I <strong><em>can never sort the cards</em></strong>; pages remain in the order which they&apos;re originally written in. However, maintaining the address system is still <em>extremely</em> useful, and allows me to have thoughts which I would not otherwise be capable of having. As I mentioned, I don&apos;t sort my index cards that often anyway, and I feel like I lose important recency information when I do so. So losing the ability to rearrange pages was not so bad! Although, I still miss it sometimes and do still use other formats which allow me to rearrange pages appropriately.</p><p>I still mainly find Zettelkasten useful on the order of minutes, weeks, and months. After that long, my notes start to become &quot;stale&quot; and I&apos;m better off starting fresh rather than continuing to build on my old note structures about a particular idea. (Old notes are still useful for reference purposes, but I very rarely add to them to further develop the ideas therein, preferring to start fresh with a new tree of ideas.)</p><p>This is partly because the Zettelkasten note structure is not very rearrangeable, and so I can&apos;t &quot;fix&quot; old structures to reflect new thinking. As I&apos;ve discussed, I&apos;ve had better luck with digital note structures continuing to have real use over long time periods. But it&apos;s not just that -- I&apos;ve still <em>mainly</em> experienced note structures &quot;going stale&quot; in digital formats, as well.</p><p>There are two possible responses to this that I see. (1) Try to develop better techniques to make long-term useful structures. (2) Embrace the tendency, and optimize for the more immediate usefulness. I&apos;ve tended toward (2). I worry that optimizing for (1) too much would create only hypothetical value at the cost of real value -- like when you delay gratification indefinitely.</p><p>Relatedly, I still haven&apos;t made much use of indexing.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>The following distinction is crucial to my understanding of consciousness and epistemology. It is also extremely useful for seeing through some of the language games people play in terms of framing. There are fundamentally two ways in which we can define entities and much confusion is created by failing to distinguish between the two.</p><p>The first way is relabelling where we define something in terms of what we've already defined. If we've already defined the meaning of hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms and molecules, then we can simply define water as a molecule consisting of one hydrogen atom and two oxygen atoms, if that's how we want to define it. Defining water in this way postulate a new entity in our fundamental ontology, but instead reuses existing elements.</p><p>The second way is to define an external reference; that is, a reference that doesn't purely build on top of already defined language or meaning. It is a very common belief that we can only define something in terms of things that have already been defined, but if that were the case, then we wouldn't even be able to get our first definition of the ground. All our definitions would either be circular or involve an infinite regress.</p><p>External references provide a not completely satisfactory, but pragmatically necessary workaround. Instead of being impractically purist when it comes to definitions, we allow ourselves to point to (or vaguely gesture at) things without being able to fully say what they are.</p><p>Let's imagine that quarks are the foundational element of physics as far as we can tell. Well, we could define quarks by how they interact with each other, but that is a surface level characteristic, which doesn't seem to explain what exactly they are at their fundamental core And if these quarks have a nature beyond their behaviour, then it makes sense to think about them as external references.</p><p>Some might say that the observable behaviour of these quarks is all that there is to their nature. If this is the case, then I would like to ask what is the difference between an atom and a simulation of an atom? Or even if I concede these quarks can be defined in terms of behaviour, what exactly is behaviour at its core? It doesn't seem like we can define behaviour in terms of behaviour and saying \"It is what it is\" seems like a way of obscuring that we don't know what it is. At the end of the day, it seems there has to be some deeper nature somewhere.</p><p>Here's another way of putting this: Relabeling defines a new entity in the map; external references posit a new entity in the territory (see: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJ9MFBPwXGwNpadf2/skill-the-map-is-not-the-territory\">map and territory</a>)</p><p><strong>Relabelings don't change a system</strong></p><p>Creating a relabeling doesn't affect reality (alternate phrasing: adding a new entity in the map doesn't change the territory). Here's an example: Let's suppose I introduce a new label \"Gaia\" and I say that by this I only mean the natural world and nothing more. Well, there's no reason why I can't use the word Gaia for this, however, most of the time people do this</p><p>I'm allowed to define terms however I want, however I shouldn't use this to trick you into accepting the connotations of the term, for example, that nature is some kind of divine being or provides a perfect order. I wouldn't object if someone argued that nature has these properties separately and chose to use the term to emphasise those aspects, but we shouldn't accept an argument by definition.</p><p>This is a <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/\">Motte and Bailey argument</a>.  The Mott is the claim that they are just using a slightly unusual term for the natural world. The Bailey is that the natural world has the properties we tend to associate with this term. Or in my terminology, Gaia is a relabelling and it perhaps the framing might help us understand and talk about the system, but introducing it doesn't change anything. For any argument we can make using the term \"Gaia\", we should be able to make the same argument without it (see: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words\">Tabooing your words</a>). Adding the relabelling \"Gaia\" into the system doesn't add divinity or a perfect order into the system. If they are present, they should still be present after we remove that relabelling.</p><p>Here's another example: a reasonable number of people believe that  it is intrinsically valuable for beauty to exist in the world, even if no-one ever experiences it. \"Intrinsically valuable\" can mean different things to different people, but here let's take it to claim some kind of objective value independent of any observer. Similarly,  I think most people wouldn't object to defining an object being beautiful as meaning that it meets certain aesthetic criteria when viewed by most humans.</p><p>I don't want to claim that the claim of intrinsic value is definitively false, but I believe we should be highly suspicious of this claim. The claim that beauty is intrinsically valuable seems to lean upon the conception of beauty as an intrinsic property of objects. Once we taboo the word beautiful, the argument becomes much less compelling. Beauty just seems a relabeling which matches particular combinations of atoms. It becomes natural to ask, \"What is so special about these combinations that makes them valuable when other combinations are not?\" And if the only thing that is special about these combinations is that they create a certain experience <em>when viewed by a human</em>, then this doesn't seem to provide a reason to think them valuable <em>when not viewed by a human</em>. Perhaps there is a way to justify this, but this isn't a sufficient argument by itself.</p><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>Ultimately, I'm trying to build up towards making a point about consciousness, which I know will be controversial since I tried making it here before and it met with significant opposition. I decided that it would be logical to take a step back and clarify my epistemological stance, in the hope that it might reduce the chance that we end up talking past each other.</p>",

As well as succeeding in &#x2022;producing beliefs in people, they have been effective in &#x2022;squashing and stopping inquiry; and the harm they have done by spoiling and putting an end to other men&#x2019;s efforts outweighs any good their own efforts have brought. Some people on the other hand have gone the opposite way, asserting that absolutely nothing can be known&#x2014;having reached this opinion through dislike of the ancient sophists, or through uncertainty and fluctuation of mind, or even through being crammed with some doctrine or other. They have certainly advanced respectable reasons for their view; but zeal and posturing have carried them much too far: they haven&#x2019;t &#x2022;started from true premises or &#x2022;ended at the right conclusion. The earlier of the ancient Greeks (whose writings are lost) showed better judgment in taking a position between</p><ul><li>one extreme: presuming to pronounce on everything,</li></ul><p>and</p><ul><li>the opposite extreme: despairing of coming to understand anything.</li></ul><p>My method is hard to practice but easy to explain. I propose to &#x2022;establish <em>degrees</em> of certainty, to &#x2022;retain &#xB7;the evidence of&#xB7; the senses subject to certain constraints, but mostly to &#x2022;reject ways of thinking that track along after sensation. In place of that, I open up a new and certain path for the mind to follow, starting from sense-perception. The need for this was felt, no doubt, by those who gave such importance to dialectics; their emphasis on dialectics showed that they were looking for aids to the intellect, and had no confidence in the innate and spontaneous process of the mind.</p><p>[Bacon&#x2019;s <em>dialectica</em>, sometimes translated as &#x2018;logic&#x2019;, refers more narrowly to the formalized and rule-governed use of logic, especially in debates.]</p><p>But this remedy did no good, coming as it did <em>after</em> the processes of everyday life had filled the mind with hearsay and debased doctrines and infested it with utterly empty idols. (&#xB7;I shall explain &#x2018;idols&#x2019; in <strong>39&#x2013;45</strong>&#xB7;.) The upshot was that the art of dialectics, coming (I repeat) too late to the rescue and having no power to set matters right, was only good for fixing errors rather than for revealing truth.</p><p>[Throughout this work, &#x2018;art&#x2019; will refer to any human activity that involves techniques and requires skills.]</p><p>We are left with only one way to health&#x2014;namely to start the work of the mind all over again. In this, the mind shouldn&#x2019;t be left to its own devices, but right from the outset should be guided at every step, as though a machine were in control.</p><p>Certainly if in mechanical projects men had set to work with their naked hands, without the help and power of tools, just as in intellectual matters they have set to work with little but the naked forces of the intellect, even with their best collaborating efforts they wouldn&#x2019;t have achieved&#x2014;or even attempted&#x2014;much. . . . Suppose that some enormous stone column had to be moved from its place (wanted elsewhere for some ceremonial purpose), and that men started trying to move it with their naked hands, wouldn&#x2019;t any sober spectator think them mad? If they then brought in more people, thinking that that might do it, wouldn&#x2019;t he think them even madder? If they then weeded out the weaker labourers, and used only the strong and vigorous ones, wouldn&#x2019;t he think them madder than ever? Finally, if they resolved to get help from the art of athletics, and required all their workers to come with hands, arms, and sinews properly oiled and medicated according to good athletic practice, wouldn&#x2019;t the onlooker think &#x2018;My God, they are trying to show <em>method</em> in their madness!&#x2019;?</p><p>Yet that is exactly how men proceed in intellectual matters&#x2014;with just the same kind of mad effort and useless combining of forces&#x2014;when they hope to achieve great things either through their individual brilliance or through the sheer number of them who will co-operate in the work, and when they try through dialectics (which we can see as a kind of athletic art) to strengthen the sinews of the intellect. With all this study and effort, as anyone with sound judgment can see, they are merely applying the naked intellect; whereas in any great work to be done by the hand of man the only way to increase the force exerted by each and to co-ordinate the efforts of all is through instruments and machinery.</p><p>Arising from those prefatory remarks, there are two more things I have to say; I want them to be known, and not forgotten. &#xB7;One concerns ancient <em>philosophers</em>, the other concerns modern <em>philosophy</em>&#xB7;.</p><p>(1) If I were to declare that I could set out on &#x2022;the same road as the ancient philosophers and come back with something better than they did, there would be no disguising the fact that I was setting up a rivalry between them and me, inviting a comparison in respect of our levels of excellence or intelligence or competence. There would nothing new in that, and nothing <em>wrong</em> with it either, for if the ancients got something wrong, why couldn&#x2019;t I&#x2014;why couldn&#x2019;t <em>anyone</em>&#x2014;point it out and criticise them for it? But that contest, however right or permissible it was, might have been an unequal one, casting an unfavourable light on my powers. So it is a good thing&#x2014;good for avoiding conflicts and intellectual turmoil&#x2014;that I can leave untouched the honour and reverence due to the ancients, and do what I plan to do while gathering the fruits of my modesty! There won&#x2019;t be any conflict here: my aim is to open up &#x2022;a new road for the intellect to follow, a road the ancients didn&#x2019;t know and didn&#x2019;t try. I shan&#x2019;t be taking a side or pressing a case. My role is merely that of a guide who points out the road&#x2014;a lowly enough task, depending more on a kind of luck than on any ability or excellence.</p><p>(2) That was a point about persons; the other thing I want to remind you of concerns the topic itself. Please bear this in mind: I&#x2019;m not even slightly working to overthrow the philosophy [here = &#x2018;philosophy and science&#x2019;] that is flourishing these days, or any other more correct and complete philosophy that has been or will be propounded. I don&#x2019;t put obstacles in the way of this accepted philosophy or others like it; &#xB7;let them go on doing what they have long done so well&#xB7;&#x2014;let them give philosophers something to argue about, provide decoration for speech, bring profit to teachers of rhetoric and civil servants! Let me be frank about it: the philosophy that I shall be advancing isn&#x2019;t much use for any of <em>those</em> purposes. It isn&#x2019;t ready to hand; you can&#x2019;t just pick it up as you go; it doesn&#x2019;t fit with preconceived ideas in a way that would enable it to slide smoothly into the mind; and the vulgar won&#x2019;t ever get hold of it except through its practical applications and its effects.</p><p>[In this work, &#x2018;vulgar&#x2019; means &#x2018;common, ordinary, run-of-the-mill&#x2019; (as in &#x2018;vulgar induction&#x2019; <strong>17</strong>) or, as applied to people, &#x2018;having little education and few intellectual interests&#x2019;.]</p><p>So let there be two sources of doctrine, two disciplines, two groups of philosophers, and two ways of doing philosophy, with the groups not being hostile or alien to each other, but bound together by mutual services. In short, let there be one discipline for cultivating the knowledge we have, and another for discovering new knowledge. This may be pleasant and beneficial for both. Most men are in too much of a hurry, or too preoccupied with business affairs, to engage with my way of doing philosophy&#x2014;or they don&#x2019;t have the mental powers needed to understand it. If for any of those reasons you prefer the other way&#x2014;&#xB7;prefer cultivation to discovery&#xB7;&#x2014;I wish you all success in your choice, and I hope you&#x2019;ll get what you are after. But if you aren&#x2019;t content to stick with the knowledge we already have, and want</p><ul><li>to penetrate further,</li><li>to conquer nature by works, not conquer an adversary by argument,</li><li>to look not for nice probable opinions but for sure proven knowledge,</li></ul><p>I invite you to join with me, if you see fit to do so. [In this context, &#x2018;works&#x2019; are experiments.] Countless people have stamped around in nature&#x2019;s outer courts; let us get across those and try to find a way into the inner rooms. For ease of communication and to make my approach more familiar by giving it a name, I have chosen to call one of these approaches &#x2018;the mind&#x2019;s <strong>anticipation</strong> &#xB7;of nature&#xB7;&#x2019;, the other &#x2018;the <strong>interpretation</strong> of nature&#x2019;.</p><p>[Throughout this work, &#x2018;anticipation&#x2019; means something like &#x2018;second-guessing, getting ahead of the data, jumping the gun&#x2019;. Bacon means it to sound rash and risky; no one current English word does the job.]</p><p>I have one request to make, &#xB7;namely that my courtesies towards you, the reader, shall be matched by your courtesies to me&#xB7;. I have put much thought and care into ensuring that the things I say will be not only true but smoothly and comfortably accepted by &#x2022;your mind, however clogged &#x2022;it is by previous opinions. It is only fair&#x2014;especially in such a great restoration of learning and knowledge&#x2014;for me to ask a favour in return, namely this: If you are led &#x2022;by the evidence of your senses, or &#x2022;by the jostling crowd of &#x2018;authorities&#x2019;, or &#x2022;by arguments in strict logical form (which these days are respected as though they were the law of the land), to want to pass judgment on these speculations of mine, don&#x2019;t think you can do this casually, while you are mainly busy with something else. Examine the matter thoroughly; go a little distance yourself along the road that I describe and lay out; make yourself familiar with the <em>subtlety</em> of things that our experience indicates; give your deeply-rooted bad mental habits a reasonable amount of time to correct themselves; and <em>then</em>, when you have started to be in control of yourself, use your own judgment&#x2014;if you want to.</p><p>[Bacon doesn&#x2019;t ever in this work address the reader at length. This version sometimes replaces &#x2018;If anybody. . . &#x2019; by &#x2018;If you. . . &#x2019;, &#x2018;Men should. . . &#x2019; by &#x2018;You should. . . &#x2019; and so on, to make the thought easier to follow.]</p>",

Though the work might be succinctly described as Bacon’s views on empiricism and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductivism\">inductivism</a>, it is far more than a list of experimental steps to be followed. It is an entire epistemology and philosophy—possibly <em>the</em> epistemology and philosophy which underlay the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution#Baconian_science\">Scientific Revolution</a>.</p><p>Bacon was damning of the science of his time and preceding centuries. He saw the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_scientific_method#Aristotle\">pseudo-empirical syllogistic paradigm</a> as deeply flawed and incapable of making progress. </p><blockquote>If those doctrines ·of the ancient Greeks· hadn’t been so utterly like a plant torn up by its roots, and had remained attached to and nourished by the womb of nature, the state of affairs that we have seen to obtain for two thousand years—namely <em>the sciences stayed in the place where they began, hardly changing, not getting any additions worth mentioning, thriving best in the hands of their first founders and declining from then on</em>—would never have come about. (<strong>74</strong>) [1]</blockquote><p>He also believed that the unaided human mind was incapable of getting far on its own.</p><blockquote>Nearly all the things that go wrong in the sciences have a single cause and root, namely: while wrongly admiring and praising the powers of the human mind, we don’t look for true helps for it. (<strong>9</strong>)</blockquote><br><blockquote> Not much can be achieved by the naked hand or by the unaided intellect. Tasks are carried through by tools and helps, and the intellect needs them as much as the hand does. (<strong>2</strong>)</blockquote><br><blockquote>When the intellect of a sober, patient, and grave mind is left to itself (especially in a mind that isn’t held back by accepted doctrines), it ventures a little way along the right path; but it doesn’t get far, because without guidance and help it isn’t up to the task, and is quite unfit to overcome the obscurity of things. (<strong>21</strong>)</blockquote><p>Nonetheless, he was optimistic that if the old doctrines were abandoned, <em>idols of the mind</em> (i.e., biases, fallacies, and confusions) were cleared out, and his precise, careful empirical method was followed by a community of scholars, then no knowledge was out of reach and humanity would eventually achieve all of the most splendid discoveries.</p><blockquote>Until now men haven’t lingered long with •experience; they have brushed past it on their way to the ingenious •theorizings on which they have wasted unthinkable amounts of time. But if we had someone at hand who could answer our questions of the form ‘What are the facts about this matter?’, it wouldn’t take many years for us to discover all causes and complete every science. (<strong>112</strong>)</blockquote><p>The human mind is fallible and flawed—”like a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/46qnWRSR7L2eyNbMA/the-lens-that-sees-its-flaws\">distorting mirror</a>,'' Bacon says—yet its biases can be overcome. Through adherence to properly looking at the world, such that if “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fKiTt55jEiTFK5prp/entangled-with-reality-the-shoelace-example\">the road from the senses to the intellect</a> [is] well defended with walls along each side,” then a scientific community can figure out the world and even reach <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atlantis\">Utopia</a>. </p><p><em>This a decidedly LessWrong worldview. </em></p><p>Indeed, by my reading, Bacon possessed in some form a large number of concepts employed on LessWrong, not limited to: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">confirmation bias</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Motivated_cognition\">motivated cognition</a>, <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/js/the_bottom_line/\">the bottom line</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZTRiSNmeGQK8AkdN2/mind-projection-fallacy\">mind-projection fallacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rmAbiEKQDpDnZzcRf/positive-bias-look-into-the-dark\">positive bias</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6s3xABaXKPdFwA3FS/what-is-evidence\">entangled evidence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d5NyJ2Lf6N22AD9PB/where-to-draw-the-boundary\">carving reality at its joints</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RgkqLqkg8vLhsYpfh/fake-causality\">fake causality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5uZQHpecjn7955faL/p/6i3zToomS86oj9bS6\">worshipping ignorance</a>, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/\">idea inoculation</a>, <a href=\"http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail\">the surprisingly detailedness of reality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HLqWn5LASfhhArZ7w/expecting-short-inferential-distances\">inferential distance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oLGCcbnvabyibnG9d\">incentives</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb/p/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz\">dissolving confused language</a>. He even spoke of the <em><a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq\">appropriate degrees of certainty</a> </em>for each stage of an inquiry and<em> </em>deliberately used <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Hrm59GdN2yDPWbtrd/feature-idea-epistemic-status\">epistemic statuses</a>! </p><p>Novum Organum was Bacon’s monumental attempt to explain all of the above: how and why the existing scientific methods were entirely broken, why nobody had noticed until then, what the alternative paradigm was, and a vision for a community of scholars and institutions which could help discover all scientific truths.</p><p>Covering biases and empiricism as it does, Novum Organum is highly instructive as a rationalist text. Yet why read Bacon when we’ve got <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality\">the Sequences</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/codex\">Codex</a>, and the rest of modern LessWrong? I answer that it’s worthwhile because there’s a focus and immediacy to a text whose author wasn’t writing abstractly, but direly wanted to redirect all the scientific efforts of his time to be more productive. </p><p>There’s an impressiveness to someone grappling with how to do science at a point when so much less was known about the world. Compared to us, Bacon’s time was one of extreme mystery. Recall that he was writing before Boyle, Newton, Maxwell, or Darwin. He did not have access to theories of thermodynamics, electromagnetism, evolution, or atomic physics. They hadn’t even invented the mercury thermometer in his time. He earnestly tried to figure out simply “what is heat?” and by use of his meticulous empiricism correctly inferred it was just something to do with motion—150 years before phlogiston theory was laid to rest and with access to only primitive air-based thermometers!</p><p>We get to look back and point to all that modern science has done over the centuries to make us feel enthusiastic. Four hundred years ago, Bacon's enthusiasm came entirely from his ability to look forward.</p><p>There is also perhaps a validation of the LessWrong worldview to be found in Bacon. Bacon was a symbolic figure of the Scientific Revolution. Inspirational to the Royal Society and many others. Historical credit allocation is hard, but it seems more likely than not that Bacon gets a good deal of credit in bringing about the Scientific Revolution. Seemingly, many of the same ideas that we cherish now were read by the scholars who first read Bacon and kicked off the modern scientific era. If only people hadn’t stopped reading Bacon in the original after a few generations.</p><p>Beyond his instruction in biases and empiricism, Bacon in an inspiration to the LessWrong 2.0 project [2] for his visions of how infrastructure and community are key to intellectual progress. Bacon saw intellectual progress as a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZvjYRmkTfWxhTXCaT/lesswrong-2-0-technology-platform-for-intellectual-progress\">technological</a> [3] and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nBcvEFXw4Yoz7rSDk/lesswrong-2-0-community-culture-and-intellectual-progress\">collaborative</a> endeavor, exactly as LessWrong 2.0 does.</p><p>At the technologies for individual thinking level, Bacon writes:</p><blockquote>Not much can be achieved by the naked hand or by the unaided intellect. Tasks are carried through by tools and helps, and the intellect needs them as much as the hand does. And just as the hand’s tools either give motion or guide it, so ·in a comparable way· the mind’s tools either point the intellect in the direction it should go or offer warnings. (<strong>2</strong>)</blockquote><p>Bacon is further adamant that the process of science requires people to write their work down and share it. Perhaps this is obvious now, but Bacon was writing before the first scientific journal, indeed, he is credited as a major inspiration for the Royal Society whose <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society\">philosophical transactions were the first scientific journal</a>.</p><blockquote>Even after we have acquired and have ready at hand a store of natural history and experimental results such as is required for the work of the intellect, or of philosophy, still that is not enough. The intellect is far from being able to retain all this material in memory and recall it at will, any more than a man could keep a diary all in his head. Yet until now there has been more thinking than writing about discovery procedures—experimentation hasn’t yet become literate! But a discovery isn’t worth much if it isn’t ·planned and reported· in writing; and when this becomes the standard practice, better things can be hoped for from experimental procedures that have at last  been made literate. (<strong>101</strong>)</blockquote><p>Yet another point, maybe, obvious to us now: the work of science can be split up among people.</p><blockquote>Unlike the work of sheerly thinking up hypotheses, proper scientific work can be done collaboratively; the best way is for men’s efforts (especially in collecting experimental results) to be exerted separately and then brought together. Men will begin to know their strength only when they go this way—with one taking charge of one thing and another of another, instead of all doing all the same things. (<strong>113)</strong></blockquote><p>Though Bacon’s greatest reference to collaborating and institution for knowledge perhaps comes from his utopian novel, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atlantis\">New Atlantis</a>. </em>One character describes the fictional institution of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon%27s_House\">Solomon’s House</a>:</p><blockquote>Ye shall understand (my dear friends) that amongst the excellent acts of that king, one above all hath the pre-eminence. It was the erection and institution of an Order or Society, which we call <em>Salomon's House</em>; the noblest foundation (as we think) that ever was upon the earth; and the lanthorn of this kingdom. It is dedicated to the study of the works and creatures of God. Some think it beareth the founder's name a little corrupted, as if it should be Solamona's House. But the records write it as it is spoken. So as I take it to be denominate of the king of the Hebrews, which is famous with you, and no stranger to us.</blockquote><p>The novel goes into great depth about how the institution functions and all the roles different individuals play in the scientific process. According to Wikipedia, it is this vision which inspired Samuel Hartlib and Robert Boyle to found the Royal Society. </p><p>To conclude this introduction, I’ll mention that Novum Organum is actually part two of six from Bacon’s much larger, never-completed work, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum_Organum#Instauratio_Magna\">Instauratio Magna</a></em>. The title is usually translated as <em>The Great Instauration</em> yet <a href=\"http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/faqs/bennett\">Bennett</a> (whose translation of Novum Organum we are posting) translates it as <em>The Great Fresh Start</em>. Seems fitting to Bacon’s intentions.</p><blockquote>It is pointless to expect any great advances in science from grafting new things onto old. If we don’t want to go around in circles for ever, making ‘progress’ that is so small as be almost negligible, we must make a fresh start with deep foundations. (<strong>31</strong>)</blockquote><p>Given the Scientific Revolution got going in earnest around his lifetime, I dare say he got what we he asked for.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>[1] Novum Organum consists two books each containing \"aphorisms\" which range in length from three lines to sixteen pages. A bold number on its own refers to an aphorism from Book 1 by default or Book 2 where the context is very clear. When unclear, aphorisms are referenced by a leading 1- or 2- to disambiguate, e.g 2-13 is the 13th aphorism in Book 2.</p><p>[2] Usually, we now call ourselves simply “LessWrong” but it feels important to disambiguate here since I cannot make claims to the vision for original LessWrong as founded in 2009 by Eliezer. It does seem clear that Eliezer was not influenced by Bacon in the same way that Habryka (LessWrong 2.0’s team lead and core founder) has been.</p><p>[3] By <em>technological</em> I refer broadly to the creation of knowledge and tools that can be used for a specific purpose, including things like methodologies and procedures, not just physical artifacts. I would call a set of techniques for debiasing one’s thinking and likewise training for how to moderate an online forum as both examples of technologies.</p>",

It&#x2019;s really cool. I haven&#x2019;t experienced this before.</p><p><strong>In these interviews, I try</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://conversationswithtyler.com/\">to channel Tyler Cowen</a>. Before he interviews people he reads everything they&#x2019;ve produced so he&#x2019;s not introducing listeners to a person, but diving really deep into how they think. Because we set this interview up on short notice, I spent 8 hours yesterday</strong> <a href=\"https://knowingless.com/\">consuming your entire blog</a> <strong>and podcast archive.</strong></p><p>Have you heard of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8h8NJG9gacZ5lAJJvhD0fQ\">Nardwuar</a>? He&#x2019;s an interviewer who also does this. Last night when you sent me the questions I felt that this would be like a Nardwuar interview.</p><p><strong>I want to start with an</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.askhole.io/\">Askholey</a></strong> <strong>question. Do people know the real you? Would people who follow you online be surprised if they got to spend a lot of time with you?</strong></p><p>I don&#x2019;t know what that means, &#x201C;the real me&#x201D;. Most likely people would be surprised by things that aren&#x2019;t that interesting, like small habits I have. Things that are interesting, I tend to talk about because stories are a commodity. Learning to identify the aspects of my life that can serve as a commodity is really useful because you can put it out there and then get attention and start a dialogue in ways that are new and creative. And so the things that aren&#x2019;t novel are things that might surprise you, like how I take my coffee or something.</p><p><strong>Do you identify with the story of you that&#x2019;s out there?</strong></p><p>I don&#x2019;t know what that means. There&#x2019;s a strong way in which I feel like the stuff I write about myself in the past is a completely different person. The sense that I have when writing about myself in the past, is like a story that&#x2019;s not me. It&#x2019;s just a dream that I woke up with in my head one day and I&#x2019;m sharing that dream.</p><p><strong>So we&#x2019;re getting a snapshot of Aella&#x2019;s mind on September 5th, 2019, and that&#x2019;s it. Is there a set date at which you will automatically unendorse everything you&#x2019;re going to say today?</strong></p><p>It kind of happens as I say it. If I&#x2019;m paying attention and being mindful when speaking, then it becomes a lot more salient for me. As soon as something leaves my mouth, it&#x2019;s as if it&#x2019;s no longer part of me in any way.&#xA0;</p><p>It&#x2019;s a weird thing to have a feeling that you identify with something. Like what even is that, to identify with something?</p><p><strong>I think that there&#x2019;s no objective answer to what your identity is, it&#x2019;s more of a stance that you can take. If I notice a feature of me that persists over time, and people start predicting my behavior based on it,</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/predictable-identities/\">I&#x2019;m also going to predict myself</a></strong> <strong>based on it and it becomes my identity.</strong></p><p>So your identity is prediction?</p><p><strong>That&#x2019;s one of the ways to think about it.</strong></p><p>I don&#x2019;t identify with a lot of aspects of my body. I don&#x2019;t carry things like my digestive system or subconscious habits that I have as a sense of identity. I guess I&#x2019;m saying that predictability is not all that you need.</p><p><strong>I just saw a woman wearing a t-shirt that said:</strong> <strong><em>&#x201C;Queens are born in December&#x201D;</em>. People will craft an identity out of any random thing, like the month they were born.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s kind of fun!</p><p>Something I&#x2019;ve been working on recently is the sense of flexible identity, being able to rapidly shift the identity that I have. And this is helping me not be afraid of carrying authority and also not be afraid of not having authority. Going back and forth rapidly between knowing what I&#x2019;m talking about and knowing nothing of what I&#x2019;m talking about. It feels really good to be able to shift identity or the sense of it.</p><p><strong>I asked for question suggestions from our Twitter followers, which gave me a glimpse into your world a little bit. I have 750 followers and I&#x2019;m very proud of all of them. You have 35,000, and</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1169698605294325763\">I&#x2019;m not as proud of them</a>.&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Yeah, I often have my hopes in humanity dashed by Twitter. It keeps my relation to humanity humble.</p><p><strong>I get the sense that you&#x2019;re really curious about people at large, without necessarily liking them.</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q2plaBw2UEYelx8bFP1dEi9zAcH5se_ZJvxLZISdN8o/edit#gid=1488785250\">A lot of your Twitter questions</a> <strong>are driven by curiosity but they</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl/status/949408470062673920\">don&#x2019;t show people in the best light</a><strong>.</strong></p><p>That is true. I enjoy bonding in darkness, finding the worst aspects of someone or forcing a bad frame or a confession. Showing that we&#x2019;re all in an evil and gritty sort of world and then displaying acceptance in that world. I really enjoy the sense of acceptance and peace inside the hairy, gross stuff. And so part of my drive is to pull people <em>downwards</em> because I want to show that it can be safe there. It&#x2019;s safe to go down. I like that.</p><p><strong>Tyler Cowen is fond of saying that every thinker is a regional thinker. That the culture and circumstances where you grew up affect how you think and make you different from your current intellectual peers. You grew up in</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://knowingless.com/2017/04/24/how-i-lost-my-faith/\">really unusual circumstances</a>; how do they affect the way you think today?</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s hard to know what is the culture and what is genetics, but there are definitely things that came into play like cultural isolation. When I was growing up access to movies and music was really limited. We weren&#x2019;t allowed to see media of children who were upset with their parents so even the concept of being whiny just wasn&#x2019;t in my worldview. Information was controlled at such an extreme level. And of course, I didn&#x2019;t go to public school except for a couple of brief months, which didn&#x2019;t have much of an effect on me.&#xA0;</p><p>Also very important was the philosophy of us-against-the-world. &#x2018;Us&#x2019; being the Christians, the minority, the one that was persecuted, and we had the truth and everybody else hated us. We were told constantly that when you grow up and you go into the world, you&#x2019;re going to have to stand your ground and everybody is going to think differently than you. But it&#x2019;s okay to think differently. And so I think that made me feel really comfortable from an early age with the idea of being really different from everybody else. That was just the norm.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Do</strong> <strong>you still feel like it&#x2019;s us-against-the-world, just transferred to a different tribe?</strong></p><p>I don&#x2019;t know. I think that this made me feel safe being different in a fundamental way. It reduced my fears around thinking terrible things, fears that other people might have. Although there was strong conformity in my culture as it was, we were still nonconformist in contrast to everyone else. So I had access to that nonconformist identity in ways that maybe the mainstream doesn&#x2019;t because there&#x2019;s nothing to contrast themselves to.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>How about the genetic side, and also your family upbringing. Do you see any</strong> <strong>parts of your parents in yourself?</strong> </p><p>I like to think of myself as sort of the blend between my parents. <a href=\"https://knowingless.com/2018/09/21/trauma-narrative/\">My dad&#x2019;s quite severe</a>. He has Asperger&#x2019;s and is ambitious in a kind of way. He&#x2019;s very intelligent and kind of immature and very masculine in a low empathy, low agreeableness manner. And I can see some of that in myself, too. When you&#x2019;re talking about me being more interested in curiosity and less in liking people that might come from low sociality.&#xA0;</p><p>But my mom is extremely empathetic and pro-social, exactly the opposite. And she taught us a lot of social norms that feel ingrained in me on a deep level, like being extremely kind to people around you no matter what. This has led to me sometimes engaging in actions that are weird, like going out of my way to get a homeless person an Uber. This backfired, the homeless person did not get in the Uber, they were insane. But I tried to do that when other people already knew that that&#x2019;s not something you&#x2019;re supposed to do.</p><p><strong>I just took a homeless person grocery shopping for the first time.</strong></p><p>Did that work?</p><p><strong>Yeah, it was a 10/10 great experience. I see a lot of homeless people in NYC with terrible signs that are clearly lies. But this guy&#x2019;s sign said:&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;A $10 shopping spree at CVS would be life-changing&#x201D;</em>. I liked how direct it was. I asked, &#x201C;Hey, buddy, what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201D; -&#x201D;Justin.&#x201D; -&#x201C;OK, Justin, let&#x2019;s go shopping at CVS. Anything you want is on me.&#x201D;</strong></p><p><strong>All he got was a box of tuna. I asked if he wanted anything else but he said that someone had already bought him soup, and that soup plus tuna is a great dinner.&#xA0;He also got really excited about how many different kinds of tuna there were&#xA0;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1165448248963883009\">and I almost said</a>, &#x201C;Yeah, isn&#x2019;t capitalism amazing?&#x201D; but in the end, I didn&#x2019;t say that.</strong></p><p><strong>I may not have been 100% sober when this happened.</strong></p><p>Did that cause you to do this or do you tend to do stuff like this in general? I guess it&#x2019;s already within you.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>I try to do more things like this in general, but I find myself doing them a lot less when I&#x2019;m sober. But this was such a great experience that I&#x2019;m going to do more stuff like that.</strong> </p><p>I used to do this kind of thing when I lived in Seattle. I lived alone; I was kind of lonely. And so one night I got pretty drunk and then went out on the street and saw this group of homeless people and gave them all LSD and then they all started tripping. I just hung out with them all night.</p><p>I continued to hang out with this group and would bring them food all the time and gifts. They were very picky about the food and gifts that I brought them, actually, but it was a really great experience. Homeless people and LSD is a great combo.</p><p><strong>To all the people out there: go buy some tuna, put LSD in it, and go make friends under the local bridge.</strong></p><p><strong>You&#x2019;re a very unique person in almost every domain, what you believe and the things you do. I have a speculative theory about that. It sounds like none of the social scripts that you&#x2019;ve absorbed as a child still ring true, and so you had to figure things out from scratch at 19.</strong></p><p><strong>I learned a lot of things from my parents and where I grew up about what&#x2019;s appropriate and what&#x2019;s good. Scripts for family life, work, education, how to treat people, etc.</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/about/#comment-46336\">Some of these I discarded</a>, but for the most part, they were pretty good scripts to follow.&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>But the only scripts you had came from your parents since you didn&#x2019;t have things like TV shows to offer an alternative. And the social rules you got from your parents seemed so bad that you completely rejected it. And so at 19, you had to reckon how to interact with the world with a completely open mind, doing sex work and psychedelics and all of that. It&#x2019;s like you were born again as an adult with no prior programming.</strong> </p><p>Weirdly, I think some of this might come down to the religious training that I had. You know my dad&#x2019;s a professional evangelical. A big deal growing up was proving other faiths wrong. And I was always terrified, how do we know <em>they&#x2019;re</em> wrong and <em>we&#x2019;re</em> not the ones that are wrong? I recognized that there is this weird parallel between my religion and the other religions. And so a huge part of my attention was devoted towards noticing that people just buy into what they&#x2019;re raised in, and that can send them to hell to burn for eternity.&#xA0;</p><p>This was an extremely terrifying idea to me, that people could just not deeply question what they believed in. I knew I had to do that for my own faith too, which is eventually what knocked me out of it. This deep fear of not questioning the thing that I&#x2019;m put into was a really big theme for me as a teenager and adult. I viewed everything with really strong skepticism because I&#x2019;d always been judging people of other faiths, like Muslims and Catholics, for not looking on their lives with a critical eye.&#xA0;</p><p>That put the idea into my brain that nothing is sacred at all because my God, the most sacred thing of all could be taken down by reason or at least questioning.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>So you still have an instinct to rigorously question things like systems of belief.</strong></p><p>I think it&#x2019;s a point of annoyance with even my closest friends that I may want to build a commune with, me being too fast to be skeptical about belief systems.</p><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s talk about friends and communities. I often think about how the people I spend most of my time with are not really representative of broad humanity, they&#x2019;re huge outliers in terms of intelligence, education (I don&#x2019;t mean college degrees), resources, etc. I imagine that for you this is even more extreme. Do you find it strange, living on an island of people who are strongly selected and unusual?</strong></p><p>Yes. When I was growing up I felt super introverted and everybody viewed me as an introvert. And then I <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/community\">found the Rationalists</a> and I realized for the first time that I was an extrovert with them, the people that I clicked with. I felt like I&#x2019;d been looking for them my whole life. There is a way in which my current community is satisfying something for me that normal communities can&#x2019;t and so I deeply appreciate that about them even though you get normalized to it. I&#x2019;m assuming this happens to you, too, although maybe not.&#xA0;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t really talk to people outside of my bubble very much. And then when I do, it&#x2019;s quite a shock. I forget that the world is so incredibly different from me and my friends.</p><p><strong>I have a normie day job, I have a soccer team and things like that. One of the reasons why I like New York and don&#x2019;t</strong> <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/\">move to Berkeley</a> <strong>is that I don&#x2019;t really want to have everyone I talk to be a rationalist.&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>I assume that growing up in Idaho in a fundamentalist Calvinist family you didn&#x2019;t know a lot of Jewish people. When was the first time you met one?</strong></p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know <em>any</em> Jewish people growing up. When I moved to the camgirl house in Washington a lot of the other girls had moved from the East Coast and would just talk about Jews or refer to Jews playfully. And I&#x2019;m like, what the fuck are you talking about? How do you have all these stereotypes about Jews? Where do you meet them? I didn&#x2019;t know that there was a whole bunch of them here in New York.</p><p><strong>And now it seems like every passing year you&#x2019;re surrounded by more and more Jews.</strong></p><p>Oh, yeah. Now it&#x2019;s just Jew city.</p><p>I kind of like it. I feel mild affection for the Jews on the basis of their race, which might be racist, I&#x2019;m not sure. I tend to have positive experiences with them, especially Israelis. I really like the Israelis that I&#x2019;ve met. When I go to burns, often there&#x2019;s a community of Israelis I hang out with and they&#x2019;re quite interesting, culturally different people.</p><p><strong>I&#x2019;m glad that my tribe is representing.</strong></p><p>Yeah, they&#x2019;re doing it well.</p><p><strong>You mentioned potentially forming a commune or an intentional community. Is that your biggest goal in life right now?</strong> </p><p>I think so. I&#x2019;m starting to shift from an &#x201C;explore mindset&#x201D; to a &#x201C;settle mindset&#x201D;, and people around me have been talking about building communities forever. I&#x2019;ve been afraid of it because you hear constantly about how intentional communities fail and explode. I don&#x2019;t know any intentional communities that have been together for decades with the same people. Maybe I&#x2019;m not looking in the right places.</p><p>Anyway, this has made me a little bit afraid of pursuing it but now I&#x2019;m starting to want it badly enough that I&#x2019;m going to pursue it anyway. I&#x2019;m interested in getting land or a large building.</p><p><strong>With what sort of people?</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://knowingless.com/2017/04/24/how-i-lost-my-faith/\">You wrote</a>:</strong> <strong><em>&#x201C;Belief systems aren&#x2019;t &#x2018;the things we&#x2019;ve logically concluded about the world.&#x2019; They are structures that give us a way to interact with our environment.&#x201D;</em></strong> <strong>And the environment is mostly the people around you. So what sort of people are you looking for and with what shared belief system?</strong></p><p>Sufficient intelligence, emotional maturity, and creativity are the three qualities I&#x2019;m most interested in if <a href=\"https://aella719441.typeform.com/to/P2hkTz\">we&#x2019;re going to be scoring people on tests or something</a>. With regards to a belief system, I think I&#x2019;m primarily interested in a specific relationship to that belief system. The flexibility to recognize that beliefs are something that you hold instead of having the belief hold you. Being able to manipulate or shift around your beliefs to figure out what is most useful in the moment, because I feel like people have a lot more options for interaction available to them if they&#x2019;re not subject to their beliefs. I&#x2019;m really drawn to people who seem to have that quality. I would love to live with those people.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>So: the anti-cult. You want questioning people who won&#x2019;t just settle into agreeing on a thing just because that gets them accepted by the group.&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Right. I think this falls into the intelligence category a bit. You want people who have this curiosity, which is something that I often find lacking with very creative people, weirdly enough. You&#x2019;d think that creative people are quite curious, but I&#x2019;ve been disappointed in this for a while.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>What are the main obstacles right now for getting that community set up?</strong></p><p>Money.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>So you&#x2019;re looking for a millionaire who thinks your community idea sounds cool?</strong></p><p>That would be dope, and I don&#x2019;t think is that infeasible, really. But I don&#x2019;t like the idea of being at the whim of someone else. Independence is quite important to me. And if you accept someone else&#x2019;s money, who&#x2019;s going to be part of this project, then you&#x2019;re subject to their whims.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>It shouldn&#x2019;t be hard for people who are intelligent, emotionally mature, and creative to make money. I&#x2019;m not optimizing for making money right now but I could still save up enough in a few years to then live for 20 years on a ranch in Montana. I just want someone to help babysit my kids when I have them.</strong></p><p>This is kind of what&#x2019;s going on. I and some of my friends have some funds that we&#x2019;re interested in using. Not a ton, but communities can also be businesses. You could have a community that runs a retreat or workshop center. Get investment from someone and start a company.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>The FDA could eventually approve psilocybin and LSD therapy for things like addiction and depression.</strong></p><p>An LSD cult on a ranch, it&#x2019;s not like that hasn&#x2019;t been done before.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://tim.blog/2019/09/10/largest-psychedelic-research-center/\">Tim Ferriss recently declared</a></strong> <strong>that he&#x2019;s putting all his energy into psychedelics research. It&#x2019;s a massive business opportunity.&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Yeah, I think it&#x2019;s going to be big and hopefully, it&#x2019;s done right this time. Last time it was a little&#x2026; people weren&#x2019;t ready.&#xA0;</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/23/book-review-the-electric-kool-aid-acid-test/\">Some people were more than ready</a>. Some people had a great time.</strong></p><p>&#xA0;That is true.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://knowingless.com/2016/09/03/wiki-links/\">Who do you identify</a></strong> <strong>with more,</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igaluk\">Igaluk or Malina</a>?&#xA0;</strong></p><p>That&#x2019;s the girl who got raped by her brother and cut off her breasts?</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think I was so much identifying with one of the characters as the incredible darkness of the tales of the Inuit life. It seems when reading about legends of different tribes that the farther north you go, the more horrific they are. Demons crawling out of things to eat children and such.&#xA0;</p><p>Igaluk and Malina, in Inuit mythology she ends up becoming the moon and he the sun and he&#x2019;s chasing her forever. This is their fucking sun and moon tale. In other places, it&#x2019;s the God-father giving birth to the earth and the sun rises in a chariot or something more innocent.</p><p><strong>The Aztecs are a tropical civilization, and their myths are pretty dark. But it does seem like warm weather cultures have more trickster gods who aren&#x2019;t really vicious, they just they fuck around.</strong></p><p>In other mythologies, there are classic tales of Hero&#x2019;s Journey or some shit. But if you fall down <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_religion\">the Wikipedia hole of Inuit mythology</a> it&#x2019;s just consistently gut-wrenching.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>So what&#x2019;s the morality that they teach? That the night is dark and full of terrors?</strong></p><p>Probably. I haven&#x2019;t thought about it too much, but my original theory was that the environment is a lot more threatening than it might be if you&#x2019;re in a tropical or warm place. So the stories reflect that. It does stay dark up there for a really long time for half the year.</p><p><strong>I wonder if they have a set of nicer myths to tell in July when it&#x2019;s sunny all the time and then they bust out the book of really dark tales in December.</strong></p><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s talk about sex.</strong></p><p>All right.</p><p><strong>There are many approaches and uses of sex, and you&#x2019;ve explored quite a few of them. And some of them are somewhat in tension. Sex can be used</strong> <strong>for bonding and creating intimate relationships with people of both genders.</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://knowingless.com/2016/08/20/342/\">But you also wrote about how</a></strong> <strong>at the heart of it is this vicious game of power and status. What does sex mean for you and how do you use it?</strong></p><p>Maybe the question that I have the least insight into is myself and sex. I&#x2019;ve been in and out of sex work for a while so for me, sex has primarily functioned as a money-making thing. It&#x2019;s practical, a business, the thing that you do to support yourself and eat food. It&#x2019;s quite distant and it&#x2019;s very much a tool for me. And so in my personal life, it&#x2019;s shifted a lot. I&#x2019;ve gone from having a really high sex drive to a really low sex drive and being uncertain about what I want in my partners.</p><p>In general, status seems to be attractive. People who are high status seem to make me want to have sex with them by being high status. Not always, obviously, but it&#x2019;s the highest correlate.</p><p><strong>You said on a podcast that when you first left home you were really horny and had sex all the time.</strong></p><p>That&#x2019;s true. My upbringing was extremely sexually suppressive and getting out of it made it feel like a fun game. And of course, I treated it very rationally, thinking I need to be rational in all my actions and so I need to be rational about sex. And rationally, if I enjoy pleasure and people enjoy pleasure, I should probably have sex with as many people who bring me pleasure as I can.&#xA0;</p><p>And so I did, but it turns out sex is very complicated. I wasn&#x2019;t actually enjoying it very much.</p><p><strong>It&#x2019;s probably common for every single human to at some point think they have sex figured out and then to discover how much there is to learn.</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;m kind of excited by the confusion that surrounds sex. Usually, when I meditate or introspect, I can develop a framework of what I&#x2019;m feeling. But with sexual arousal, it&#x2019;s just totally opaque. I assume it&#x2019;s this way for a lot of other people too, like we don&#x2019;t really know what gives people kinks. It&#x2019;s a very weird part of human psychology.</p><p><strong>I don&#x2019;t have sex &#x201C;figured out&#x201D; but my own relationship with it is more straightforward, at least in how it works for me. It&#x2019;s not a business for me, it&#x2019;s not a power move. It&#x2019;s pleasure and bonding; I always liked women more after sleeping with them.</strong></p><p>It makes sense.</p><p><strong>I hear women give each other advice that sleeping with a guy will make him respect the woman less. And I understand the evolutionary psychology and the power aspect of it, but I don&#x2019;t share this feeling at all. I respect anyone who made the smart choice to have sex with me!</strong> </p><p><strong>Many people see you as a sex object and project their sexual fantasies on you. And also many people see you as a guru and a teacher and project their hopes for enlightenment and wisdom on you. Either one of these roles is rare enough, how weird is it to be seen as both at the same time?</strong> </p><p>I suspect that the people that view me as a sex object and the people that view me as a teacher are not the same people.&#xA0;</p><p>The sex object thing doesn&#x2019;t really feel like much to me. It feels like a weird glitch. It&#x2019;s like playing a video game and running a character through this virtual world, and other characters sometimes run up to your character and try and hump it. It&#x2019;s just people reacting to this type of body in a specific way. It feels quite impersonal and practical. When I was doing sex work, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/camgirlz/\">camming</a> and <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/X5Mnr\">putting photos online</a>, it just felt like a very practical way of existing. It&#x2019;s like it wasn&#x2019;t really <em>me</em> doing it at all, but my avatar was doing it. So I don&#x2019;t really think about it that much.</p><p>The guru thing is weirder. There&#x2019;s this phenomenon that I didn&#x2019;t realize I was going to have once I hit some level of attention, which is that people treat me as a conduit for their own validation. So they recognize that I have some sort of quote-unquote authority or awareness or attention from others that gives me status. But the thing that they&#x2019;re looking for is not for my opinions, but rather for me to witness <em>them</em>. So they explain their problems to me, usually over email, and it seems that what they want is for me to just look at it. And so that makes me feel slightly dehumanized. It&#x2019;s like I am operating as a character that serves you a specific function. It feels a little weird, more so than the sex thing.</p><p><strong>Do you hear any problems that you feel really unqualified to answer?</strong></p><p>Yeah, definitely.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t have any that I remember right now, but there are some where it&#x2019;s obvious that mental illnesses are at stake. For those I think I have a slightly different approach &#x2013; &#x201C;crazy&#x201D; feels like a frame you can apply or not apply. I tend to be a little bit more open to people when they are in a crazy state because it&#x2019;s not crazy, it&#x2019;s just different. It&#x2019;s typically just a sub-optimal way of achieving your goals.</p><p><strong>Let&#x2019;s talk about insecurity. My favorite thing that you ever wrote is</strong> <strong><em><a href=\"https://knowingless.com/2018/05/02/so-says-crazybrain/\">So Says Crazybrain</a></em>. It sounds like you&#x2019;ve been thinking about insecurity a lot, attacking it in many ways. What&#x2019;s the state of that struggle right now?</strong></p><p>It vacillates, but the overall trend is having less of it. Insecurity seems to be not knowing what you are and being afraid that what you are is bad in some way. And so all of my insecurities come from the blind spots that I hold within myself. Sometimes my attention is too small or I&#x2019;m not practicing mindfulness enough such that the blind spots grow and I start to experience insecurity in daily life. I think that this is why insecurity tends to go away in familiar situations because you get to know yourself more in a familiar situation.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>So insecurity is feeling like you don&#x2019;t know yourself, and if you knew you would be disappointed.</strong></p><p>I struggled with it a huge amount. When I was younger, I was almost cripplingly insecure. I couldn&#x2019;t do things that other kids could do because I was so afraid of what people thought of me. I don&#x2019;t know if this came from my dad who is also extremely insecure.</p><p><strong>It&#x2019;s interesting that</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://knowingless.com/2017/01/15/choosing-insecurity/\">you tie monogamy to insecurity</a>. And it seems that even though the amount of insecurity you feel vacillates, you&#x2019;re never ceding polyamory to it.</strong></p><p>I have trouble even imagining not being poly. It&#x2019;s not a question that I ever think about it. I became poly almost as soon as I heard of it. I was 19, and at the time I was dating my boyfriend monogamously because that&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;d ever heard of and I was just doing the thing that everybody did. And then I met this guy and his wife who were living with a third person and they were all poly. And once they explained polyamory to me it made so much sense, it was obviously the thing that I want to do.&#xA0;</p><p>I tried explaining this to my boyfriend, why it should be okay for me to have sex with this new guy. But my boyfriend didn&#x2019;t get it and we ended up breaking up. Ever since then, I was definitely poly. I&#x2019;m not going to date anybody ever again who doesn&#x2019;t want me to have sex with someone I want to have sex with.</p>",

On one side is a crank, on the other side is a wheel which spins when the crank is turned. We want to predict the rotation of the wheel given the rotation of the crank, so we run a <u><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions\">Kaggle competition</a></u>.</p><p>We collect hundreds of thousands of data points on crank rotation and wheel rotation. 70% are used as training data, the other 30% set aside as test data and kept under lock and key in an old nuclear bunker. Hundreds of teams submit algorithms to predict wheel rotation from crank rotation. Several top teams combine their models into one gradient-boosted deep random neural support vector forest. The model achieves stunning precision and accuracy in predicting wheel rotation.</p><p>On the other hand, in a very literal sense, the model contains no <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding\">gears</a></u>. Is that a problem? If so, when and why would it be a problem?</p><h2>What is Missing?</h2><p>When we say the model “<u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding\">contains no gears</a></u>”, what does that mean, in a less literal and more generalizable sense?</p><p>Simplest answer: the deep random neural support vector forest model does not tell us what we expect to see if we open up the physical gearbox.</p><p>For instance, consider these two gearboxes:</p><p></p><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/wrsxjq3nevponhflkhc2\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:624%\"></figure><p></p><p>Both produce the same input-output behavior. Our model above, which treats the gearbox as a literal black box, does not tell us anything at all which would distinguish between these two cases. It only talks about input-output behavior, without making any predictions about what’s inside the gearbox (other than that the gearbox must be consistent with the input/output behavior).</p><p>That’s the key feature of gears-level models: they make falsifiable predictions about the internals of a system, separate from the externally-visible behavior. If a model could correctly predict all of a system’s externally-visible behavior, but still be falsified by looking inside the box, then that’s a gears-level model. Conversely, we cannot fully learn gears-level models by looking only at externally-visible input-output behavior - external behavior cannot, for example, distinguish between the 3- and 5-gear models above. A model which can be fully learned from system behavior, without any side information, is not a full gears-level model.</p><p>Why would this be useful, if what we really care about is the externally-visible behavior? Several reasons:</p><ul><li>First and foremost, if we are able to actually look inside the box, then that provides a huge amount of information about the behavior. If we can see the physical gears, then we can immediately make highly confident predictions about system behavior.</li><li>More generally, any information about the internals of the system provide a “side  channel” for testing gears-level models. If data about externally-visible behavior is limited, then the ability to leverage data about system internals can be valuable.</li><li>It may be that all of our input data is only from within a certain range - i.e. we never tried cranking the box faster than a human could crank. If someone comes along and attaches a motor to the crank, then that’s going to generate input way outside the range of what our input/output model has ever seen - but if we know what the gears look like, then that won’t be a problem. In other words, knowing what the system internals look like lets us deal with distribution shifts.</li><li>Finally, if someone changes something about the system, then a model trained only on input/output data will fail completely. For instance, maybe there’s a switch on top of the gearbox which disconnects the gears, and nobody has ever thrown it before. If we know what the inside of the box looks like, then that’s not a problem - we can look at what the switch does.</li></ul><p>All that said, if we have abundant data and aren’t worried about distribution shifts or system changes, non-gears models can still give us great predictive power. <u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Kolmogorov-Complexity-Applications-Computer/dp/0387339981\">Solomonoff induction</a></u> is the idealized theoretical example: it gives asymptotically optimal predictions based on input-output behavior, without any visibility into the system internals.</p><h2>Application: Macroeconomic Models</h2><p>One particularly well-known example of these ideas in action is the <u><a href=\"http://www.thebigquestions.com/LucasCritique.pdf\">Lucas Critique</a></u>, a famous 1976 paper by <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lucas,_Jr.\">Bob Lucas</a></u> critiquing the use of simple statistical models for evaluation of economic policy decisions. Lucas’ paper gives several broad examples, but arguably the most remembered example is policy decisions based on the <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve\">Phillips curve</a></u>.</p><p>The Phillips curve is an empirical relationship between unemployment and inflation. Phillips examined almost a century of economic data, and showed a consistent negative correlation: when inflation was high, unemployment was low, and vice-versa. In other words, prices and wages rise faster at the peak of the business cycle (when unemployment is low) than at the trough (when unemployment is high).</p><p>The obvious mistake one might make, based on the Phillips curve, is to think that perpetual low unemployment can be achieved simply by creating perpetual inflation (e.g. by printing money). Lucas opens his critique by eviscerating this very idea:</p><blockquote>The inference that permanent inflation will therefore induce a permanent economic high is no doubt [...] ancient, yet it is only recently that this notion has undergone the mysterious transformation from obvious fallacy to cornerstone of the theory of economic policy.</blockquote><p>Bear in mind that this was written in the mid-1970’s - the era of “stagflation”, when both inflation and unemployment were high for several years. Stagflation was an empirical violation of the Phillips curve - the historical behavior of the system broke down when central banks changed their policies to pursue more inflation, and people changed their behavior to account for faster expected inflation in the future.</p><p>In short: a statistical model with no gears in it completely fell apart when one part of the system (the central bank) changed its behavior.</p><p>On the other hand, <em>before</em> stagflation was under way, multiple theorists (notably <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Phelps\">Edmund Phelps</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman\">Milton Friedman</a></u>, via very different approaches) published simple gears-level models of the Phillips curve which predicted that it would break down if currencies were <em>predictably</em> devalued - i.e. if people <em>expected</em> central banks to print more money. The key “gears” in these models were individual agents - the macroeconomic behavior (unemployment-inflation relationship) was explained in terms of the expectations and decisions of all the individual people.</p><p>This led to a paradigm shift in macroeconomics, beginning the era of “microfoundations”: macroeconomic models derivable from microeconomic models of the expectations and behavior of individual agents - in other words, gears-level models of the economy.</p><h2>Gears from Behavior?</h2><p>In general, we cannot <em>fully</em> learn gears-level models by looking only at externally-visible input-output behavior. Our hypothetical 3- or 5-gear boxes are a case in point.</p><p>However, some kinds of models can at least deduce <em>something</em> about gears-level structure by looking at externally-visible behavior.</p><p>For example: given a gearbox with a crank and wheel, it’s entirely possible that the rotation of the wheel has hysteresis, a.k.a. memory - it depends not only on the crank’s rotation now, but also the crank’s rotation earlier. This would be the case if, for instance, the box contains a flywheel. If we look at the data and see that the wheel’s rotation has no dependence on the crank’s rotation at earlier times (after accounting for the crank’s current rotation), then we can conclude that the box probably does not contain any flywheels or other hysteretic components (or if it does, they’re small or decoupled from the wheel).</p><p>More generally, these sort of conditional independence relationships fall under the umbrella of <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SqFbMbtxGybdS2gRs/p/hzuSDMx7pd2uxFc5w\">probabilistic causal models</a></u>. By testing different causal models on externally-visible data, we can back out information about the internal cause-and-effect structure of the system. If we see that only the crank’s <em>current</em> rotation matters to the wheel, then that rules out internal components with memory.</p><p>Causal models are the largest class of statistical models I know of which yield information about internal gears. However, they’re not the only way to build gears-level models from behavior. If we have strong prior information, we can often use behavioral data to directly compare gears-level hypotheses.</p><h2>Application: Wolf’s Dice</h2><p>Around the mid-19th century, Swiss astronomer Rudolf Wolf rolled a pair of dice 20000 times, recording each outcome. The main result was that the dice were definitely not perfectly fair - there were small but statistically significant biases.</p><p>Now, we could easily look at Wolf’s data and use it to estimate the frequency with which each face of each die is rolled. But that’s not a gears-level model; it doesn’t say anything about the physical die.</p><p>In order to back out gears-level information from the data, we need to leverage our prior knowledge about dice and die-making. Jaynes did exactly this in <u><a href=\"https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/entropy.concentration.pdf\">a 1979 paper</a></u>; the key pieces of prior information are:</p><ul><li>We know dice are roughly cube-shaped, and any difference in face frequencies should stem from asymmetry of the physical die. We know 3 is opposite 4, 2 is opposite 5, and 1 is opposite 6.</li><li>We know dice have little pips showing the numbers on each face; different faces have different numbers of pips, which we’d expect to introduce a slight asymmetry.</li><li>Imagining how the dice might have been manufactured, Jaynes guesses that the final cut would have been more difficult to make perfectly even than the earlier cuts - leaving one axis slightly shorter/longer than the other two.</li></ul><p>Based on those asymmetries, we’d guess:</p><ul><li>One of the three face pairs (3, 4), (2, 5), (1, 6) has significantly different frequency from the others, corresponding to the last axis cut.</li><li>The faces with fewer pips (3, 2, and especially 1) have slightly lower frequency than those with more pips (4, 5, and especially 6), since more pips means slightly less mass near that face.</li><li>Other than that, the frequencies should be pretty even.</li></ul><p>This is basically a guess-and-check process: we guess what asymmetry might be present based on our prior knowledge, consider how that would change the behavior, then we use the data to check the model.</p><p>Jaynes tests out these models, and finds that (1) the white die’s 3-4 axis is slightly shorter than the other two, and (2) the pips indeed shift the center of mass slightly away from the center of the die. These two asymmetries together explain all of the bias seen in the data, so the die should be quite symmetric otherwise. I analyze the same problem in <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QKnbbGDd2LbAPfgBh/wolf-s-dice-ii-what-asymmetry\">this post</a></u> (using slightly different methods from Jaynes) and reproduce the same result.</p><p>Because this is a gears-level model, we could in principle check the result using a “side channel”: if we could track down the dice Wolf used, then we could take out our calipers and measure the lengths of the 3-4, 2-5, and 1-6 axes. Our prediction is that the 2-5 and 1-6 axes would be close, but the 3-4 axis would be significantly shorter. Note that we still don’t have a <em>full</em> gears-level model - we don’t predict <em>how much</em> shorter the 3-4 axis is. We don’t have a way to back out all the dimensions of the die. But we certainly expect the difference between the 3-4 length and the 2-5 length to be much larger than the difference between the 2-5 length and the 1-6 length. Our model yields <em>some</em> information about gears-level structure.</p><h2>Takeaway</h2><p>Statistics, machine learning, and adjacent fields tend to have a myopic focus on predicting future data.</p><p>Gears-level models cannot be fully learned by looking at externally-visible behavior data. That makes it hard to prove theorems about convergence of statistical methods, or write tests for machine learning algorithms, when the goal is to learn about a system’s internal gears. So, to a large extent, these fields have ignored gears-level learning and focused on predicting future data. Gears have snuck in only to the extent that they’re useful for predicting externally-visible behavior.</p><p>But sooner or later, any field dominated by a gears-less worldview will have its Lucas Critique.</p><p>It is possible to leverage probability to test gears-level models, and to back out at least some information about a system’s internal structure. It’s not easy. We need to restrict ourselves to certain classes of models (i.e. causal models) and/or leverage lots of prior knowledge (e.g. about dice). It looks less like black-box statistical/ML models, and more like science: think about what the physical system might look like, figure out how the data would differ between different possible physical systems, and then go test it. The main goal is not to predict future data, but to compare models.</p><p>That’s the kind of approach we need to build models which won’t fall apart every time central banks change their policies.</p>",

Although this was generally regarded as an impressive achievement, it quickly became clear that not everybody was satisfied with how the AI agent, called AlphaStar, interacted with the game, or how its creator, DeepMind, presented it. Many observers complained that, in spite of DeepMind’s claims that it performed at similar speeds to humans, AlphaStar was able to control the game with greater speed and accuracy than any human, and that this was the reason why it prevailed.</p>\n\n\n<p>Although I think this story is mostly correct, I think it is harder than it looks to compare AlphaStar’s interaction with the game to that of humans, and to determine to what extent this mattered for the outcome of the matches. Merely comparing raw numbers for actions taken per minute (the usual metric for a player’s speed) does not tell the whole story, and appropriately taking into account mouse accuracy, the differences between combat actions and non-combat actions, and the control of the game’s “camera” turns out to be quite difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, I begin with an overview of Starcraft II as a platform for AI research, a timeline of events leading up to AlphaStar’s success, and a brief description of how AlphaStar works. Next, I explain why measuring performance in Starcraft II is hard, show some analysis on the speed of both human and AI players, and offer some preliminary conclusions on how AlphaStar’s speed compares to humans. After this, I discuss the differences in how humans and AlphaStar “see” the game and the impact this has on performance. Finally, I give an update on DeepMind’s current experiments with Starcraft II and explain why I expect we will encounter similar difficulties when comparing human and AI performance in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2> Why Starcraft is a Target for AI Research </h2>\n\n\n\n<p> Starcraft II has been a target for AI for several years, and some readers will recall that Starcraft II appeared on our <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/2016-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/\">2016 expert survey</a>. But there are many games and many AIs that play them, so it may not be obvious why Starcraft II is a target for research or why it is of interest to those of us that are trying to understand what is happening with AI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, Starcraft II was chosen because it is popular, and it is difficult for AI. Starcraft II is a real time strategy game, and like similar games, it requires a variety of tasks: harvesting resources, constructing bases, researching technology, building armies, and attempting to destroy their opponent’s base are all part of the game. Playing it well requires balancing attention between many things at once: planning ahead, ensuring that one’s units<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-1980\">1</a> are good counters for the enemy’s units, predicting opponents’ moves, and changing plans in response to new information. There are other aspects that make it difficult for AI in particular: it has imperfect information<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-1980\">2</a>, an extremely large action space, and takes place in real time. When humans play, they engage in long term planning, making the best use of their limited capacity for attention, and crafting ploys to deceive the other players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game’s popularity is important because it makes it a good source of extremely high human talent and increases the number of people that will intuitively understand how difficult the task is for a computer. Additionally, as a game that is designed to be suitable for high-level competition, the game is carefully balanced so that competition is fair, does not favor just one strategy<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-1980\">3</a>, and does not rely too heavily on luck. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>  Timeline of Events </h2>\n\n\n\n<p> To put AlphaStar’s performance in context, it helps to understand the timeline of events over the past few years:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>November 2016:</strong> Blizzard and DeepMind <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-and-blizzard-release-starcraft-ii-ai-research-environment/\">announce</a> they are launching a new project in Starcraft II AI</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>August 2017:</strong> DeepMind <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-and-blizzard-open-starcraft-ii-ai-research-environment/\">releases</a> the Starcraft II API, a set of tools for interfacing AI with the game</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>March 2018:</strong> Oriol Vinyals gives an <a href=\"https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/starcraft2/21509421/checking-in-with-the-deepmind-starcraft-ii-team\">update</a>, saying they’re making progress, but he doesn’t know if their agent will be able to beat the best human players</p>\n\n<p><strong>November 3, 2018:</strong> Oriol Vinyals gives another update at a Blizzcon panel, and shares a sequence of videos demonstrating AlphaStar's progress in learning the game, including leaning to win against the hardest built-in AI. When asked if they could play against it that day, he says \"For us, it’s still a bit early in the research.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>December 12, 2018:</strong> AlphaStar wins five straight matches against TLO, a professional Starcraft II player, who was playing as Protoss<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-1980\">4</a>, which is off-race for him. DeepMind keeps the matches secret.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>December 19, 2018:</strong> AlphaStar, given an additional week of training time<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-1980\">5</a>, wins five consecutive Protoss vs Protoss matches vs MaNa, a pro Starcraft II player who is higher ranked than TLO and specializes in Protoss. DeepMind continues to keep the victories a secret.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>January 24, 2019:</strong> DeepMind <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/\">announces</a> the successful test matches vs TLO and MaNa in a live video feed. MaNa plays a live match against a version of AlphaStar which had more constraints on how it “saw” the map, forcing it to interact with the game in a way more similar to humans<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-1980\">6</a>. AlphaStar loses when MaNa finds a way to exploit a blatant failure of the AI to manage its units sensibly. The replays of all the matches are released, and people start arguing<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-1980\">7</a> about how (un)fair the matches were, whether AlphaStar is any good at making decisions, and how honest DeepMind was in presenting the results of the matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>July 10, 2019:</strong> DeepMind and Blizzard announce that they will allow an experimental version of AlphaStar to play on the European ladder<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-1980\">8</a>, for players who opt in. The agent will play anonymously, so that most players will not know that they are playing against a computer. Over the following weeks, players attempt to discern whether they played against the agent, and some post replays of matches in which they believe they were matched with the agent. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2> How AlphaStar works </h2>\n\n\n\n<p> The best place to learn about AlphaStar is from <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii\">DeepMind’s page</a> about it. There are a few particular aspects of the AI that are worth keeping in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It does not interact with the game like a human does:</strong> Humans interact with the game by looking at a screen, listening through headphones or speakers, and giving commands through a mouse and keyboard. AlphaStar is given a list of units or buildings and their attributes, which includes things like their location, how much damage they’ve taken, and which actions they’re able to take, and gives commands directly, using coordinates and unit identifiers. For most of the matches, it had access to information about anything that wouldn’t normally be hidden from a human player, without needing to control a “camera” that focuses on only one part of the map at a time. For the final match, it had a camera restriction similar to humans, though it still was not given screen pixels as input. Because it gives commands directly through the game, it does not need to use a mouse accurately or worry about tapping the wrong key by accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is trained first by watching human matches, and then through self-play:</strong> The neural network is trained first on a large database of matches between humans, and then by playing against versions of itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is a set of agents selected from a tournament:</strong> Hundreds of versions of the AI play against each other, and the ones that perform best are selected to play against human players. Each one has its own set of units that it is incentivized to use via reinforcement learning, so that they each play with different strategies. TLO and MaNa played against a total of 11 agents, all of which were selected from the same tournament, except the last one, which had been substantially modified. The agents that defeated MaNa had each played for hundreds of years in the virtual tournament<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-1980\">9</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2> January/February Impressions Survey </h2>\n\n<p> Before deciding to focus my investigation on a comparison between human and AI performance in Starcraft II, I conducted an informal survey with my Facebook friends, my colleagues at AI Impacts, and a few people from an effective altruism Facebook group. I wanted to know what they were thinking about the matches in general, with an emphasis on which factors most contributed to the outcome of the matches. I’ve put details about my analysis and the full results of the survey in the appendix at the end of this article, but I’ll summarize a few major results here. </p>\n\n<h4><strong>Forecasts</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing and nature of AlphaStar’s success seems to have been mostly in line with people’s expectations, at least at the time of the announcement. Some respondents did not expect to see it for a year or two, but on average, AlphaStar was less than a year earlier than expected. It is probable that some respondents had been expecting it to take longer, but updated their predictions in 2016 after finding out that DeepMind was working on it. For future expectations, a majority of respondents expect to see an agent (not necessarily AlphaStar) that can beat the best humans without any of the current caveats within two years. In general, I do not think that I worded the forecasting questions carefully enough to infer very much from the answers given by survey respondents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some readers may be wondering how these survey results compare to those of our more careful 2016 survey, or how we should view the earlier survey results in light of MaNa and TLOs defeat at the hands of AlphaStar. The 2016 survey specified an agent that only receives a video of the screen, so that prediction has not yet resolved. But the median respondent assigned 50% probability of seeing such an agent that can defeat the top human players at least 50% of the time by 2021<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-1980\">10</a>. I don’t personally know how hard it is to add in that capability, but my impression from speaking to people with greater machine learning expertise than mine is that this is not out of reach, so these predictions still seem reasonable, and are not generally in disagreement with the results from my informal survey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Speed</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly everyone thought that AlphaStar was able to give commands faster and more accurately than humans, and that this advantage was an important factor in the outcome of the matches. I looked into this in more detail, and wrote about it in the next section.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Camera</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned in the description of AlphaStar, it does not see the game the same way that humans do. Its visual field covered the entire map, though its vision was still affected by the usual fog of war<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-1980\">11</a>. Survey respondents ranked this as an important factor in the outcome of the matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given these results, I decided to look into the speed and camera issues in more detail. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2> The Speed Controversy </h2>\n\n\n\n<p> Starcraft is a game that rewards the ability to micromanage many things at once and give many commands in a short period of time. Players must simultaneously build their bases, manage resource collection, scout the map, research better technology, build individual units to create an army, and fight battles against other players. The combat is sufficiently fine grained that a player who is outnumbered or outgunned can often come out ahead by exerting better control over the units that make up their military forces, both on a group level and an individual level. For years, there have been simple Starcraft II bots that, although they cannot win a match against a highly-skilled human player, can do <a href=\"https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/497826-micro-ai-bot\">amazing things</a> that humans can’t do, by controlling dozens of units individually during combat. In practice, human players are limited by how many actions they can take in a given amount of time, usually measured in actions per minute (APM).  Although DeepMind imposed restrictions on how quickly AlphaStar could react to the game and how many actions it could take in a given amount of time, many people believe that the agent was sometimes able to act with superhuman speed and precision.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Here is a graph<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-1980\">12</a> of the APM for MaNa (red) and AlphaStar (blue), through the second match, with five-second bins: </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/e4pWzbCIUWfkO1P1amIBZkI69C5EOGEOle0BN0olaycqhKrlBYXEbg8uQM6CsYN3u96dI6w3r4mp0lTfbpZmR1prBsC_4JHlwQjxPtYOx2rE5K17WTBU9wKmEB16aZzMLMNa6Zo0\" /> Actions per minute for MaNa (red) and AlphaStar (blue) in their second game. The horizontal axis is time, and the vertical axis is 5 second average APM. \n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, this looks reasonably even. AlphaStar has both a lower average APM (180 vs MaNa’s 270) for the whole match, and a lower peak 5 second APM (495 vs Mana’s 615). This seems consistent with DeepMind’s claim that AlphaStar was restricted to human-level speed. But a more detailed look at which actions are actually taken during these peaks reveals some crucial differences. Here’s a sample of actions taken by each player during their peaks:</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VEYbo7vFZ5ZrLYVRGul4Q5D_O6M2ufoibP7NFVfqcbsRUh_s918pETzY2fKYIj8U6etfdLs0L-z7nZkKz4VvXNMZ4scsVD_37hlV30Rm5XblwsbZfLryh06elJEMBv8LPThTUeh6\" />Lists of commands for MaNa and AlphaStar during each player’s peak APM for game 2\n\n\n\n<p> MaNa hit his APM peaks early in the game by using hot keys to twitchily switch back and forth between control groups<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-1980\">13</a> for his workers and the main building in his base. I don’t know why he’s doing this: maybe to warm up his fingers (which apparently is a thing), as a way to watch two things at once, to keep himself occupied during the slow parts of the early game, or some other reason understood only by the kinds of people that can produce Starcraft commands faster than I can type. But it drives up his peak APM, and probably is not very important to how the game unfolds<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-1980\">14</a>. Here’s what MaNa’s peak APM looked like at the beginning of Game 2 (if you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see that the units he has selected switches back-and-forth between his workers and the building that he uses to make more workers): </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GOAeZ_aPwFe18bvrlQF58fGlIFFq35q9xlghIuEE2at00a0Pbx7bY2o-L7gQJ6a4z2jC2RFu2sTagzMTJLEinugDENFALNDHo3LO09J1Tz-XWb8Z83uGFL1U6KLJ-q7lVE6bvo1C\" />MaNa’s play during his peak APM for match 2. Most of his actions consist of switching between control groups without giving new commands to any units or buildings\n\n\n\n<p> AlphaStar hit peak APM in combat. The agent seems to reserve a substantial portion of its limited actions budget until the critical moment when it can cash them in to eliminate enemy forces and gain an advantage. Here’s what that looked like near the end of game 2, when it won the engagement that probably won it the match (while still taking a few actions back at its base to keep its production going): </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1MbLA3GbDuFucJIMxXKFzPLQAt2oeK-kA1-Vp4EpNDe868tcTG3qhsWNvTD57xSX1ggppKKDTCnw5r6D3FvAI1wVYGrcNEhcSIv7kHKOYkyqRNHHex7SyyY-uVwvD2YcfRPIFasd\" />AlphaStar’s play during its peak APM in match 2. Most of its actions are related to combat, and require precise timing.\n\n\n\n<p> It may be hard to see what exactly is happening here for people who have not played the game. AlphaStar (blue) is using extremely fine-grained control of its units to defeat MaNa’s army (red) in an efficient way. This involves several different actions: Commanding units to move to different locations so they can make their way into his base while keeping them bunched up and avoiding spots that make them vulnerable, focusing fire on MaNa’s units to eliminate the most vulnerable ones first, using special abilities to lift MaNa’s units off the ground and disable them, and redirecting units to attack MaNa’s workers once a majority of MaNa’s military units are taken care of. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Given these differences between how MaNa and AlphaStar play, it seems clear that we can’t just use raw match-wide APM to compare the two, which most people paying attention seem to have noticed fairly quickly after the matches. The more difficult question is whether AlphaStar won primarily by playing with a level of speed and accuracy that humans are incapable of, or by playing better in other ways. Though based on the analysis that I am about to present I think the answer is probably that AlphaStar won through speed, I also think the question is harder to answer definitively than many critics of DeepMind are making it out to be.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p> A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRsDAX8DfBw&amp;t=611\">very fast human</a> can average well over 300 APM for several minutes, with 5 second bursts at over 600 APM. Although these bursts are not always throwaway commands like those from the MaNa vs AlphaStar matches, they tend not to be commands that require highly accurate clicking, or rapid movement across the map. Take, for example, this 10 second, 600 APM peak from current top player Serral: </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KJEH8juVslGQ3ytg7rTnqcKceUNmXpD6NHTsy8HpdOiQnsYC93QKrNVtBCwNIiVl4GH9n-hM1i57U2FS8tVR239lYX_nTAebA5CnTKSFaa3scexbeScOcZv-lQvdmvIwnzY91vyg\" />Serral’s play during a 10 second, 600 APM peak\n\n\n\n<p> Here, Serral has just finished focusing on a pair of battles with the other player, and is taking care of business in his base, while still picking up some pieces on the battlefield. It might not be obvious why he is issuing so many commands during this time, so let’s look at the list of commands: </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hJMQ92gS4XI8NaK2m4Um9DgVz40vjP1wCAkuOXDnPMM4SaJRnU8CoJPz8y_nSYpi69Eq4ka-Ey5PcrzOdG1AfDQ23wGjPoCthPT5GUmvR9ubCajurngohwB25tNIuqa1BhsiEvYJ\" />\n\n\n\n<p> The lines that say “Morph to Hydralisk” and “Morph to Roach” represent a series of repeats of that command. For a human player, this is a matter of pressing the same hotkey many times, or even just holding down the key to give the command very rapidly<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-1980\">15</a>. You can see this in the gif by looking at the bottom center of the screen where he selects a bunch of worm-looking things and turns them all into a bunch of egg-looking things (it happens very quickly, so it can be easy to miss).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Serral is doing here is difficult, and the ability to do it only comes with years of practice. But the raw numbers don’t tell the whole story. Taking 100 actions in 10 seconds is much easier when a third of those actions come from holding down a key for a few hundred milliseconds than when they each require a press of a different key or a precise mouse click. And this is without all the extraneous actions that humans often take (as we saw with MaNa).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it seems to be the case that peak human APM happens outside of combat, while AlphaStar’s wins happened during combat APM peaks, we need to do a more detailed analysis to determine the highest APM a human player can achieve during combat. To try to answer this question, I looked at approximately ten APM for each of the 5 games between AlphaStar and MaNa, as well as each of another 15 replays between professional Starcraft II players. The peaks were chosen so that roughly half were the largest peak at any time during the match and the rest were strictly during combat. My methodology for this is given in the appendix. Here are the results for just the human vs human matches:</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ympsf_Lx9K_-r2l8p0WexCW3-K6NScmtFS2nfi1YQIvez-YU1ALisfSQitH3W2fa3ceSkyHkj9vRpY3qOCHUYL4kimKP6f4GoUFagOXmWA3zcpM0mtUMxboCb8dIWD4O2WDGUAmQ\" />Histogram of 5-second APM peaks from analyzed matches between human professional players in a tournament setting The blue bars are peaks achieved outside of combat, while the red bars are those achieved during combat.\n\n\n\n<p> Provisionally, it looks like pro players frequently hit approximately 550 to 600 APM outside of combat before the distribution starts to fall off, and they peak at around 200-350 during combat, with a long right tail. As I was doing this, however, I found that all of the highest APM peaks had one thing in common with each other that they did not have in common with all of the lower APM peaks, which is that it was difficult to tell when a player’s actions are primarily combat-oriented commands, and when they are mixed in with bursts of commands for things like training units. In particular, I found that the combat situations with high APM tended to be similar to the Serral gif above, in that they involve spam clicking and actions related to the player’s economy and production, which was probably driving up the numbers. I give more details in the appendix, but I don’t think I can say with confidence that any players were achieving greater than 400-450 APM in combat, in the absence of spurious actions or macromanagement commands.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p> The more pertinent question might what the lowest APM is that a player can have while still succeeding at the highest level. Since we know that humans can succeed without exceeding this APM, it is not an unreasonable limitation to put on AlphaStar. The lowest peak APM in combat I saw for a winning player in my analysis was 215, though it could be that I missed a higher peak during combat in that same match. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Here is a histogram of AlphaStar’s combat APM: </p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eruKmMtfvsOQUk418Y67GHgHT-xCvKpkPvdiFVgDngQRUrbOQvtJ04myia-ygnFHIGrnw_b7gwxvJdfVG6bsmv_P9OKhKAXVSeyUu9tXhEODPjNAujKdzqwCs-6w0wT47conlmgD\" />\n\n\n\n<p> The smallest 5-second APM that AlphaStar needed to win a match against MaNa was just shy of 500. I found 14 cases in which the agent was able to average over 400 APM for 5 seconds in combat, and six times when the agent averaged over 500 APM for more than 5 seconds. This was done with perfect accuracy and no spam clicking or control group switching, so I think we can safely say that its play was faster than is required for a human to win a match in a professional tournament. Given that I found no cases where a human was clearly achieving this speed in combat, I think I can comfortably say that AlphaStar had a large enough speed advantage over MaNa to have substantially influenced the match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy to get lost in numbers, so it’s good to take a step back and remind ourselves of the insane level of skill required to play Starcraft II professionally. The top professional players already play with what looks to me like superhuman speed, precision, and multitasking, so it is not surprising that the agent that can beat them is so fast. Some observers, especially those in the Starcraft community, have indicated that they will not be impressed until AI can beat humans at Starcraft II at sub-human APM. There is some extent to which speed can make up for poor strategy and good strategy can make up for a lack of speed, but it is not clear what the limits are on this trade-off. It may be very difficult to make an agent that can beat professional Starcraft II players while restricting its speed to an undisputedly human or sub-human level, or it may simply be a matter of a couple more weeks of training time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2> The Camera</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> As I explained earlier, the agent interacts with the game differently than humans. As with other games, humans look at a screen to know what’s happening, use a mouse and keyboard to give commands, and need to move the game’s ‘camera’ to see different parts of the play area. With the exception of the final exhibition match against MaNa, AlphaStar was able to see the entire map at once (though much of it is concealed by the fog of war most of the time), and had no need to select units to get information about them. It’s unclear just how much of an advantage this was for the agent, but it seems likely that it was significant, if nothing else because it did not suffer from the APM overhead just to look around and get information from the game. Furthermore, seeing the entire map makes it easier to simultaneously control units across the map, which AlphaStar used to great effect in the first five matches against MaNa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the exhibition match in January, DeepMind trained a version of AlphaStar that had similar camera control to human players. Although the agent still saw the game in a way that was abstracted from the screen pixels that humans see, it only had access to about one screen’s worth of information at a time, and it needed to spend actions to look at different parts of the map. A further disadvantage was that this version of the agent only had half as much training time as the agents that beat MaNa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three factors that may have contributed to AlphaStar’s loss:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The agent was unable to deal effectively with the added complication of controlling the camera</li><li>The agent had insufficient training time</li><li>The agent had easily exploitable flaws the whole time, and MaNa figured out how to use them in match 6</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For the third factor, I mean that the agent had sufficiently many exploitable flaws that were obvious enough to human players that any skilled human player could find at least one during a small number of games. The best humans do not have a sufficient number of such flaws to influence the game with any regularity. Matches in professional tournaments are not won by causing the other player to make the same obvious-to-humans mistake over and over again.<br />I suspect that AlphaStar’s loss in January is mainly due to the first two factors. In support of 1, AlphaStar seemed less able to simultaneously deal with things happening on opposite sides of the map, and less willing to split its forces, which could plausibly be related to an inability to simultaneously look at distant parts of the map. It’s not just that the agent had to move the camera to give commands on other parts of the map. The agent had to remember what was going on globally, rather than being able to see it all the time. In support of 2, the agent that MaNa defeated had only as much training time as the agents that went up against TLO, and those agents lost to the agents that defeated MaNa 94% of the time during training<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-16-1980\">16</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it is hard to dismiss the third factor. One way in which an agent can improve through training is to encounter tactics that it has not seen before, so that it can react well if it sees it in the future. But the tactics that it encounters are only those that another agent employed, and without seeing the agents during training, it is hard to know if any of them learned the harassment tactics that MaNa used in game 6, so it is hard to know if the agents that defeated MaNa were susceptible to the exploit that he used to defeat the last agent. So far, the evidence from DeepMind’s more recent experiment pitting AlphaStar against the broader Starcraft community (which I will go into in the next section) suggests that the agents do not tend to learn defenses to these types of exploits, though it is hard to say if this is a general problem or just one associated with low training time or particular kinds of training data. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2> AlphaStar on the Ladder </h2>\n\n\n\n<p> For the past couple months, as of this writing, skilled European players have had the opportunity to play against AlphaStar as part of the usual system for matching players with those of similar skill. For the version of AlphaStar that plays on the European ladder, DeepMind claims to have made changes that address the camera and action speed complaints from the January matches. The agent needs to control the camera, and <a href=\"https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/starcraft2/22933138/deepmind-research-on-ladder\">they say</a> they have placed restrictions on AlphaStar’s performance in consultation with pro players, particularly the maximum actions per minute and per second that the agent can make. I will be curious to see what numbers they arrive at for this. If this was done in an iterative way, such that pro players were allowed to see the agent play or to play against it, I expect they were able to arrive at a good constraint. Given the difficulty that I had with arriving at a good value for a combat APM restriction, I’m less confident that they would get a good value just by thinking about it, though if they were sufficiently conservative, they probably did alright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason to expect a realistic APM constraint is that DeepMind wanted to run the European ladder matches as a blind study, in which the human players did not know they were playing against an AI. If the agent were to play with the superhuman speed and accuracy that AlphaStar did in January, it would likely give it away and spoil the experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it is unclear that any players were able to tell they were playing against an AI during their match, it does seem that some were able to figure it out after the fact. One example comes from Lowko, who is a Dutch player who streams and does commentary for games. During a stream of a ladder match in Starcraft II, he noticed the player was doing some strange things near the end of the match, like lifting their buildings<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-17-1980\">17</a> when the match had clearly been lost, and air-dropping workers into Lowko’s base to kill units. Lowko did eventually win the match. Afterward, he was able to view the replay from the match and see that the player he had defeated did some very strange things throughout the entire match, the most notable of which was how the player controlled their units. The player used no control groups at all, which is, as far as I know, not something anybody does at high-level play<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-18-1980\">18</a>. There were many other quirks, which he describes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HqwCrDBdTE\">in his entertaining video</a>, which I highly recommend to anyone who is interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other players have released replay files from matches against players they believed were AlphaStar, and they show the same lack of control groups. This is great, because it means we can get a sense of what the new APM restriction is on AlphaStar. There are now dozens of replay files from players who claim to have played against the AI. Although I have not done the level of analysis that I did with the matches in the APM section, it seems clear that they have drastically lowered the APM cap, with the matches I have looked at topping out at 380 APM peaks, which did not even occur in combat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems to be the case that DeepMind has brought the agent’s interaction with the game more in line with human capability, but we will probably need to wait until they release the details of the experiment before we can say for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another notable aspect of the matches that people are sharing is that their opponent will do strange things that human players, especially skilled human players almost never do, most of which are detrimental to their success. For example, they will construct buildings that block them into their own base, crowd their units into a dangerous bottleneck to get to a cleverly-placed enemy unit, and fail to change tactics when their current strategy is not working. These are all the types of flaws that are well-known to exist in game-playing AI going back to much older games, including the original Starcraft, and they are similar to the flaw that MaNa exploited to defeat AlphaStar in game 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, the agents that humans are uncovering seem to be capable, but not superhuman. Early on, the accounts that were identified as likely candidates for being AlphaStar were winning about 90-95% of their matches on the ladder, achieving Grandmaster rank, which is reserved for only the top 200 players in each region. I have not been able to conduct a careful investigation to determine the win rate or Elo rating for the agents. However, based on the videos and replays that have been released, plausible claims from reddit users, and my own recollection of the records for the players that seemed likely to be AlphaStar<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-19-1980\">19</a>, a good estimate is that they were winning a majority of matches among Grandmaster players, but did not achieve an Elo rating that would suggest a favorable outcome in a rematch vs TLO<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/the-unexpected-difficulty-of-comparing-alphastar-to-humans/#easy-footnote-bottom-20-1980\">20</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with AlphaStar’s January loss, it is hard to say if this is the result of insufficient training time, additional restrictions on camera control and APM, or if the flaws are a deeper, harder to solve problem for AI. It may seem unreasonable to chalk this up to insufficient training time given that it has been several months since the matches in December and January, but it helps to keep in mind that we do not yet know what DeepMind’s research goals are. It is not hard to imagine that their goals are based around sample efficiency or some other aspect of AI research that requires such restrictions. As with the APM restrictions, we should learn more when we get results published by DeepMind. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2> Discussion </h2>\n\n\n\n<p> I have been focusing on what many onlookers have been calling a lack of “fairness” of the matches, which seems to come from a sentiment that the AI did not defeat the best humans on human terms. I think this is a reasonable concern; if we’re trying to understand how AI is progressing, one of our main interests is when it will catch up with us, so we want to compare its performance to ours. Since we already know that computers can do the things they’re able to do faster than we can do them, we should be less interested in artificial intelligence that can do things better than we can by being faster or by keeping track of more things at once. We are more interested in AI that can make better decisions than we can. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going into this project, I thought that the disagreements surrounding the fairness of the matches were due to a lack of careful analysis, and I expected it to be very easy to evaluate AlphaStar’s performance in comparison to human-level performance. After all, the replay files are just lists of commands, and when we run them through the game engine, we can easily see the outcome of those commands. But it turned out to be harder than I had expected. Separating careful, necessary combat actions (like targeting a particular enemy unit) from important but less precise actions (like training new units) from extraneous, unnecessary actions (like spam clicks) turned out to be surprisingly difficult. I expect if I were to spend a few months learning a lot more about how the game is played and writing my own software tools to analyze replay files, I could get closer to a definitive answer, but I still expect there would be some uncertainty surrounding what actually constitutes human performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is unclear to me where this leaves us. AlphaStar is an impressive achievement, even with the speed and camera advantages. I am excited to see the results of DeepMind’s latest experiment on the ladder, and I expect they will have satisfied most critics, at least in terms of the agent’s speed. But I do not expect it to become any easier to compare humans to AI in the future. If this sort of analysis is hard in the context of a game where we have access to all the inputs and outputs, we should expect it to be even harder once we’re looking at tasks for which success is less clear cut or for which the AI’s output is harder to objectively compare to humans. This includes some of the major targets for AI research in the near future. Driving a car does not have a simple win-loss condition, and novel writing does not have clear metrics for what good performance looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer may be that, if we want to learn things from future successes or failures of AI,  we need to worry less about making direct comparisons between human performance and AI performance, and keep watching the broad strokes of what’s going on. From AlphaStar, we’ve learned that one of two things is true: Either AI can do long-term planning, solve basic game theory problems, balance different priorities against each other, and develop tactics that work, or that there are tasks which seem at first to require all of these things but did not, at least not at a high level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Gillian Ring for lending her expertise in e-sports and for helping me understanding some of the nuances of the game.

Two respondents failed to correctly answer the question designed to filter out people that are goofing off or not paying attention, leaving 20 useful responses. Five people who filled out the survey were affiliated in some way with AI Impacts. Here are the responses for respondents’ self-reported level of expertise in Starcraft II and artificial intelligence:</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/K1NUiM44FLWAC0syTK1rtzTetjYgpDcY0aeLIb5Epd5JtNq4eXcmmNxGYeEcC8Ah5ObPT_yxhfGFhoqNBOA7rIlOEue2_78vphmhAy3lMt9EZjjt1kiomMshjZwy4ePasAuqhGDd\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2mzsWsfZAht9RiI_DURhNJmI9YvfUFjiugFTxE9wLBw_8D2NQqOgc5Q_FDvNdPHY_LXVIzaTcL2_zPRxE2Lpyx5HR7HzPVHOer1r315zQPgT9Szgu_CYDFfDO8aHMO1Nk0_FdeSj\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Survey respondents’ mean expertise rating was 4.6/10 for Starcraft II and 4.9/10 for AI. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Questions About AlphaStar’s Performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How fair were the AlphaStar matches?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For this one, it seems easiest to show a screenshot from the survey:</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RhkTV-s_JtFO3LeA0kSn1eaWCb2IkoNbdqyGLCSC0p6q7cw-xH2mlb4wv1S59dqXorUWCo6QMFivS24OUaaGMHDinLHBAkNWPHA0g1GIp2B70WDsLDXao9ZtN1ONyiOmmDX5k0A-\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The results from this indicated that people thought the match was unfair and favored AlphaStar:</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WXyaIY_rY1dJRYkZ3mfcIEkX_zgRNSY6wD-ggj5QGFsuhV1HUyWYWdu3cUUByyrRCuhd1BVjtkW9jv58XrvR-eMukcnbDh2vMjOoVatllzQ7bP9oOKTdbyaCB2kEaOGdnoSTUQ2p\" />\n\n\n\n<p>I asked respondents to rate AlphaStar’s overall performance, as well as its “micro” and “macro”. The term “micro” is used to refer to a player’s ability to control units in combat, and is greatly improved by speed. There seems to have been some misunderstanding about how to use the word “macro”. Based on comments from respondents and looking around to see how people use the term on the Internet, it seems that that there are at least three somewhat distinct ways that people use the phrase, and I did not clarify which I meant, so I’ve discarded the results from that question. <br /><br />For the next two questions, the scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 labeled “AlphaStar is much worse” and 10 labeled “AlphaStar is much better”<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Overall, how do you think AlphaStar’s performance compares to the best humans?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o1I6vgw3I5R2hC6EvfdnrDwZF-FM3x5EVOFg8rWatJ_1jzakCfdw5vgEQHl5SCg5gT6t3cWhQJ9uLSf4mfGKAPKIVCwYvVej4EJCrEP8nhYxNp_XNtcbBPIUFm-5B2v3BiNc-ein\" />\n\n\n\n<p>I found these results interesting, because AlphaStar was able to consistently defeat professional players, so some survey respondents felt the outcome alone was not enough to rate it as at least as good as the best humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you think AlphaStar’s micro compares to the best humans? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6BbwzLUBQ4f7OrXohCQTVk17gqaGiatfLdlCBlzvJAk3yPzPtztnf1M0B_PwTHEYGyDwB8f2xYGWSZEUYZev8Us1u3otky9QBKo2uvc0NoVc-0ns-frxKyvFUIvlpdzGvYTUnS-2\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Survey respondents unanimously reported that they thought AlphaStar’s combat micromanagement was an important factor in the outcome of the matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Forecasting Questions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Respondents were split on whether they expected to see AlphaStar’s level of Starcraft II performance by this time:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Did you expect to see AlphaStar’s level of performance in a Starcraft II agent:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td>Before Now</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Around this time</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Later than now</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>I had no expectation either way</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p>Respondents who indicated that they expected it sooner or later than now were also asked by how many years their expectation differed from reality. If we assign negative numbers to “before now”, positive numbers to “Later than now”, zero to “Around this time”, ignore those with no expectation, and weight responses by level of expertise, we find respondents’ mean expectation was just 9 months later the announcement, and the median respondent expected to see it around this time. Here is a histogram of these results, without expertise weighting:</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RrNbhiZ9d1Y_rTwrMhY0Qmos4kgi5yhmTW_Eqz77ObWmR2hm93gdYMo4PPvfT9-f7ejoP1r6yByJyz0H839TJ6wiMubcHyYHzmZADbewl6osjvPA1oX-bm8FsnEwc1TufyTtc58b\" />\n\n\n\n<p>These results do not generally indicate too much surprise about seeing a Starcraft II agent of AlphaStar’s ability now. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How many years do you think it will be until we see (in public) an agent which only gets screen pixels as input, has human-level apm and reaction speed, and is very clearly better than the best humans?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This question was intended to outline an AI that would satisfy almost anybody that Starcraft II is a solved game, such that AI is clearly better than humans, and not for “boring” reasons like superior speed. Most survey respondents expected to see such an agent in two-ish years, with a few a little longer, and two that expected it to take much longer. Respondents had a median prediction of two years and an expertise-weighted mean prediction of a little less than four years.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vBTP1c3RCLPv3bvcbp6xGh7NWMIsfnBM48zA4thNm2-s4zgV6DZlN73u9_CKMde5x8IqY4B5zeVhiMukF2EsgMNtITpYfEuuxIE_VhNV6xHbwKIf7H0UR7IV04bayuA1RJMMc-i\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>Questions About Relevant Considerations</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How important do you think the following were in determining the outcome of the AlphaStar vs MaNa matches?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I listed 12 possible considerations to be rated in importance, from 1 to 5, with 1 being “not at all important” and 5 being “extremely important”. The expertise weighted mean for each question is given below:<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aSjosf5Op-ZOdnBPH5Q1ve91wXzVN2ubxidCTMq6BduESpXpjndzIwq96HShRxAqbMHooOw6qORRiBo3MK-TgXOaR3LmsvwJOhgNIx8lEV-rp_JtFlGd2PD7FLOM-HErecI6znrg\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Respondents rated AlphaStar’s peak APM and camera control as the two most important factors in determining the outcome of the matches, and the particular choice of map and professional player as the two least important considerations. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>When thinking about AlphaStar as a benchmark for AI progress in general, how important do you think the following considerations are?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, respondents rated a series of considerations by importance, this time for thinking about AlphaStar in a broader context. This included all of the considerations from the previous question, plus several others. Here are the results, again with expertise weighted averaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CpBgaC0jrzw-8t1lJOUL1qgr-QUV9_RPqvLaZA3oJT1SbN-oLE_Z47D1dEwCiodzizMutJxc1x06NIkhX3jgeVDljkzbBKYVG7L1iJL0oo8qwDu8jWI224YJCNTtjf8mc6GMP1tV\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For these two sets of questions, there was almost no difference between the mean scores if I used only Starcraft II expertise weighting, only AI expertise weighting, or ignored expertise weighting entirely.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Further questions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the questions were free-form to give respondents a chance to tell me anything else that they thought was important. Although these answers were thoughtful and shaped my thinking about AlphaStar, especially early on in the project, I won’t summarize them here.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Appendix II: APM Measurement Methodology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I created a list of professional players by asking users of the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/\">Starcraft subreddit</a> which players they thought were exceptionally fast. Replays including these players were found by searching <a href=\"https://lotv.spawningtool.com/replays/?pro_only=on\">Spawning Tool</a> for replays from tournament matches which included at least one player from the list of fast players. This resulted in 51 replay files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several of the replay files were too old, so that they could no longer be opened by the current version of Starcraft II, and I ignored them. Others were ignored because they included players, race matchups, or maps that were already represented in other matches. Some were ignored because we did not get to them before we had collected what seemed to be enough data. This left 15 replays that made it into the analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I opened each file using <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/\">Scelight</a>, and the time and APM values were recorded for the top three peaks on the graph of that player’s APM, using 5-second bins. Next, I opened the replay file in Starcraft II, and for each peak recorded earlier, we wrote down whether that player was primarily engaging in combat at the time or not. Additionally, I recorded the time and APM for each player for 2-4 5-second durations of the game in which the players were primarily engaged in combat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the APM values which came from combat and from outside of combat were aggregated into the histogram shown in the ‘Speed Controversy’ section of this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several potential sources of bias or error in this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Our method for choosing players and matches may be biased. We were seeking examples of humans playing with speed and precision, but it’s possible that by relying on input from a relatively small number of Reddit users (as well as some personal friends), we missed something.</li><li>This measurement relies entirely on my subjective evaluation of whether the players are mostly engaged in combat. I am not an expert on the game, and it seems likely that I missed some things, at least some of the time.</li><li>The tool I used for this seems to mismatch events in the game by a few seconds. Since I was using 5-second bins, and sometimes a player’s APM will change greatly between 5-second bins, it’s possible that this introduced a significant error.</li><li>The choice of 5 second bins (as opposed to something shorter or longer) is somewhat arbitrary, but it is what some people in the Starcraft community were using, so I’m using it here.</li><li>Some actions are excluded from the analysis automatically. These include camera updates, and this is probably a good thing, but I did not look carefully at the source code for the tool, so it may be doing something I don’t know about.</li></ol>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Epistemic status: fake framework</em></p>\n<p>To do effective differential technological development for AI safety, we'd like to know which combinations of AI insights are more likely to lead to FAI vs UFAI.  This is an overarching strategic consideration which feeds into questions like how to think about the value of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/y5fYPAyKjWePCsq3Y/project-proposal-considerations-for-trading-off-capabilities\">AI capabilities research</a>.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, there are actually several different stories for how we may end up with a set of AI insights which makes UFAI more likely than FAI, and these stories aren't entirely compatible with one another.</p>\n<p>Note: In this document, when I say \"FAI\", I mean any superintelligent system which does a good job of helping humans (so an \"aligned Task AGI\" also counts).</p>\n<h1>Story #1: The Roadblock Story</h1>\n<p>Nate Soares describes the roadblock story in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SEL9PW8jozrvLnkb4/my-current-thoughts-on-miri-s-highly-reliable-agent-design#Z6TbXivpjxWyc8NYM\">this comment</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...if a safety-conscious AGI team asked how we’d expect their project to fail, the two likeliest scenarios we’d point to are \"your team runs into a capabilities roadblock and can't achieve AGI\" or \"your team runs into an alignment <em>roadblock</em> and <em>can easily tell that the system is currently misaligned, but can’t figure out how to achieve alignment in any reasonable amount of time</em>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis mine)</p>\n<p>The roadblock story happens if there are key safety insights that FAI needs but AGI doesn't need.  In this story, the knowledge needed for FAI is a superset of the knowledge needed for AGI.  If the safety insights are difficult to obtain, or no one is working to obtain them, we could find ourselves in a situation where we have all the AGI insights without having all the FAI insights.</p>\n<p>There is subtlety here.  In order to make a strong argument for the existence of insights like this, it's not enough to point to failures of existing systems, or describe hypothetical failures of future systems.  You also need to explain why the insights necessary to create AGI wouldn't be sufficient to fix the problems.</p>\n<p>Some possible ways the roadblock story could come about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Maybe safety insights are more or less agnostic to the chosen AGI technology and can be discovered in parallel.  (Stuart Russell has pushed against this, saying that in the same way making sure bridges don't fall down is part of civil engineering, safety should be part of mainstream AI research.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maybe safety insights require AGI insights as a prerequisite, leaving us in a precarious position where we will have acquired the capability to build an AGI <em>before</em> we begin critical FAI research.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This could be the case if the needed safety insights are mostly about how to safely assemble AGI insights into an FAI.  It's possible we could do a bit of this work in advance by developing \"contingency plans\" for how we would construct FAI in the event of combinations of capabilities advances that seem plausible.\n<ul>\n<li>Paul Christiano's IDA framework could be considered a contingency plan for the case where we develop much more powerful imitation learning.</li>\n<li>Contingency plans could also be helpful for directing differential technological development, since we'd get a sense of the difficulty of FAI under various tech development scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maybe there will be multiple subsets of the insights needed for FAI which are sufficient for AGI.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In this case, we'd like to speed the discovery of whichever FAI insight will be discovered last.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Story #2: The Security Story</h1>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cpdsMuAHSWhWnKdog/security-mindset-and-the-logistic-success-curve\">Security Mindset and the Logistic Success Curve</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CORAL:  You know, back in mainstream computer security, when you propose a new way of securing a system, it's considered traditional and wise for everyone to gather around and try to come up with reasons why your idea might not work. It's understood that no matter how smart you are, most seemingly bright ideas turn out to be flawed, and that you shouldn't be touchy about people trying to shoot them down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The main difference between the security story and the roadblock story is that in the security story, it's not obvious that the system is misaligned.</p>\n<p>We can subdivide the security story based on the ease of fixing a flaw if we're able to detect it in advance.  For example, vulnerability #1 on the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/owasp-top-10/\">OWASP Top 10</a> is injection, which is typically easy to patch once it's discovered.  Insecure systems are often right next to secure systems in program space.</p>\n<p>If the security story is what we are worried about, it could be wise to try &amp; develop the AI equivalent of OWASP's <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/\">Cheat Sheet Series</a>, to make it easier for people to find security problems with AI systems.  Of course, many items on the cheat sheet would be speculative, since AGI doesn't actually exist yet.  But it could still serve as a useful starting point for brainstorming flaws.</p>\n<p>Differential technological development could be useful in the security story if we push for the development of AI tech that is easier to secure.  However, it's not clear how confident we can be in our intuitions about what will or won't be easy to secure.  In his book <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em>, Daniel Kahneman describes his adversarial collaboration with expertise researcher Gary Klein.  Kahneman was an expertise skeptic, and Klein an expertise booster:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We eventually concluded that our disagreement was due in part to the fact that we had different experts in mind. Klein had spent much time with fireground commanders, clinical nurses, and other professionals who have real expertise. I had spent more time thinking about clinicians, stock pickers, and political scientists trying to make unsupportable long-term forecasts. Not surprisingly, his default attitude was trust and respect; mine was skepticism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When do judgments reflect true expertise? ... The answer comes from the two basic conditions for acquiring a skill:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable</li>\n<li>an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a less regular, or low-validity, environment, the heuristics of judgment are invoked. System 1 is often able to produce quick answers to difficult\nquestions by substitution, creating coherence where there is none. The question that is answered is not the one that was intended, but the answer is produced quickly and may be sufficiently plausible to pass the lax and lenient review of System 2. You may want to forecast the commercial future of a company, for example, and believe that this is what you are judging, while in fact your evaluation is dominated by your impressions of the energy and competence of its current executives. Because substitution occurs automatically, you often do not know the origin of a judgment that you (your System 2) endorse and adopt. If it is the only one that comes to mind, it may be subjectively undistinguishable from valid judgments that you make with expert confidence. This is why subjective confidence is not a good diagnostic of accuracy: judgments that answer the wrong question can also be made with high confidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our intuitions are only as good as the data we've seen.  \"Gathering data\" for an AI security cheat sheet could helpful for developing security intuition.  But I think we should be skeptical of intuition anyway, given the speculative nature of the topic.</p>\n<h1>Story #3: The Alchemy Story</h1>\n<p>Ali Rahimi and Ben Recht <a href=\"http://www.argmin.net/2017/12/05/kitchen-sinks/\">describe</a> the alchemy story in their Test-of-time award presentation at the NeurIPS machine learning conference in 2017 (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi1Yry33TQE\">video</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Batch Norm is a technique that speeds up gradient descent on deep nets. You sprinkle it between your layers and gradient descent goes faster. I think it’s ok to use techniques we don’t understand. I only vaguely understand how an airplane works, and I was fine taking one to this conference. But <em>it’s always better if we build systems on top of things we do understand deeply</em>? This is what we know about why batch norm works well. But don’t you want to understand why reducing internal covariate shift speeds up gradient descent? Don’t you want to see evidence that Batch Norm reduces internal covariate shift? Don’t you want to know what internal covariate shift <em>is</em>? Batch Norm has become a foundational operation for machine learning. <em>It works amazingly well. But we know almost nothing about it.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis mine)</p>\n<p>The alchemy story has similarities to both the roadblock story and the security story.</p>\n<p><strong>From the perspective of the roadblock story</strong>, \"alchemical\" insights could be viewed as insights which could be useful if we only cared about creating AGI, but are too unreliable to use in an FAI.  (It's possible there are other insights which fall into the \"usable for AGI but not FAI\" category due to something other than their alchemical nature--if you can think of any, I'd be interested to hear.)</p>\n<p>In some ways, alchemy could be worse than a clear roadblock.  It might be that not everyone agrees whether the systems are reliable enough to form the basis of an FAI, and then we're looking at a <a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/unilateralists-curse/\">unilateralist's curse</a> scenario.</p>\n<p>Just like chemistry only came after alchemy, it's possible that we'll first develop the capability to create AGI via alchemical means, and only acquire the deeper understanding necessary to create a reliable FAI later.  (This is a scenario from the roadblock section, where FAI insights require AGI insights as a prerequisite.)  To prevent this, we could try &amp; deepen our understanding of components we expect to fail in subtle ways, and retard the development of components we expect to \"just work\" without any surprises once invented.</p>\n<p><strong>From the perspective of the security story</strong>, \"alchemical\" insights could be viewed as components which are <em>clearly</em> prone to vulnerabilities.  Alchemical components could produce failures which are hard to understand or summarize, let alone fix.  From a differential technological development point of view, the best approach may be to differentially advance less alchemical, more interpretable AI paradigms, developing the AI equivalent of reliable cryptographic primitives.  (Note that explainability is <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0048-x.epdf?author_access_token=SU_TpOb-H5d3uy5KF-dedtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M3t8uDwhDckroSbUOOygdba5KNHQMo_Ji2D1_SdDjVr6hjgxJXc-7jt5FQZuPTQKIAkZsBoTI4uqjwnzbltD01Z8QwhwKsbvwh-z1xL8bAcg%3D%3D\">inferior</a> to <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/10/30/explainable-ml-versus-interpretable-ml/\">interpretability</a>.)</p>\n<p>Trying to create an FAI from alchemical components is obviously not the best idea.  But it's not totally clear how much of a risk these components pose, because if the components don't work reliably, an AGI built from them may not work well enough to pose a threat.  Such an AGI could work better over time if it's able to improve its own components.  In this case, we might be able to program it so it periodically re-evaluates its training data as its components get upgraded, so its understanding of human values improves as its components improve.</p>\n<h1>Discussion Questions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How plausible does each story seem?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What possibilities aren't covered by the taxonomy provided?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What distinctions does this framework fail to capture?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Which claims are incorrect?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

This post is influenced by <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma\">False Dilemma</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/erGipespbbzdG5zYb/the-third-alternative\">The Third alternative</a></u>.</em></p><p>A false dilemma is of the form &#x201C;It&#x2019;s either this, or that. Pick one!&#x201D; It tries to make you choose from a limited set of options, when, in reality, more options are available. With that in mind, what&#x2019;s wrong with the following examples?</p><p>Ex. 1: You either love the guy or hate him</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Counterargument 1: &#x201C;Only a Sith deals in absolutes!&#x201D;</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Counterargument 2: I can feel neutral towards the guy</p></div><p>Ex. 2: You can only add and subtract in mathematics.</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Uh, division and multiplication, right?</p></div><p>Ex. 3: Either you get me that new car, or you don&#x2019;t love me!</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">I can care about your well-being and happiness and not get you that specific car. I could buy a used car, so you wouldn&#x2019;t freak out if it got damaged or [3 different examples based on what the (father?) thinks is best]. </p></div><p>Ex. 4: You didn&#x2019;t donate to the food drive, so you don&#x2019;t care about starving children!</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">I do care about starving children, but my family and I are just barely scraping by and I value feeding them first. </p></div><h1>Generalization</h1><p>How would you generalize the above examples? Of course it presents a certain set of options as the only available options (I said this in the intro!), but what&#x2019;s the relationship between those options? Are there different types of options that are similar/different between the examples?</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">One way to frame it is to separate options into two types: values and actions </p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">With that frame, false dilemmas can be categorized into 4 varieties:</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">1. Only these values are compatible with an agent</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">2. Only these actions are compatible with a system/environment</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">3. Only these actions are compatible with this value</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">4. Only these values are compatible with this action</p></div><p>These 4 varieties correspond to each of their respective examples above (this is not a coincidence). Note: you could have answered Ex.3 as (4) and Ex.4 as (3), it really just depends on the truth of the situation. I&#x2019;ll leave the details as an exercise for the reader. </p><p>[Also, I&#x2019;m sticking my neck out here and claiming that these are the only 4 categories a false dilemma can ever fit. Prove me wrong in the comments and I&#x2019;ll update the post]</p><p>So how about trying this new frame out on the following:</p><p>Ex. 5: You can either get up and work out every day or stay on that couch and stay an unhealthy slob!</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\"><em>Ouch. </em>Rephrasing: &#x201C;Only working out every day is compatible with desiring health&#x201D;. There&#x2019;s also couch-to-5k, high intensity training 1-3 days/week, playing sports together that could all improve health and be better long-term or transitioning-wise or whatever you also value. </p></div><p>Ex. 6: Pencils are for writing and erasing</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">I could use it to make a beat, play miniature football, as a flagpole in a diorama, as a gift, or to poke holes in a page, or &#x2026;</p></div><p>Ex. 7: <em>You upset your friend Alice with an insensitive joke. Bob tells you, </em>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe you said such a terrible thing. You don&#x2019;t care about her at all!&#x201D;</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Rephrasing: &#x201C;Only never hurting someone&#x2019;s feelings is compatible with caring about them&#x201D;. I care about Alice very much, I just really suck at showing it. (I think it&#x2019;s interesting that this covers failed goals/good intentions. This makes sense since agents, like us, aren&#x2019;t logically omniscient)</p></div><p>Ex. 8: You either care for animal life or your own temporary comfort!</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">I can care about both to different degrees. </p></div><h1>Algorithm</h1><p>What&#x2019;s a possibly ideal general algorithm to solve False Dilemmas?</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">1. What are the possible values and actions?</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">2. What&#x2019;s arbitrarily constrained?</p></div><br><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">3. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vpvKEj7shuk8h5Eet/hammertime-day-2-yoda-timers\">Yoda Timers:</a> brainstorm more options</p></div><p>[Note: Some of these examples are limited because we don&#x2019;t know the context or the purpose, so it&#x2019;s hard to enumerate very useful actions/accurate values. That&#x2019;s okay because in reality, you can introspect and ask questions]</p><h1>Useful Constraints:</h1><p>Constraints can be useful when used purposefully. False Dilemmas are generally bad because they are arbitrary constraints and no one is even aware that a constraint is being used! In the following prompts, what&#x2019;s a useful constraint to use and why is it useful?</p><p>Ex. 9: &#x201C;Write a 500 word essay on the United States&#x201D;</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">&quot;Narrow it down to the front of one building on the main street of Bozeman. The Opera House. Start with the upper left-hand brick.&#x201D; [This is stolen from Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance]. Narrowing down the topic is useful for writer&#x2019;s block. </p></div><p>Ex. 10: Prove that given two Natural numbers (0,1,2,3,...) n and m, n*m = 0 if and only if one of them is 0. </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">I could talk about all natural numbers n &amp;m; however, it may be easier to divide this into 4 cases: n = 0 &amp; m = 0,  n &gt;0 &amp; m = 0, n = 0 &amp; m &gt; 0, and n &gt; 0 &amp; m &gt;0. This is useful because it&#x2019;s trivial to prove each case, and it&#x2019;s hard (for me!) to prove this in a way that doesn&#x2019;t rely on cases. </p></div><p>Ex. 11: You listed them out, and it appears you have 10 problems in your life and you can&#x2019;t even do anything about some of them!</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Circle which ones you can do something about, and constrain your thoughts/actions to only those problems. Constraining in this way helps combat feeling overwhelmed/helpless.</p></div><p>Ex. 12: Your friend asks &#x201C;Where do you want to go eat?&#x201D;. You say &#x201C;Oh wherever, I&#x2019;m not pick&#x201D;. They say, &#x201C;Oh me too!&#x201D;. (Normally it takes 5-10 minutes after this to figure out where to go)</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">I could say anything like &#x201C;Place A and B are very close and I like both, which one is good for you?&#x201D;, and that normally speeds up the process. Same applies for picking a time and place for hanging out. &#x201C;How about this coffeehouse at this time? Is that good?&#x201D;</p></div><p>Ex. 13: You always seem to have trouble deciding what food to order when you go to a new restaurant.</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">There are several constraints that may serve you well. One is &#x201C;Pick what is popular in the restaurant&#x201D;, another is &#x201C;pick the first thing that sounds good&#x201D; (Got this from someone here in LW).</p></div><h1>Introspective Problem Set</h1><p>Very often we arbitrarily constrain what we can do. </p><p>Ex. 14: How do identities (I am a Parent/Good Student/ Good friend/Smart Person/etc) constrain possible actions? What&#x2019;s a specific example of an identity you&#x2019;ve held (or are holding) that has constrained what you thought you could do. </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">By identifying as X, we must a<em>ct li</em>ke someone who is X. Whether that&#x2019;s mimicking how we&#x2019;ve seen another X act, or how our model of being X. </p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">I&#x2019;ve personally identified as a &#x201C;Good Student&#x201D;. What I mean is that as long as I really put in the time to study, then I have done my duty. This has constrained possible actions such as asking what specifically confused me and googling other explanations.</p></div><p>Ex. 15: Are there any times when it&#x2019;s good to constrain who you are/ what you can do?</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Tons! The search space of a problem is sometimes very big. Having an identity/ being a role always is usually bad because it constrains you to a specific chunk of search space always.  But temporarily playing as different roles helps search through different chunks more efficiently.</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">For example, playing as the devil&#x2019;s advocate with yourself can help search for the very best reasons why your idea is good, and find the very best reasons why it&#x2019;s bad. When a friend tells me a huge problem they&#x2019;re dealing with, it&#x2019;s time to switch to &#x201C;Very concerned friend who listens&#x201D;. When I meet someone very shy, it&#x2019;s time to switch to &#x201C;Talkative friend who asks easy questions&#x201D;. </p></div><p>This is also related to the <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AqbWna2S85pFTsHH4/the-intelligent-social-web\">Intelligent Social Web</a></u>. </p><p>Ex. 16: What about emotions/mental states? What&#x2019;s a time they&#x2019;ve constrained you to do something bad? What about something something good?</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Sometimes when something frustrating happens, I feel like I&#x2019;m only constrained to the action &#x201C;Eat something sweet and distract yourself&#x201D;. Realizing that, I have now produced several alternatives: take a walk, take care of any present needs (hunger, sleep, etc), play piano, call a loved one, etc. I would say this is category 2, &#x201C;Only these actions are compatible in this specific environment&#x201D;</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Being in a meditative state helps me love those who are late (it&#x2019;s true because it rhymes). I am consistently way more patient in a meditative state and it&#x2019;s my go to move when someone is late. </p></div><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Category Qualifications was about seeing words as a set of qualifications and how to wield qualifications to effectively communicate. This post is about seeing constraints in planning/agents/environments and how to wield those constraints effectively to achieve your goals. </p><p>When arguing well, it&#x2019;s useful to know exactly which constraints are being used and why they are being used. People fall victim to False Dilemmas when they&#x2019;re not aware of the implied/assumed constraints. </p><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/THj3Q6p9NsDvmsMAF/finding-cruxes\">next post</a>, we&#x2019;ll be investigating how to find cruxes and how this is useful when arguing well. </p><p>As a final exercise (which I haven&#x2019;t worked myself), how does this apply to <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/\">conflict vs mistake culture</a></u>?</p><p>[This is an iterative post/sequence. I don&#x2019;t think any of us on LW claim we have the 100% truth/final word on a topic. If you strongly downvote a post, please also leave a comment saying why it&#x2019;s wrong/not useful so the iterative/improving process can happen]</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>  </p><p>It is relevant that one should pay attention in the tiniest bits of the location they find themselves in. From this bit of habit, a lot of things will cease to confound the mind. How much we can predict circumstances by relying on previous data depends on how much we have programmed our minds to divide the world into tiny clues, and compose it in the right way. A lot of Sherlock Holmes readers fail to see the conclusion of the crime, even when all the facts are laid out before them. When the conclusion does come, you then make connections to the strings you’ve been provided with. Mostly with human psychology, we get the answer and then go back to connect the strings we’ve had in the very beginning. In this exercise, we are learning to condition ourselves to use the strings of incidences to theorize the ending, not use the ending to connect the incidences. </p><p>I’ve actually met a person that can always predict the ending of the movie just five minutes into the movie. And then another that claims that if he had the name of the movie, the starring actors or their faces, that he could pick up the clues and possibly predict the ending. The second claim may seem farfetched, but it is within the bounds of logical reasoning. For most people, this attribute has been so innate in them, it becomes a conditioned reflex.</p><p>Let’s say you climb a set of stairs every day for the past ten years. Have you really taken the time to know the number of stairs in the staircase? Can you identify the parts that are more worn than the others? </p><p>Okay, here’s another one. If you had a neighbor for two years, can you rightfully recall what colors the neighbor favors to wear on Tuesday or Wednesday, and the fact that he usually leaves by this time and gets back by another time? Can you guess his behavioral patterns? And let’s say he suddenly goes missing, and the police questions you and asks if there were odd manners that he was exhibiting prior to his disappearance, would you be able to recall that he always wears a brown tie on Tuesdays, and the last Tuesday you saw him, he wasn’t wearing one? That is conditioned observation. </p><p>If I were to ask you the number of trees in your street, the highest number of same colored homes in your district, or the number of people who have black cars around your area, might you be able to answer accurately, might your guess even get as close to the real figure. A scientist is an observer, a detective is an observer; observations is the best skill in law and science. It is a power that can be learned, and it requires strict discipline. You don’t only have to see, you have to observe and recall. If you’re walking along a lane with a hundred other people, and a red car zooms past, you and the hundred other people see the car, but how many actually observe it?</p><p>Being connected to the world around you, training yourself to recognize the bread crumbs, goes a long way to improve your observational skills even in the areas of science. Science simply is asking the right questions, but how can you ask the right questions, if there are no observation of the workings of the world to trigger the question.</p><p>If we take in the works of fiction, there aren’t many fictional works an average person wouldn’t be able to glimpse the ending of by reading a few pages of the book. Apart from the ‘Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’ by Douglas Adams that really jumps around with no definite direction- or sanity in any case- most other fictional works are written for the purpose of finding the bread crumbs, following the breadcrumbs, and seeing the end. A lot of people are only able to see the ending when the ending comes, and yet others can see the ending by staring at the name of the book.</p><p>Observation in science doesn’t only go as far as to only observe the quantities in an experiment, it goes a longer way than that. Nature is science, human beings are science, their behavioral patterns is science; observe everything. From observing the tiniest details, changes, and objects around you, your observational skills will keep on developing, till you’ve advanced to that level where the most imperceptible changes around you, become perceptible to you.</p><p>For an example, and to send you into the hardest egg hunt I’ve seen in science fiction, or literary fiction for that matter, I’ll point you to a newly released book ‘Cybernetics Within Us’ by Nmesoma Okechukwu. From my observational skills, I can also relate to the fact that this fictional book is named after the 1967 nonfiction work by Yelena Saparina. The nonfictional work features the in-depth study of the growing science of introducing cybernetic systems in living systems. </p><p>When reading the fictional work, I try to keep in mind the direction of the original copy bearing the same name, and try to use it to decipher the tidbits that were lain out in front of the readers of the fictional work. I must commend the author, because the conclusion I and a few others came to were destroyed by the author at the very end. And yet when you look back to the lines of the story, you find out that the tangled mess of strings actually reads to this definite point of conclusion. It may likely seem random for other people, but I am assured that the author has a bigger purpose in mind. The Book One left a mystery for the readers to solve at the very end- a sort of careless clue- and I’ve likely solved mine to the best of my knowledge. Hopefully, it might prove to be a right solution with what would be presented in Book Two of the book, if not, so much for the logic. </p><p>Reviewing the science that was presented in the book, I would say that it would most likely be termed a hard sci-fi work. But there were some elements of logic that I may well disagree with, and my strongest doubts came present at the length of time it took for the world to change, according to the book. It may have been more possible to prolong the time frame, but that is by my own reasoning. </p><p>Not many literary works offer the chance to send readers on a clue hunt. And don’t be disappointed when your conclusion is far from the whole purpose of the book, the writer is creatively deceptive. It would be a fun challenge to put your observational skills to work by checking out this ‘mind bending’ piece of literary work.</p><p>Remember, logic is not always right, because it depends on how much information the reasoner has, and the qualities or capabilities he/she has in piecing together the aimless clues, in order to present the final accurate story. To sum up every single thing this article is about in a single sentence, observe anything and everything. Make everything around you a challenge. It’s certainly one of the best cognitive exercises there is. </p>",

You can</em> <em><u><a href=\"http://samoburja.com/the-youtube-revolution-in-knowledge-transfer/\">access the original here.</a></u></em></p><p>Growing up as an aspiring javelin thrower in Kenya, the young <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Yego\">Julius Yego</a> was unable to find a coach: in a country where runners command the most prestige, mentorship was practically nonexistent. Determined to succeed, he instead watched YouTube recordings of Norwegian Olympic javelin thrower Andreas Thorkildsen, taking detailed notes and attempting to imitate the fine details of his movements. Yego went on to win gold in the 2015 World Championships in Beijing, silver in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and holds the 3rd-longest javelin throw on world record. He acquired a coach only six months before he competed in the 2012 London Olympics&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;over a decade after he started practicing.</p><p>Yego&#x2019;s rise was enabled by YouTube. Yet since its founding, popular consensus has been that the video service is making people dumber. Indeed, modern video media may shorten attention spans and distract from longer-form means of communication, such as written articles or books. But critically overlooked is its unlocking a form of mass-scale tacit knowledge transmission which is historically unprecedented, facilitating the preservation and spread of knowledge that might otherwise have been&#xA0;lost.</p><p>Tacit knowledge is knowledge that can&#x2019;t properly be transmitted via verbal or written instruction, like the ability to create great art or assess a startup. This tacit knowledge is a form of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-KPAD1UjpsE\">intellectual dark matter</a>, pervading society in a million ways, some of them trivial, some of them vital. Examples include woodworking, metalworking, housekeeping, cooking, dancing, amateur public speaking, assembly line oversight, rapid problem-solving, and heart&#xA0;surgery.</p><p>Before video became available at scale, tacit knowledge had to be transmitted in person, so that the learner could closely observe the knowledge in action and learn in real time&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;skilled metalworking, for example, is impossible to teach from a textbook. Because of this intensely local nature, it presents a uniquely strong <a href=\"https://medium.com/@samo.burja/the-succession-problem-c5ffb8d1ab58\">succession problem</a>: if a master woodworker fails to transmit his tacit knowledge to the few apprentices in his shop, the knowledge is lost forever, even if he&#x2019;s written books about it. Further, tacit knowledge serves as an obstacle to centralization, as its local transmission provides an advantage for decentralized players that can&#x2019;t be replicated by a central authority. The center cannot appropriate what it cannot access: there will never be a state monopoly on plumbing or dentistry, for&#xA0;example.</p><p>Some will object that tacit knowledge acquisition must be possible without close observation of a skilled practitioner; otherwise we would never see skilled autodidacts. It&#x2019;s true that some are able to acquire tacit knowledge by directly interacting with the object of mastery and figuring out things on their own, but this is very difficult. True autodidacts who can invent their own techniques are rare, but many can learn by watching and imitating.</p><p>The scarcity of people who can truly learn from what they&#x2019;re given is why the massive open online courses of the early 2010s <a href=\"https://www.umt.edu/provost/docs/MOOC-pivot.pdf\">didn&#x2019;t work out</a>, with 95% of enrolled students failing to complete even a single course, and year-on-year student retention rates below 10%. Learners who wish to acquire tacit knowledge, but who are unable to figure things out on their own, are therefore limited by their access to personal observation of skilled&#xA0;people.</p><p>Massively available video recordings of practitioners in action change this entirely. Through these videos, learners can now partially replicate the master-apprentice relationship, opening up skill domains and economic niches that were previously cordoned off by personal access. These new points of access range from the specialized trades, where electricians illustrate <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVFkKBFJsZg\">how to use multimeters</a> and how to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUHxrejOhvM\">assess breaker boxes</a>, to less specialized domestic activities, where a novice can learn <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlnOsnr94qM\">basic knife-handling techniques</a> from an expert. YouTube reports that searches in the &#x201C;how-to&#x201D; category has grown <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/micro-moments/i-want-to-do-micro-moments/\">70% year-on-year</a>.</p><p>This ability to transmit visually apparent tacit knowledge at scale has only recently become technically possible as a result of the convergence of four&#xA0;factors:</p><ol><li>Quality digital cameras have become cheap enough for mass use. This happened due to incremental technological advancements, as well as the economies of scale, driven by mass consumer demand. It is still expensive to buy a camera good enough to record video that is pleasant to watch, but it is not expensive to buy a camera that provides enough information for us to track natural facial movement and fine hand gestures. The availability of such cameras distributes the means of documenting activity to all the nooks and crannies of society that might store tacit knowledge.</li><li>Mass broadband internet access. It allows us to watch recorded video on demand at sufficient quality.</li><li>Search engines. Only a tiny fraction of the great mass of video content produced and consumed due to (1) and (2) is of value. Imagine a society that has digital cameras and mass broadband internet access available, but no way to search through the videos. Somewhere in there might be exactly what you need, but if all you did was replace the cost of finding someone in your social circles with the cost of finding a needle in a digital haystack, the economics of transmitting such knowledge wouldn&#x2019;t have improved.</li><li>Ubiquity of portable screens. TV sets of the previous century were not very portable and usually needed an entire room dedicated to comfortable content consumption. This is not the case with smartphones, which have displaced and fragmented television hours by a similar number of portable screen watching&#xA0;hours.</li></ol><p>All of these factors come together in YouTube, where people upload their digital videos to the internet on a viewing platform that allows for easy search and content aggregation&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;all on a massive&#xA0;scale.</p><p>Early results of this knowledge-transfer revolution are easy to find, like an explosion of at-home science in domains such as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/03/the-citizen-science-of-skin-care/555125/\">dermatology</a>. Such efforts combat industries with incentives to advertise pseudoscience to consumers.</p><p>Can this growing corpus reshape knowledge inside established institutions as well? Take academic science, for example. The ongoing replication crisis is after all partially the consequence of the questionable assumption that every procedure and observation can be expressed in exact scientific writing. What if the scientific literature shifted its balance much more towards visual documentation?</p><p>The unflinching eye of the camera captures what experimental scientists might not know that they know, opening a window to distant collaborators. Through this mutual transparency, we can create a truly open science, going beyond current methods like preregistration and the sharing of source code and original data&#xA0;sets.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.jove.com/journal\">JoVE</a>, a peer-reviewed video journal, is the only effort of this kind I&#x2019;m aware of. They record and make available online tacit knowledge from universities and laboratories across the world. They have been collecting such material since December 2006, making it almost as old as YouTube. While maintaining and using their own player might have made sense in their early days, they would today probably be better off migrating to&#xA0;YouTube.</p><p>Who today would argue that YouTube will one day be evaluated in the same category as the printing press or the telegraph? It is quite possible it will&#xA0;be.</p><p><em>You can follow me on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4QYBbgLkGaULStiC5yc_1Q\">YouTube</a> or&#xA0;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamoBurja?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>.</em></p><p><em>Read more from Samo Burja</em> <em><u><a href=\"http://samoburja.com/essays\">here.</a></u></em></p>",

Kind of making this up as I go along, almost certainly missing important points. </em></p><p><em>Other meta: Written all in one sitting, to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. No one proofread it, so hopefully there aren&apos;t sentences that just cut off in the middle. Also, forgive my excessive use of scare quotes.</em></p><p>tl;dr: The difference between historical salons and LW meetups is that meetups do not feel like the place where progress is made. They&#x2019;re not doing research or publishing anything. If they wrote up the results of their discussions and posted them on LW, that would help conversations be less siloed.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>This post is a confluence of two major topics I&#x2019;ve been mulling over for a while now.</p><p>Number one is rationality meetups. I&#x2019;ve been working on global meetup coordination on-and-off and more-or-less formally for over two years now, and it is just... not an easy problem. It was about two years ago that I wrote <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bDnFhJBcLQvCY3vJW/what-are-meetups-actually-trying-to-accomplish\">What Are Meetups Actually Trying to Accomplish?</a>, and I honestly haven&#x2019;t made a ton of progress since then (due to meetups being like my sixth or lower priority at any given time). However, I have changed my outlook somewhat - that post was very much trying to be descriptive, but I&#x2019;m now much more inclined towards prescriptivism (more on that in the appendix). </p><p>Number two, Habryka has gotten me hooked on books about the history of science, and on thinking about how intellectual progress is made more generally. I&#x2019;ve recently read <em>The Innovators, The Age of Innovation</em>, and the biographies of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, and I&#x2019;m in the process of reading <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Science in the 20th Century, </em>and a biography of Benjamin Franklin. I also majored in physics, which de facto included a fair amount of history of science.</p><p>Turns out, most modern histories of science and innovation (at least the ones that I&#x2019;ve read, but like, selection bias) focus pretty heavily on the first half of the 20th century, and specifically, the people during that time who roughly thought of themselves as physicists.</p><p>Physics at the time was a small community. If the books I&#x2019;ve been reading are to be believed, all the big-name scientists read each others&apos; papers, many of them were close friends who regularly exchanged letters, and they all went to lectures by each other and often had their big ideas there. </p><p>I&#x2019;ve come to think of the thing that meetups <em>should </em>be as something akin to these lectures (but mixed with intellectual salons / Franklin&#x2019;s Junto / gentlemen&#x2019;s clubs). A version of meetups I&#x2019;d be excited about would be not only forums for exchange of ideas, but also ones that aim towards real intellectual progress.</p><p>Glossing over all the detail and individual variation, meetups are currently a mix of a) social groups, and b) forums for learning, intellectual discussion, and exchange of ideas. For the latter, we generally have a core set of ideas that we&#x2019;re all more or less familiar with, and we build from there. This is much like an intellectual salon or Franklin&apos;s Junto. However, I think there are a few key things missing that prevent us from developing and building on ideas in a way similar to early 20th century scientists:</p><h1>Missing pieces</h1><h3>Less clear focus</h3><p>I have a sense that, compared to early 20th century scientists, our efforts are less focused on one thing in particular. &#x2018;Rationality&#x2019; is a broad umbrella, encompassing AI safety, developing the art of human rationality, navel-gazey community stuff (like this post), science more generally, and everything that falls under the &#x2018;effective altruism&#x2019; umbrella (animal welfare, global development, cause prioritization, etc, etc, etc.). This means that even people who are really trying to &#x2018;make progress&#x2019; on &#x2018;the project of rationality&#x2019; are often working on completely different things, and won&#x2019;t even be able to talk to each other in depth about what they&#x2019;re doing.</p><p>However, this isn&#x2019;t necessarily a dealbreaker - it&#x2019;s similar to the way that particle physicists and astrophysicists will share a lot of basic knowledge, but there&#x2019;s still plenty of detail about their research that they may not easily be able to share with each other.</p><h3>Feeling of license</h3><p>I&#x2019;ve gotten a feeling - both from talking to meetup attendees who don&#x2019;t live in &#x2018;rationalist hubs&#x2019;, and from being one myself - that most meetup attendees have a feeling that they&#x2019;re &#x2018;not part of the intellectual elite.&#x2019; Speaking for myself, there was a feeling that all the &#x2018;real&#x2019; progress was happening in conversations in the Bay Area that are never written down, and that there were these special elite people like Eliezer, Scott, Nate Soares, Luke Muehlhauser, Julia Galef, Anna Salamon, etc., who were the only &#x2018;real rationalists&#x2019;, and other people just didn&apos;t really get to contribute to rationality. This resulted in a feeling that because I wasn&apos;t part of this select elite, I wasn&apos;t smart enough to be working on rationality, and so it wasn&apos;t worth writing down and developing my ideas.</p><h3>Sense that it matters</h3><p>As gruesome and horrible as the World Wars were in terms of immediate human cost, history of science books make it pretty clear that they were really good for science and progress. There was a sense of urgency, coupled with plenty of government funding, and this resulted in innovations like the transistor and the radar, as well as huge developments in fields like nuclear physics.</p><p>Many people in this community <em>do </em>have a sense of urgency, because of existential risk. But I think it&#x2019;s fair to say that AI safety, for most people, feels less viscerally real than the current, imminent, or past gruesome deaths of their friends and family members. In WWII, people knew what the end of their world looked like, because it was happening all around them. For us, we may have a sense that our world is very close to ending, but it usually feels pretty intellectual. (I think events like Petrov Day and the Secular Solstice are valuable for bringing existential risk into near mode, but that&apos;s another story).</p><p>Ending death is definitely more visceral, but it&#x2019;s still very different from the World Wars. During that time (at least as the history books tell it, so could be way off), most of the Western world was pretty focused on a single goal. By contrast, ending death is currently a pretty out-there idea, and it&apos;s much harder to rally behind a cause when people think you&apos;re crazy than it is when multiple countries are on your side.</p><h3>Siloed conversations</h3><p>Conversations in the geographically disparate communities are fairly siloed. This means that, while past-Mingyuan all the way over in Chicago may feel left out because she doesn&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s being discussed in Berkeley, the flip side is that the people in Berkeley have no idea what&#x2019;s being discussed in Chicago.</p><p>As a result, different meetups are probably endlessly retreading much of the same ground. While this isn&#x2019;t always a bad thing - since discussions like those can be useful just for practicing things like debate and idea generation - it does feel like there&#x2019;s a lot of wasted motion. There must have been dozens of meetups on Meditations on Moloch, and I&#x2019;m sure most of them have had plenty of ideas and insights, but there&#x2019;s no net progress because we don&#x2019;t communicate with each other.</p><h1>How can we be more like early 20th century science?</h1><p>I have several concrete ideas for improving on the current situation, most of which I&#x2019;ve sanity-checked with Habryka. Some of these are going into effect immediately, while others are more long-term goals that we aren&#x2019;t currently prioritizing.</p><h3>Fostering a feeling of license</h3><p>Habryka and I have talked a bit about how to make meetups feel more like real institutions, rather than just random groups of people. One idea we&#x2019;ve floated is having there be &#x2018;official&#x2019; LessWrong groups - similar to how other organizations (Toastmasters, Girl Scouts, etc.) have official chapters. While I think this would probably be cool, it would also require a lot more work than any of us currently have the time to put in.</p><p>Something that we can do in the short term is build a feature to allow people to make frontpage LessWrong posts that are affiliated with meetup groups. I&#x2019;m not sure how much this will actually foster a feeling of license, but at least it will make my other proposal work better.</p><h3>A single conversational locus</h3><p>Three years ago, Anna Salamon wrote <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8rYxw9xZfwy86jkpG/on-the-importance-of-less-wrong-or-another-single\">On the importance of Less Wrong, or another single conversational locus</a></u>. In direct correspondence to her point about the online rationalist diaspora, I think the various geographic communities could benefit strongly from having a more centralized discussion.</p><h4>Proposal: Monetary incentives for write-ups</h4><p>I propose that meetup attendees write up the ideas that come out of each meeting - or even just summarize the conversation they had - and post them on LessWrong. In order to encourage people to actually write these posts, I am offering a monetary incentive of $100 per write-up (to be paid out a maximum of once per week to each meetup). See <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPvLSKkhZhdKbykoruQ1PO3K2CR7D9mNusd9BvRamIw/edit?usp=sharing\">this doc </a>for further details.</p><h4>Proposal: Facebook group</h4><p>I&#x2019;m also in the process of creating a Facebook group for attendees of all meetups worldwide. The goal is to make meetup attendees feel more like part of a single community, and to have a Schelling place for them to discuss problems specific to meetups. </p><p>I&apos;ve wanted something like this to exist for a while, and in a survey I ran a couple months ago, more than 80% of respondents indicated that they&apos;d appreciate a way to communicate with people from other meetup groups. Of those, a plurality preferred to use a Facebook group, and much as I personally dislike Facebook, I have to admit that it has pretty good infrastructure for this use case.</p><h4>Some other ideas:</h4><ul><li>Cross-pollination of ideas via geographical travel.</li><ul><li>Obviously this won&#x2019;t be feasible for everyone, or even most people. However, I&#x2019;ve found that there&#x2019;s value to meeting people face-to-face that&#x2019;s really hard to get even with years of online discussion. This is why a bunch of people were excited to accompany Scott Alexander on his Meetups Everywhere road trip - it&#x2019;s just really hard to know what&#x2019;s going on in a place without actually going there.</li></ul><li>Topics of the month.</li><ul><li>I&#x2019;d potentially like to generate a default meetup topic for each month, so that lots of people all over are talking about the same thing at the same time. This could make discussion on both LessWrong (via the write-ups) and the Facebook group more focused, and thus hopefully move the community&apos;s conversation around those topics forward (trying to avoid the failure mode of retreading the same ground).</li><li>I am not going ahead with implementing this idea imminently both because I&apos;m less confident in it, and because of the overhead required.</li></ul></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>So, I have some ideas and some amount of power to execute them. I am fairly excited about the write-up incentives idea and fairly confident that the Facebook group is at least something that enough people want to try. On the other hand, many of the times that I&apos;ve previously tried to publicly take action in this space, I got shot down pretty harshly. So I&apos;d love to hear why you think my proposals are na&#xEF;ve / misguided / going to pollute the commons / going to crash and burn <strong>before</strong> I launch anything this time. Concrete critiques and proposals of alternatives would be greatly appreciated.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p><strong>Appendix: Towards prescriptivism</strong></p><p>So, why the change from the descriptive approach in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bDnFhJBcLQvCY3vJW/what-are-meetups-actually-trying-to-accomplish\">my last post</a> to a more prescriptive outlook? Well, frankly, it became pretty clear to me that there had been barely any thought put into meetups as a whole (not to diminish the work that has been done in this domain; there&#x2019;s just been very little of it overall). Meetups kind of grew organically because people wanted to socialize with people who shared their interests, but over the last decade or so, many of them have grown into institutions that do tangible things like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3bbvzoRA8n6ZgbiyK/p/jES7mcPvKpfmzMTgC\">invent</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fr8MEigHzJeFQkctL/petrov-day-is-september-26\">holidays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WmfapdnpFfHWzkdXY/rationalist-community-hub-in-moscow-3-years-retrospective\">run their own rationality workshops</a>, and <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Translations_into_other_languages\">translate the Sequences into different languages</a>. While all of those things are really cool and great, the majority of meetup groups aren&apos;t doing anything like that. So I&apos;ve come to think of meetups, as a whole, as vastly underutilized resources. If this is going to change, someone needs to take real action on it, and I&apos;ve somehow ended up in a position where I guess that&apos;s my job. So here we are.</p>",

The goal of this post is to carve up the information landscape into areas of relative danger and safety; to illuminate some of the islands in the mire that contain more treasures than traps, and to help you judge where you’re likely to find discussion more destructive than constructive.</p>\n<p><strong>Useful things to know already if you’re reading this post</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf\">Bostrom’s paper on Information Hazards</a>, and the more general categorization schema from <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Information_hazard\">this LessWrong overview</a>.</li>\n<li>It would also be useful to refresh yourself on the meaning of the <a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/unilateralists-curse/\">Unilateralist’s Curse</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Much of the material in this also overlaps with Gregory Lewis’ <em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/risa.13235\">Information Hazards in Biotechnology</a></em> article, which we recommend.</p>\n<h1>Risks of Information Sharing</h1>\n<p>We’ve divided this paper into two broad categories: risks from information sharing, and risks from secrecy. First we will go over the ways in which sharing information can cause harm, and then how keeping information secret can cause harm.</p>\n<p>We believe considering both is important for determining whether or not to share a particular thought or paper. To keep things relatively targeted and concrete, we provide illustrative toy examples, or sometimes even real examples.</p>\n<p>This section categorizes ways that sharing information in the biological sciences can be risky.</p>\n<p>A topic covered in other Information Hazard posts that we chose not to focus on here is that different audiences can present substantially different risk profiles for the same idea.</p>\n<p>With some ideas, you can achieve almost all of the benefits and de-risking associated with sharing by only mentioning your idea to one key researcher, or sharing findings in a journal associated with some obscure subfield, while simultaneously dodging most of the risk of these ideas finding their way to a foolish or bad actor.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in that topic, Gregory Lewis’ paper <em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/risa.13235\">Information Hazards in Biotechnology</a></em> covers it well.</p>\n<h2>Bad conceptual ideas to bad actors</h2>\n<p><em>A bad actor gets an idea they did not previously have</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bad actor uses these new ideas to create novel biological weapons or strategies.</li>\n<li>State bioweapons programs or bioterrorists gain new research directions or ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>State or non-state actors may have trouble developing ideas on their own. Model generation can be quite difficult, so generating or sharing clever new models can be risky. In particular, we are concerned about the possibility of ideas moving from biology researchers to bioterrorists or state actors. Biosecurity researchers are often better-educated and/or more creative than most bad actors. There are also probably many more researchers than people interested in bioterrorism; the difference in numbers could be even more impactful. If there are more biosecurity researchers than there are bad actors, researchers are likely to come up with many more ideas.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy example:</strong> Biosecurity researcher writes and publishes a paper about vulnerabilities in the water supply of Exemplandia and a biological agent, Sickmaniasis, that could be used to terrorize Exemplandia. Bioterrorists read the paper, and decide to carry out an attack. A bioterrorist does research in how to manufacture Sickmaniasis, and how to disseminate Sickmaniasis into the water supply of Exemplandia, and carries out the attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bad conceptual ideas to careless actors</h2>\n<p><em>A careless actor gets an idea they did not previously have</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A careless actor decides to either explore an idea publicly in further detail, or decides to implement the idea, not realizing or caring about the damage it could cause.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>Some careless actors may have a low chance of thinking of a given interesting idea on their own, but have the inclination and ability to implement an idea if they hear about it from someone else. One reason this might be true is that biosecurity researchers could specifically be looking for interesting possible threats, so the “interesting idea” space they explore will focus more heavily on risky ideas.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Toy example 1:</strong> Biosecurity researcher publishes a report about vulnerabilities in the water supply of Exemplandia and a biological agent, Sickmaniasis, that could be used to terrorize Exemplandia. Another researcher writes a paper that explores specific possible implementations of Sickmaniasis, including sequence information and lab procedures for generating Sickmaniasis. In this case of the Unilaterist’s Curse, both security researchers were motivated by the desire to prevent some kind of harm, but the first researcher was specifically more careful about publishing methods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Toy example 2:</strong> Researcher publishes report on how to use a gene drive to drive an insect species extinct. A careless researcher uses this report to create a gene drive in a lab on a test population of an insect species. Some insects escape from the lab, and the wild insect species population crashes. Even though the original researcher’s lab was very careful with test implementations of their gene drives, the information they produce led to a careless lab crashing the population of a whole species.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real Example:</strong> In 1997, rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) began to spread through New Zealand. It is believed by authorities that New Zealand farmers smuggled the disease into the country and released it intentionally as an animal control measure. RHD was used in Australia as a biocontrol tool, and organizations had attempted to get the New Zealand government to approve it for use. The virus began to spread after the New Zealand government denied their application. This is a case where authorities that reviewed a biological tool for use decided it was a bad idea. Despite their disapproval, someone released it. This wasn’t a human pathogen, but the demonstrated potential for a unilateral actor to decide to release a banned disease agent and succeed is troubling all the same. We’d like to reiterate that unsanctioned pest control using disease is A BAD IDEA!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Implementation details to bad actors</h2>\n<p><em>A bad actor gains access to details (but not an original idea) on how to create a harmful biological agent</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bad actor exploits this newly available information to create a weapon they did not have the knowledge or ability to create before, even though they already knew of the potential attack vector.</li>\n<li>Someone with the intent to produce a potentially-dangerous agent, but not the means or knowledge, is granted access to supplies and/or knowledge that allows them to develop a dangerous biological product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>The bad actor would not have been able to easily generate the instructions to create the harmful agent without the new source of information. As DNA synthesis &amp; lab automation technology improves, the bottleneck to the creation of a harmful agent is increasingly knowledge &amp; information rather than applied skill. Technical knowledge and precise implementation details have historically been a bottleneck for bioweapons programs, particularly terrorist or poorly-funded programs (see <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Barriers-Bioweapons-Challenges-Organization-Development/dp/0801452880/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=barriers+to+bioweapons&amp;qid=1568170252&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1\">Barriers to Bioweapons</a> by Sonia Ben Ouagrham-Gormley).</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy example:</strong> A researcher publishes the information for how to reconstruct an extinct &amp; deadly human virus. A bioterrorist or state bioweapon program uses this information to recreate the extinct virus and weaponizes it.</li>\n<li><strong>Real Example:</strong> It’s no secret that the smallpox genome is available online. It’s quite conceivable that a country could fund a program to reconstruct it from this information. It’s also not impossible that this has already happened in secret.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Implementation details to careless actors</h2>\n<p><em>A little knowledge is a dangerous thing</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Careless actors who might otherwise have had very little likelihood of creating or releasing anything particularly hazardous, gain access to methods or equipment that increase this likelihood</li>\n<li>A careful researcher offhandedly mentions a potentially-valuable line of research, which they chose not to pursue due to its potentially catastrophic downsides, which might inspire an overly-optimistic colleague to pursue it</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>Many new technologies (especially in biology) may have unintended side effects. Microscopic organisms can proliferate, and that may get out of hand if procedures are not followed carefully. Sometimes a tentative plan, which might or might not be a good idea, is perceived as a great plan by someone less familiar with its risks. The more careless actor may then take steps to implement a plan without considering the externalities.</p>\n<p>As advanced lab equipment becomes cheaper and more accessible, and as more non-academic labs open up without the highly-cautious pro-safety incentives of academia, we might expect to see more experimenters who neglect to practice appropriate safety procedures. We might even see more experimenters who fell through the cracks, and never learned these procedures in the first place. How bad a development this is depends on precisely what those labs are working on, and the quality of their self-supervision.</p>\n<p>Second-degree variant: Dangerous implementation knowledge is given to someone who is likely to distribute it, which might later result in a convergence of intent and means in a single individual, either a careless or malicious actor, who produces a dangerous biological product. Some examples of possible distributors might be a person whose job rewards the dissemination of information, or a person who chronically underestimates risks.</p>\n<p>This risk means it is important to keep in mind what incentives people have to share information, and whether that might incline them to share information hazards.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 1:</strong> A civilian hears about how CRISPR can remove viruses from cells, buys himself some tools, and injects himself with an untested DIY Herpes ‘cure.’ He doesn’t actually cure his herpes, but he does accidentally edit his germline or give himself cancer. There is a massive social backlash towards synthetic biology, and the FDA shuts down multiple scientific attempts at a Herpes cure that used superficially-similar methods but had much higher odds of success.</li>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 2:</strong> An undergrad lab assistant tests out adding a plasmid to <em>E. coli</em> for a novel protein that she heard about at a conference. She fails to note that the original paper included a few non-prominent sentences on the necessity of only transfecting varieties with a genetic kill-switch, due to a strong suspicion that this gene considerably increases the hardiness of <em>E. coli</em>. Further carelessness results in this <em>E. coli</em> getting out and multiplying outside of the lab. Eventually, this hardiness gene is picked up by a human pathogen.</li>\n<li><strong>Real Example:</strong> A biohacker, among other exploits, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/genetically-engineering-yourself-sounds-like-a-horrible-1820189351\">injected himself</a> with an agent meant to enhance muscle growth. This likely spurred others to take dangerous risks and the CEO of a biotech company ended up <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/genetically-engineering-yourself-sounds-like-a-horrible-1820189351\">injecting himself</a> with an untested herpes treatment.</li>\n<li><strong>Toy Example (Second Degree Variant):</strong> A researcher discovers a way to make Azure Death transmissible from guinea pigs to humans and tells a journalist to warn pet owners. The journalist spreads the researcher’s work, wanting to credit them for the discovery, widely spreading their methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Information vulnerable to future advances</h2>\n<p><em>Information that is not currently dangerous becomes dangerous</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Future tech could turn previously safe information into dangerous information.</li>\n<li>Technological advances or economies of scale could alter the capabilities we could reasonably expect even a low-competence actor to have access to</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>Technological progress can be difficult to predict. Sometimes there are major advances in technology that allow for new capabilities, such as rapidly sequencing and copying genomes. Could the information you share be dangerous in 5 years? 10? 100? How does this weigh against how useful the information is, or how likely it is to become public soon anyway?</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 1:</strong> After future technology makes the discovery of new and functional enzymes much easier, conceptual ideas of bioweapons that previously required highly specialized knowledge to implement are now extremely hazardous.</li>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 2:</strong> A new culturing technique makes it drastically easier and cheaper to grow not only harmless bacterial cells, but also pathogenic ones. Suddenly, a paper published on the highly-specific culturing procedures for a finicky but dangerous pathogen is useful to non-specialists.</li>\n<li><strong>Real example:</strong> The Smallpox genome was published online. Later, DNA printing became cheap and easy to use. The publishing of the smallpox genome online wasn’t particularly dangerous when it happened. Humanity hadn’t yet developed the technology to print organisms from scratch, and genetic engineering methods were much less precise. Now, access to the smallpox genome could be used by bad actors with sufficient knowhow and technology to print it and use it as a bioweapon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risk of Idea Inoculation</h2>\n<p><em>Presenting an idea causes people to dismiss risks</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presenting a bad version of a good idea can cause people to dismiss it prematurely and not take it seriously even when it’s presented in a better form</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>Trying to change norms can backfire. If the first people presenting a measure to reduce the publication of risky research are too low-prestige to be taken seriously, no effect might actually be the best-case scenario. An idea that is associated with disreputable people or hard-to-swallow arguments may itself start being treated as disreputable, and face much higher skepticism and hostility than if better, proven arguments had been presented first.</p>\n<p>This is almost the inverse of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect\">Streisand effect</a>, which appears to derive from similar psychological principles. In the case of the Streisand Effect, attempts to remove information are what catapult it into public consciousness. In the case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation_theory\">idea inoculation</a>, attempts to publicize an idea ensure that the concept is ignored or dismissed out-of-hand, with no further consideration given to it.</p>\n<p>It also connects in interesting ways with Bostrom's Schema<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-JWBpDDicX2TEh2RB3-1\" id=\"fnref-JWBpDDicX2TEh2RB3-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 1:</strong> A biohacker attempts using CRISPR to alter their genome to produce more of the hormone incredulin. It doesn’t work and they give themselves cancer. The story gets popularized in media and lawmakers prevent useful research on the uses of CRISPR.</li>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 2:</strong> An overly-enthusiastic crackpot biologist over-promises some huge advancement in the next 2 years, and ends up plastered across the media. Once he’s revealed as a fraud, suddenly no funding agencies want to touch the field even though other people in this specialty are still doing meaningful, realistic work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Some Other Risk Categories</h2>\n<p>This list is not exhaustive, and we chose to lean concrete rather than abstract.</p>\n<p>There were a few important-but-abstract risk categories that we didn’t think we could easily do justice while keeping them succinct and concrete. We felt that several were already implied in a more concrete way by the categories we did keep, but that they encompass some edge-cases that our schemas don’t capture. They at least warrant a mention and description.</p>\n<p>One is the “Risk of Increased Attention,” what Bostrom calls “Attention Hazard.” This is naturally implied by the four “ideas/actors” categories, but in fact covers a broader set of cases. A zone we focused less on are the circumstances in which even <em>useful</em> ideas, combined with <em>smart</em> actors, can eventually lead to unintuitive but catastrophic consequences if given enough attention and funding. This is best exemplified in the fears about the rate of development and investment in AI. It’s also partially exemplified in “Information vulnerable to future advances.”</p>\n<p>The other is “Information Several Inferential Distances Out Is Hazardous.” This is a superset of “Information vulnerable to future advances,” but it also encompasses cases where it’s merely a matter of extending an idea out a few further logical steps, not just technological ones.</p>\n<p>For both, we felt they partially-overlapped with the examples already given, and leaned a bit too abstract and hard-to-model for this post’s focus on concrete examples. However, we think there’s still a lot of value in these important, abstract, and complete (but harder-to-use) schemas.</p>\n<h1>Risks from Secrecy</h1>\n<p>We’ve talked above about many of the risks involved in information hazards. We take the risks of sharing information hazards seriously, and think others should as well. But in the Effective Altruist community, it has been our observation that people don’t observe the flipside of this.</p>\n<p>Conversations about risks from biology get shut down and turn into discussions of infohazards, even when the information being shared is already available. There is something to be said for not spreading information further, but shutting down the discussion of people looking for solutions also has downsides.</p>\n<p>Leaving it to the experts is not enough when there may not be a group of experts thinking and coming up with solutions. We encourage people that want to work on biorisks to think about the value and risks in sharing potentially dangerous information. Below we will go through the risks or loss of value from not sharing information.</p>\n<p>A holistic model of information sharing will include weighing both the risks and benefits of sharing information. A decision should be made having considered how the information might be used by bad or careless actors AND how valuable the information is for good actors to further research or coordinate to solve a problem.</p>\n<h2>Risk of Lost Progress</h2>\n<p><em>Closed research culture stifles innovation</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignorance is the default outcome. If secretiveness ensures that nothing is added to the knowledge and work of a field, beneficial progress is unlikely to be made.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>Good actors need information to develop useful countermeasures. In a world where researchers cannot communicate their ideas with each other it makes model generation more difficult and reduces the ability of the field to build up good defensive systems.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 1:</strong> New information is learned about a recently-discovered virus, which indicate it is more dangerous and has greater pandemic potential than originally thought. This information is not shared on the grounds that it could inspire others to weaponize it. As a result, lab safety procedures for working with the virus are not updated.</li>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 2:</strong> Vaccines are not produced because researchers don’t have access to information about dangerous organisms.</li>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 3:</strong> A dangerous scenario is never discussed among good actors avoiding infohazards. Bad actors don’t avoid thinking about infohazards, so they create novel bioweapons that could have been prepared for if a discussion had occurred.</li>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 4:</strong> The public is unaware of risks, so politicians don’t fund programs that develop critical infrastructure towards defending against pathogens (see US gov defunding programs like the USDA).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dangerous work is not stopped</h2>\n<p><em>Information is not shared, so risky work is not stopped</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Areas with stronger privacy norms, such as industry, may have incentives to hide details about their work. If the risks associated with a particular project are not open information, these risks may be missed or ignored by others engaging in the same work.</li>\n<li>If a high standard of secrecy is maintained by labs by default, it can be hard for governmental or academic oversight to notice which labs should receive more oversight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>Some fields of research are dangerous, or may eventually become dangerous. It is much harder to prevent a class of research if the dangers posed by that research cannot be discussed publicly.</p>\n<p>Informal social checks on the standards or behavior of others seems to serve an important, and often underestimated, function as a monitoring and reporting system against unethical or unsafe behaviors. It can be easy to underestimate how much the objections of a friend can shift the way you view the safety of your research, as they may bring up a concern you didn’t even think to ask about.</p>\n<p>There are also entities with a mandate to do formal checks, and it is dangerous if they are left in the dark. Work environments, labs, or even entire fields can develop their own unusual work cultures. Sometimes, these cultures systematically undervalue a type of risk because of its disproportionate benefits to them, even if the general populace would have objections. Law enforcement, lawmakers, public discussion, reporting, and entities like ethical review boards are intended to intervene in these sorts of cases, but have no way to do so if they never hear about a problem.</p>\n<p>Each of these entities have their strengths and weaknesses, but a world without whistleblowers, or one where no one can access anyone capable of changing these environments, is likely to be a more dangerous world.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy Example:</strong> An academic decides not to publish a paper about the risks of researching a particular strain of bacteria due to high rates of escape from seemingly quarantined labs. Researchers elsewhere begin research on the bacteria, but with lax containment because they were unaware of the risks.</li>\n<li><strong>Real Almost-Example:</strong> In 1972 -a year before the Asilomar Conference- grad student Janet Metz mentioned to other grad students that her lab might try to use a virus to put bacterial DNA into mammalian cells. Pollack told Berg (her supervisor) he should “put genes into a phage that doesn't grow in a bug that grows in your gut,” and reminded him that SV40 is a small-animal tumor virus that transforms human cells in culture and makes them look like tumor cells. Prior to that discussion, her lab had not fully thought through the potential dangerous implications of that research.</li>\n<li><strong>Real Example:</strong> The true source of the Rajneeshee Salmonella poisonings was only uncovered when a leader of the cult publicly expressed concern about the behavior of one of its members, and explicitly requested an investigation into their laboratory.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risk of Information Siloing</h2>\n<p><em>Siloing information leaves individual workers blind to the overall goal accomplished</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can be more difficult to prevent harm when the systems capable of producing it are not well understood by the participants. If you have processes of production or research where labor is specialized and distributed, moral actors may not notice when they are producing something harmful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>Lab work seems to be increasingly getting automated, or outsourced piecemeal. At the same time, the biotechnology industry has an incentive to be secretive with any pre-patent information they uncover. Without additional precautions being taken, secretive assembly-line-esque offerings increase the likelihood that someone could order a series of steps that look harmless in isolation, but create something dangerous when combined.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 1:</strong> A platform outsources lab work while granting buyers a high degree of privacy. No individual worker in the assembly line was able to piece together that they were producing a dangerous biological agent until it had already been produced and released.</li>\n<li><strong>Toy Example 2:</strong> Diagnosis of novel diseases takes longer because knowledge of diseases was hidden.</li>\n<li><strong>Real Example 1:</strong> Researchers put together a bird flu that was airborne and killed ferrets. They didn’t create any mutations that didn’t exist in the wild already, they just put them together in a way that nature hadn’t yet, but could happen naturally through recombination. American and Dutch governments banned publication of papers with their methods. Had they been allowed to publish their research, it could have given other scientists more information with which to develop a vaccine. Americans have since reversed their decision on the ban.</li>\n<li><strong>Real Example 2:</strong> The Guardian successfully ordered part of the smallpox genome to a residential address from a bioprinting company.</li>\n<li><strong>Real Example 3:</strong> A DOD lab accidentally sent weapons grade anthrax to many labs. The CDC and other orgs have made similar mistakes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Barriers to Funding and New Talent</h2>\n<p><em>Talented people don’t go into seemingly empty or underfunded fields</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A culture of secrecy can serve as a stumbling-block for early-career researchers interested in entering a field. It can make it more challenging to locate information, funding, and aligned mentors, and these can serve to deter people who might otherwise be interested in making a career solving an important problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>While many researchers and policy makers work in biosecurity, there is a shortage of talent applied to longer term and more extreme biosecurity problems. There have been only limited efforts to successfully attract top talent to this nascent field.</p>\n<p>This may be changing. The Open Philanthropy Project has begun <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants\">funding projects</a> focused on Global Catastrophic Biorisk, and has provided funding for many individuals beginning their careers in the field of biosecurity.</p>\n<p>Policies that require a lot of oversight or add on procedures that increase the cost of doing research cause there to be fewer opportunities for people who want to make a positive difference.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy Example:</strong> A talented biology graduate looks at EA discussions and notices a lack of engagement with the most important biosecurity risks for the far future. They decide the EA community isn’t taking far future concerns seriously and apply their skills elsewhere.</li>\n<li><strong>Real Example:</strong> Labs opt out of valuable pathogen research because regulations increase operating costs and time costs of workers (Wurtz, <em>et al</em>). This leads to fewer places to learn and fewer job opportunities for people that want to prevent harmful pathogens.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Streisand Effect</h2>\n<p><em>Suppressing information can cause it to spread</em></p>\n<p>Some ways this could manifest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attempting to suppress information can sometimes cause information to spread further than it would have otherwise. Many people’s response to even well-advised attempts at information suppression is to directly or indirectly increase the visibility of the event by discussing it or spreading the underlying information itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why might this be important?</em></p>\n<p>The Streisand effect is named after an incident where attempts to have photographs taken down led to a media spotlight and widespread discussion of those same photos. The photos had previously been posted in a context where only 1 or 2 people had taken enough of an interest to access it.</p>\n<p>Something analogous could very easily happen with a paper outlining something hazardous in a research journal, or with an online discussion. The audience may have originally been quite targeted simply due to the nicheness or the obscurity of its original context. But an attempt at calling for intervention leads to a public discussion, which spreads the original information. This could be viewed as one of the possible negative outcomes of poorly-targeted whistleblowing.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the section on idea inoculation, this effect is functionally idea inoculation’s inverse and is based on similar principles.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toy example:</strong> An online discussion group has policies for handling information that some view as overly restrictive. The frustrated people start a new online discussion group with overly-permissive infohazard guidelines.</li>\n<li><strong>Real Examples of the Streisand effect:</strong> Barbra Streisand’s attempts to remove photos of her seaside mansion from a large database of California coastline photos catapulted said photograph to fame. See also: The Roko’s Basilisk Incident, “Why the Lucky Stiff”’s Infosuicide</li>\n<li><strong>Real Bio Examples of the Streisand effect:</strong> In all likelihood, more people know that the smallpox genome is/was public due to the attempts to suppress it than from organic searches. Relatedly, some dangerous people might have assumed that printed DNA was carefully and successfully monitored if there weren’t so many articles about how sometimes it’s <em>not</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Overall, we think biosecurity in the context of catastrophic risks has been underfunded and underdiscussed. There has been positive development in the time since we started on this paper; the Open Philanthropy Project is aware of funding problems in the realm of biosecurity and has been <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants\">funding a variety of projects</a> to make progress on biosecurity.</p>\n<p>It can be difficult to know where to start helping in biosecurity. In the EA community, we have the desire to weigh the costs and benefits of philanthropic actions, but that is made more difficult in biosecurity by the need for secrecy.</p>\n<p>We hope we’ve given you a place to start and factors to weigh when deciding to share or not share a particular piece of information in the realm of biosecurity. We think the EA community has sometimes erred too much on the side of shutting down discussions of biology by turning them into discussions about infohazards. It’s possible EA is being left out of conversations and decision making processes that could benefit from an EA perspective. We’d like to see collaborative discussion aimed towards possible actions or improvements in biosecurity with risks and benefits of the information considered, but not the central point of the conversation.</p>\n<p>It’s a big world with many problems to focus on. If you prefer to focus your efforts elsewhere, feel free to do so. But if you do choose to engage with biosecurity, we hope you can weigh risks appropriately and choose the conversations that will lead to many talented collaborators and a world safer from biological risks.</p>\n<h3>Catalyst Biosummit</h3>\n<p>By the way, the authors are part of the organizing team for the <a href=\"https://catalystbiosummit.com/\">Catalyst Biosecurity Summit</a>.

    "htmlBody": "<p>For just about any academic field F and number X greater than ~100, there are <em>a lot </em>more F researchers than there were X years ago, and this remains true if you restrict to researchers above a given level of quality/competence Q.</p><p>This observation seems pretty straightforward/uncontroversial to me, and yet it has quite a few consequences that seem quite nontrivial. Before getting to those, allow me to explain the claim in more detail.</p><h1>The Claim</h1><p>For concreteness, let's let F be \"maths\" and let X be \"519\".</p><p>Well, the world population is about 15 times what it was in the year 1500, therefore there's 15 times as many researchers (at any given level of quality). Right?</p><p>Of course not. Let's go through what's wrong with that.</p><p>Most notably, pretty much all the mathematicians who were doing cutting-edge research in 1500 lived in Europe. Today, they almost all live in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, and some other small developed countries. Every now and then a prodigy like Ramanujan comes along, but by and large, the developing world does not have the economic/pedagogical/cultural means to raise many of these, or even \"discover\" them when they do come along, so I will round these off.</p><p>The point is, we should be comparing the population of Europe in 1500 to the combined current population of all those regions that have the infrastructure to reliably pump out mathematicians today.</p><p>Population of Europe in 1500: 88,000,000</p><p>Population of Europe, US, CA, AU, JP in 1998: 1,280,000,000</p><p>...which gives us a quotient of 1280/91 ~= 14.54. I will round this up to account for the \"other small developed countries\" and also the fact that talented 3rd world prodigies occasionally make their way in academia in a way that wasn't possible in 1500. So by our reasoning so far, the talent pool of researchers has grown by a factor of <strong>15</strong> in that time. But a few more corrections are still in order.</p><p>One consideration is whether, due to better nutrition, schooling, economic conditions, etc., the average person in the developed world today is actually smarter than the average European in 1500. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect\">Flynn effect</a> is the observation that average IQ scores have risen substantially (over 10 points) in the past century, but it is controversial whether this represents a real gain in intelligence or test-taking familiarity (or, of course, a combination of these). If the former, our factor of 14 goes into the triple digits (especially if one sets the quality bar Q high). But I don't feel like reading up enough to take a stance on this, so I'll be conservative and assume the null hypothesis. The point is, there's no reason to believe people today are innately \"dumber\".</p><p>The other point is, we've so far focused just on the talent pool, rather than who's <em>actually</em> doing math research full-time, now and then. It seems likely to me that on a per capita basis, there are many more math researchers now than then, considering the academic infrastructure we have today. This raises the question of how the average researcher quality used to be. There are essentially two models one can have of how someone becomes a math researcher in 1500:</p><p>a) Because they had all 3 of intellect, interest in math research, and the means to support themselves (via personal wealth or benefactors).</p><p>b) Because they truly were the crème de la crème of their time</p><p>Personally, I find (a) more plausible: if you were an aristocrat with a passion for mathematics, then probably that's what you'll do with your time as long as you had the requisite amount of intellect, on par with any math undergrad/grad today. If you were middle class, then probably you'd have to find a benefactor and this process would be correlated at least somewhat with talent. But if you were socially awkward, or a peasant, then your prospects would seem bleak, so ultimately I suspect this would be far less meritocratic than our current system. Unfortunately, this would take some tedious research to sort out, and I have no idea how I'd quantify the results. Also, I'm not <em>positive</em> there's proportionally more researchers now than then, so I'll be conservative again and assume the null.</p><p>I've just given a couple ways our factor could be significantly <em>greater </em>than 14, but I see no good reason why the number would be <em>less</em> than 14.</p><p>If F is a field besides maths, the same conclusions seem to apply as far as I can tell, except perhaps more strongly (e.g. more developing countries around the world today produce top artists/poets/musicians, even though the best were largely restricted to Europe in 1500).</p><p>If we let X vary, this does change the picture. For instance, if we are comparing to Europe up to 1700, the factor remains above 10. By 1800, other countries such as the US enter the picture, but even 100 years ago we still have a factor of 2.</p><h1>Some Consequences: How Good Were \"The Greats\"?</h1><p>If we are inclined to say that Newton was the greatest physicist of his century, then the world should have produced about 10 physicists of his caliber in the past century (well, more like 5-10, since the OECD population a century ago was half what it is now). So:</p><p>a) Pick your 10 best physicists who did most of their work 1920-2019. If they'd been born in Newton's place, they'd have done just as well in advancing physics (pinning down the exact counterfactual is tricky, but \"you know what I mean\").</p><p>b) Pick the #1 physicist of this decade. Let's say for concreteness, Kip Thorne. He'd also do just as well.</p><p>c) Pick the #1 physicist of the past century, say, its Niels Bohr. He'd do even <em>better</em>.</p><p>d) If Newton grew up today, he'd probably win a Nobel, but \"Newton\" would be about as much of a household name as \"Thorne\" (and less than \"Bohr\").</p><p>This game is even more amusing to play in other fields:</p><p>If we are inclined to say that Shakespeare was the greatest poet of his century, then in expectation, the world should have produced someone equal to his ability in this <em>decade</em>. So let's take the best poet of this decade. I dunno how to actually do this, but  of the last 10 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Literature\">Nobel Laureates in literature</a>, apparently 3 do poetry. Now take max{Herta Müller, Tomas Tranströmer, Bob Dylan}, and that person should be as good a poet as Shakespeare...</p><p>I notice I'm confused. Or more accurately, I notice I've derived a weird conclusion from seemingly valid reasoning and anodyne premises. It's probably worth examining in more detail.</p><p>I assumed that a population of ~100 million people should produce a Shakespeare every century on average. One could argue that Shakespeare was even more special than that, and if one \"reran the simulation\" of Renaissance Europe a few times with different \"random seeds\", then we wouldn't get another Shakespeare equivalent. This seems believable up to a point, depending on how much one is willing to argue for Shakespeare being significantly better than anyone before or since. But then we can make the same argument on Goethe, Poe, or Whitman, and then one can no longer credibly argue for Goethe-, Poe-, or Whitman-exceptionalism. At some point, the outside view of \"how strange that most of the best people <em>just happened</em> to be among the first to have lived chronologically\" kicks in.</p><p>It could also be objected that maybe we <em>are</em> \"dumber\" now in literature. The only plausible ways I see this happening:</p><p>a) Literature used to be a more central part of culture/education than today</p><p>b) Living in that time gave Shakespeare and other authors more colorful experiences to inform their writing. Or at least, they seem more interesting to us than fiction based on modern society.</p><p>Lastly, one could object to my assertion that max{Herta Müller, Tomas Tranströmer, Bob Dylan} is the best poet of the decade (or <em>some</em> recent decade, since Nobels are usually awarded pretty late in one's career). For one thing, one could argue that the best poet of a given decade won't be that likely to win a Nobel. This could be the case (I have no idea), but then the question becomes <em>why</em> the field is unable to recognize its top performers. Maybe the Nobel committee is idiosyncratically bad but I'm not sure what else there is to go on (book sales seems worse). I'm sure there's also an amount of \"intellectuals in any field are hard to appraise while they're alive, so their contemporaries (rationally) err on the side of not lionizing them too highly\".</p><p>(I am curious if people find the Thorne ~= Newton conclusion less or more controversial as Tranströmer ~= Shakespeare?)</p><h1>Further Notes on Data Sources, and Another Calculation</h1><p>For the population of Europe at different centuries, I used <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Europe#Population_of_Western_and_Eastern_Europe_and_Former_USSR,_0%E2%80%931998_A.D\">this table</a> (which ends at 1998), manually adding up the 3 subtotals. Note this includes European Russia, even though I don't <em>think</em> Russia was producing many intellectuals until ~1700s, but that's just a guess. So besides the Flynn effect and increased meritocracy, this is a third way that my estimate of the increase of researcher quality are potentially conservative. Maybe the region we should've started with in 1500 was non-Russian Europe, or even just \"Western Europe\": the UK, France, the Low Countries, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Denmark, and Poland (because Copernicus). Let's see what happens when we do this:</p><p>Population of \"Western Europe\" in 1500: 51,000,000</p><p>Population of \"Western Europe\" in 1998: 342,000,000</p><p>And then we only get a factor of 342/51 ~= 6.7. But if we are inclined to say that the US, Canada, and Australia are now doing about as good as \"Western Europe\" in per capita researcher production, then we get a population of roughly 700 million, for a factor of 14. And then there are other places that certainly add to the quantity, but I'm not convinced they're on par with \"Western Europe\" in per capita terms: Japan, Korea, Russia, eastern Europe, etc. It seems roughly correct to me to say that ~1/3 of the world's researchers were born/raised in \"Western Europe\", ~1/3 in the US, and ~1/3 in the rest of the world. This would push our factor up to ~20.</p><p>Of course this factor declines as the centuries pass after 1500, in a way that would have to be quantified on a case-by-case basis. It's worth noting, though, that even though Western Europe's population has less than doubled since 1900, the US population has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_the_United_States\">more than quadrupled</a>.</p><p>For those interested in such calculations, here's another which is tedious to do but whose result which be interesting to look at:</p><p>Most lists of the best physicists, or best authors, or anything in between, almost entirely contain people from over 100 years ago. If, for example, you have a list of the <em>n</em> best physicists, the chance that all of them <em>just happened</em> to live among the first <em>p</em> proportion of people to live since physics became its own field is p^n. For instance, suppose you have a purported list of the top 10 physicists, and all of them were born before 1900. Let's say \"physics\" became a thing around 1500, and that a physicist would have to be born before 1970 to be recognized today. Then one would have to calculate the \"area under the curve\" to find the number of people born 1500-1900, and the number of people born 1500-1970, and then <em>p</em> is the quotient of these. If <em>p</em> is, say, 0.7, then .7^10 ~= .028, which is sufficient for us to reject the null hypothesis that the list is not biased against modern physicists. Actually calculating <em>p</em> would take some work though.</p><p>Also, there is the issue of finding the actual number of <em>researchers</em> in centuries past, rather than making inferences based on the talent pool or the top-end as I've done in this post. Currently, I welcome suggestions for how to estimate this number and/or how it has increased over time.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>The \"paradox of tolerance\" is a continually hot topic, but I've not seen it framed as a member in a category of fallacies where a principle is conceptualized as either absolute or hypocritical and the absolute conception then rejected as self-contradictory or incoherent. Other examples of commonly absolutized principles are pacifism, pluralism, humility, openness, specific kinds of freedoms, etc.<br><br>I've been provisionally calling it the 'false self-contradiction fallacy', meaning a specialized case of black-and-white fallacy as applied to ethical, moral or practical principles by presuming a false dichotomy between the principle being either absolute or hypocritical. The presumption is based on a shallow conception of the principle that excludes the deeper grounding principles that would allow integrating restrictions on the principle. The fallacy banks on the popular intuitions of justice needing to be blind and the universality of human rights and presumes limits to a principle to be arbitrary or unjustified.<br><br>Deeper conceptions of principles are able to integrate critical rejection; for example, in the case of tolerance, it can integrate the self-preservation of the principle by conditioning it on reciprocity. Tolerance in this case is not valuable in itself but as a higher-order expression of avoiding conflict escalation, achieving intellectual plurality, etc.<br><br>Absolute pacifism may be the most clear example of the fallacy, since most people understand that, to be coherent, pacifism must assign a high negative value to violence as a conflict-solving approach and positive value to alternative approaches, but that violence is still kept as the last resort, since the other approaches can't always work.<br><br>I find 'false self-contradictions' especially pernicious in their rhetorical persuasiveness and their consequent wide application in promoting moral relativism and getting around inconvenient principles. I'm really interested in finding existing discourse that would take a similar angle, and generally in mainstreaming awareness of this specific kind of fallacious argumentation.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Chances are you've heard about speed reading. A magical technique that allows you to glance at a page of text and immediately extract all of its meaning. But after digging deeper and trying the techniques yourself, you realized that it does not seem to work for you. You may even feel guilty about not being able to read fast enough. After all, if there is a way to read 10,000 words per minute, are you not wasting a lot of time? I was in a similar position myself not too long ago.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I decided to build my own framework for reading. I collected some bits and pieces from various sources, added my own insights to it -- and voilà! You can read the result here.</p>\n<p>The good news is: Once you understand some basic facts and have the right terminology, the mystery around it fades away. What is left are a few practical and useful techniques that help you optimize your reading.</p>\n<h2>The basics</h2>\n<p>A <strong>fixation point</strong> is a point that your eyes fixate on. Every time you look at something intently, you are placing your eyes on an imaginary point. It could be on the lamp on your desk, on the nose of your conversation partner or on the title of a book lying in front of you.</p>\n<p>The <strong>fixation area</strong> is the area around a fixation point that you can still see and extract information from -- without directly focusing on it. In other words, it is everything that you can see without moving your eyes. It can be approximated by a round shape. This should not be confused with peripheral vision, which refers to the outmost parts of your entire field of view. The fixation area only refers to the periphery of a single fixation point.</p>\n<p>A <strong>saccade</strong> is a single atomic eye movement, going from one fixation point to another. Of course, the fixation area is also changed through that movement. We tend to believe that our eyes move continuously, when in fact, they make short and discrete movements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://limerott.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fixation-point.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now, let's apply these basic concepts to reading.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is impossible to read a word or sentence without ever having seen it <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-1\" id=\"fnref-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-1\">[1]</a></sup>. Therefore, to read something in full, each word must have appeared in a fixation area at least once. Since each additional fixation point takes time, we look for a method that minimizes them while still covering the entire text. If we also assume that we read from left to right and leave no gaps, there aren't many options left.</p>\n<p>We end up with the following standard reading method:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read from left to right, placing 2-3 fixation points per line</li>\n<li>Don't go back in the text (avoid regression)</li>\n<li>Place the fixation points in a way that exploits the fixation areas as much as possible</li>\n<li>In particular, don't place them on the outer edges of the text, but indent them a few centimeters (for example, on the third and third-to-last word)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://limerott.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/page.png\" alt=\"Standard reading method\"></p>\n<p>This concludes our take on the foundation of reading. All other reading methods are based on this standard method.</p>\n<h2>It's not about speed</h2>\n<p>Numbers are tempting, especially if they are indicators of intelligence. We all know that those who read are intelligent. So those who read very quickly must be very intelligent, right? Unfortunately, numbers can also be misguiding.</p>\n<p>After all, reading something quickly does not imply that you understood the material or that you will retain it. Reading speed is a nominal value -- it is useless without putting in into proper context. If you gave somebody a boring book to read, he will claim to have read it in no time. His reading speed will be through the roof. But it is doubtful that it has brought him much use.</p>\n<p>Instead of optimizing reading <em>speed</em>, we should optimize reading itself, i.e. the extraction of meaning from text. Sometimes this means to read faster and sometimes to read slower. <strong>The main way to accomplish that is to remove the mechanical barriers that keep you from reading as fast as you could.</strong> This is what proper reading should be about and this is also the goal of the method outlined above. Once you've mastered it, the mechanics of reading will step into the background and your focus will shift to extracting and processing meaning <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-2\" id=\"fnref-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-2\">[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<h2>Thinking speed: A natural limit</h2>\n<p>Your reading speed is upper bounded by your thinking speed. You can see reading as thinking by proxy, whereby you reproduce an author's thoughts in your mind. But if reading is merely a form of thinking, then it must be bounded by the same limits as thinking.</p>\n<p>What are the limits of thinking speed? This is hard to determine, but I suggest to do an experiment: How fast can somebody talk for him still to be intelligible? Auctioneers talk at about 250 wpm. If you listen to a podcast at 3-4x the normal speed, you will still understand most of it. So, thinking speed is a multiple of normal talking speed (at about 150 wpm), but it is still within one order of magnitude.</p>\n<p>There is no magical sauce that allows you to circumvent this barrier. People who claim to read faster than that are skimming the text rather than reading all of it (see fragmented reading below).</p>\n<p>Regardless of your actual thinking speed, the ultimate goal is to get your reading speed as close to it as possible. Because that is all you can do anyway. <strong>Good reading is about removing barriers that keep you from reading at the speed of thought.</strong> Once you understand that, you understand speed reading.</p>\n<h2>Voice and visual reading</h2>\n<p>While learning and experimenting with reading, one insight was particularly shocking to me: <strong>There are two separate and very distinct ways how to read. Both of them are useful in different contextes.</strong></p>\n<p>The first one, <strong>voice reading</strong>, refers to a mode of reading where you pronounce words out loud in your head. It is as though you are both creating and parsing a conversation that takes place only in your mind. This is how most people read.</p>\n<p>The second one is <strong>visual reading</strong>, where the meaning is directly extracted from the visual perception of written text. The words are not pronounced, but directly understood.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the mechanics of reading as outlined above stay the same for both modes. The only thing that changes is the method you use to turn words into meaning. This is also why shifting between these two modes is so subtle.</p>\n<p><strong>Subvocalization</strong> is the internal speech typically produced when reading. You can characterize voice and visual reading by the degree to which they use subvocalization. Research suggests that it is impossible to shut it down entirely, but it can be significantly reduced, which allows you to do more visual and less voice reading. This ultimately results in a higher reading speed.</p>\n<p>There may be concerns about whether visual reading really exists. I want to argue that not only does it exist, but it is the primary way in which we navigate daily life. When you enter an office and see a chair, you don't say to yourself \"This is a chair\", but recognize it as such and move on. If you see a sign in traffic, you don't say to yourself \"I have the right of way\", but you <em>simply know</em> that and then act on it. This means that you have been doing plenty of visual reading all along (just not with books)!</p>\n<p>The problem with visual reading is that is not how we have been conditioned to read. Words -- unlike traffic signs -- are typically spoken out loud, so we tend to do the same with written words. This results in subvocalization. Fortunately, this conditioning can be untrained to a large extent.</p>\n<p>A little caveat: Even when you are doing visual reading, it still may be that you hear a small voice in the background. But the words are all scrambled up and only part of the text is read. Subvocalization is so deeply conditioned in ourselves that it is quite hard to get rid of it entirely. However, as long as you are not <em>focused</em> on these voices as your source of meaning, it should be fine.</p>\n<p>According to most speed reading literature, voice reading is an inferior mode of reading. Also, subvocalization needs to be suppressed at all costs. But this is a fatal misconception. It is a knee-jerk reaction to think that the faster method is automatically the better. In reality, there are many situations in which voice reading is the favorable method -- or is even indispensable. I will outline some of them here.</p>\n<p>The clearest example is poetry: It is a form of art whose expression of beauty is fundamentally dependent on the way that the verses are pronounced. You cannot speed read (here: visual read) poetry. It was only when I understood the distinction between voice reading and visual reading that I understood the appeal of poems. Until then, entering this world was impossible for me.</p>\n<p>For humans, the meaning of text is intertwined with how it sounds. Powerful messages sound right, in that they produce exactly the right echo in the reader's mind. This is why the choice of words matters so much. When you read visually, your focus is on the visual image of the words rather than the sound. This means that you miss the deep emotional effect it produces. For that to happen, you have to read slowly -- to allow the sound of the words penetrate your soul.</p>\n<p>If you are a writer and you want to assess the quality of a text you've written, you will be forced to use voice reading. It is the only way to truly <em>feel</em> a piece of text. It is only then that you know whether the text really creates the impression that you want it to have. However, if your goal is to simply recall the content of a longer text you've written, then visual reading is the better option.</p>\n<p>If you edit a piece of text and use visual-reading, you won't notice that a word is missing since you have trained yourself to look over grammatical constructs, as they don't add much to the meaning of the text.</p>\n<p>Comprehension is another issue. If you voice read a text, you typically pronounce every single word. Also, it is slower, giving your mind more time to process the information. Also, as stated before, meaning is intertwined with sound, so pronouncing words should produce a deeper meaning. Pronouncing the words also may aid in memory, as we typically retain better what we have heard (rather than merely understood).</p>\n<p>So, voice reading is not inferior, but <em>different</em>. And consequently, it is used for different purposes.</p>\n<p>How do you choose which one to use? A good rule of thumb is<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-3\" id=\"fnref-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-3\">[3]</a></sup>: <strong>Visual reading is about information, voice reading about emotion.</strong> In visual reading, you are focused on the sheer informational value of the text. In voice reading, you are focused on how the text feels. If you only ever do visual reading, you deprive yourself of a lot of meaning and enjoyment for the sake of efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Full and fragmented reading</h2>\n<p><strong>There is no need to read the entire text to understand it</strong>. This is another major insight that helped me improve my reading. This also motivates another distinction: full reading and fragmented reading.</p>\n<p><strong>Full reading</strong> is reading the entire text, word by word, without skipping or jumping over any parts of it. Most often, this is done using voice reading and by pronouncing every word. But visual reading is also possible. This is the appropriate mode for all situations that require full comprehension: technical documents, dense textbooks, problem descriptions to name a few.</p>\n<p>The standard method that is described above is a form of full reading, as we required each word to appear once in a fixation area.</p>\n<p><strong>Fragmented reading</strong> takes a different approach: instead of reading the full text, you only read fragments of it. For this to be useful, these fragments have to be chosen strategically. One approach is to only read the first sentence of each paragraph. Another approach is to focus on the central words within a text, i.e. those that provide the most meaning (or bang for the buck). This means skipping grammatical constructs such as \"a\" and \"the\" entirely.</p>\n<p>In terms of the terminology we introduced earlier, fragmented reading means to place fewer fixation points on the text than would be necessary for full reading. But as long as they are well placed, this is not a problem.</p>\n<p>You may ask: If you don't read the entire text, how are you supposed to understand it? I bet that if I gave you a collection of words, you would be able to derive the story behind them. Try it yourself: \"mom\", \"video games\", \"education\", \"son\", \"autism\". Since we already have a lot of background information on each fragment and know how they are related, there is only one line of interpretation that makes sense.</p>\n<p>The key here is to acknowledge that you are puzzling together pieces. This means that, to some degree, you are simply <em>guessing</em> what the text is about. Depending on the text and the amount of background information you have, this can work very well. But it is certainly a psychological barrier to be overcome, as we have been conditioned to read everything in full.</p>\n<p>The more background information you have, the easier it is to attain higher speeds. In fiction in particular, there is a set of common tropes that get repeated across books. If you know them, you will understand what the book is about without reading all the details.</p>\n<p>There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-4\" id=\"fnref-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-4\">[4]</a></sup>. If you want higher speed, you need to be prepared give up accuracy.</p>\n<p>The transition between full and fragmented reading is fluid. You can always decide to use fewer or more fixation points, leading to a more fragmented or a fuller type of reading. The fact that we <em>don't</em> have two strictly distinct types of reading is a testament to the flexibility of this framework. Also, it is often unclear whether you are reading in full at a very high speed or already doing fragmented reading. In practice, though, these distinctions are not important as long as you manage to adapt your reading mode to the material at hand.</p>\n<p>A lot of speed reading literature glorifies fragmented reading as the one-true-way of reading. But to make this clear: In many cases, fragmented reading simply is completely inappropriate. Not reading a math problem in full is a terrible idea. You wouldn't want to go to a doctor who reads your clinical history in a fragmented way. Nor would you do that with a dense technical document of a device you are trying to repair. Whenever a text is packed with information or if every bit of information is crucial, full reading should be used instead.</p>\n<p>At this point, we can use our terminology to state what most books on speed reading actually <em>mean</em> by this term. It is very blurry because it is used in many different ways, without ever making the underlying distinctions clear. Sometimes it refers to fast reading in general, sometimes to intelligent skimming and sometimes to visual reading as opposed to voice reading. Using the above terminology, we can clear this up and <em>hopefully</em> never have to use that dreadful term again. The definition of most books most likely is this: <strong>speed reading = visual reading + fragmented reading + maximize fixation area</strong>. This is certainly faster than voice reading + full reading (or: slow reading), but, as we have seen, there are many situations in which it is not applicable!</p>\n<h2>How to read? It depends</h2>\n<p>If you adhere to a rigid system, your performance will suffer. Trying to read poetry using visual reading or applying fragmented reading on a doctor's note will lead you nowhere. You have to read flexibly and be prepared to switch from one mode to the other instantly. In particular, you have to acknowledge that <strong>different reading tasks require different reading modes</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are many factors that play a role: If you are sleepy, it is unlikely that you will be able to process information quickly -- so, choose voice reading instead. If you are interested in a single piece of information, but are looking at a very long document, then full reading would be a waste of time and you should switch to (very) fragmented reading. If you want to deeply understand a quote, you should read it using full reading + voice reading.</p>\n<p>The mechanics of reading should also be kept flexible. Say that you chose a method where you use two fixation points for each line (both slightly indented). What do you do on the last line of a paragraph that may only contain three words (the rest of the line is blank). Do you force yourself to place another fixation point on the blank space, just to enforce your method? Or do you break the rules and make a vertical saccade to the beginning of the next paragraph? The answer is: First of all, don't use unnecessary fixation points only to follow some rule. Second, it depends on the text you are reading. There is no single valid way to transition from one paragraph to the next. But as of now, you should have the tools to figure this out for yourself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-5\" id=\"fnref-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-5\">[5]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The optimal strategy will always be some <em>mixture</em> of all techniques. In many scenarios, a good strategy is the following: First skim through the text to get a rough idea of its content, identify the parts that interest you the most and then read them in full. This is a combination of fragmented reading and full reading.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right reading mode is a matter of experience. After experimenting with different ways to read (and remember, they are <em>all</em> valid ways of reading), you should grow more and more confident in your ability to choose the right one for the job.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Since most of us are reading all the time, trying to improve it is a worthwhile investment. The problem is that there is a bewildering amount of material on this topic -- and a lot of it is of dubious quality. Here, I tried to present a realistic and down-to-earth approach, as well as introduce some key distinctions that help to think about this topic.</p>\n<p>This approach can be summarized like this: There is no one-size-fits-all solution. There is no magic trick that allows super-human reading speed. And that's fine. After all, all we really need is to get rid of the barriers that keep us from reading at human-level speed!</p>\n<p>We have only touched on the mechanical aspect of reading. There are more advanced questions such as choosing between different strategies to read a book. But with this framework, I am giving you the trunk of the tree. It is up to you to fill up the branches.</p>\n<p>Why does reading have to be so complicated? Why can't we simply read naturally? Unfortunately, our brains were not designed to read. And since this ability is not built-in, we need to use what we have to work around that. The concepts presented here make reading slightly more complicated, but they also help remove the barriers that keep you from proper reading. Which, in turn, makes reading easier! And after gaining some experience with them, they will feel natural, too.</p>\n<p>The first time I stumbled upon speed reading was in high school. But the materials I studied contained too much mumbo-jumbo for my taste. Also, trying their techniques rapidly reduced my rate of comprehension, which was very discouraging. I put the topic aside and came back to it only many years later. After some reflection, I finally understood the key ideas behind good reading and started applying them. This was the first time that I was truly satisfied with how I read.</p>\n<p>I hope the ideas in this guide are as useful to you as they were to me.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>I am stating such obvious facts because many books I have read on this topic don't. <a href=\"#fnref-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-BhgaxcG24r45g6jB2-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This is analogous to the vim or emacs editors.

This paper explores this idea in the context of deep reinforcement learning. In their grid-world environment, two agents move around and pick up lemons or plums. The principal is penalized for moving, but is the only one who knows whether plums or lemons should be picked up. The authors hypothesize that simply by jointly training the two agents to maximize rewards, they will automatically learn to interact in order for the assistant to learn the task, rather than requiring an explicit mechanism like comparisons or demonstrations.</p><p>Recurrent Q-networks are used for the agents, which are then trained via deep Q-learning. The authors run several experiments that show emergent interaction. In the first experiment, when the principal is penalized for moving it learns to demonstrate the task to the assistant, and then let the assistant finish the job. In the second experiment, when the assistant has a restricted field of view, it learns to follow the principal to see what it does, until it can infer whether the principal wants plums or lemons. In the third, they tell the assistant the task 50% of the time, and so the principal is initially unsure whether the agent needs any direction (and due to the motion cost, the principal would rather not do anything). When the agent knows the task, it performs it. When the agent doesn&#x27;t know the task, it moves closer to the principal, in effect &quot;asking&quot; what the reward is, and the principal moves until it can see the object, and then &quot;answers&quot; by either moving towards the object (if it should be collected) or doing nothing (if not). Finally, the authors run an experiment using pixels as input. While they had to switch to dueling DQNs instead of vanilla DQNs, they show that the joint reward is competitive with the grid approach. They also run an experiment with human principals and show that the human/assistant pair outperforms the solo-human setup.</p><p><strong>Zach&#x27;s opinion:</strong> Overall, I found the idea expressed in this paper to be well-articulated. While I think that the grid-world environment is a bit simplistic, their results are interesting. Being able to learn intent in an online manner is an important problem to solve if we’re interested in robust collaboration between humans and autonomous agents. However, the authors point out that training on pixel input fails in the majority of cases, 64% of the time, which raises concerns about how well the method would generalize to non-trivial environments.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I&#x27;m excited that the ideas from <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\">CIRL</a></u> are making their way to deep RL. Ultimately I expect we&#x27;ll want an agent that takes all of its sensory data as evidence about &quot;what the human wants&quot;, rather than relying on a special reward channel, or a special type of data called &quot;comparisons&quot; or &quot;demonstrations&quot;, and this work takes that sort of approach.</p><p>For these simple environments, an agent trained to perform well with another artificial agent will generalize reasonably well to real humans, because there&#x27;s only a few reasonable strategies for the principal to take. However, with more complex environments, when there are many ways to interact, we can&#x27;t expect such generalization. (I&#x27;ll have a paper and blog post coming out soon about this phenomenon.)</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Technical agendas and prioritization</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://alignmentforum.org/posts/wJK944YqvFwjdbqCP/four-ways-an-impact-measure-could-help-alignment\">Four Ways An Impact Measure Could Help Alignment</a></u> <em>(Matthew Barnett)</em> (summarized by Asya Bergal): Much <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure\">recent</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/0c5eeec28f75/alignment-newsletter-25\">AN #25</a></u>) <u><a href=\"https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-side-effects-e1ac80ea6107\">work</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/efed27be268a/alignment-newsletter-49\">AN #49</a></u>) has focused on quantifying the effect an AI has on the world, aka measuring impact, though some are <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/kCY9dYGLoThC3aG7w/best-reasons-for-pessimism-about-impact-of-impact-measures\">skeptical</a></u>. This post presents four potential ways impact measures could help with AI alignment. <em>First</em>, impact could act as a <strong>regularizer</strong>: an untrained AI attempting to do value learning could have an impact penalty that prevents it from taking dangerous actions before it is confident it has learned the right utility function. <em>Second</em>, impact could act as a <strong>safety protocol</strong>: if our training process is dangerous, e.g. due to <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">mesa optimization</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care\">AN #58</a></u>), we can penalize impact during training to safely test models that may be misaligned. <em>Third</em>, impact could act as an <strong>influence-limiter</strong>: impact measures could help us construct AIs with intentionally limited scope that won’t heavily optimize the world as a side effect. <em>Fourth</em>, impact could help us with <strong>deconfusion</strong>: even if impact measures themselves aren&#x27;t used, conceptual clarity about impact could help us gain conceptual clarity about other important concepts such as corrigibility, mild optimization, etc.</p><p><strong>Asya&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I am most excited about impact as a <strong>regularizer</strong> and impact as a <strong>safety protocol</strong>. I feel like AIs that are impact-limited at runtime (the <strong>influence-limiter</strong> case) are unlikely to be competitive with other AIs that have no impact penalty (this is discussed in the post). I found the argument that impact could be particularly useful for <strong>deconfusion</strong> uncompelling.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion</strong>: It seems to me like the safety protocol argument is for limited actions at training time, while the influence limiter argument is for limited actions at test time. I don&#x27;t really get how the regularizer is supposed to be different from these two cases -- perhaps the idea is that it is a regularizer specifically on the distribution over utility functions that the AI is optimizing? This is still confusing I would have expected the influence limiter case to also be a change to the utility function. Like Asya, I am worried about competitiveness: see the post about <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zrunBA8B5bmm2XZ59/reversible-changes-consider-a-bucket-of-water\">reversible changes</a></u> below.</p><h3><strong>Preventing bad behavior</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zrunBA8B5bmm2XZ59/reversible-changes-consider-a-bucket-of-water\">Reversible changes: consider a bucket of water</a></u> <em>(Stuart Armstrong)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post argues that impact regularization methods require preference information in order to work well. Consider a robot that has to navigate to a location, and the fastest way of doing so involves kicking a bucket of water into a pool to get it out of the way. Kicking the bucket is acceptable even though it is irreversible, but it may not be if the water has a special mixture of salts used for an industrial process. In order to determine the appropriate penalty for kicking the bucket, we need preference information -- it is not enough to think about anything value-agnostic like reversibility.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I agree with this -- as I&#x27;ve <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/kCY9dYGLoThC3aG7w/best-reasons-for-pessimism-about-impact-of-impact-measures#qAy66Wza8csAqWxiB\">said</a></u> <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure#JFuGFW8ifAPAL6bjp\">before</a></u>, it seems hard to simultaneously avoid catastrophes, be useful, and be value agnostic. This post is arguing that if we want to avoid catastrophes and be useful, then we can&#x27;t be value agnostic.</p><h3><strong>Adversarial examples</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07174\">Natural Adversarial Examples</a></u> <em>(Dan Hendrycks et al)</em> (summarized by Flo Dorner): This paper introduces a new dataset to evaluate the worst-case performance of image classifiers. ImageNet-A consists of unmodified natural images that are consistently misclassified by popular neural-network architectures trained on ImageNet. Based on some concrete misclassifications, like a dragonfly on a yellow plastic shovel being classified as a banana, the authors hypothesize that current classifiers rely too much on color, texture and background cues. Neither classical adversarial training nor training on a version of ImageNet designed to reduce the reliance on texture helps a lot, but modifying the network architecture can increase the accuracy on ImageNet-A from around 5% to 15%.</p><p><strong>Flo&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This seems to show that current methods and/or training sets for image classification are still far away from allowing for robust generalization, even in naturally occuring scenarios. While not too surprising, the results might convince those who have heavily discounted the evidence provided by classical adversarial examples due to the reliance on artificial perturbations.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I&#x27;m particularly excited about this dataset because it seems like a significantly better way to evaluate new techniques for robustness: it&#x27;s much closer to a &quot;real world&quot; test of the technique (as opposed to e.g. introducing an artificial perturbation that classifiers are expected to be robust to).</p><h3><strong>Field building</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/ai-reading-list-c4753afd97a\">AI Reading List</a></u> <em>(Vishal Maini)</em></p><h1><strong>AI strategy and policy</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2019/08/16/chinas-ai-superpower-dream-with-jeffrey-ding/\">AI Alignment Podcast: China’s AI Superpower Dream</a></u> <em>(Lucas Perry and Jeffrey Ding)</em> (summarized by Rohin): See also <u><a href=\"http://www.rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-231-helen-toner-on-misconceptions-about-china-and-artific.html\">these</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/405e29e1f1cd/an-55-regulatory-markets-and-international-standards-as-a-means-of-ensuring-beneficial-ai\">AN #55</a></u>) <u><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/helen-toner-on-security-and-emerging-technology/\">three</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/2abdf19aa813/an-61ai-policy-and-governance-from-two-people-in-the-field\">AN #61</a></u>) <u><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2019/08/30/fli-podcast-beyond-the-arms-race-narrative-ai-china-with-helen-toner-elsa-kania/\">podcasts</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/533c646a4b21/an-63how-architecture-search-meta-learning-and-environment-design-could-lead-to-general-intelligence\">AN #63</a></u>).</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02908\">On Inductive Biases in Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></u> <em>(Matteo Hessel, Hado van Hasselt et al)</em> (summarized by Sudhanshu Kasewa): The fewer inductive biases we use, the more general our algorithms will be. But how much does it really help to have fewer inductive biases? This paper replaces several hand-engineered components of an A2C agent with generic or adaptive variants to empirically answer this question.</p><p>Specifically, they compared: 1) reward clipping vs. reward normalization via <u><a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/preserving-outputs-precisely-while-adaptively-rescaling-targets/\">PopArt</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/d7b5059d64ed/alignment-newsletter-24\">AN #24</a></u>), 2) handpicked discount factor vs. online adaptive discounting via meta-learning, 3) fixed action repeats vs. learned action-commitment, and 4) standard Atari observation preprocessing vs. passing raw observations to a recurrent network. Over 57 Atari tasks, they found that the tuned algorithm outperformed the adaptive method only in (1). Performance was similar for (2) and (3), and the proposed method outperformed the baseline for (4). When the fully adaptive agent was compared to the vanilla agent (with heuristics designed for Atari) over 28 unseen continuous control tasks, the adaptive agent performed better in 14 of them, worse in one, and about the same in the rest, providing evidence that fewer inductive biases do lead to more general agents.</p><p><strong>Sudhanshu&#x27;s opinion:</strong> On net, I am quite happy to see work which argues in favour of reducing time spent hand-tuning and hand-crafting parts of a complex pipeline, and demonstrates the alternatives that currently exist to do so.</p><p>However, I feel the work did not fully compare the trade-off between tuning hyperparameters, and increasing the complexity of the pipeline by adding the adaptive components. I agree, though, that the latter is a one-time effort (per inductive bias), and is thus far more scalable than the former which needs to be repeated for each bias for every new task.</p><p>It would also be interesting to see how adaptive agents fare on problems where we care more about failures than successes, or if they are better/worse suited for safe exploration than baseline agents. My intuition is that adaptive internals of the agent cause it behave more noisily/unpredictably, and it may not fare as well as our current efforts for such problems.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> While it&#x27;s certainly true that fewer inductive biases imply more general agents, it also usually means more compute and data requirements. For action repetition and learned discount factors, only one new parameter has to be learned, so it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference either way (and in fact performance on Atari doesn&#x27;t change much). Clipped rewards do in fact learn faster than PopArt. I don&#x27;t know why a recurrent network improves upon standard observation preprocessing for Atari -- perhaps initially RNNs were hard to train, and it became a de facto standard to use observation preprocessing, and no one checked about using recurrent networks later when RNNs became easier to train?</p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (AI)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05909v1.pdf\">Stand-Alone Self Attention in Vision Models</a></u> <em>(Prajit Ramachandran et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): Continuing with the more general rise of attention models across disciplines, this paper argues that attention-only models can perform comparably to convolutional networks on image classification tasks, a domain where convolution has been the reigning default method for years now. Because attention doesn&#x27;t scale parameter-wise as you increase spatial scale, this comparable performance can be achieved at notably lower number of parameters and FLOPs. The authors perform a few interesting modifications to attention. Firstly, it&#x27;s canonical, with attention, to include a representation of a pixel&#x27;s position in the image, in addition to the vector storing the content of the image. In this paper, they found that storing this position information in relative terms (i.e. &quot;how close is this pixel to the center one where attention is being calculated&quot;) performs better.</p><p>This can be seen as a sort of generalized form of convolution, where instead of having fixed weights for pixels in a kernel indexed by their relative position, attention takes both content and relative position as an input and generates a weight dynamically. Another modification is, at the lower parts of the network, to somewhat modify the attention paradigm such that the &quot;value&quot; at each location isn&#x27;t just a neutrally transformed version of the input at that location, but rather one transformed differently according to the pixel&#x27;s position relative to the anchor point where attention is being calculated. At the lower levels of the network, convolutions tend to outperform attention, but attention performs better at later layers of the network. This makes sense, the authors claim, because in early layers each individual pixel doesn&#x27;t contain much content information that an attention mechanism could usefully leverage, whereas later the learned features at a given spatial location are richer, and more productively leveraged by attention.</p><p><strong>Cody&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I enjoyed and appreciated the way this paper questions the obvious default of convolutional models for image processing, and in particular the way it highlights various reachable points (neighborhood-aware value transformation, relative position position encoding, etc) on the interpolation path between weights based purely on relative distance (convolution) and weights based purely on content similarity (attention without any position representation). I&#x27;d be interested in the future to see more work in this space, exploring different places in a network architecture where content-focused or position-focused computation is most valuable.</p>",

We might hope that at least 99% of the universe’s resources end up being used for stuff-humans-like (in expectation).</p><p>Jessica Taylor argued for this conclusion in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375325/strategies-for-coalitions-in-unit-sum-games\">Strategies for Coalitions in Unit-Sum Games</a>: if the humans divide into 99 groups each of which acquires influence as effectively as the unaligned AI, then by symmetry each group should end, up with as much influence as the AI, i.e. they should end up with 99% of the influence.</p><p>This argument rests on what I’ll call the <em>strategy-stealing assumption</em>: for any strategy an unaligned AI could use to influence the long-run future, there is an analogous strategy that a similarly-sized group of humans can use in order to capture a similar amount of flexible influence over the future. By “flexible” I mean that humans can decide later what to do with that influence — which is important since humans don’t yet know what we want in the long run.</p><h3>Why might the strategy-stealing assumption be true?</h3><p>Today there are a bunch of humans, with different preferences and different kinds of influence. Crudely speaking, the long-term outcome seems to be determined by some combination of {which preferences have how much influence?} and {what is the space of realizable outcomes?}.</p><p>I expect this to become more true over time — I expect groups of agents with diverse preferences to eventually approach efficient outcomes, since otherwise there are changes that every agent would prefer (though this is not obvious, especially in light of bargaining failures). Then the question is just about <em>which</em> of these efficient outcomes we pick.</p><p>I think that our actions don’t effect the space of realizable outcomes, because long-term realizability is mostly determined by facts about distant stars that we can’t yet influence. The obvious exception is that if we colonize space faster, we will have access more resources. But <a href=\"https://rationalaltruist.com/2013/04/30/astronomical-waste/\">quantitatively this doesn’t seem like a big consideration</a>, because astronomical events occur over millions of millennia while our decisions only change colonization timelines by decades.</p><p>So I think our decisions mostly affect long-term outcomes by changing the relative weights of different possible preferences (or by causing extinction).</p><p>Today, one of the main ways that preferences have weight is because agents with those preferences control resources and other forms of influence. Strategy-stealing seems most possible for this kind of plan — an aligned AI can exactly copy the strategy of an unaligned AI, except the money goes into the aligned AI’s bank account instead. The same seems true for most kinds of resource gathering.</p><p>There are lots of strategies that give influence to other people instead of helping me. For example, I might preferentially collaborate with people who share my values. But I can still steal these strategies, as long as my values are just as common as the values of the person I’m trying to steal from. So a majority can steal strategies from a minority, but not the other way around.</p><p>There can be plenty of strategies that don’t involve acquiring resources or flexible influence. For example, we could have a parliament with obscure rules in which I can make maneuvers that advantage one set of values or another in a way that can’t be stolen. Strategy-stealing may only be possible at the level of groups — you need to retain the option of setting up a different parliamentary system that doesn’t favor particular values. Even then, it’s unclear whether strategy-stealing is possible.</p><p>There isn’t a clean argument for strategy-stealing, but I think it seems plausible enough that it’s meaningful and productive to think of it as a plausible default, and to look at ways it can fail. (If you found enough ways it could fail, you might eventually stop thinking of it as a default.)</p><h3>Eleven ways the strategy-stealing assumption could fail</h3><p>In this section I’ll describe some of the failures that seem most important to me, with a focus on the ones that would interfere with the argument in the introduction.</p><h4>1. AI alignment</h4><p>If we can build smart AIs, but not aligned AIs, then humans can’t necessarily use AI to capture flexible influence. I think this is theπ most important way in which strategy-stealing is likely to fail. I’m not going to spend much time talking about it here because I’ve spent so much time elsewhere.</p><p>For example, if smart AIs inevitably want to fill the universe with paperclips, then “build a really smart AI” is a good strategy for someone who wants to fill the universe with paperclips, but it can’t be easily stolen by someone who wants anything else.</p><h4>2. Value drift over generations</h4><p>The values of 21st century humans are determined by some complicated mix of human nature and the modern environment. If I’m a 16th century noble who has really specific preferences about the future, it’s not really clear how I can act on those values. But if I’m a 16th century noble who thinks that future generations will inevitably be wiser and should get what they want, then I’m in luck, all I need to do is wait and make sure our civilization doesn’t do anything rash. And if I have some kind of crude intermediate preferences, then I might be able to push our culture in appropriate directions or encourage people with similar genetic dispositions to have more kids.</p><p>This is the most obvious and important way that strategy-stealing has failed historically. It’s not something I personally worry about too much though.</p><p>The big reason I don’t worry is some combination of common-sense morality and decision-theory: our values are the product of many generations each giving way to the next one, and so I’m pretty inclined to “pay it forward.” Put a different way, I think it’s relatively clear I should empathize with the next generation since I might well have been in their place (whereas <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/sympathizing-with-ai-e11a4bf5ef6e\">I find it much less clear under what conditions I should empathize with AI</a>). Or from yet another perspective, the same intuition that I’m “more right” than previous generations makes me very open to the possibility that future generations are more right still. This question gets very complex, but my first-pass take is that I’m maybe an order of magnitude less worried than about other kinds of value drift.</p><p>The small reason I don’t worry is that I think this dynamic is probably going to be less important in the future (unless we actively want it to be important — which seems quite possible). I believe there is a good chance that within 60 years most decisions will be made by machines, and so the handover from one generation to the next will be optional.</p><p>That all said, I am somewhat worried about more “out of distribution” changes to the values of future generations, in scenarios where AI development is slower than I expect. For example, I think it’s possible that genetic engineering of humans will substantially change what we want, and that I should be less excited about that kind of drift. Or I can imagine the interaction between technology and culture causing similarly alien changes. These questions are even harder to think about than the basic question of “how much should I empathize with future generations?” which already seemed quite thorny, and I don’t really know what I’d conclude if I spent a long time thinking. But at any rate, these things are not at the top of my priority queue.</p><h4>3. Other alignment problems</h4><p>AIs and future generations aren’t the only optimizers around. For example, we can also build institutions that further their own agendas. We can then face a problem analogous to AI alignment — if it’s easier to build effective institutions with some kinds of values than others, then those values could be at a structural advantage. For example, we might inevitably end up with a society that optimizes generalizations of short-term metrics, if big groups of humans are much more effective when doing this. (I say “generalizations of short-term metrics” because an exclusive focus on short-term metrics is the kind of problem that can fix itself over the very long run.)</p><p>I think that institutions are currently considerably weaker than humans (in the sense that’s relevant to strategy-stealing) and this will probably remain true over the medium term. For example:</p><ul><li>A company with 10,000 people might be much smarter than any individual humans, but mostly that’s because of its alliance with its employees and shareholders — most of its influence is just used to accumulate more wages and dividends. Companies do things that seem antisocial not because they have come unmoored from any human’s values, but because plenty of influential humans want them to do that in order to make more money. (You could try to point the “market” as an organization with its own preferences, but it’s even worse at defending itself than bureaucracies — it’s up to humans who benefit from the market to defend it.)</li><li>Bureaucracies can seem unmoored from any individual human desire. But their actual ability to defend themselves and acquire resources seems much weaker than other optimizers like humans or corporations.</li></ul><p>Overall I’m less concerned about this than AI alignment, but I do think it is a real problem. I’m somewhat optimistic that the same general principles will be relevant both to aligning institutions and AIs. If AI alignment wasn’t an issue, I’d be more concerned by problems like institutional alignment.</p><h4>4. Human fragility</h4><p>If AI systems are aligned with humans, they may want to keep humans alive. Not only do humans prefer being alive, humans may need to survive if they want to have the time and space to figure out what they really want and to tell their AI what to do. (I say “may” because at some point you might imagine e.g. putting some humans in cold storage, to be revived later.)</p><p>This could introduce an asymmetry: an AI that just cares about paperclips can get a leg up on humans by threatening to release an engineered plague, or trashing natural ecosystems that humans rely on. (Of course, this asymmetry may also go the other way — values implemented in machines are reliant on a bunch of complex infrastructure which may be more or less of a liability than humanity’s reliance on ecosystems.)</p><p>Stepping back, I think the fundamental long-term problem here is that “do what this human wants” is only a simple description of human values if you actually have the human in hand, and so an agent with these values does have a big extra liability.</p><p>I do think that the extreme option of “storing” humans to revive them later is workable, though most people would be very unhappy with a world where that becomes necessary. (To be clear, I think it almost certainly won’t.) We’ll return to this under “short-term terminal preferences” below.</p><h4>5. Persuasion as fragility</h4><p>If an aligned AI defines its values with reference to “whatever Paul wants,” then someone doesn’t need to kill Paul to mess with the AI, they just need to change what Paul wants. If it’s very easy to manipulate humans, but we want to keep talking with each other and interacting with the world despite the risk, then this extra attack surface could become a huge liability.</p><p>This is easier to defend against — just stop talking with people except in extremely controlled environments where you can minimize the risk of manipulation — but again humans may not be willing to pay that cost.</p><p>The main reason this might be worse than point 4 is that humans may be relatively happy to physically isolate themselves from anything scary, but it would be much more costly for us to cut off from contact with other humans.</p><h4>6. Asymmetric persuasion</h4><p>Even if humans are the only optimizers around, it might be easier to persuade humans of some things than others. For example, you could imagine a world where it’s easier to convince humans to endorse a simple ideology like “maximize the complexity of the universe” than to convince humans to pursue some more complex and subtle values.</p><p>This means that people with easily-persuadable values can use persuasion as a strategy, and people with other values cannot copy it.</p><p>I think this is ultimately more important than fragility, because it is relevant before we have powerful AI systems. It has many similarities to “value drift over generations,” and I have some mixed feelings here as well — there are some kinds of argument and deliberation that I certainly do endorse, and to the extent that my current views are the product of significant amounts of non-endorsed deliberation I am more inclined to be empathetic to future people who are influenced by increasingly-sophisticated arguments.</p><p>But as I described in section 2, I think these connections can get weaker as technological progress moves us further out of distribution, and if you told me that e.g. it was possible to perform a brute force search and find an argument that could convince someone to maximize the complexity of the future, I wouldn’t conclude that it’s probably fine if they decided to do that.</p><p>(Credit to Wei Dai for emphasizing this failure mode.)</p><h4>7. Value-sensitive bargaining</h4><p>If a bunch of powerful agents collectively decide what to do with the universe, I think it probably won’t look like “they all control their own slice of the universe and make independent decisions about what to do.” There will likely be opportunities for trade, they may have meddling preferences (where I care what you do with your part of the universe), there may be a possibility of destructive conflict, or it may look completely different in an unanticipated way.</p><p>In many of these settings the outcome is influenced by a complicated bargaining game, and it’s unclear whether the majority can steal a minority’s strategy. For example, suppose that there are two values X and Y in the world, with 99% X-agents and 1% Y-agents. The Y-agents may be able to threaten to destroy the world unless there is an even split, and the X-agents have no way to copy such a strategy. (This could also occur over the short term.)</p><p>I don’t have a strong view about the severity of this problem. I could imagine it being a big deal.</p><h4>8. Recklessness</h4><p>Some preferences might not care about whether the world is destroyed, and therefore have access to productive but risky strategies that more cautious agents cannot copy. The same could happen with other kinds of risks, like commitments that are game-theoretically useful but risk sacrificing some part of the universe or creating long-term negative outcomes.</p><p>I tend to think about this problem in the context of particular technologies that pose an extinction risk, but it’s worth keeping in mind that it can be compounded by the existence of more reckless agents.</p><p>Overall I think this isn’t a big deal, because it seems much easier to cause extinction by trying to kill everyone than as an accident. There are fewer people who are in fact trying to kill everyone, but I think not enough fewer to tip the balance. (This is a contingent fact about technology though; it could change in the future and I could easily be wrong even today.)</p><h4>9. Short-term unity and coordination</h4><p>Some actors may have long-term values that are easier to talk about, represent formally, or reason about. Relative to humans, AIs may be especially likely to have such values. These actors could have an easier time coordinating, e.g. by pursuing some explicit compromise between their values (rather than being forced to find a governance mechanism for some resources produced by a joint venture).</p><p>This could leave us in a place where e.g. an unaligned AI controls 1% resources, but the majority of resources are controlled by humans who want to acquire flexible resources. Then the unaligned AIs can form a coalition which achieves very high efficiencies, while the humans cannot form 99 other coalitions to compete.</p><p>This could theoretically be a problem without AI, e.g. a large group of human with shared explicit values might be able to coordinate better and so leave normal humans at a disadvantage, though I think this is relatively unlikely as a major force in the world.</p><p>The seriousness of this problem is bounded by both the efficiency gains for a large coalition, and the quality of governance mechanisms for different actors who want to acquire flexible resources. I think we have OK solutions for coordination between people who want flexible influence, such that I don’t think this will be a big problem:</p><ul><li>The humans can participate in lotteries to concentrate influence. Or you can gather resources to be used for a lottery in the future, while still allowing time for people to become wiser and then make bargains about what to do with the universe before they know who wins.</li><li>You can divide up the resources produced by a coalition equitably (and then negotiate about what to do with them).</li><li>You can modify other mechanisms by allowing votes that could e.g. overrule certain uses of resources. You could have more complex governance mechanisms, can delegate different kinds of authority to different systems, can rely on trusted parties, etc.</li><li>Many of these procedures work much better amongst groups of humans who expect to have relatively similar preferences or have a reasonable level of trust for other participants to do something basically cooperative and friendly (rather than e.g. demanding concessions so that they don’t do something terrible with their share of the universe or if they win the eventual lottery).</li></ul><p>(Credit to Wei Dai for describing and emphasizing this failure mode.)</p><h4>10. Weird stuff with simulations</h4><p>I think civilizations like ours mostly have an impact via the common-sense channel where we ultimately colonize space. But there may be many civilizations like ours in simulations of various kinds, and influencing the results of those simulations could also be an important part of what we do. In that case, I don’t have any particular reason to think strategy-stealing breaks dow but I think stuff could be very weird and I have only a weak sense of how this influences optimal strategies.</p><p>Overall I don’t think much about this since it doesn’t seem likely to be a large part of our influence and it doesn’t break strategy-stealing in an obvious way. But I think it’s worth having in mind.</p><h4>11. Other preferences</h4><p>People care about lots of stuff other than their influence over the long-term future. If 1% of the world is unaligned AI and 99% of the world is humans, but the AI spends all of its resources on influencing the future while the humans only spend one tenth, it wouldn’t be too surprising if the AI ended up with 10% of the influence rather than 1%. This can matter in lots of ways other than literal spending and saving: someone who only cared about the future might make different tradeoffs, might be willing to defend themselves at the cost of short-term value (see sections 4 and 5 above), might pursue more ruthless strategies for expansion, and so on<em>.</em></p><p>I think the simplest approximation is to restrict attention to the part of our preferences that is about the long-term (I discussed this a bit in <a href=\"https://rationalaltruist.com/2013/02/27/why-will-they-be-happy/\">Why might the future be good?</a>). To the extent that someone cares about the long-term less than the average actor, they will represent a smaller fraction of this “long-term preferences” mixture. This may give unaligned AI systems a one-time advantage for influencing the long-term future (if they care more about it) but doesn’t change the basic dynamics of strategy-stealing. Even this advantage might be clawed back by a majority (e.g. by taxing savers).</p><p>There are a few places where this picture seems a little bit less crisp:</p><ul><li>Rather than being able to spend resources on either the short or long-term, sometimes you might have preferences about <em>how</em> you acquire resources in the short-term; an agent without such scruples could potentially pull ahead. If these preferences are strong, it probably violates strategy-stealing unless the majority can agree to crush anyone unscrupulous.</li><li>For humans in particular, it may be hard to separate out “humans as repository of values” from “humans as an object of preferences,” and this may make it harder for us to defend ourselves (as discussed in sections 4 and 5).</li></ul><p>I mostly think these complexities won’t be a big deal quantitatively, because I think our short-term preferences will mostly be compatible with defense and resource acquisition. But I’m not confident about that.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think strategy-stealing isn’t really true; but I think it’s a good enough approximation that we can basically act as if it’s true, and then think about the risk posed by possible failures of strategy-stealing.</p><p>I think this is especially important for thinking about AI alignment, because it lets us formalize the lowered goalposts I discussed <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/a-possible-stance-for-ai-control-research-fe9cf717fc1b\">here</a>: we just want to ensure that AI is compatible with strategy-stealing. These lowered goalposts are an important part of why I think we can solve alignment.</p><p>In practice I think that a large coalition of humans isn’t reduced to strategy-stealing — a majority can simply stop a minority from doing something bad, rather than by copying it. The possible failures in this post could potentially be addressed by either a technical solution or some kind of coordination.</p>",

I also won't be giving sources, motivation, or inspiration for these techniques in the post, so if you notice something that feels like it came from somewhere else, just know that in the eventual sequence I'll do my best to make my sources clear.</p>\n<p>I'm also skipping over all the prerequisite material on how to notice triggers, cognitively rehearse items, etc.</p>\n<p>The proper thing to choose what exercises will help you is to look at the <strong>Symptoms</strong> for each cognitive strategy.

    "htmlBody": "<p>(This uses a politically charged topic as an example, but I&#x27;m hoping that people are willing to try to understand the points made despite that. Politics is Hard Mode, and I&#x27;m hoping to stay at a lower difficulty level for now, so I&#x27;ve asked that comments not discuss the object level politics.)</p><p>Last week on twitter, I saw two very different takes on how the United States reacted to 9/11, and the consequences. They both reflected an update to people&#x27;s views based on the data since that time, but the conclusions radically diverged. E.T. Jaynes posited that this can happen, but this is the first time I recognized it in practice so clearly, and thought it was worth noting simply as an example. Beyond that, I wanted to point out how it can be to some extent avoided.</p><p>The first was Don Moynihan, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/donmoyn/status/1171747435170992134\">said</a>: &quot;It is important to remember 9/11 and the lives that were lost. Its also important to remember that period of American history fully, to understand that a terrorist attack triggered a series of catastrophic judgments by US politicians that led to the loss of more innocent lives.&quot;</p><p>The second was David French, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidAFrench/status/1171789626719313920\">said</a>: &quot; If you had told us on that day that we wouldn&#x27;t endure another mass-scale attack on American soil for at least 18 more years, we would have thought you were wildly optimistic. The achievement of our military and security establishment should never be underestimated.&quot;</p><p>First, I want to note that the two views are based on different counterfactuals. Moynihan presumably assumes that the counterfactual rate of terrorist attacks had the US not gone to war in Afghanistan and Iraq to be at least relatively low. He therefore updates based on the fact that there have been very few credible attempts to mount large attacks on the US homeland, to conclude that they would be foiled by standard US intelligence sources and policing. French explicitly calls out the fact that the commonly held prior for the number of attacks that would be mounted in the wake of 9/11 was high, and asserts that this was correct but-for the military interventions the US waged. He therefore updates based on the fact that there have been very few credible attempts to mount large attacks on the US homeland, to conclude that the military interventions were successful.</p><p>Clearly, it is not the case that either person is ignoring the evidence. In this case, there are different reasons to update towards each of the models; the lack of credible attack attempts in the US contrasts with the large number in Iraq, and it&#x27;s plausible that without the US wars abroad, some of that effort would have been directed at the US. On the other hand, law enforcement was very successful in detecting and stopping attacks, so it&#x27;s plausible that few would have gotten through anyways. But since we can&#x27;t see what would have happened has the US not gone to war (i.e. counterfactual realities are unobservable), we may be tempted to conclude that evidence is useless in the face of different prior beliefs. This isn&#x27;t quite true.</p><p>If Moynihan and French had been asked in detail in 2001 what they expected in the case that the US would or would not go to war, they would be forced to confront the ways in which their predictions failed. Perhaps their conclusions would be different - but most people don&#x27;t routinely make quantifiable predictions. Their stated models are at best capable of being twisted, and if people want to believe their model, and not change their mind, not only can the invisible dragon in the garage be post-hoc determined to be permeable to flour once an annoying rationalist proposes a test of the theory, but given the flexibility that language offers, people often specify models of the world that don&#x27;t require post-hoc adjustment, just defensible clarifications. So unless we&#x27;re incredibly detailed in the predictions we request of people, the ability to use data to reinforce rather than revise beliefs can&#x27;t be stopped.</p><p>Ideally, we&#x27;d have the ability to build a correct model, but we can&#x27;t - certainly not in the space of this post, near-certainly not in a couple years of research into international relations theory, and plausibly not at all due to the paucity of evidence and the number of uncertain variables involved.</p><p>The better approach, I think, is to consider the outside view about the models.  We have are two different models that are espoused by people with differing political viewpoints. Each of the models reflect a combination of motivated reasoning, selective blindness, and actual attempts to understand the world, and we&#x27;re stuck uncertain which is less wrong.</p><p>But what we absolutely shouldn&#x27;t do - and without explicitly trying not to, likely would do - is notice the model that we&#x27;d prefer and (perhaps subconsciously) preferentially interpret evidence as supporting it and disproving the alternatives. Especially here, where both models are simplified and wrong in many ways, my advice is to try to reason under model-uncertainty, instead of trying to reason the way we are naturally inclined to, by picking sides in a fight. Absent further plausible arguments and evidence - which exist, but themselves need to be evaluated very carefully for the same reasons - we should look at the models as both plausible. </p>",

To be fair, my fascination comes from an honest place: I’m a walking stereotype of a reluctant decision-maker. Back when I was a teenager, I was paralyzed by challenges as mundane as what topics to choose for my high school English papers. Even now, I drive my wife and other dinner companions crazy whenever we’re at a restaurant, as I’ll study the menu, ask the server for a recommendation, ignore that recommendation, then call them over a minute later and change my order again. (Seriously, this exact sequence happens like 40% of the time.)</p><p>The self-help literature these days may be littered with guides on how to give yourself productivity superpowers — use <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/business-insider/amy-cuddy-the-poses-that-will-boost-your-confidence.html\">power poses</a> to harness your <a href=\"https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/\">grit</a> so that that you can enjoy a <a href=\"https://fourhourworkweek.com/\">four-hour work week</a> and <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/08/02/pf/early-retirement/index.html\">retire early</a>! — but personally, I’m more interested in how to give myself the superpower of making consistently wise decisions. Because it doesn’t matter how fast you blow through your task list if it’s full of mindless busywork.</p><p>And when it comes to social sector leaders, I’m doubly interested. Because your decisions carry a profound moral weight. They <em>matter</em>. The decisions of government officials, donors, and nonprofit executives have shaped my life in too many ways to count, both for better and for worse. And if you pause to think about your own life, I imagine you’ll conclude the same.</p><p>To be honest, I think that’s why we all got into this work in the first place: to make a difference in people’s lives. But it took me a while to realize that <strong>the difference we make and the decisions we make are one and the same.</strong> Better decisions foster a legacy we can be proud of.</p><p>So how can we get better? Lots of ways! Decision-making is an exciting frontier in social impact precisely because there is so much untapped potential to improve how we do things. For decades now, scholars and practitioners have been pioneering methodologies for analyzing and making decisions that have seen barely any adoption in philanthropy, government, or impact investing. Drawing from that body of work, I’ve developed my own process to help myself and my collaborators make critical decisions with intention and focus. Here, I’m sharing the key elements of that process so that you can benefit from them in your own practice.</p><h3>Begin with strategy</h3><p>It’s important to place decisions in context. Decision theory can’t tell you what goals ought to be motivating you or who should be accountable for making decisions. So I like to tell people that decision-making doesn’t <em>replace</em> strategy. Instead, decision-making is the <em>manifestation </em>of strategy. Decision analysis methodologies are most powerful when you already have a pretty good idea of what you’re trying to do and how you want to try to do it. They work best when the challenge in front of you is to figure out how to take the general direction and principles you’ve already committed to and translate them into action <em>in</em> <em>this specific situation</em>.</p><p>Accordingly, before you make use of the advice in the rest of this article, it’s best to have your mission, vision, and values figured out and committed to paper or pixels. You should know who has final authority for decision-making and, if decisions must be made as a group, how conflicts will be resolved among the group members. And you should ideally have some sense of the landscape in which you’re operating and the specific, near-term outcomes that are most critical to your success.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*n22EAL-DYBlmA-RH\" /></figure><p>Now, it might not be immediately clear why anything more than this is necessary. If you’ve already set out a general strategy, won’t its application to day-to-day decisions be straightforward? In some cases, it might be. Not every decision is a head-scratcher, after all. But almost inevitably, tradeoffs come up between goals or values that can’t be accommodated at the same time or to the same degree. Almost inevitably, people on your team or in your brain trust will disagree about the likely consequences of different paths forward, with no easy way to determine who’s likely to be right. And almost inevitably, there will be situations where the right choice will piss off all the wrong people.</p><p>Decision analysis was made for moments like these.</p><h3><strong>Deciding what to decide</strong></h3><p>We make <a href=\"https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/17182/basis-for-we-make-35-000-decisions-a-day-statistic\">hundreds of decisions</a> every day, from what to cook for dinner to whether to open up Twitter right now to how to respond to the slightly offensive comment your coworker just made. Most of these are hardly worth a moment’s thought, to say nothing of hiring a consultant to help you figure them out.</p><p>If the discipline of decision analysis makes anything clear, though, it’s that some decisions matter more than others. Decisions in which <strong>the stakes are high, the context is unfamiliar, and the definition of success is not immediately obvious</strong> are the ones that will benefit most from your sustained attention.</p><p>Due to the fast pace at which many teams operate, though, we often only start paying attention to decisions shortly before they need to be made. As a result, we shortchange many of our most important decisions and risk falling prey to <a href=\"https://medium.com/better-humans/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18\">cognitive biases</a> that lead to worse outcomes.</p><p>We can’t afford to thoroughly analyze every single decision we make, of course; we would quickly find ourselves so consumed by the exercise that we are unable to get anything done. So we need some way of anticipating and prioritizing our decisions in order to ensure we are spending the appropriate bandwidth on the ones that really matter.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a simple activity called a <strong>decision inventory</strong> that can fix this problem. Adapted from a method created by decision analysis pioneers <a href=\"http://sdg.com\">Strategic Decisions Group</a>, the decision inventory is a means of cataloguing, consolidating, and sorting all of the major decisions you expect to make in the near to medium term. The exercise offers foresight on what dilemmas you will need to focus on when, and which ones to resolve quickly vs. investigate thoroughly.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TpeS_k0x8TJk06mv\" /></figure><h3><strong>Breaking down your decision</strong></h3><p>Okay, now we’re getting to the good stuff. Once it’s clear which decisions are most deserving of your attention, it’s time to start analyzing the ones on top of the pile. There are a number of ways one could potentially break down a decision into its component parts. My own process incorporates the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The factors at play. </strong>What is the broader organizational/strategic context in which this decision is taking place? You and your team members will usually have a strong intuitive sense of what’s relevant here, so it’s fine to rely on your gut for this one as a first pass. What are the biggest opportunities and concerns associated with this dilemma? What most excites and/or worries you?</li><li><strong>What you could do. </strong>What are the options on the table? What options should be discussed but aren’t part of the conversation yet? What are the pros and cons associated with each?</li><li><strong>Optimization strategies. </strong>Are we making this decision at the right time? Generally speaking, more strategic/consequential decisions should precede more tactical choices. Other decisions would be better considered after some set of events has unfolded or more information will be available. Finally, sometimes it makes sense to “bundle” decisions together so that the strategy can be naturally aligned.</li><li><strong>Stakes. </strong>You will have already begun to assess the stakes of a decision at the inventory stage, but it’s helpful to keep them in mind as you determine how much total time and budget you’re willing to spend before committing to a direction. A thoughtful assessment of stakes will take into account who and what could be affected by the outcome(s) of the decision, by how much, and for how long. It would also consider the reversibility of the decision; once you’ve made it, how hard is it to go back on it?</li><li><strong>Sources and degree of uncertainty. </strong>If you had to make this decision right now, what choice would you make? If the answer isn’t immediately obvious, it’s probably because there’s something (or several things) you don’t know that you wish you did. Honing in on those sources of uncertainty can help you prioritize what additional information would be most helpful to you in this situation. (Note that you can usually get a much more precise understanding of the value of additional information by modeling the decision quantitatively, as discussed below.)</li></ul><p>Don’t be intimidated by the breadth of the above list. Chances are you’re already making these kinds of assessments about your decisions, you’re just not (yet) doing it in a systematic way. This process helps to bring that thinking into the realm of the conscious mind. And in many situations, that can happen with just a couple of meetings and some back-of-the-envelope estimates.</p><p>Some decisions really do require careful attention to get right, though. For those, there’s no substitute for an in-depth quantitative model.</p><h3><strong>Going mental with decision modeling</strong></h3><p>The preliminary analysis described in the previous section will give you a holistic overview of your decision dilemma, but it optimizes for breadth over depth. It’s like exploring the world by looking at a two-dimensional map — you can see the complete picture, but not all the details.</p><p>To achieve both, it’s necessary to model your decision explicitly using mathematical tools. This is like exploring the world from your desktop using a combination of Google Maps and Street View. The map helps you understand the broader context, but you can improve your understanding of the details by zooming in on specific points of interest.</p><p>My invocation of technology here is intentional, because building decision models is a technological enhancement to human decision-making. We are leveraging the power and speed of modern computing capacity to help us gain a deeper understanding of our decision dilemma than would be possible using our minds alone. You are still in the driver’s seat — you are still the one who makes the decision, after all — but the mathematical model we create serves as a kind of supercharged coach or advisor.</p><p>The nuts and bolts of putting together a decision model are too involved to cover here, but I wrote <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-decision-modeling-3e50581e8a73\">a handy primer featuring a grantmaking case study</a> if you’re interested in learning more about how to do it.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/805/0*xsxkRb7VFc0z6_Y1\" /><figcaption>Sample decision model focusing on grantmaking for vaccine distribution (<a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-decision-modeling-3e50581e8a73\">full article</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>There are two main reasons to put together a decision model. The first is that it’s possible to get <em>much</em> better precision about the factors at play and which ones are really important. When putting together a decision model, I use a statistical technique called Monte Carlo simulation that dynamically generates thousands of potential futures based on the estimates and assumptions that you provide (and can easily tweak in real time). Developed by nuclear physicists in the middle of the 20th century, Monte Carlo simulations have been empirically tested and <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=EAPXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=nasa+unmanned+space+probes+monte+carlo+analysis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CrfdwXFjH5&amp;sig=ACfU3U2nGJ6etP0wCu8JweDf-ZkAsES7hg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOoenJy8zkAhXnw1kKHT2oBagQ6AEwBHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nasa%20unmanned%20space%20probes%20monte%20carlo%20analysis&amp;f=false\">shown to yield better judgments than alternative strategies</a> in real-world settings. It’s the method that <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/jstar/monte_carlo.html\">NASA swears by</a> when preparing for so-called “complex projects” like launching human beings into space.</p><p>The second awesome superpower of quantitative models is that they can help guide a research or learning agenda created for the express purpose of reducing uncertainty about important factors relating to the decision in question. You can use the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information\">value of information</a> to pick out the most important things to measure, measure them, and re-run the model in an iterative cycle until there is literally no more value to wring out of seeking further data. This method is called <a href=\"https://www.hubbardresearch.com/about/applied-information-economics/\">Applied Information Economics</a> and was invented by information scientist Doug Hubbard for use in high-stakes investment decisions in the social sector and business world alike (read about a couple of examples of its use <a href=\"https://mel.cgiar.org/reporting/download/hash/BSHUT74g\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/8652/-Review_of_the_Kubuqi_Ecological_Restoration_Project_A_Desert_Green_Economy_Pilot_Initiative-2015Review_of_the_Kubuqi_Ecological_Restoration_Project..pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y\">here</a>). As far as decision analysis techniques go, AIE is pretty much the gold standard approach.</p><p>With that said, modeling does have some costs and drawbacks. The main challenge is that, compared to the quick and easy process described in the previous section, modeling does usually require a more significant minimum investment of time and expense, an investment that scales with the number of stakeholders that need to provide input. In addition, modeling may feel somewhat intimidating or unnatural at first to staff or partners who have little experience with quantitative methods. Finally, while I’m a firm believer that <a href=\"https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/weve-been-thinking-about-measurement-all-wrong-e3b51c46a792\">anything worth modeling can be modeled</a>, it is true that some kinds of goals and decision factors are harder to translate into mathematical terms than others and may require more specialized expertise.</p><p>So when should you make the leap to modeling your decision? Ultimately, it comes down most of all to the stakes of the decision. Although all such situations should be judged case by case, <strong>a good-enough rule of thumb is that if your decision has more than $25,000 (for an individual) or $50,000 (for an organization) riding on it, it’s worth considering putting together at least a quick-and-dirty quantitative model to help ensure you get it right.</strong> And if the stakes are in the $250,000 and up range, I’d say it’s actually pretty irresponsible <em>not </em>to attempt a quantitative treatment of the situation.</p><p>Finally, remember: the math is there to help you make your decision, not to make it for you. You are free to ignore it if you want. When I’m making a decision model I work hard to make sure it accounts for everything the decision-maker cares about. But I never deliver a recommendation without also considering the qualitative analysis that we developed alongside it.</p><h3><strong>After the math, the aftermath</strong></h3><p>Congratulations, you’ve made your decision! Give yourself a pat on the back and a well-deserved breather. But don’t take too long, for while the dilemma itself may be resolved, the consequences of your choice are just beginning to be felt.</p><p>Here are some helpful questions to ask and things to think about in the post-decision phase:</p><ul><li><strong>How should you talk about this decision (and the process that went into it)?</strong> Strategic Decisions Group’s <a href=\"https://sdg.com/thought-leadership/decision-quality-defined/\">Decision Quality framework</a> notably includes “commitment to action” as one of six key pillars to a high-quality decision — meaning that they include commitment in the very <em>definition </em>of what constitutes a high-quality decision. Particularly when the decision is about a charged topic or conversation in your organization or community, having a robust, transparent process like this one can <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_justice\">help to build consensus and buy-in moving forward</a>.</li><li><strong>Do you expect to make similar decisions like this in the future?</strong> If so, it’s likely you can reuse much of the analysis and basic framework you developed for this one in those scenarios to come. And if you created a quantitative model for the decision, you can turn that model into a standardized template that can accommodate any such situation in the future. In my own practice, I’ve built templates like this for things like whether to apply for a new consulting opportunity. In such situations, the work you put in initially to develop the model is amortized across many uses, making the investment of time effectively a no-brainer.</li><li><strong>How does this decision affect other decisions you need to make?</strong> Decisions usually beget more decisions. You or your team might have been waiting for resolution on this situation because it would provide crucial information for other dilemmas in play. In other cases, a decision to, say, move forward with a project will create lots of new choices about how exactly to implement it. Be sure to document the more important of these so that you can devote the appropriate amount of attention to them, and if any seem especially high-stakes and/or uncertain, the techniques discussed in this article are here to help.</li></ul><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QeWFbnBP9VgKaHUX\" /></figure><h3>You, too, can decide like a pro</h3><p>So that’s how I help clients make decisions. If you have grappled with how to make smarter decisions for your organization or philanthropy and come up with similar or different techniques, I’d <a href=\"https://www.iandavidmoss.com/contact\">love to hear from you</a>.

Realism and Anti-Realism</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone is, at least sometimes, inclined to ask: “What should I do?”</p>\n<p>We ask this question when we're making a decision and it seems like there are different considerations to be weighed up. You might be considering taking a new job in a new city, for example, and find yourself wondering how to balance your preferences with those of your significant other. You might also find yourself thinking about whether you have any obligation to do impactful work, about whether it’s better to play it safe or take risks, about whether it's better to be happy in the moment or to be able to look back with satisfaction, and so on. It’s almost inevitable that in a situation like this you will find yourself asking “What should I do?” and reasoning about it as though the question has an answer you can approach through a certain kind of directed thought.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-2\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>But it’s also conceivable that this sort of question doesn’t actually have an answer. Very roughly, at least to certain philosophers, <em>realism</em> is a name for the view that there are some things that we should do or think. <em>Anti-realism</em> is a name for the view that there are not.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-3\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-3\">[3]</a></sup><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-4\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-4\">[4]</a></sup><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-5\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-5\">[5]</a></sup><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-6\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>2. Anti-Realism and the Rationality Community</strong></p>\n<p>In discussions of normative issues, it seems not uncommon for members of the rationalist community to identify as “anti-realists.\" Since people in different communities can obviously use the same words to mean different things, I don't know what fraction of rationalists have the same thing in mind when they use the term \"anti-realism.\"</p>\n<p>To the extent people do have the same thing in mind, though, I find anti-realism hard to square with a lot of other views and lines of research that are popular within the community. A few main points of tension stand out to me.</p>\n<p><strong>2.1 Normative Uncertainty</strong></p>\n<p>One first point of tension is the community’s relatively strong interest in the subject of normative uncertainty. At least as it's <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf\">normally discussed</a> in the philosophy literature, normative uncertainty is uncertainty about normative facts that bear on what we should do. If we assume that anti-realism is true, though, then we are assuming that there are no such facts. It seems to me like a committed anti-realist could not be in a state of normative uncertainty.</p>\n<p>It may still be the case, as <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-011-9713-6\">Sepielli (2012)</a> suggests, that a committed anti-realist can experience psychological states that are interestingly <em>structurally analogous</em> to states of normative uncertainty. However, <a href=\"http://jesp.org/PDF/against_the_being.pdf\">Bykvist and Olson (2012)</a> disagree (in my view) fairly forcefully, and Sepielli is in any case clear that: “Strictly speaking, there cannot be such a thing as normative uncertainty if non-cognitivism [the dominant form of anti-realism] is true.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-7\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>2.2 Strongly Endorsed Normative Views</strong></p>\n<p>A second point of tension is the existence of a key set of normative claims that a large portion of the community seems to treat as true.</p>\n<p>One of these normative claims is the Bayesian claim that we ought to have degrees of belief in propositions that are consistent with the Kolmogorov probability axioms and that are updated in accordance with Bayes’ rule. It seems to me like very large portions of the community self-identify as Bayesians and regard other ways of assigning and updating degrees of belief in propositions as not just different but incorrect.</p>\n<p>Another of these normative claim is the subjectivist claim that we should do whatever would best fulfill some version of our current preferences. To learn what we should do, on this view, the main thing is to introspect about our own preferences.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-8\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-8\">[8]</a></sup> Whether or not a given person should commit a violent crime, for instance, depends purely on whether they want to commit the crime (or perhaps on whether they would want to commit it if they went through some particular process of reflection).</p>\n<p>A further elaboration on this claim is that, when we are uncertain about the outcomes of our actions, we should more specifically act to maximize the <em>expected</em> fulfillment of our desires. We should consider the different possible outcomes of each action, assign them probabilities, assign them desirability ratings, and then use the expected value formula to rate the overall goodness of the action. Whichever action has the best overall rating is the one we should take.</p>\n<p>One possible way of squaring an endorsement of anti-realism with an apparent endorsement of these normative claims is to argue that people don’t actually have normative claims in mind when they write and talk about these issues. Non-cognitivists -- a particular variety of anti-realists -- argue that many utterances that seem at first glance like claims about normative facts are in fact nothing more than expressions of attitudes. For instance, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotivism\">emotivist</a> -- a further sub-variety of non-cognitivist -- might argue that the sentence “You should maximize the expected fulfillment of your current desires!” is simply a way of expressing a sense of fondness toward this course of action. The sentence might be cached out as being essentially equivalent in content to the sentence, “Hurrah, maximizing the expected fulfillment of your current desires!”</p>\n<p>Although a sizeable portion of philosophers are non-cognitivists, I generally don’t find it very plausible as a theory of what people are trying to do when they seem to make normative claims.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-9\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-9\">[9]</a></sup> In this case it doesn’t feel to me like most members of the rationalist community are just trying to describe one particular way of thinking and acting, which they happen to prefer to others. It seems to me, rather, that people often talk about updating your credences in accordance with Bayes' rule and maximizing the expected fulfillment of your current desires as the <em>correct</em> things to do.</p>\n<p>One more thing that stands out to me is that arguments for anti-realism often seem to be presented as though they implied (rather than negated) the truth of some of these normative claims. For example, the popular \"Replacing Guilt\" sequence on Minding Our Way seems to me to repeatedly attack normative realism. It <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/not-because-you-should/\">rejects</a> the idea of \"shoulds\" and <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/altruistic-motivations/\">points out</a> that there aren't \"any oughtthorities to ordain what is right and what is wrong.\"  But then it seems to draw normative implications out of these attacks: among other implications, you should \"just do what you want.\" At least taken at face value, this line of reaoning wouldn't be valid. It makes no more sense than reaoning that, if there are no facts about what we should do, then we should \"just maximize total hedonistic well-being” or \"just do the opposite of what we want” or \"just open up souvenir shops.” Of course, though, there's a good chance that I'm misunderstanding something here.</p>\n<p><strong>2.3 Decision Theory Research</strong></p>\n<p>A third point of tension is the community's engagement with normative decision theory research. Different normative decision theories pick out different necessary conditions for an action to be the one that a given person should take, with a focus on how one should respond to uncertainty (rather than on what ends one should pursue).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-10\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-10\">[10]</a></sup><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-11\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-11\">[11]</a></sup></p>\n<p>A typical version of <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/\">CDT</a> says that the action you should take at a particular point in time is the one that would <em>cause</em> the largest expected increase in value (under some particular framework for evaluating causation). A typical version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidential_decision_theory\">EDT</a> says that the action you should take at a particular point in time is the one that would, once you take it, allow you to rationally expect the most value. There are also alternative versions of these theories -- for instance, versions using <a href=\"https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672165.001.0001/acprof-9780199672165-chapter-2\"><em>risk-weighted</em> expected value maximization</a> or the criterion of <a href=\"https://philarchive.org/archive/TAREES\">stochastic dominance</a> -- that break from the use of pure expected value.</p>\n<p>I've pretty frequently seen it argued within the community (e.g. in the papers “<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/DeathInDamascus.pdf\">Cheating Death in Damascus</a>” and “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf\">Functional Decision Theory</a>”) that CDT and EDT are not “correct\" and that some other new theory such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060\">functional decision theory</a> is. But if anti-realism is true, then no decision theory is correct.</p>\n<p>Eliezier Yudkowsky's influential <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ddcsdA2c2XpNpE5x/newcomb-s-problem-and-regret-of-rationality\">early writing</a> on decision theory seems to me to take an anti-realist stance. It suggests that we can only ask meaningful questions about the effects and correlates of decisions. For example, in the context of the Newcomb thought experiment, we can ask whether one-boxing is correlated with winning more money.  But, it suggests, we cannot take a step further and ask what these effects and correlations imply about what it is \"reasonable\" for an agent to do (i.e. what they <em>should</em> do).  This question -- the one that normative decision theory research, as I understand it, is generally about  -- is seemingly dismissed as vacuous.</p>\n<p>If this apparently anti-realist stance is widely held, then I don't understand why the community engages so heavily with normative decision theory research or why it takes part in discussions about which decision theory is \"correct.\" It strikes me a bit like an atheist enthustiastically following theological debates about which god is the true god. But I'm mostly just confused here.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-12\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-12\">[12]</a></sup><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-13\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-13\">[13]</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>3. Sympathy for Realism</strong></p>\n<p>I wouldn’t necessarily describe myself as a realist. I get that realism is a weird position. It’s both metaphysically and epistemologically suspicious. What is this mysterious property of “should-ness” that certain actions are meant to possess -- and why would our intuitions about which actions possess it be reliable?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-14\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-14\">[14]</a></sup><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-15\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-15\">[15]</a></sup></p>\n<p>But I am also very sympathetic to realism and, in practice, tend to reason about normative questions as though I was a full-throated realist. My sympathy for realism and tendency to think as a realist largely stems from my perception that if we reject realism and internalize this rejection then there’s really not much to be said or thought about anything. We can still express attitudes at one another, for example suggesting that we like certain actions or credences in propositions better than others. We can present claims about the world, without any associated explicit or implicit belief that others should agree with them or respond to them in any particular way. And that seems to be about it.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if anti-realism is true, then it can’t also be true that we should believe that anti-realism is true. Belief in anti-realism seems to undermine itself. Perhaps belief in realism is self-undermining in a similar way -- if seemingly correct reasoning leads us to account for all the ways in which realism is a suspect position -- but the negative feedback loop in this case at least seems to me to be less strong.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-16\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-16\">[16]</a></sup></p>\n<p>I think that realism warrants more respect than it has historically received in the rationality community, at least relative to the level of respect it gets from philosophers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-17\" id=\"fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-17\">[17]</a></sup> I suspect that some of this lack of respect might come from a relatively weaker awareness of the cost of rejecting realism or of the way in which belief in anti-realism appears to undermine itself.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>I'm basing my the views I express in this post primarily off Derek Parfit’s writing, specifically his book <em>On What Matters</em>. For this reason, it seems pretty plausible to me that there are some important points I've missed by reading too narrowly. In addition, it also seems likely that some of the ways in which I talk about particular issues around normativity will sound a bit foreign or just generally “off” to people who are highly familiar with some of these issues. One unfortunate reason for this is that the study of normative questions and of the nature of normativity seems to me to be spread out pretty awkwardly across the field of philosophy, with philosophers in different sub-disciplines often discussing apparently interconnected questions in significant isolation of one another while using fairly different terminology. This means that (e.g.) meta-ethics and decision theory are seldom talked about at the same time and are often talked about in ways that make it difficult to see how they fit together. A major reason I am leaning on Parfit’s work is that he is -- to my knowledge -- one of relatively few philosophers to have tried to approach questions around normativity through a single unified framework. <a href=\"#fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This is a point that is also discussed at length in David Enoch’s book <em>Taking Morality Seriously</em> (pgs. 70-73):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps...we are essentially deliberative creatures. Perhaps, in other words, we cannot avoid asking ourselves what to do, what to believe, how to reason, what to care about. We can, of course, stop deliberating about one thing or another, and it’s not as if all of us have to be practical philosophers (well, if you’re reading this book, you probably are, but you know what I mean). It’s opting out of the deliberative project as a whole that may not be an option for us….</p>\n<p>[Suppose] law school turned out not to be all you thought it would be, and you no longer find the prospects of a career in law as exciting as you once did. For some reason you don’t seem to be able to shake off that old romantic dream of studying philosophy. It seems now is the time to make a decision. And so, alone, or in the company of some others you find helpful in such circumstances, you deliberate. You try to decide whether to join a law firm, apply to graduate school in philosophy, or perhaps do neither.</p>\n<p>The decision is of some consequence, and so you resolve to put some thought into it. You ask yourself such questions as: Will I be happy practicing law? Will I be happier doing philosophy? What are my chances of becoming a good lawyer? A good philosopher? How much money does a reasonably successful lawyer make, and how much less does a reasonably successful philosopher make? Am I, so to speak, more of a philosopher or more of a lawyer? As a lawyer, will I be able to make a significant political difference? How important is the political difference I can reasonably expect to make? How important is it to try and make any political difference? Should I give any weight to my father’s expectations, and to the disappointment he will feel if I fail to become a lawyer? How strongly do I really want to do philosophy? And so on. Even with answers to most – even all – of these questions, there remains the ultimate question. “All things considered”, you ask yourself, “what makes best sense for me to do? When all is said and done, what should I do? What shall I do?”</p>\n<p>When engaging in this deliberation, when asking yourself these questions, you assume, so it seems to me, that they have answers. These answers may be very vague, allow for some indeterminacy, and so on. But at the very least you assume that some possible answers to these questions are better than others. You try to find out what the (better) answers to these questions are, and how they interact so as to answer the arch-question, the one about what it makes most sense for you to do. You are not trying to create these answers. Of course, in an obvious sense what you will end up doing is up to you (or so, at least, both you and I are supposing here). And in another, less obvious sense, perhaps the answer to some of these questions is also up to you. Perhaps, for instance, how happy practicing law will make you is at least partly up to you. But, when trying to make up your mind, it doesn’t feel like just trying to make an arbitrary choice. This is just not what it is like to deliberate. Rather, it feels like trying to make the right choice. It feels like trying to find the best solution, or at least a good solution, or at the very least one of the better solutions, to a problem you’re presented with. What you’re trying to do, it seems to me, is to make the decision it makes most sense for you to make. Making the decision is up to you. But which decision is the one it makes most sense for you to make is not. This is something you are trying to discover, not create. Or so, at the very least, it feels like when deliberating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n <a href=\"#fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Specifically, the two relevant views can be described as realism and anti-realism with regard to “normativity.” We can divide the domain of “normativity” up into the domains of “<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/practical-reason/\">practical rationality</a>,” which describes what actions people should take, and “epistemic rationality,” which describes which beliefs or degrees of belief people should hold. The study of ethics, decision-making under uncertainty, and so on can then all be understood as sub-components of the study of practical rationality. For example, one view on the study of ethics is that it is the study of how factors other than one’s own preferences might play roles in determining what actions one should take. It should be noted that terminology varies very widely though. For example, different authors seem to use the word \"ethics\" more or less inclusively. The term \"moral realism\" also sometimes means roughly the same thing as \"normative realism,\" as I've defined it here, and sometimes picks out a more specific position. <a href=\"#fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>An an edit to the initial post, I think it's probably worth saying more about the concept of \"moral realism\" in relation to \"normative realism.\" Depending on the context, \"moral realism\" might be taken to refer to: (a) normative realism, (b) realism about practical rationality (not just epistemic rationality), (c) realism about practical rationality combined with the object-level belief that people should do more than just try to satisfy their own personal preferences, or (d) something else in this direction.</p>\n<p>One possible reason the term lacks a consensus definition is that, perhaps surprisingly, many contemporary \"moral realists\" aren't actually very preocuppied with the concept of \"morality.\" Popular books like <em>Taking Morality Seriously</em>, <em>On What Matters</em>, and <em>The Normative Web</em> spend most of their energy defending normative realism, more broadly, and my impression is that their critics spend most of their energy attacking normative realism more broadly. One reason for this shift in focus toward normative realism is the realization that, on almost any conception of \"moral realism,\" nearly all of the standard metaphysical and epistemological objections to \"moral realism\" also apply just as well to normative realism in general. Another reason is that any possible distinction between moral and normative-but-not-moral facts doesn't seem like it could have much practical relevance: If we know that we should make some decision, then we know that we should take it; we have no obvious additional need to know or care whether this normative fact warrants the label \"moral fact\" or not. Here, for example, is David Enoch, in <em>Taking Morality Seriously</em>, on the concept of morality (pg. 86):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What more...does it take for a normative truth (or falsehood) to qualify as moral? Morality is a particular instance of normativity, and so we are now in effect asking about its distinctive characteristics, the ones that serve to distinguish between the moral and the rest of the normative. I do not have a view on these special characteristics of the moral. In fact, I think that for most purposes this is not a line worth worrying about. The distinction within the normative between the moral and the non-moral seems to me to be shallow compared to the distinction between the normative and the non-normative - both philosophically, and, as I am about to argue, practically. (Once you know you have a reason to X and what this reason is, does it really matter for your deliberation whether it qualifies as a <em>moral reason</em>?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n <a href=\"#fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>There are two major strands of anti-realism.

I think this tendency to switch back and forth between describing decision theories in these two distinct ways can be seen both in papers proposing new decision theories and in online discussions. I also think this switching tendency can make things pretty confusing. Although it makes sense to discuss how an algorithm “performs” when “implemented,” once we specify a sufficiently precise performance metric, it does not seem to me to make sense to discuss the performance of a normative claim. I think the tendency to blur the distinction between algorithms and normative claims -- or, as Will MacAskill puts it in his recent and similar <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ySLYSsNeFL5CoAQzN/a-critique-of-functional-decision-theory\">critique</a>, between \"decision procedures\" and \"criteria of rightness\" -- partly explains why proponents of FDT and other new decision theories have not been able to get much traction with academic decision theorists. For example, causal decision theorists are well aware that people who always takes the actions that CDT says they should take will tend to fare less well in Newcomb scenarios than people who always take the actions that EDT says they should take. Causal decision theorists are also well aware that that there are some scenarios -- for example, a Newcomb scenario with a perfect predictor and the option to get brain surgery to pre-commit yourself to one-boxing -- in which there is no available sequence of actions such that CDT says you should take each of the actions in the sequence. If you ask a causal decision theorist what sort of algorithm you should (according to CDT) put into an AI system that will live in a world full of Newcomb scenarios, if the AI system won’t have the opportunity to self-modify, then I think it's safe to say a causal decision theorist won’t tell you to put in an algorithm that only produces actions that CDT says it should take. This tells me that we really can’t fluidly switch back and forth between making claims about the correctness of normative principles and claims about the performance of algorithms, as though there were a canonical one-to-one mapping between these two sorts of claims. Insofar as rationalist writing on decision theory tends to do this sort of switching, I suspect that it contributes to confusion on the part of many academic readers. See also this <a href=\"https://www.umsu.de/wo/2018/688\">blog post</a> by an academic decision theorist, Wolfgang Schwarz, for a much more thorough perspective on why proponents of FDT may be having difficulty getting traction within the academic decision theory community. <a href=\"#fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-12\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-13\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>A similar concern also leads me to assign low (p&lt;10%) probability to normative decision theory research ultimately being useful for avoiding large-scale accidental harm caused by AI systems. It seems to me like the question “What is the correct decision theory?” only has an answer if we assume that realism is true. But even if we assume that realism is true, we are now asking a normative question (“What criterion determines whether an action is one an agent ‘should’ take?”) as a way of trying to make progress on a non-normative question (“What approaches to designing advanced AI systems result in unintended disasters and which do not?”). Proponents of CDT and proponents of EDT do not actually disagree on how any given agent will behave, on what the causal outcome of assigning an agent a given algorithm will be, or on what evidence might be provided by the choice to assign an agent a given algorithm; they both agree, for example, about how much money different agents will tend to earn in the classic Newcomb scenario. What decision theorists appear to disagree about is a seperate normative question that floats above (or rather “<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/\">supervenes</a>” upon) questions about observed behavior or questions about outcomes. I don't see how answering this normative question could help us much in answering the non-normative question of what approaches to designing advanced AI systems don’t (e.g.) result in global catastrophe. Put another way, my concern is that the strategy here seems to rely on the hope that we can derive an “is” from an “ought.”</p>\n<p>However, in keeping with the above endnote, community work on decision theory only sometimes seems to be pitched (as it is in the abstract of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf\">this paper</a>) as an exploration of normative principles. It is also sometimes pitched as an exploration of how different “algorithms” “perform” across relevant scenarios. This exploration doesn't seem to me to have any direct link to the core academic decision theory literature and, given a sufficiently specific performance metric, does not seem to be inherently normative. I'm actually more optimistic, then, about this line of research having implications for AI development. Nonetheless, for reasons similar to the ones described in the post “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jzvDLtPkeLkpBEx9S/decision-theory-anti-realism\">Decision Theory Anti-Realism</a>,” I'm still not very optimistic. In the cases that are being considered, the answer to the question “Which algorithm performs best?” will depend on subtle variations in the set of counterfactuals we consider when judging performance; different algorithms come out on top for different sets of counterfactuals. For example, in a prisoner’s dilemma, the best-performing algorithm will vary depending on whether we are imaging a counterfactual world where just one agent was born with a different algorithm or a counterfactual world where both agents were born with different algorithms. It seems unclear to me where we go from here except perhaps to list several different sets of imaginary counterfactuals and note which algorithms perform best relative to them.</p>\n<p>Wolfgang Schwarz and Will MacAskill also make similar points, regarding the sensitivity of comparisons of algorithmic performance, in their essays on FDT. Schwarz writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yudkowsky and Soares constantly talk about how FDT \"outperforms\" CDT, how FDT agents \"achieve more utility\", how they \"win\", etc. As we saw above, it is not at all obvious that this is true. It depends, in part, on how performance is measured. At one place, Yudkowsky and Soares are more specific. Here they say that \"in all dilemmas where the agent's beliefs are accurate [??] and the outcome depends only on the agent's actual and counterfactual behavior in the dilemma at hand -- reasonable constraints on what we should consider \"fair\" dilemmas -- FDT performs at least as well as CDT and EDT (and often better)\". OK. But how we should we understand \"depends on ... the dilemma at hand\"? First, are we talking about subjunctive or evidential dependence? If we're talking about evidential dependence, EDT will often outperform FDT. And EDTers will say that's the right standard. CDTers will agree with FDTers that subjunctive dependence is relevant, but they'll insist that the standard Newcomb Problem isn't \"fair\" because here the outcome (of both one-boxing and two-boxing) depends not only on the agent's behavior in the present dilemma, but also on what's in the opaque box, which is entirely outside her control. Similarly for all the other cases where FDT supposedly outperforms CDT. Now, I can vaguely see a reading of \"depends on ... the dilemma at hand\" on which FDT agents really do achieve higher long-run utility than CDT/EDT agents in many \"fair\" problems (although not in all). But this is a very special and peculiar reading, tailored to FDT. We don't have any independent, non-question-begging criterion by which FDT always \"outperforms\" EDT and CDT across \"fair\" decision problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>MacAskill writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[A]rguing that FDT does best in a class of ‘fair’ problems, without being able to define what that class is or why it’s interesting, is a pretty weak argument. And, even if we could define such a class of cases, claiming that FDT ‘appears to be superior’ to EDT and CDT in the classic cases in the literature is simply begging the question: CDT adherents claims that two-boxing is the right action (which gets you more expected utility!) in Newcomb’s problem; EDT adherents claims that smoking is the right action (which gets you more expected utility!) in the smoking lesion. The question is which of these accounts is the right way to understand ‘expected utility’; they’ll therefore all differ on which of them do better in terms of getting expected utility in these classic cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n <a href=\"#fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-13\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-14\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>In my view, the epistemological issues are the most severe ones. I think Sharon Street’s paper <a href=\"https://fewd.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/inst_ethik_wiss_dialog/Street__Sharon_2006._A_Darwinian_Dilemma_for_Realist_Theories_of_Value..pdf\">A Darwinian Dilemma for Realist Theories of Value</a>, for example, presents an especially hard-to-counter attack on the realist position on epistemological grounds. She argues that, in the light of the view that our brains evolved via natural selection, and natural selection did not and could not have directly selected for the accuracy of our normative intuitions, it is extremely difficult to construct a compelling explanation for why our normative intuitions should be correlated in any way with normative facts. This technically leave open the possibility of there being non-trivial normative facts, without us having any way of perceiving or intuiting them, but this state of affairs would strike most people as absurd. Although some realists, including Parfit, have attempted to counter Street’s argument, I’m not aware of anyone who I feel has truly succeeded. Street's argument pretty much just seems to work to me. <a href=\"#fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-14\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-15\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>These metaphysical and epistemological issues become less concerning if we accept some version of “naturalist realism” which asserts that all normative claims can be reduced into claims about the natural world (i.e. claims about physical and psychological properties) and therefore tested in roughly the same way we might test any other claim about the natural world.  However, this view seems wrong to me.</p>\n<p>The bluntest objection to naturalist realism is what's sometimes called the \"just-too-different\" objection. This is the objection that, to many and perhaps most people, normative claims are just <em>obviously</em> a different sort of claim. No one has ever felt any inclination to evoke an \"is/is-made-of-wood divide\" or an \"is/is-illegal-in-Massachusetts divide,\" because the property of being made of wood and the propery of being illegal in Massachusetts are obviously properties of the standard (natural) kind. But references to the \"is/ought divide\" -- or, equivalently, the distinction between the \"positive\" and the \"normative\" -- are commonplace and don't typically provoke blank stares. Normative discussions are, seemingly, about something <em>above-and-beyond</em> and <em>distinct from</em> discussions of the physical and psychological aspects of a situation. When people debate whether or not it's \"wrong\" to support the death penalty or \"wrong\" for women to abort unwanted pregnancies, for example, it seems obvious that physical and psychological facts are typically not the core (or at least <em>only</em>) thing in dispute.</p>\n<p>G.E. Moore’s “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-question_argument\">Open Question Argument</a>\" elaborates on this objection. The argument also raises the point that that, in many cases where we are inclined to ask “What should I do?”, it seems like what we are inclined to ask goes above-and-beyond any individual question we might ask about the natural world. Consider again the case where we are considering a career change and wondering what we should do. It seems like we could know all of the natural facts -- facts like how happy will we be on average while pursuing each career, how satisfied will we feel looking back on each career, how many lives we could improve by donating money made in each career, what labor practices each company has, how disappointed our parents will be if we pursue each career, how our personal values will change if we pursue each career, what we would end up deciding at the end of one hypothetical deliberative process or another, etc. -- and still retain the inclination to ask, “Given all this, what should I do?” This means that -- insofar as we're taking the realist stance that this question actually has a meaningful answer, rather than rejecting the question as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yA4gF5KrboK2m2Xu7/how-an-algorithm-feels-from-inside\">vacuous</a> -- the claim that we \"should\" do one thing or another cannot easily be understood as a claim about the natural world. A set of claims about the natural world may <em>support</em> the claim that we should make a certain decision, but, in cases such as this one, it seems like no set of claims about the natural world is <em>equivalent</em> to the claim that we should make a certain decision.</p>\n<p>A last objection to mention is Parfit’s “Triviality Objection” (<em>On What Matters</em>, Section 95).  The basic intuition behind Parfit’s objection is that pretty much any attempt to define the word “should” in terms of natural properties would turn many normative claims into puzzling assertions of either obvious tautologies or obvious falsehoods. For example, consider a man who is offered -- at the end of his life, I guess by the devil or something -- the option of undergoing a year of certain torture for a one-in-a-trillion chance of receiving a big prize: a trillion years of an equivalently powerful positive experience, plus a single lollipop. He is purely interested in experiencing pleasure and avoiding pain and would like to know whether he should take the offer. A decision theorist who endorses expected desire-fulfillment maximisation says that he “should,” since the lollipop tips the offer over into having slightly positive expected value. A decision theorist who endorses risk aversion says he “should not,” since the man is nearly certain to be horribly tortured without receiving any sort of compensation. In this context, it’s hard to understand how we could redefine the claim “He should take action X” in terms of natural properties and have this disagreement make any sense. We could define the phrase as meaning “Action X maximizes expected fulfillment of desire,” but now the first decision theorist is expressing an obvious tautology and the second decision theorist is expressing an obvious falsehood. We could also try, in keeping with a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARtkT3EYox3THYjF/rationality-is-systematized-winning\">suggestion</a> by Eliezer Yudkowsky, to define the phrase as meaning “Action X is the one that someone acting in a winning way would take.” But this is obviously too vague to imply a particular action; taking the gamble is associated with some chance of winning and some chance of losing. We could make the definition more specific -- for instance, saying “Action X is the one that someone acting in a way that maximizes expected winning would take” -- but now of course we’re back in tautology mode. The apparent upshot, here, is that many normative claims simply can’t be interpreted as non-trivially true or non-trivially false claims about natural properties. The associated disagreements only become sensible if we interpret them as being about something above-and-beyond these properties.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is surely true that <em>some</em> of the claims people make using the word “should” can be understood as claims about the natural world. Words can, after all, be used in many different ways. But it’s the claims that can’t easily be understood in this way that non-naturalist realists such as Parfit, Enoch, and Moore have in mind. In general, I agree with the view that the key division in metaethics is between self-identified non-naturalist realists on the one hand and self-identified anti-realists and naturalist realists on the other hand, since “naturalist realists” are in fact anti-realists with regard to the distinctively normative properties of decisions that non-naturalist realists are talking about. If we rule out non-naturalist realism as a position then it seems the main remaining question is a somewhat boring one about semantics: When someone makes a statement of form “A should do X,” are they most commonly expressing some sort of attitude (non-cognitivism), making a claim about the natural world (naturalist realism), or making a claim about some made-up property that no actions actually possess (error theory)?</p>\n<p>Here, for example, is how Michael Huemer (a non-naturalist realist) expresses this point in his book <em>Ethical Intuitionism</em> (pg. 8):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Non-naturalist realists] differ fundamentally from everyone else in their view of the world. [Naturalist realists], non-cognitivists, and nihilists all agree in their basic view of the world, for they have no significant disagreements about what the non-evaluative facts are, and they all agree that there are no further facts over and above those. They agree, for example, on the non-evaluative properties of the act of stealing, and they agree, contra the [non-naturalist realists], that there is no further, distinctively evaluative property of the act. Then what sort of dispute do the [three] monistic theories have? I believe that, though this is not generally recognized, their disputes with each other are merely semantic. Once the nature of the world 'out there' has been agreed upon, semantic disputes are all that is left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this attitude is in line with the viewpoint that Luke Muehlhauser expresses in his classic LessWrong blog post on what he calls “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3zDX3f3QTepNeZHGc/pluralistic-moral-reductionism\">pluralistic moral reductionism</a>.” PMR seems to me to be the view that: (a) non-naturalist realism is false, (b) all remaining meta-normative disputes are purely semantic, and (c) purely semantic disputes aren't terribly substantive and often reflect a failure to accept that the same phrase can be used in different ways.  If we define the view this way, then, <em>conditional on non-naturalist realism being false</em>, I believe that PMR is the correct view. I believe that many non-naturalist realists would agree on this point as well. <a href=\"#fnref-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-15\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-uNQxgS8esQChtvHkb-16\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This point is made by Parfit in <em>On What Matters</em>.

Similarly, to ground an emotionally-loaded claim, you give an example of a specific situation that you'd mentally classify within that claim.</p><p>Let’s look at a couple examples of people introspecting on the specific causes of their emotions.</p><h2>A \"Disgusting Slob\" Roommate (h/t <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific\">Eliezer</a>)</h2><p>Tim feels strongly that his roommate Rob is a disgusting slob, so he says, “Hey Rob, can you stop being such a slob?” and Rob says “I’m not a slob, you’re a neat freak!” And they start to hate each other.</p><p>Let’s see how Tim can do better by activating his specificity powers!</p><p>In general, when you activate your specificity powers on an emotional claim you've made, you might end up instantly demolishing the claim, like a boy who's made to realize that there's nothing inherently \"mean\" about his sister giving him a soft punch on the arm. But if you find that your emotion <em>can</em> be coherently grounded in the specific stimuli you've experienced, then you can at least figure out a <em>specific counterfactual situation</em> under which your emotional response would no longer be triggered.</p><p>Let's see what happens in Tim's case.</p><p>First, Tim grounds his concept of a “disgusting slob”: Tim posits that “someone who often leaves soda cans on the table, often leaves dishes in the sink, and never vacuums” is a specific stimulus that would be sufficient to mentally classify anyone as a disgusting slob. So Rob really <em>is</em> currently a disgusting slob, from the perspective of Tim's emotional processes.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*GW6wCvXy0xhZJhXw.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>But at least Tim can figure out a specific counterfactual situation under which his emotional response would no longer be triggered: If Rob were to stop leaving soda cans on the table, stop leaving dishes in the sink, and vacuum sometimes, then Rob would no longer have any of the specific characteristics that comprise Tim’s emotionally-loaded concept of “slob”. At that point, Tim’s feeling of Rob “being a slob” will be demolished. Rob wouldn’t be a slob anymore.</p><p>As an empathetic guy, Tim thinks the term \"disgusting\" is too harshly judgmental of poor Rob. But Tim doesn't have much control over the emotional part of his brain, the part that automatically applies abstract concept-labels like \"disgusting\" to stimuli before his sense of empathy gets a chance to weigh in. Tim's emotional brain automatically slides specific stimuli <em>up</em> the ladder of abstraction, and all Tim can do is painstakingly reverse-engineer the process.</p><h2>An \"Unfriendly\" Q&amp;A Community</h2><p>When you slide any concept up or down the ladder of abstraction, you may find that the lower-level description of reality has a different qualitative character than the higher-level description. This is called \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence\">emergence</a>\". For instance, liquid water emerges from a set of non-wet H2O molecules.</p><p>Similarly, an emotional judgment about a set of specific things may not apply to any of the things individually. We can call this <strong>emotional emergence</strong>. For instance, Sara Chipps, Director of Public Q&amp;A at Stack Overflow, recently <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/18/building-community-inclusivity-stack-overflow/\">posted</a> about a time when she felt \"attacked and diminished\" by her coworkers:</p><blockquote>On a Friday afternoon, we introduced a new company-wide policy that I felt was relatively benign. What happened next was that, from my point of view, the engineering team completely lost it. No one agreed with this policy, and they made it known over seemingly hundreds of Slack pings. After an afternoon of going back and forth, I walked away feeling emotionally drained. What had happened to my amazing coworkers that were so kind and wonderful? I felt attacked and diminished. It seemed people weren’t valuing my work or my judgment.</blockquote><blockquote>[...] As I went back through that Friday afternoon chat log, I was shocked to see that no one had been hurling insults. There was no one saying mean things about me or attacking my efficacy directly.</blockquote><blockquote>[...] My coworkers hadn’t become monsters, they were still the kind and caring people I thought they were. The monster in this case is not one person, it was created when lots of people, even with great intentions, publicly disagreed with you at the same time.</blockquote><p>Sara realized that this incident is related to why new users of Stack Overflow's Q&amp;A community often reported feeling that the community is \"unfriendly\". It's another example of emotional emergence:</p><blockquote>In our developer survey results we read things like this:<br><strong>“</strong><em>Caustic community for new users. There is no excuse for not being kind!</em>”  [...] <strong>“</strong><em>People could be less brutal</em>”  [...]<br>However, when our more experienced users hear this feedback they ask us to provide them with definitive examples of WHERE EXACTLY people are being unfriendly? There isn’t a lot of name calling or anger, why are they being accused of being unfriendly?</blockquote><p>When we first learn the survey participants' judgment that Stack Overflow is \"unfriendly”, we might mistakenly conclude that individual members of the community must not be acting friendly enough. The Stack Overflow team didn't jump to that conclusion; they kept an open mind while figuring out how to ground \"unfriendly\".</p><p>The team realized that the unfriendliness was triggered by how their site design colocates an overwhelming amount of negative feedback onto the same screen:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*wlD45Euy35ZRJnQx\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>The judgment \"unfriendly\" turned out to be triggered by a combination of specific stimuli that were&nbsp;all fixable without improving the friendliness of any individual community members.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Being emotionally mature is pretty straightforward. So why aren't people more emotionally mature?</p><p>We've <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pFvZXFWbtvKvGiACJ/how-specificity-works\">seen</a> that sliding concepts down the ladder of abstraction generally goes against the grain of your typical flow of thoughts. It's hard cognitive work.</p><p>Introspecting on the specific causes of your emotions is usually even harder work, because your brain is also spinning up various automatic processes as part of the emotional reaction you're having. If you're happy, your brain spins up processes to celebrate and spread your excitement. If you're angry, your brain spins up processes to yell and stomp around and plot revenge.</p><p>By building up your specificity muscles, you'll have an easier time using them in emotionally-charged situations, so you'll be more emotionally mature.</p><p><strong>Next post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CD2kRisJcdBRLhrC5/the-power-to-teach-concepts-better\">The Power to Teach Concepts Better</a></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>LessWrong is about learning rationality, and applying rationality to interesting problems. </p><p>An issue is that solving interesting problems often requires fairly deep technical knowledge of a field.

As such, this story&#x27;s wording is a bit unusual.)</p><p>Without ado:</p><br/><blockquote>On a cool autumn day, two girls found a dark hollow. At 14 and 16, Otu and Lai had no grasp of what risks its winding corridors could hold. Lai, always an analyst, was curious what lay at its bottom, if it had a bottom at all. Otu, young and timid, saw no option but to tag along.  </blockquote><blockquote>It wasn’t long until that hollow’s mouth was a long-ago ghost of a thought. Lai’s hand ran along dank rock walls just to find a way to walk; sunlight had all but quit our protagonists.</blockquote><blockquote>“I know this wall!” Lai would say now and again. “Now I can find us a way out!”</blockquote><blockquote>On no occasion did this pan out, and following six dud calls, Lai didn’t try again.</blockquote><blockquote>“Damn,” said Lai at last. “Okay, I couldn’t hold a full map of this hollow in my mind. But you know what? Turning right at all junctions should work to bring us back out. That’s a fact I know from math class, so it <em>has</em> to work.”</blockquote><blockquote>But that was a no-go too; it wasn’t <em>always turning right</em> that would bring you out; it was <em>always</em> <em>following a wall</em> that would do it. Lai’s slip cost an hour, at which point both girls had to stop walking and sit down for a bit. Gloom sprung up, and spans of quick sobs took turns with spans of calm.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally Otu lay down, admitting that touching a bit of dirt was worth not having an aching butt from sitting for so long. Might so much as a nap stand as too high a wish?</blockquote><blockquote>It did, for Otu’s torso hit not ground but a plastic chassis.</blockquote><blockquote>“Ouch! What was that?”</blockquote><blockquote>Lai sat up. “What’s what?</blockquote><blockquote>Otu’s hand found it, took it, hit it, hit it again, and ran along its plastic skin, trying to find out what it was. It was long-ish, a tubular form, with a sort of protrusion on its top. It was mostly rough and hard, though its protrusion’s front was smooth and glassy. It also had a small switch on it. Flipping that switch did nothing at first, but…</blockquote><blockquote>O brilliant light! Abruptly a hollow priorly dark and boding was brightly lit and allowing, possibly, of a happy conclusion.</blockquote><blockquote>Otu’s jaw hung, and said nothing.</blockquote><blockquote>“Fascinating!” said Lai. “Can I hold it?”</blockquote><blockquote>Now it was Lai’s hand that took it, hit it, ran along its plastic skin. It was an amazing apparatus, and Lai was profoundly curious how it did what it did. So captivating, just to look at it…</blockquote><blockquote>Shortly, Otu said “Um, don’t you want to start trying to find our way out? I think with this much light it won’t—”</blockquote><blockquote>“Hang on, hang on,” said Lai. “I want to know how this thing works. Light must form in this part, right? Or no, wait, it could build up in this long body and spill out on command. This switch could control a trap door. Oh, or mayhap God monitors it and calls down light if—”</blockquote><blockquote>“Lai! I know this stuff is fun for you, but shouldn’t you and I focus on finding a way out first?”</blockquote><blockquote>Lai wasn’t paying any mind. “—a mirror. That way any light it spawns would, uh… oh! Or it could just <em>trick</em> you into thinking it’s making light, but it’s actually an illusion! If that’s it, it’s still dark, and using this thing to try to find a way out will bring us <em>away</em> from our goal. Or—”</blockquote><blockquote>Otu was almost crying now. “What? You <em>know</em> it’s light, just <em>look! </em>How can you find that stupid contraption so alluring right now?”</blockquote><blockquote>This didn’t stop Lai’s mumbling and puzzling. No, nothing could stop it at this point. Lai’s curiosity had no bounds and no limits: it could sustain a distraction for infinity, blind to crucial situational factors, blind to rising panic, blind to logic.</blockquote><blockquote>And so, our two girls stood in a dark hollow’s gut, having a tool that could bring faith of finding a way back out, but failing to apply it to that task. For all that tool could do, for all its magic — that was void if its cryptic quality was too much of a distraction for its claimant to actually put it to work.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m afraid my story cuts off at this point — I don’t know if Otu and Lai got out of that hollow. I want to think that Otu finally got to Lai, that what was actually important finally won out against what was shiny and fun to think about. But I don’t know.</blockquote><blockquote>Stay vigilant, folks. Lai’s flub looks obvious from this standpoint, but foolish distraction is an insidious bastard — anybody can fall victim to it.</blockquote>",

In this post, we&#x2019;ll\n    generalize that problem to help determine useful categories. But before we go on, what&#x2019;s wrong with these\n    arguments?</p>\n<p>Ex. 1 [Stolen from slatestarcodex] </p>\n<blockquote>&#x201C;A few months ago, a friend confessed that she had abused her boyfriend. I was shocked, because this\n    friend is one of the kindest and gentlest people I know. I probed for details. She told me that sometimes she needed\n    her boyfriend to do some favor for her, and he wouldn&#x2019;t, so she would cry &#x2013; not as an attempt to\n    manipulate him, just because she was sad. She counted this as abuse, because her definition of &#x201C;abuse&#x201D;\n    is &#x201C;something that makes your partner feel bad about setting boundaries&#x201D;. And when she cried, that\n    made her boyfriend feel guilty about his boundary that he wasn&#x2019;t going to do the favor.&#x201D;</blockquote>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">By this definition of &#x201C;abuse&#x201D;, a majority of people are &#x201C;abusive&#x201D;.\n        It would be better to reserve that word for a smaller group of people who are intentionally manipulating people.\n    </p>\n</div>\n<p>Ex. 2: I also had a friend that was &#x201C;one of the nicest people everyone knows, wow she listens so\n    well!&#x201D;. She admitted that she was actually &#x201C;selfish and manipulative&#x201D; because she did nice\n    things to people so they&#x2019;d like her. </p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">I honestly wish everyone was as &#x201C;selfish and manipulative&#x201D; as this girl;\n        however, it makes those two words nearly useless. It would be better to reserve those words for people who\n        create win-lose situations (You give, I take) as opposed to win-win situations (Oh wow, you make me feel\n        important. I want to be your friend). </p>\n</div>\n<h1>General Frame</h1>\n<p>What is the general frame of the problem in the two scenarios? You have 2 minutes. </p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">The claim relies on a &#x201C;bad definition&#x201D; of a word. It&#x2019;s\n        &#x201C;bad&#x201D; because my expectations weren&#x2019;t met. If you say you&#x2019;re selfish, then I expect\n        that you create win-lose situations, but if all you&#x2019;re actually a really nice person, then you misled me.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">In another way, I can say if you meet the qualifications a,b,c, then you are a member of that\n        category. The problem arises when you have the &#x201C;wrong&#x201D; qualifications, as in, the person you were\n        talking to was expecting different qualifications. </p>\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">X meets qualifications a,b,c for [word]: -&gt; X is [word]</p>\n</div>\n<p>Now that you have a new frame to fit everything in, let&#x2019;s dive in to a couple curveballs.</p>\n<p>Ex. 3: If God was all-powerful, could he make a rock so big that he couldn&#x2019;t lift it?</p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">This is about the qualifications of the word &#x201C;all-powerful&#x201D;, and it&#x2019;s\n        implying that one of those qualifications is &#x201C;can create a situation that unqualifies itself as\n        all-powerful&#x201D;. You could define all-powerful that way; however, I (and most other people) are expecting a\n        definition that means &#x201C;has a lot of power/abilities&#x201D; like miracles, time travel, etc and not\n        something paradoxical.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Ex. 4: Is a hotdog a sandwich?</p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Considering just preserving expectations, if someone asked me to make them a sandwich, and I\n        went to hand them either (A) Ham sandwich, (B) Tomato w/ mayo sandwich, or (C ) Hotdog, which one would most\n        surprise them?</p>\n</div>\n<p>Ex. 5: If a tree falls in the woods, and no one is around to hear it, would it make a sound?</p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">What qualifies as a sound? If we agree that it&#x2019;s vibrational waves between 20Hz-20kHz,\n        then it made a sound. If we agree that there has to be someone to hear it, then it didn&#x2019;t make a sound.\n        Since the purpose is communication/ expectation preservation, we can just agree on a set of qualifications,\n        solve the philosophical problem, and move on. </p>\n</div>\n<h1>Ideal Algorithm</h1>\n<p>What algorithm were you running? What&#x2019;s an ideal algorithm for correcting these types of arguments? You have 3\n    minutes (The previous examples should fit in your algorithm)</p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">1. What is the key word?</p>\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">2. What are their qualifications for that word?</p>\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">3. What are the desired qualifications given the context?</p>\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">4. If (2) and (3) disagree, then argue about which set of qualifications provide clearer\n        communication given the context. </p>\n</div>\n<p>Running this algorithm on the previous examples is easy, except for the &#x201C;tree falling in the woods&#x201D;.\n    The key word is &#x201C;sound&#x201D;, but there is no &#x201C;(3) desired qualification&#x201D; for sound in this\n    case. If there is no agreed qualification, then what&#x2019;s needed is to <em>agree on a qualification</em>.\n    Updating</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>What is the key word?</li>\n    <li>What are their qualifications for that word?</li>\n    <li>What are the desired qualifications given the context?</li>\n    <li><strong>If 3 doesn&#x2019;t exist, then agree on a set of qualifications. </strong></li>\n    <li>Else if (2) and (3) disagree, then argue about which set of qualifications provide clearer communication given\n        the context. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>What are the differences/similarities/relationships between this and Proving Too Much? You have 3 minutes</p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">My framing of Proving Too Much is a subset of this (I did kind of gave that away in the\n        intro). It&#x2019;s about the category of 100% Truth/accurate predictions/ map-territory correspondances in the\n        context of wanting to find actually true things that reflect reality. I ex<em>pect a</em> qualification to lead\n        to only true claims; however, if it implies false or inconsistent claims, then my expectations are violated and\n        that qualification is wrong. </p>\n</div>\n<p>Hard exercise: The category of 100% true reasons to believe things should have no members. How would you construct a\n    category for 0-100% beliefs that is actually more useful?</p>\n<p>With this algorithm down, let&#x2019;s tackle a few more problems. </p>\n<h1>Final Problem Set</h1>\n<p>Ex. 6: That salad with cucumbers on it should be called a fruit salad, because cucumbers are botanically a fruit</p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">The key word is &#x201C;fruit salad&#x201D;. Most people who order a fruit salad at a\n        restaurant and get cucumbers as their &#x201C;fruit&#x201D; would not be happy because their expectations were\n        violated. As the saying goes, the customer is always right. </p>\n</div>\n<p>Ex. 7: Christianity is true to me like Islam is true to someone else. </p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">If I told someone that I made them soup and put a bowl of cereal in front of them, then they\n        might laugh or be disappointed. Both implies a violation of expectation.</p>\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Oh, I don&#x2019;t mean true in that way, but I am talking about something close, let&#x2019;s\n        call it &#x201C;reflects reality&#x201D; instead of truth. Like if Christianity reflects reality, then if I\n        built a time machine, I should be able to go back in time, see Jesus die, be buried, and rise again. Then the\n        bible reflects reality. If Islam reflects reality, then I should be able to go back in time and see Jesus ascend\n        to heaven, but not die or resurrect. Then the Quran reflects reality. So the Bible and the Quran can&#x2019;t\n        both reflect reality since they&#x2019;re predicting I would see two different things. Does what I&#x2019;m\n        trying to say make sense? </p>\n</div>\n    <p>Ex. 8: </p>\n    <blockquote>&quot;Let&apos;s run further than we ran yesterday&quot;</blockquote>\n    <blockquote>&quot;You mean *farther&quot;</blockquote>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Using the more grammatically correct word doesn&apos;t change our expectations. In either\n        case, I&apos;d expect to run a greater distance than yesterday.</p>\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">This is interesting because it generalizes to all grammar corrections that don&apos;t change\n        expectations when the context is communication. If the context is instead signalling competence (like a resume),\n        then it would be important. </p>\n</div>\n    <p>Ex. 9: Is cereal soup?</p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">This one is interesting because it&#x2019;s saying the qualifications for the word\n        &#x201C;true&#x201D; are different than in Proving Too Much. Instead of being abrasive and claiming the word\n        &#x201C;true&#x201D; as mine and can only mean one thing, I can instead just <a\n            href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words\">Taboo</a> the word and replace it\n        with its meaning. </p>\n</div>\n    <p>Ex. 10: Is water wet?</p>\n<div class=\"spoilers\">\n    <p class=\"spoiler-v2\">If someone told me the pool water is wet, I&apos;d think they were saying something trivially\n        true to be silly. If they told me, in all seriousness, the water isn&apos;t wet, then I might think the water is\n        fake/an illusion or that generally something is wrong with the water. So in the context of two normal people\n        communicating, water is expected to be described as wet. (If the context is chemistry research papers, there may\n        be a different answer)</p>\n</div>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>One of the purposes of arguing well is clear communication. When talking to someone else (or yourself!), knowing\n    what key words means to each person aids in understanding each other and helps in avoiding confusion. </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a8iQ3oT4kZvraTvrZ/false-dilemmas-w-exercises\">the next post</a>,\n    we&#x2019;ll be discussing false dilemmas, how they arise, and how to deal with them. What&apos;s wrong with the\n    classic example:</p>\n<p>&quot;You&apos;re either with me, or against me!&quot;</p>\n<p>[Feel free to comment your answer to the hard question and if you got different answers/ generalizations/\n    algorithms than I did. Same if you feel like you hit on something interesting or that there&apos;s a concept I\n    missed.

    "htmlBody": "<p>\n\n\nOne of the things I have the hardest time with is focus.  I have times when\nfocus comes easily, and I get a week's worth of work done in hours, come up\nwith ideas that need sustained thinking, write blog posts that have been\nbouncing around my head for years.  Other times my attention is flighty, and I\nhave to struggle to keep myself from finding low-investment sources of\nentertainment.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe biggest component of this is how excited I am.  When I really get\ninto something, that's when focus comes easily.  I recently finished a\nproject at work where I was building something that dramatically\nimproved something the team had found frustrating for years.  I could\nsee where I wanted it to go, and I was excited enough that when I ran\ninto issues I pushed at it until I had good solutions for them.  The\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/bass-whistle\">bass whistle</a> project was another one like\nthis, where I couldn't think of anything else for about a week, until\nI had something coded up and working.  I didn't need to make myself\nfocus, I needed to make myself do the rest of my life.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nA lot of other factors matter, but are mediated by excitement.  Short iteration\ncycles, where I can quickly find out whether something worked, are so important\nto me because they keep the excitement from draining away.  Doing something no\none has done before, that a lot of people are going to like, that needs doing\nurgently, or that I've been thinking about for a long time all help, but mostly\nbecause those are exciting things.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn-person collaboration also helps, in at least two ways.  When I'm\nworking with someone, talking to them directly, it feels like ideas\nflow much better.  It's most fun when we have complementary skills,\neach filling in for and learning from the other, but even when the\nother person is inexperienced it still helps to have another person's\nworth of working memory.  And then if I'm working one-on-one with\nsomeone I can't respond to brief roadblocks by letting myself get\ndistracted.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere's also a component of mental patterns: if I'm in the habit of tabbing\nover to Facebook I'll fall out of focus more easily. [1] The hard part for me\nis that I'm often doing work that is full of short breaks that should be fine\nto fill: waiting for compiles, for queries, for tests.  This means that when\nI've tried to make myself rules like \"no distraction activities\" I either get\nbored enough waiting for things that I can't stick to the rule, or I learn how\nto turn some previously fine activity into a diversion.  The feeling of \"I\ncan't make progress right now, let's distract\" is shared between \"my code's\ncompiling\", where waiting will help, and \"this problem is hard\", where waiting\n(mostly) won't.  How well I'm able to distinguish these in the moment varies,\nhowever, and I'm not all that good at it.  This also means that if I'm doing a\nkind of work that lends itself to unbroken effort (washing dishes, framing a\nwall, coding something that's fully in my head) then I'm much more likely to\njust work until I'm done.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere are also kinds of work where I need to be in a very\ndistraction-prone mindset.  Analysis is often like this for me, where\nI relax my barrier between having an idea and trying it.  Sometimes\nthis leads me to explore aspects of a problem that are really\npromising, and other times it leads me to explore the history of\nbi-level railcars.  You would think this would be very easy to reign\nin, and it is for me when I'm excited about the analysis, but my\nexcitement can go off in pretty random directions.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnother aspect is that when I have something I have to do that I'm just not\nexcited about, it's really hard to get myself to do it.  I do have strategies,\nlike sitting down with just a piece of paper or a single browser tab and\ntelling myself I can't get up until I've hit some criteria, but it goes very\nslowly and is very unpleasant.  Sometimes leaving tasks like this until I do\nget excited about them helps, but not if I never end up feeling that way.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn the other direction, I've done some of my best work while\ndistracted from something else that I was supposed to be doing: my\nsense of what's exciting sometimes gets at something my conscious\nprioritization doesn't.  Additionally, \"doing things when I'm excited\nabout them\" often means \"do things when they're most tractable\".  I'm\nnervous about breaking something that overall has outcomes I like.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSome of this feels like what Constantin describes in <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2019/07/20/the-costs-of-reliability/\">The\nCosts of Reliability</a>.  The whole post is good, but in particular:\n\"people given an open-ended mandate to do what they like can be far\nmore efficient than people working to spec... at the cost of\nunpredictable output with no guarantees of getting what you need when\nyou need it\".\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere's also a lot that resonates in Graham's <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/distraction.html\">Disconnecting\nDistraction</a>, including \"Another reason it was hard to notice the\ndanger of this new type of distraction was that social customs hadn't\nyet caught up with it. If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa\nwatching TV, I'd have noticed very quickly. That's a known danger\nsign, like drinking alone. But using the Internet still looked and\nfelt a lot like work.\"  Time holes and culture of handling them are\nboth evolving, and figuring out how to keep from falling into them\ninvolves constantly learning how to tell good from bad uses.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOverall, this both is and isn't a big problem for me.  It isn't, in\nthat I am often very focused and get a lot done, at work and at home.\nIt is, in a sense of opportunity cost: possibly I could be doing a lot\nmore if I were able to focus more by either (a) influencing my\nexcitement or (b) doing important things without excitement.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI initially wrote this as a \"here's where I am\" post, but rereading it\nI do have a few ideas:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Putting more effort into recognizing the cases where \"wait a bit\"\nwill help me make progress</li>\n<li>Bring a book to work to read during times when waiting really is\nthe best next step, since it's both much less addictive than a digital\ndevice and better understood.</li>\n<li>Spending more time working directly with others.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n<br>\n\n[1] A strong correlate for this with me is, if I put a piece of chocolate in my\nmouth, do I chew it or am I able to wait and enjoy it slowly?  And, weirdly,\nthis seems to still give signal even though I now use it for self-evaluation.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100111340579422\">facebook</a></i></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This is the first post in the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FthQatMGBajcFt7Sj/arguing-well-sequence\">Arguing Well</a> sequence. This post is influenced by Scott Alexander's write up on <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/13/proving-too-much/\">Proving too Much</a>. </em></p><p><em>[edit: Reformatted the post as a Problem/Solution to clarify what I'm trying to claim]</em></p><h1>The Problem</h1><p>One of the purposes of arguing well is to figure out what is true. A very common type of bad argument claims something like this:</p><blockquote>Because of reason X, I am 100% confident in belief Y</blockquote><p>I don't know of any reason that leads to 100% truth all the time (and if you do, please let me know!), and it's usually hard to reason with the person until this faulty logic is dealt with first. This is the purpose of this post.</p><p>Assuming the context of all exercises is with someone claiming 100% belief for that one reason, what's wrong with the following:</p><p>Ex. 1: I believe that Cthulhu exists because that’s just how I was raised. </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">How someone was raised doesn’t make something true or not. In fact, I could be raised to believe that Cthulhu doesn’t exist. We can’t both be right.</p></div><p>Ex. 2: I believe that a goddess is watching over me because it makes me feel better and helps me get through the day. </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Just because believing it makes you feel better doesn’t make it true. Kids might feel better believing in Santa Claus, but that doesn’t make him actually exist. </p></div><h1>Generalized Model</h1><p>How would you generalize the common problem in the above arguments? You have 2 minutes</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">The common theme that I see is that same logic that proves the original claim, also proves something false. It “Proves too much” because it also proves false things. I like to think of this logic as “Qualifications for 100% truth”, and whatever qualifications proves the original claim can also prove a false claim. </p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Truth Qualifications -&gt; Claim</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Same Truth Qualifications -&gt; Absurd Claim</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Important Note: the purpose of this frame isn't to win an argument/ prove anything. It's to differentiate between heuristics that claim 100% success rates vs ones that claim a more accurate estimates. Imagine \"I'm 100% confident I'll roll 7's with my two die cause of my luck!\" vs \"There's a 6/36 chance I'll roll 7's because I'm assuming two fair die\"</p></div><p>Let’s work a couple more examples with this model. </p><p>Ex. 3: My startup is guaranteed to succeed because it uses quantum machine learning on a blockchain!</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">A startup using buzzwords doesn’t make it succeed. In fact, there are several startups that use those terms and failed. </p></div><p>Ex. 4: Of course I believe in evolution! Stephen Hawking believes it, and he’s really smart. </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">A smart person believing something doesn’t make it true. In fact, smart people often disagree and I bet there’s a person with Mensa-level IQ that doesn’t believe in evolution. </p></div><p>Ex. 5: This paper’s result has to be true since it has p &lt; 0.05! </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">A paper having a p value less than 0.05 doesn’t mean it’s true. In fact, there are several papers that disagree with each other with p &lt; 0.05. Also, homeopathy ha<a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-5-115\">s <u>been shown to </u>h</a>ave a p value &lt; 0.005!  </p></div><h1>Ideal Algorithm</h1><p>What algorithm were you running when you solved the above problems? Is there a more ideal/general algorithm? You have 3 minutes.</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">1. What does this person believe?</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">2. Why do they believe it?</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">3. Generalize that reasoning</p><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">4. What’s something crazy I can prove with this reasoning?</p></div><p>The algorithm I actu<em>ally ran fel</em>t like a mix of 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3, and then 4, but without literally thinking those words in my head. </p><p>Now to practice that new, ideal algorithm you made.</p><h1>Final Problem Sets</h1><p>Ex. 6: I believe in my religion because of faith (defined as hope)</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Hoping in something doesn’t make it true. I can hope to make a good grade on a test, but that doesn’t mean that I will make a good grade. Studying would probably help more than hoping. (Here I provided a counter-example as required and an additional counter-reason)</p></div><p>Ex. 7: I believe in my religion because of faith (defined as trust)</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Trusting in something doesn’t make it true. I can trust that my dog won’t bite people, but then someone steps on her paw and she bites them. Trusting that my dog won’t bite people doesn’t make my dog not bite people.</p></div><p>Ex. 8: I believe in a soul because I have a really strong gut feeling. </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">Having a strong gut feeling doesn’t make it true. In juries, people can even have conflicting gut feelings about a crime. If a jury was trying to determine if I was guilty, I would want them to use the evidence available and not their gut feeling. (Again, I added an additional counter-reason)</p></div><p>Ex. 9: I believe in my religion because I had a really amazing, transformative experience. </p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">There are several religions that claim contradictory beliefs, and also have several people who have had really great, transformative experiences. </p></div><p>Ex. 10: I believe in my religion because there are several accounts of people seeing heaven when they died and came back.</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">There are several accounts of people seeing their religion’s version of heaven or nirvana in death-to-life experiences. You would have to believe Christianity, Mormonism, Islam, Hindu, … too! </p></div><p>Ex. 11: You get an email asking to be wired money, which you’ll be paid back handsomely for. The email concludes <em>“I, prince Nubadola, assure you that this is my message, and it is legitimate.  You can trust this email and any others that come from me.”  </em></p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\">The email saying the email is legitimate doesn’t make it true. I could even write a new email saying “Prince Nubadola is a fraud, and I assure you that this is true”. (This is circular reasoning/ begging the question)</p></div><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In order to argue well, it's important to identify and work through arguments that prove too much. In practice, this technique has the potential to lower someone's confidence... in a belief, or help clarify that \"No, I don't think this leads to 100% true things all the time, just most of the time\". Either way, communication is better and progress is made. </p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4vQuNSwJvPFs7mSSs/category-qualifications-w-exercises\">the next post</a>, I will be generalizing Proving too much. In the meantime, what’s wrong with this question:</p><p>If a tree falls in the woods, but no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? (note: you shouldn’t be able to frame it as Proving too much)</p><p>[Feel free to comment if you got different answers/ generalizations/ algorithms than I did. Same if you feel like you hit on something interesting or that there's a concept I missed.

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Automatically crossposted from <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/\">https://sideways-view.com</a></em></p><p>From the perspective of an organism trying to propagate its genes, sex is like a trade: I’ll put half of your DNA in my offspring if you put half of my DNA in yours. I still pass one copy of my genes onto the next generation per unit of investment in children, so it’s a fair deal. And it doesn’t impact the average fitness of my kids very much, since on average my partner’s genes will be about as good as mine. (ETA: but see the discussion below, in which case the costs might be much bigger.)</p><p>But the trade has transaction costs, so I’m only going to do it if I get some benefit. In this post I’ll tell a particularly simple story about the benefit of sex. I think this is basically equivalent to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction\">standard story</a>, but I find it much clearer. It also makes it more obvious that we don’t require group selection, and that the benefit is very large.</p><br/><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1568486365/2018-06-07-19-25-57-1200x800_hxxlzy.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\" /></figure></span><br/><p>Why doesn’t sex change the average fitness of my kids? The possibility of a “lucky” kid who gets the better genes from both of us is offset by the possibility of an unlucky kid who gets the worse genes from both of us. If the effects of genes are linear, the average fitness will be exactly the same as the parents. In practice I expect it to be slightly lower because of convexity and linkage disequilibrium.</p><p>But sex increases the average fitness of my <em>grandchildren</em>, because my fittest children will be responsible for a disproportionate fraction of my grandkids. More precisely, if my if an organism with fitness dX has (1+dX) kids per generation, then the total fitness of my grandkids is E[(1 + dX)^2] = 1 + 2 E[dX] + E[dX^2]. So increasing variance by 1 unit is as good as increasing average fitness by 0.5 units.</p><p>Reproductive decisions are naturally a tradeoff between average fitness and variance. Sex slightly lowers the average but increases the variance. If you try to get the same amount of variance with random mutations, you’ll have to totally tank your kid’s expected fitness, because your current genome is well-optimized, <strong>and</strong> you’ll also pass on fewer genes to the next generation (since some of yours got destroyed). In fact, it’s hard to think of any way to get similar benefits without exchanging genes.</p><p>Variance becomes linearly more important over time. For the fitness of my grandkids, 1 unit of variance is worth 0.5 units of fitness; for great-grandkids, they are equally valuable; for great-great-great-grandkids variance is twice as valuable. I don’t think we have to look too many generations ahead before the variance bonus from sex outweighs the costs. For example, if genetic fitness differs by 5% between my offspring, and sex reduces fitness by 1%, then sex breaks even within 6 generations.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This is a continuation of a discussion with Vanessa from the MIRIxDiscord group. I'll make some comments on things Vanessa has said, but those should not be considered a summary of the discussion so far. My comments here are also informed by discussion with Sam.</em></p><h1>1: Logic as Proxy</h1><h2>1a: The Role of Prediction</h2><p>Vanessa has said that predictive accuracy is sufficient; consideration of logic is not needed to judge (<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703753a4/learning-incomplete-models-using-dominant-markets\">partial</a>) models. A hypothesis should ultimately ground out to perceptual information. So why is there any need to consider other sorts of \"predictions\" it can make? (IE, why should we think of it as possessing internal propositions which have a logic of their own?)</p><p>But similarly, why should agents use predictive accuracy to learn? What's the argument for it? Ultimately, predicting perceptions ahead of time should only be in service of achieving higher reward.</p><p>We could instead learn from reward feedback alone. A (partial) \"hypothesis\" would really be a (partial) <em>strategy</em>, helping us to generate actions. We would judge strategies on (something like) average reward achieved, not even trying to predict precise reward signals. The agent still receives incoming perceptual information, and strategies can use it to update internal states and to inform actions. However, strategies are not asked to produce any predictions. (The framework I'm describing is, of course, model-free RL.)</p><p>Intuitively, it seems as if this is missing something. A model-based agent can learn a lot about the world just by watching, taking no actions. However, individual strategies can implement prediction-based learning within themselves. So, it seems difficult to say what benefit model-based RL provides beyond model-free RL, besides a better prior over strategies.</p><p>It might be that we can't say anything recommending model-based learning over model free in a standard bounded-regret framework. (I actually haven't thought about it much -- but the argument that model-free strategies can implement models internally seems potentially strong. Perhaps you just can't get much in the AIXI framework because there are no good loss bounds in that framework at all, <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375575/the-learning-theoretic-ai-alignment-research-agenda\">as Vanessa mentions</a>.) However, if so, this seems like a weakness of standard bounded-regret frameworks. Predicting the world seems to be a significant aspect of intelligence; we should be able to talk about this formally somehow.</p><p>Granted, it doesn't make sense for bounded agents to pursue predictive accuracy above all else. There is a computational trade-off, and you don't need to predict something which isn't important. My claim is something like, you should try and predict when you don't yet have an effective strategy. After you have an effective strategy, you don't really need to generate predictions. Before that, you need to generate predictions because you're still grappling with the world, trying to understand what's basically going on.</p><p>If we're trying to <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375575/the-learning-theoretic-ai-alignment-research-agenda\">understand intelligence</a>, the idea that model-free learners can internally manage these trade-offs (by choosing strategies which judiciously choose to learn from predictions when it is efficacious to do so) seems less satisfying than a proper theory of learning from prediction. What is fundamental vs non-fundamental to intelligence can get fuzzy, but learning from prediction seems like something we expect any sufficiently intelligent agent to do (whether it was built-in or learned behavior).</p><p>On the other hand, judging hypotheses on their predictive accuracy is kind of a weird thing to do if what you ultimately want a hypothesis to do for you is generate actions. It's like this: You've got two tasks; task A, and task B. Task A is what you really care about, but it might be quite difficult to tackle on its own. Task B is really very different from task A, but you can get a lot of feedback on task B. So you ask your hypotheses to compete on task B, and judge them on that in addition to task A. Somehow you're expecting to get a lot of information about task A from performance on task B. And indeed, it seems you do: predictive accuracy of a hypothesis is somehow a useful proxy for efficacy of that hypothesis in guiding action.</p><p>(It should also be noted that a reward-learning framework presumes we get feedback about utility at all. If we get no feedback about reward, then we're forced to <em>only</em> judge hypotheses by predictions, and make what inferences about utility we will. A dire situation for learning theory, but a situation where we can still talk about rational agency more generally.)</p><h2>1b: The Analogy to Logic</h2><p>My argument is going to be that if achieving high reward is task A, and predicting perception is task B, logic can be task C. Like task B, it is very different from task A. Like task B, it nonetheless provides useful information. Like task B, it seems to me that a theory of (boundedly) rational agency is missing something without it.</p><p>The basic picture is this. Perceptual prediction provides a lot of good feedback about the quality of cognitive algorithms. But if you really want to train up some good cognitive algorithms for yourself, it is helpful to do some imaginative play on the side. </p><p>One way to visualize this is an agent making up math puzzles in order to strengthen its reasoning skills. This might suggest a picture where the puzzles are always well-defined (terminating) computations. However, there's no special dividing line between decidable and undecidable problems -- any particular restriction to a decidable class might rule out some interesting (decidable but non-obviously so) stuff which we could learn from. So we might end up just going with any computations (halting or no).</p><p>Similarly, we might not restrict ourselves to entirely well-defined propositions. It makes a lot of sense to test cognitive heuristics on scenarios closer to life.</p><p>Why do I think sufficiently advanced agents are likely to do this?</p><p>Well, just as it seems important that we can learn a whole lot from prediction before we ever take an action in a given type of situation, it seems important that we can learn a whole lot by reasoning before we even observe that situation. I'm not formulating a precise learning-theoretic conjecture, but intuitively, it is related to whether we could reasonably expect the agent to get something right on the first try. Good perceptual prediction alone does not guarantee that we can correctly anticipate the effects of actions we have never tried before, but if I see an agent generate an effective strategy in a situation it has never intervened in before (but has had opportunity to observe), I expect that internally it is learning from perception at some level (even if it is model-free in overall architecture). Similarly,  if I see an agent quickly pick up a reasoning-heavy game like chess, then I suspect it of learning from hypothetical simulations at some level.</p><p>Again, \"on the first try\" is not supposed to be a formal learning-theoretic requirement; I realize you can't exactly expect anything to work on the first try with learning agents. What I'm getting at has something to do with generalization.</p><h1>2: Learning-Theoretic Criteria</h1><p>Part of the frame has been learning-theory-vs-logic. One might interpret my closing remarks from the previous section that way; I don't know how to formulate my intuition learning-theoretically, but I expect that reasoning helps agents in particular situations. It may be that the phenomena of the previous section cannot be understood learning-theoretically, and only amount to a \"better prior over strategies\" as I mentioned. However, I don't want it to be a learning-theory-vs-logic argument. I would hope that something learning-theoretic can be said in favor of learning from perception, and in favor of learning from logic. Even if it can't, learning theory is still an important component here, regardless of the importance of logic.</p><p>I'll try to say something about how I think learning theory should interface with logic.</p><p>Vanessa <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S3W4Xrmp6AL7nxRHd/formalising-decision-theory-is-hard#X7R4rxHpkEKycJvSb\">said some relevant things in a comment</a>, which I'll quote in full:</p><blockquote>Heterodox opinion: I think the entire MIRIesque (<em>and</em> academic philosophy) approach to decision theory is confused. The basic assumption seems to be, that we can decouple the problem of learning a model of the world from the problem of taking a decision given such a model. We then ignore the first problem, and assume a particular shape for the model (for example, causal network) which allows us to consider decision theories such as CDT, EDT etc. However, in reality the two problems cannot be decoupled. This is because the <em>type signature </em>of a world model is only meaningful if it comes with an algorithm for how to learn a model of this type.</blockquote><blockquote>For example, consider Newcomb's paradox. The agent makes a decision under the assumption that Omega behaves in a certain way. But, where did the assumption come from? Realistic agents have to <em>learn</em> everything they know. Learning normally requires a time sequence. For example, we can consider the <em>iterated</em> Newcomb's paradox (INP). In INP, any reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm will converge to one-boxing, simply because one-boxing gives it the money. This is despite RL naively looking like CDT. Why does it happen? Because in the learned model, the \"causal\" relationships are <em>not</em> physical causality. The agent comes to believe that taking the one box <em>causes</em> the money to appear there.</blockquote><blockquote>In Newcomb's paradox EDT succeeds but CDT fails. Let's consider an example where CDT succeeds and EDT fails: the XOR blackmail. The iterated version would be IXB. In IXB, classical RL doesn't guarantee much because the environment is more complex than the agent (it contains Omega). To overcome this, we can use RL with <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375575/the-learning-theoretic-ai-alignment-research-agenda\">incomplete models</a>. I believe that this indeed solves both INP and IXB.</blockquote><blockquote>Then we can consider e.g. counterfactual mugging. In counterfactual mugging, RL with incomplete models doesn't work. That's because the assumption that Omega responds in a way that depends on a counterfactual world is not in the space of models at all. Indeed, it's unclear how can any agent learn such a fact from empirical observations. One way to fix it is by allowing the agent to precommit. Then the assumption about Omega becomes empirically verifiable. But, if we do this, then RL with incomplete models can solve the problem again.</blockquote><blockquote>The only class of problems that I'm genuinely unsure how to deal with is game-theoretic superrationality. However, I also don't see much evidence the MIRIesque approach has succeeded on that front. We probably need to start with just solving the grain of truth problem in the sense of converging to ordinary Nash (or similar) equilibria (which might be possible using incomplete models). Later we can consider agents that observe each other's source code, and maybe something along the lines of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375058/superrationality-in-arbitrary-games\">this</a> can apply.</blockquote><p>Besides the MIRI-vs-learning frame, I agree with a lot of this. I <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction#jbC8934HoXaoXrqhR\">wrote a comment</a> elsewhere making some related points about the need for a learning-theoretic approach. Some of the points also relate to my <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/fgHSwxFitysGKHH56\">CDT=EDT sequence</a>; I have been arguing that CDT and EDT don't behave as people broadly imagine (often not having the bad behavior which people broadly imagine). Some of those arguments were learning-theoretic while others were not, but the conclusions were similar either way.</p><p>In any case, I think the following criterion (originally mentioned to me by Jack Gallagher) makes sense:</p><p><em>A decision problem should be conceived as a sequence, but the algorithm deciding what to do on a particular element of the sequence should not know/care what the whole sequence is.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yXCvYqTZCsfN7WRrg/asymptotic-decision-theory-improved-writeup\">Asymptotic decision theory</a> was the first major proposal to conceive of decision problems as sequences in this way. Decision-problem-as-sequence allows decision theory to be addressed learning-theoretically; we can't expect a learning agent to necessarily do well in any particular case (because it could have a sufficiently poor prior, and so still be learning in that particular case), but we <em>can</em> expect it to <em>eventually</em> perform well (provided the problem meets some \"fairness\" conditions which make it learnable).</p><p>As for the second part of the criterion, requiring that the agent is ignorant of the overall sequence when deciding what to do on an instance: this captures the idea of learning from logic. Providing the agent with the sequence is cheating, because you're essentially giving the agent your interpretation of the situation.</p><p>Jack mentioned this criterion to me in a discussion of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037541d/an-approach-to-logically-updateless-decisions\">averaging decision theory (AvDT)</a>, in order to explain why AvDT was cheating. </p><p>AvDT is based on a fairly simple idea: look at the average performance of a strategy so far, rather than its expected performance on this particular problem. Unfortunately, \"performance so far\" requires things to be defined in terms of a training sequence (counter to the logical-induction philosophy of non-sequential learning).</p><p>I created AvDT to try and address some shortcomings of asymptotic decision theory (let's call it AsDT). Specifically, AsDT does not do well in counterlogical mugging. AvDT is capable of doing well in counterfactual mugging. However, it depends on the training sequence. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZwxY88NCCHffJuxM/a-problem-about-bargaining-and-logical-uncertainty\">Counterlogical mugging</a> requires the agent to decide on the \"probability\" of Omega asking for money vs paying up, to figure out whether participation is worth it overall. AvDT solves this problem by looking at the training sequence to see how often Omega pays up. So, the problem of doing well in decision problems is \"reduced\" to specifying good training sequences. This (1) doesn't obviously make things easier, and (2) puts the work on the human trainers.</p><p>Jack is saying that the system should be looking through logic <em>on its own</em> to find analogous scenarios to generalize from. When judging whether a system gets counterlogical mugging right, <em>we</em> have to define counterlogical mugging as a sequence to enable learning-theoretic analysis; but <em>the agent</em> has to figure things out on its own.</p><p>This is a somewhat subtle point. A realistic agent experiences the world sequentially, and learns by treating its history as a training sequence of sorts. This is <em>physical time</em>. I have no problem with this. What I'm saying is that if an agent is also learning <em>from analogous circumstances within logic</em>, as I suggested sophisticated agents will do in the first part, then Jack's condition should come into play. We aren't handed, from on high, a sequence of logically defined scenarios which we can locate ourselves within. We only have regular physical time, plus a bunch of hypothetical scenarios which we can define and whose relevance we have to determine.</p><p>This gets back to my earlier intuition about agents having a reasonable chance of getting certain things right on the first try. Learning-theoretic agents don't get things right on the first try. However, agents who learn from logic have \"lots of tries\" before their first real try in physical time. If you can successfully determine which logical scenarios are relevantly analogous to your own, you can learn what to do just by thinking. (Of course, you still need a lot of physical-time learning to know enough about your situation to do that!)</p><p>So, getting back to Vanessa's point in the comment I quoted: can we solve MIRI-style decision problems by considering the iterated problem, rather than the single-shot version? To a large extent, I think so: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dKAJqBDZRMMsaaYo5/in-logical-time-all-games-are-iterated-games\">in logical time, all games are iterated games</a>. However, I don't want to have to set an agent up with a training sequence in which it encounters those specific problems many times. For example, finding good strategies in chess via self-play should come naturally from the way the agent thinks about the world, rather than being an explicit training regime which the designer has to implement. Once the rules for chess are understood, the bottleneck should be thinking time rather than (physical) training instances.</p>",

Apologies that it’s sloppier than I’d usually aim for in a philosophy paper, and lacking in appropriate references. And, even though the paper is pretty negative about FDT, I want to emphasise that my writing this should be taken as a sign of respect for those involved in developing FDT. I’ll also caveat I’m unlikely to have time to engage in the comments; I thought it was better to get this out there all the same rather than delay publication further.</em></p><br><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Introduction</strong></li></ol><p>There’s a long-running issue where many in the rationality community take functional decision theory (and its variants) very seriously, but the academic decision theory community does not. But there’s been little public discussion of FDT from academic decision theorists (one exception is <u><a href=\"https://www.umsu.de/wo/2018/688\">here</a></u>); this note attempts to partly address this gap.&nbsp;</p><p>So that there’s a clear object of discussion, I’m going to focus on Yudkowsky and Soares’ ‘<u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf\">Functional Decision Theory</a></u>’ (which I’ll refer to as Y&amp;S), though I also read a revised version of Soares and Levinstein’s <u><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/DeathInDamascus.pdf\">Cheating Death in Damascus</a></u>.</p><p>This note is structured as follows. Section II describes causal decision theory (CDT), evidential decision theory (EDT) and functional decision theory (FDT). Sections III-VI describe problems for FDT: (i) that it sometimes makes bizarre recommendations, recommending an option that is certainly lower-utility than another option; (ii) that it fails to one-box in most instances of Newcomb’s problem, even though the correctness of one-boxing is supposed to be one of the guiding motivations for the theory; (iii) that it results in implausible discontinuities, where what is rational to do can depend on arbitrarily small changes to the world; and (iv) that, because there’s no real fact of the matter about whether a particular physical process implements a particular algorithm, it’s deeply indeterminate what FDT’s implications are. In section VII I discuss the idea that FDT ‘does better at getting utility’ than EDT or CDT; I argue that Y&amp;S’s claims to this effect are unhelpfully vague, and on any more precise way of understanding their claim, aren’t plausible.&nbsp; In section VIII I briefly describe a view that captures some of the motivation behind FDT, and in my view is more plausible. I conclude that FDT faces a number of deep problems and little to say in its favour.</p><p>In what follows, I’m going to assume a reasonable amount of familiarity with the debate around Newcomb’s problem.</p><br><p><strong>II. CDT, EDT and FDT</strong></p><p>Informally: CDT, EDT and FDT differ in what non-causal correlations they care about when evaluating a decision. For CDT, what you cause to happen is all that matters; if your action correlates with some good outcome, that’s nice to know, but it’s not relevant to what you ought to do.&nbsp; For EDT, all correlations matter: you should pick whatever action will result in you believing you will have the highest expected utility. For FDT, only some non-causal correlations matter, namely only those correlations between your action and events elsewhere in time and space that would be different in the (logically impossible) worlds in which the output of the algorithm you’re running is different. Other than for those correlations, FDT behaves in the same way as CDT.</p><p>Formally, where ​<em>S</em>​ represents states of nature, ​<em>A, B</em>​ etc represent acts, ​<em>P</em> ​is a probability function, and <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

(I’m not claiming that it’s clear what this means. E.g. seehere​, second bullet point, arguing there can be no such probability function, because any probability function requires certainty in logical facts and all their entailments. I also note that strictly speaking FDT doesn’t assess acts in the same sense that CDT assesses acts; rather it assesses algorithmic outputs, and that Y&amp;S have a slightly different formal set up than the one I describe above. I don’t think this will matter for the purposes of this note, though.)</p><p>With these definitions on board, we can turn to objections to FDT.</p><br><p><strong>III. FDT sometimes makes bizarre recommendations</strong></p><p>The criterion that Y&amp;S regard as most important in assessing a decision theory is ‘amount of utility achieved’. I think that this idea is importantly underspecified (which I discuss more in section VII), but I agree with the spirit of it.&nbsp; But FDT does very poorly by that criterion, on any precisification of it.</p><p>In particular, consider the following principle:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>Guaranteed Payoffs</em>: In conditions of certainty — that is, when the decision-maker has no uncertainty about what state of nature she is in, and no uncertainty about the utility payoff of each action is — the decision-maker should choose the action that maximises utility.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>That is: for situations where there’s no uncertainty, we don’t need to appeal to expected utility theory in any form to work out what we ought to do. You just ought to do whatever will give you the highest utility payoff. This should be a constraint on any plausible decision theory. But FDT violates that principle.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider the following case:</p><blockquote><em>Bomb</em>.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>You face two open boxes, Left and Right, and you must take one of them. In the Left box, there is a live bomb; taking this box will set off the bomb, setting you ablaze, and you certainly will burn slowly to death. The Right box is empty, but you have to pay $100 in order to be able to take it.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>A long-dead predictor predicted whether you would choose Left or Right, by running a simulation of you and seeing what that simulation did. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Right, then she put a bomb in Left. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Left, then she did not put a bomb in Left, and the box is empty.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>The predictor has a failure rate of only 1 in a trillion trillion. Helpfully, she left a note, explaining that she predicted that you would take Right, and therefore she put the bomb in Left.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>You are the only person left in the universe. You have a happy life, but you know that you will never meet another agent again, nor face another situation where any of your actions will have been predicted by another agent. What box should you choose?&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><p>The right action, according to FDT, is to take Left, in the full knowledge that as a result you will slowly burn to death. Why? Because, using Y&amp;S’s counterfactuals, <em>if</em> your algorithm were to output ‘Left’, then it would also have outputted ‘Left’ when the predictor made the simulation of you, and there would be no bomb in the box, and you could save yourself $100 by taking Left. In contrast, the right action on CDT or EDT is to take Right.</p><p>The recommendation is implausible enough. But if we stipulate that in this decision-situation the decision-maker is certain in the outcome that her actions would bring about, we see that FDT violates <em>Guaranteed Payoffs</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>(One might protest that no good Bayesian would ever have credence 1 in an empirical proposition. But, first, that depends on what we could as ‘evidence’ — if a proposition is part of your evidence base, you have credence 1 in it. And, second, we could construct very similar principles to <em>Guaranteed Payoffs </em>that don’t rely on the idea of certainty, but on approximations to certainty.)</p><p>Note that FDT’s recommendation in this case is <em>much </em>more implausible than even the worst of the prima facie implausible recommendations of EDT or CDT. So, if we’re going by appeal to cases, or by ‘who gets more utility’, FDT is looking very unmotivated.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>IV. FDT fails to get the answer Y&amp;S want in most instances of the core example that’s supposed to motivate it</strong></p><p>On FDT, you consider what things would look like in the closest (logically impossible) world in which the algorithm you are running were to produce a different output than what it in fact does. Because, so the argument goes, in Newcomb problems the predictor is also running your algorithm, or a ‘sufficiently similar’ algorithm, or a representation of your algorithm, you consider the correlation between your action and the predictor’s prediction (even though you don’t consider other sorts of correlations.)</p><p>However, the predictor needn’t be running your algorithm, or have anything like a representation of that algorithm, in order to predict whether you’ll one box or two-box. Perhaps the Scots tend to one-box, whereas the English tend to two-box. Perhaps the predictor knows how you’ve acted prior to that decision. Perhaps the Predictor painted the transparent box green, and knows that’s your favourite colour and you’ll struggle not to pick it up. In none of these instances is the Predictor plausibly doing anything like running the algorithm that you’re running when you make your decision. But they are still able to predict what you’ll do. (And bear in mind that the Predictor doesn’t even need to be very reliable. As long as the Predictor is better than chance, a Newcomb problem can be created.)</p><p>In fact, on the vast majority of ways that the Predictor could predicting your behavior, she isn’t running the algorithm that you are running, or representing it. But if the Predictor isn’t running the algorithm that you are running, or representing it, then, on the most natural interpretation, FDT will treat this as ‘mere statistical correlation’, and therefore act like CDT. So, in the vast majority of Newcomb cases, FDT would recommend two-boxing. But the intuition in favour of one-boxing in Newcomb cases was exactly what was supposed to motivate FDT in the first place.</p><p>Could we instead interpret FDT, such that it doesn’t have to require the Predictor to be running the <em>exact</em> algorithm — some similar algorithm would do? But I’m not sure how that would help: in the examples given above, the Predictor’s predictions aren’t based on anything like running your algorithm. In fact, the predictor may know very little about you, perhaps only whether you’re English or Scottish.&nbsp;</p><p>One could suggest that, even though the Predictor is not running a sufficiently similar algorithm to you, nonetheless the Predictor’s prediction is subjunctively dependent on your decision (in the Y&amp;S sense of ‘subjunctive’). But, without any account of Y&amp;S’s notion of subjunctive counterfactuals, we just have no way of assessing whether that’s true or not. Y&amp;S note that specifying an account of their notion of counterfactuals is an ‘open problem,’ but the problem is much deeper than that.&nbsp; Without such an account, it becomes completely indeterminate what follows from FDT, even in the core examples that are supposed to motivate it — and that makes FDT not a new decision theory so much as a promissory note.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, on the most plausible ways of cashing this out, it doesn’t give the conclusions that Y&amp;S would want. If I imagine the closest world in which 6288 + 1048 = 7336 is false (Y&amp;S’s example), I imagine a world with laws of nature radically unlike ours — because the laws of nature rely, fundamentally, on the truths of mathematics, and if one mathematical truth is false then either (i) mathematics as a whole must be radically different, or (ii) all mathematical propositions are true because it is simple to prove a contradiction and every proposition follows from a contradiction. Either way, when I imagine worlds in which FDT outputs something different than it in fact does, then I imagine valueless worlds (no atoms or electrons, etc) — and this isn’t what Y&amp;S are wanting us to imagine.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively (as Abram Demski suggested to me in a comment), Y&amp;S could accept that the decision-maker <em>should </em>two-box in the cases given above. But then, it seems to me, that FDT has lost much of its initial motivation: the case for one-boxing in Newcomb’s problem didn’t seem to stem from whether the Predictor was running a simulation of me, or just using some other way to predict what I’d do.</p><br><p><strong>V. Implausible discontinuities</strong></p><p>A related problem is as follows: FDT treats ‘mere statistical regularities’ very differently from predictions. But there’s no sharp line between the two. So it will result in implausible discontinuities. There are two ways we can see this.</p><p>First, take some physical processes S (like the lesion from the Smoking Lesion) that causes a ‘mere statistical regularity’ (it’s not a Predictor). And suppose that the existence of S tends to cause both (i) one-boxing tendencies and (ii) whether there’s money in the opaque box or not when decision-makers face Newcomb problems.&nbsp; If it’s S alone that results in the Newcomb set-up, then FDT will recommending two-boxing.</p><p>But now suppose that the pathway by which S causes there to be money in the opaque box or not is that another agent looks at S and, if the agent sees that S will cause decision-maker X to be a one-boxer, then the agent puts money in X’s opaque box. Now, because there’s an agent making predictions, the FDT adherent will presumably want to say that the right action is one-boxing. But this seems arbitrary — why should the fact that S’s causal influence on whether there’s money in the opaque box or not go via another agent much such a big difference? And we can think of all sorts of spectrum cases in between the ‘mere statistical regularity’ and the full-blooded Predictor: What if the ‘predictor’ is a very unsophisticated agent that doesn’t even understand the implications of what they’re doing? What if they only partially understand the implications of what they’re doing? For FDT, there will be some point of sophistication at which the agent moves from simply being a conduit for a causal process to instantiating the right sort of algorithm, and suddenly FDT will switch from recommending two-boxing to recommending one-boxing.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, consider that same physical process S, and consider a sequence of Newcomb cases, each of which gradually make S more and more complicated and agent-y, making it progressively more similar to a Predictor making predictions. At some point, on FDT, there will be a point at which there’s a sharp jump; prior to that point in the sequence, FDT would recommend that the decision-maker two-boxes; after that point, FDT would recommend that the decision-maker one-boxes. But it’s very implausible that there’s some S such that a tiny change in its physical makeup should affect whether one ought to one-box or two-box.</p><br><p><strong>VI.&nbsp; FDT is deeply indeterminate</strong></p><p>Even putting the previous issues aside, there’s a fundamental way in which FDT is indeterminate, which is that there’s no objective fact of the matter about whether two physical processes A and B are running the same algorithm or not, and therefore no objective fact of the matter of which correlations represent implementations of the same algorithm or are ‘mere correlations’ of the form that FDT wants to ignore. (Though I’ll focus on ‘same algorithm’ cases, I believe that the same problem would affect accounts of when two physical processes are running similar algorithms, or any way of explaining when the output of some physical process, which instantiates a particular algorithm, is Y&amp;S-subjunctively dependent on the output of another physical process, which instantiates a different algorithm.)</p><p>To see this, consider two calculators. The first calculator is like calculators we are used to. The second calculator is from a foreign land: it’s identical except that the numbers it outputs always come with a negative sign (‘–’) in front of them when you’d expect there to be none, and no negative sign when you expect there to be one.&nbsp; Are these calculators running the same algorithm or not? Well, perhaps on this foreign calculator the ‘–’ symbol means what we usually take it to mean — namely, that the ensuing number is negative — and therefore every time we hit the ‘=’ button on the second calculator we are asking it to run the algorithm ‘compute the sum entered, then output the negative of the answer’. If so, then the calculators are systematically running different algorithms.</p><p>But perhaps, in this foreign land, the ‘–’ symbol, in this context, means that the ensuing number is positive and the lack of a ‘–’ symbol means that the number is negative. If so, then the calculators are running exactly the same algorithms; their differences are merely notational.</p><p>Ultimately, in my view, all we have, in these two calculators, are just two physical processes. The further question of whether they are running the same algorithm or not depends on how we interpret the physical outputs of the calculator. There is no deeper fact about whether they’re ‘really’ running the same algorithm or not. And in general, it seems to me, there’s no fact of the matter about which algorithm a physical process is implementing in the absence of a particular interpretation of the inputs and outputs of that physical process.&nbsp;</p><p>But if that’s true, then, even in the Newcomb cases where a Predictor is simulating you, it’s a matter of choice of symbol-interpretation whether the predictor ran the same algorithm that you are now running (or a representation of that same algorithm). And the way you choose that symbol-interpretation is fundamentally arbitrary. So there’s no real fact of the matter about whether the predictor is running the same algorithm as you. It’s indeterminate how you should act, given FDT: you should one-box, given one way of interpreting the inputs and outputs of the physical process the Predictor is running, but two-box given an alternative interpretation.</p><p>Now, there’s a <u><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computation-physicalsystems/\">bunch of interesting work</a></u> on concrete computation, trying to give an account of when two physical processes are performing the same computation. The best response that Y&amp;S could to make this problem is to provide a compelling account of when two physical processes are running the same algorithm that gives them the answers they want.&nbsp; But almost all accounts of computation in physical processes have the issue that very many physical processes are running very many different algorithms, all at the same time. (Because most accounts rely on there being some mapping from physical states to computational states, and there can be multiple mappings.) So you might well end up with the problem that in the closest (logically impossible) world in which FDT outputs something other than what it does output, not only do the actions of the Predictor change, but so do many other aspects of the world. For example, if the physical process underlying some aspect of the US economy just happened to be isomorphic with FDT’s algorithm, then in the logically impossible world where FDT outputs a different algorithm, not only does the predictor act differently, but so does the US economy. And that will probably change the value of the world under consideration, in a way that’s clearly irrelevant to the choice at hand.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>VII. But FDT gets the most utility!</strong></p><p>Y&amp;S regard the most important criterion to be ‘utility achieved’, and thinks that FDT does better than all its rivals in this regard. Though I agree with something like the spirit of this criterion, its use by Y&amp;S is unhelpfully ambiguous. To help explain this, I’ll go on a little detour to present some distinctions that are commonly used by academic moral philosophers and, to a lesser extent, decision theorists. (For more on these distinctions, see Toby Ord’s DPhil thesis.)</p><p><em>Evaluative focal points</em></p><p>An <em>evaluative focal point </em>is an object of axiological or normative evaluation. (‘Axiological’ means ‘about goodness/badness’; ‘normative’ means ‘about rightness/wrongness’. If you’re a consequentialist, <em>x </em>is best iff it’s right, but if you’re a non-consequentialist the two can come apart.) When doing moral philosophy or decision theory, the most common evaluative focal points are <em>acts</em>, but we can evaluate other things too: characters, motives, dispositions, sets of rules, beliefs, and so on.</p><p>Any axiological or normative theory needs to specify which focal point it is evaluating. The theory can evaluate a single focal point (e.g. act utilitarianism, which only evaluates acts) or many (e.g. global utilitarianism, which evaluates everything).</p><p>The theory can also differ on whether it is <em>direct </em>or <em>indirect </em>with respect to a given evaluative focal point. For example, Hooker’s rule-consequentialism is a direct theory with respect to sets of rules, and an indirect theory with respect to acts: it evaluates sets of rules on the basis of their consequences, but evaluates acts with respect to how they conform to those sets of rules. Because of this, on Hooker’s view, the right act need not maximize good consequences.</p><p><em>Criterion of rightness vs decision procedure</em></p><p>In chess, there’s a standard by which it is judged who has won the game, namely, the winner is whoever first puts their opponent’s king into checkmate. But relying solely on that standard of evaluation isn’t going to go very well if you actually want to win at chess. Instead, you should act according to some other set of rules and heuristics, such as: “if white, play e4 on the first move,” “don’t get your Queen out too early,” “rooks are worth more than bishops” etc.</p><p>A similar distinction can be made for axiological or normative theories. The criterion of rightness, for act utilitarianism, is, “The right actions are those actions which maximize the sum total of wellbeing.”&nbsp; But that’s not the decision procedure one ought to follow. Instead, perhaps, you should rely on rules like ‘almost never lie’, ‘be kind to your friends and family’, ‘figure out how much you can sustainably donate to effective charities, and do that,’ and so on.</p><p>For some people, in fact, learning that utilitarianism is true will cause one to be a worse utilitarian by the utilitarian’s criterion of rightness! (Perhaps you start to come across as someone who uses others as means to an end, and that hinders your ability to do good.) By the utilitarian criterion of rightness, someone could in principle act rightly in every decision, even though they have never heard of utilitarianism, and therefore never explicitly tried to follow utilitarianism.</p><p><em>These distinctions and FDT</em></p><p>From Y&amp;S, it wasn’t clear to me whether FDT is really meant to assess acts, agents, characters, decision procedures, or outputs of decision procedures, and it wasn’t clear to me whether it is meant to be a direct or an indirect theory with respect to acts, or with respect to outputs of decision procedures. This is crucial, because it’s relevant to which decision theory ‘does best at getting utility’.&nbsp;</p><p>With these distinctions in hand, we can see that Y&amp;S employ multiple distinct interpretations of their key criterion. Sometimes, for example, Y&amp;S talk about how “FDT agents” (which I interpret as ‘agents who follow FDT to make decisions’) get more utility, e.g.:</p><ul><li>“Using one simple and coherent decision rule, functional decision theorists (for example) achieve more utility than CDT on Newcomb’s problem, more utility than EDT on the smoking lesion problem, and more utility than both in Parfit’s hitchhiker problem.”</li><li>“We propose an entirely new decision theory, functional decision theory (FDT), that maximizes agents’ utility more reliably than CDT or EDT.”</li><li>“FDT agents attain high utility in a host of decision problems that have historically proven challenging to CDT and EDT: FDT outperforms CDT in Newcomb’s problem; EDT in the smoking lesion problem; and both in Parfit’s hitchhiker problem.”</li><li>“It should come as no surprise that an agent can outperform both CDT and EDT as measured by utility achieved; this has been known for some time (Gibbard and Harper 1978).”</li><li>“Expanding on the final argument, proponents of EDT, CDT, and FDT can all<br>agree that it would be great news to hear that a beloved daughter adheres to FDT, because FDT agents get more of what they want out of life. Would it not then be strange if the correct theory of rationality were some alternative to the theory that produces the best outcomes, as measured in utility? (Imagine hiding decision theory textbooks from loved ones, lest they be persuaded to adopt the “correct” theory and do worse thereby!) We consider this last argument—the argument from utility—to be the one that gives the precommitment and value-of-information arguments their teeth. If self- binding or self-blinding were important for getting more utility in certain scenarios, then we would plausibly endorse those practices. Utility has primacy, and FDT’s success on that front is the reason we believe that FDT is a more useful and general theory of rational choice.”</li></ul><p>Sometimes Y&amp;S talk about how different decision theories produce more utility on average if they were to face a specific dilemma repeatedly:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>“Measuring by utility achieved on average over time, CDT outperforms EDT in some well-known dilemmas (Gibbard and Harper 1978), and EDT outperforms CDT in others (Ahmed 2014b).”</li><li>“Imagine an agent that is going to face first Newcomb’s problem, and then the smoking lesion problem. Imagine measuring them in terms of utility achieved, by which we mean measuring them by how much utility we expect them to attain, on average, if they face the dilemma repeatedly. The sort of agent that we’d expect to do best, measured in terms of utility achieved, is the sort who one-boxes in Newcomb’s problem, and smokes in the smoking lesion problem.”</li></ul><p>Sometimes Y&amp;S talk about which agent will achieve more utility ‘in expectation’, though they don’t define the point at which they gain more expected utility (or what notion of ‘expected utility’ is being used):</p><ul><li>“One-boxing in the transparent Newcomb problem may look strange, but it works. Any predictor smart enough to carry out the arguments above can see that CDT and EDT agents two-box, while FDT agents one-box. Followers of CDT and EDT will therefore almost always see an empty box, while followers of FDT will almost always see a full one. Thus, FDT agents achieve more utility in expectation.”</li></ul><p>Sometimes they talk about how much utility ‘decision theories tend to achieve in practice’:</p><ul><li>“It is for this reason that we turn to Newcomblike problems to distinguish between the three theories, and demonstrate FDT’s superiority, when measuring in terms of utility achieved.”</li><li>“we much prefer to evaluate decision theories based on how much utility they tend to achieve in practice.”</li></ul><p>Sometimes they talk about how well the decision theory does in a circumscribed class of cases (though they note in footnote 15 that they can’t define what this class of cases are):</p><ul><li>“FDT does appear to be superior to CDT and EDT in all dilemmas where the agent’s beliefs are accurate and the outcome depends only on the agent’s behavior in the dilemma at hand. Informally, we call these sorts of problems “fair problems.””</li><li>“FDT, we claim, gets the balance right. An agent who weighs her options by imagining worlds where her decision function has a different output, but where logical, mathematical, nomic, causal, etc. constraints are otherwise respected, is an agent with the optimal predisposition for whatever fair dilemma she encounters.”</li></ul><p>And sometimes they talk about how much utility the agent would receive in different possible worlds than the one she finds herself in:</p><ul><li>“When weighing actions, Fiona simply imagines hypotheticals corresponding to those actions, and takes the action that corresponds to the hypothetical with higher expected utility—even if that means imagining worlds in which her observations were different, and even if that means achieving low utility in the world corresponding to her actual observations.”</li></ul><p>As we can see, the most common formulation of this criterion is that they are looking for the decision theory that, if <em>run by an agent</em>, will produce the most utility over their lifetime. That is, they’re asking what the best <em>decision procedure</em> is, rather than what the best <em>criterion of rightness </em>is, and are providing an <em>indirect </em>account of the rightness of acts, assessing acts in terms of how well they conform with the best decision procedure.&nbsp;</p><p>But, if that’s what’s going on, there are a whole bunch of issues to dissect. First, it means that FDT is not playing the same game as CDT or EDT, which are proposed as criteria of rightness, directly assessing acts. So it’s odd to have a whole paper comparing them side-by-side as if they are rivals.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, what decision theory does best, if run by an agent, depends crucially on what the world is like. To see this, let’s go back to question that Y&amp;S ask of what decision theory I’d want my child to have. This depends on a whole bunch of empirical facts: if she might have a gene that causes cancer, I’d hope that she adopts EDT; though if, for some reason, I knew whether or not she did have that gene and she didn’t, I’d hope that she adopts CDT. Similarly, if there were long-dead predictors who can no longer influence the way the world is today, then, if I didn’t know what was in the opaque boxes, I’d hope that she adopts EDT (or FDT); if I did know what was in the opaque boxes (and she didn’t) I’d hope that she adopts CDT. Or, if I’m in a world where FDT-ers are burned at the stake, I’d hope that she adopts anything other than FDT.</p><p>Third, the best decision theory to run is not going to look like <em>any</em> of the standard decision theories. I don’t run CDT, or EDT, or FDT, and I’m very glad of it; it would be impossible for my brain to handle the calculations of any of these decision theories every moment. Instead I almost always follow a whole bunch of rough-and-ready and much more computationally tractable heuristics; and even on the rare occasions where I do try to work out the expected value of something explicitly, I don’t consider the space of all possible actions and all states of nature that I have some credence in — doing so would take years.</p><p>So the main formulation of Y&amp;S’s most important principle doesn’t support FDT. And&nbsp; I don’t think that the other formulations help much, either. Criteria of how well ‘a decision theory does on average and over time’, or ‘when a dilemma is issued repeatedly’&nbsp; run into similar problems as the primary formulation of the criterion. Assessing by how well the decision-maker does in possible worlds that she isn’t in fact in doesn’t seem a compelling criterion (and EDT and CDT could both do well by that criterion, too, depending on which possible worlds one is allowed to pick).&nbsp;</p><p>Fourth, arguing that FDT does best in a class of ‘fair’ problems, without being able to define what that class is or why it’s interesting, is a pretty weak argument. And, even if we could define such a class of cases, claiming that FDT ‘appears to be superior’ to EDT and CDT in the classic cases in the literature is simply begging the question: CDT adherents claims that two-boxing is the right action (which gets you more expected utility!) in Newcomb’s problem; EDT adherents claims that smoking is the right action (which gets you more expected utility!) in the smoking lesion. The question is which of these accounts is the right way to understand ‘expected utility’; they’ll therefore all differ on which of them do better in terms of getting expected utility in these classic cases.</p><p>Finally, in a comment on a draft of this note, Abram Demski said that: “The notion of expected utility for which FDT is supposed to do well (at least, according to me) is <em>expected utility with respect to the prior for the decision problem under consideration.</em>” If that’s correct, it’s striking that this criterion isn’t mentioned in the paper. But it also doesn’t seem compelling as a principle by which to evaluate between decision theories, nor does it seem FDT even does well by it. To see both points: suppose I’m choosing between an avocado sandwich and a hummus sandwich, and my prior was that I prefer avocado, but I’ve since tasted them both and gotten evidence that I prefer hummus. The choice that does best in terms of expected utility with respect to my prior for the decision problem under consideration is the avocado sandwich (and FDT, as I understood it in the paper, would agree). But, uncontroversially, I should choose the hummus sandwich, because I prefer hummus to avocado.</p><br><p><strong>VIII. An alternative approaches that captures the spirit of FDT’s aims</strong></p><p>Academic decision theorists tends to focus on what actions are rational, but not talk very much about what sort of agent to become.&nbsp; Something that’s distinctive and good about the rationalist community’s discussion of decision theory is that there’s more of an emphasis on what sort of agent to be, and what sorts of rules to follow.</p><p>But this is an area where we can eat our cake and have it. There’s nothing to stop us assessing agents, acts and anything else we like in terms of our favourite decision theory.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s define: <em>Global expected utility theory</em> =df for any <em>x</em> that is an evaluative focal point, the right <em>x</em> is that which maximises expected utility.</p><p>I think that Global CDT can get everything we want, without the problems that face FDT. Consider, for example, the Prisoner’s Dilemma. On the global version of CDT, we can say <em>both </em>that (i) the act of defecting is the right action (assuming that the other agent will use their money poorly); and that (ii) the right sort of person to be is one who cooperates in prisoner’s dilemmas.&nbsp;</p><p>(ii) would be true, even though (i) is true, if you will face repeated prisoner’s dilemmas, if whether or not you find yourself in opportunities to cooperate depend on whether or not you’ve cooperated in the past, if other agents can tell what sort of person you are even independently in your actions in Prisoner’s Dilemmas, and so on. Similar things can be said about blackmail cases and about Parfit’s Hitchhiker. And similar things can be said more broadly about what sort of person to be given consequentialism — if you become someone who keeps promises, doesn’t tell lies, sticks up for their friends (etc), and who doesn’t analyse these decisions in consequentialist terms, you’ll do more good than someone who tries to apply the consequentialist criterion of rightness for every decision.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sometimes behaviour like this is described as ‘rational irrationality’. But I don’t think that’s an accurate description. It’s not that one and the same thing (the act) is both rational and irrational. Instead, we continue to acknowledge that the act is the irrational one; we just also acknowledge that it results from the rational disposition to have.)</p><p>There are other possible ways of capturing some of the spirit of FDT, such as a sort of rule-consequentialism, where the right set of rules to follow are those that would produce the best outcome if all agents followed those rules, and the right act is that which conforms to that set of rules. But I think that global causal decision theory is the most promising idea in this space.</p><br><p><strong>IX. Conclusion</strong></p><p>In this note, I argued that FDT faces multiple major problems. In my view, these are fatal to FDT in its current form. I think it’s possible that, with very major work, a version of FDT could be developed that could overcome some of these problems (in particular, the problems described in sections IV, V and VI, that are based, in one way or another, on the issue of when two processes are Y&amp;S-subjunctively dependent on one another). But it’s hard to see what the motivation for doing so is: FDT in any form will violate <em>Guaranteed Payoffs</em>, which should be one of the most basic constraints on a decision theory; and if, instead, we want to seriously undertake the project of what decision-procedure is the best for an agent to run (or ‘what should we code into an AI?’), the answer will be far messier, and far more dependent on particular facts about the world and the computational resources of the agent in question, than any of EDT, CDT or FDT. </p>",

On the other hand, it’s ok if the agents we describe don’t have very strong properties, as long as the properties they do have are realistic.</li></ul><p>As an example, consider <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543\">logical induction</a></u>. Logical induction was a major step forward in designing agent systems with strong properties - e.g. eventually having sane beliefs over logic statements despite finite resources. On the other hand, for the most part it doesn’t help us describe existing agenty systems much - bacteria or cats or (more debatably) humans probably don’t have embedded logical inductors.</p><p>Diving more into different questions/subgoals:</p><ul><li>Logical counterfactuals, Lobian reasoning, and the like are much more central to designing artificial agents than to describing existing agents (although still relevant).</li><li>Detecting agents in the environment, and backing out their models/goals, is much more central to describing existing agents than to designing artificial agents (although still relevant).</li><li>The entire class of <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/iTpLAaPamcKyjmbFC\">robust delegation problems</a></u> is mainly relevant to designing ideal agents, and only tangentially relevant to describing existing agents.</li><li>Questions about the extent to which <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/osxNg6yBCJ4ur9hpi/does-agent-like-behavior-imply-agent-like-architecture\">agent-like behavior requires agent-like architecture</a></u> are mainly relevant to describing existing agents, and only tangentially relevant to designing artificial agents.</li></ul><p>I’ve been pointing out differences, but of course there’s a huge amount of overlap between the theoretical problems of these two use-cases. Most of the problems of <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/efWfvrWLgJmbBAs3m\">embedded world-models</a></u> are central to both use-cases, as is the lack of a Cartesian boundary and all the problems which stem from that.</p><p>My general impression is that most MIRI folks (at least within the embedded agents group) are more focused on the AI design angle. Personally, my interest in embedded agents originally came from <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kFb8L4omGMk2kMK3K/embedded-agency-not-just-an-ai-problem\">wanting to describe</a></u> biological organisms, neural networks, markets and other real-world systems as agents, so I’m mostly focused on describing existing agents. I suspect that a lot of the <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction?commentId=qQwY6tyzSbEuGkrke\">disagreements I have with e.g. Abram</a></u> stem from these differing goals.</p><p>In terms of how the two use-cases “should” be prioritized, I certainly see both as necessary for best-case AI outcomes. Description of existing agents seems more directly relevant to human alignment: in order to reliably point to human values, we need a theory of how things made of atoms can coherently “want” things in a world they can’t fully model. AI design problems seem more related to “scaling up” a human-aligned AI, i.e. having it self-modify and copy itself and whatnot without wireheading or value drift.</p><p>I’d be interested to hear from some agency researchers who focus more on the design use-case if all this sounds like an accurate representation of how you’re thinking, or if I’m totally missing the target here. Also, if you think that design-type use-cases really are more central to AI safety than description-type use-cases, or that the distinction isn&#x27;t useful at all, I’d be interested to hear why.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>To aid communication, I’m going append a technical rephrasing after some paragraphs.</em></p>\n<p>It’s known to be hard to give non-trivial goals to reinforcement learning agents. However, I haven’t seen much discussion of the following: even ignoring wireheading, it seems impossible to specify reward functions that get what we want – at least, if the agent is farsighted, smart, and can’t see the entire world all at once, and the reward function only grades what the agent sees in the moment. If this really is impossible in our world, then the designer’s job gets way harder.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even ignoring wireheading, it could be impossible to supply a reward function such that most optimal policies lead to desirable behavior – at least, if the agent is farsighted and able to compute the optimal policy, the environment is partially observable (which it is, for the real world), and the reward function is Markovian.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think it’s important to understand <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> the designer’s job gets harder, but first, the problem.</p>\n<p>Let’s suppose that we magically have a reward function which, given an image from the agent’s camera, outputs what an idealized person would think of the image. That is, given an image, suppose a moral and intelligent person considers the image at length (magically avoiding issues of slowly becoming a different person over the course of reflection), figures out how good it is, and produces out a scalar rating – the reward.</p>\n<p>The problem here is that multiple world states can correspond to the same camera input. Is it good to see a fully black image? I don’t know – what else is going on? Is it bad to see people dying? I don’t know, are they real, or perfectly Photoshopped? I think this point is obvious, but I want to make it so I can move on to the interesting part: there just isn’t enough information to meaningfully grade inputs. Contrast with being able to grade universe-histories via utility functions: just assign 1 to histories that lead to better things than we have right now, and 0 elsewhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem is that the mapping from world state to images is <em>not at all injective</em>... in contrast, grading universe-histories directly doesn’t have this problem: simply consider an indicator function on histories leading to better worlds than the present (for some magical, philosophically valid definition of “better”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, this doesn’t mean we need to have systems grading world states. But what I’m trying to get at is, Markovian reward functions are fundamentally underdefined. To say the reward function will incentivize the right things, we have to consider the possibilities available to the agent: which path through time is the best?</p>\n<p>The bad thing here is that the reward function is no longer actually grading what the agent sees, but rather trying to output the right things to shape the agent’s behavior in the right ways. For example, to consider the behavior incentivized by a reward function linear in the number of blue pixels, we have to think about how the world is set up. We have to see, oh, this doesn’t just lead to the agent looking at blue objects; rather, there exist better possibilities, like showing yourself solid blue images forever.</p>\n<p>But maybe there don’t exist such possibilities – maybe we have <em>in fact</em> made it so the only way to get reward is by looking at blue objects. The only way to tell is by looking at the dynamics – at how the world changes as the agent acts. In many cases, you simply cannot make statements like “the agent is optimizing for <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"X\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

This problem is much, much harder: we now have the joint task of designing a reward function such that the best way of stringing together favorable observations lines up with what we want. This task requires thinking about how the world is structured, how the agent interacts with us, the agent’s possibilities at the beginning, how the agent’s learning algorithm affects things…</p>\n<p>Yikes.</p>\n<h2>Qualifications</h2>\n<p>The argument seems to hold for <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"n\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">n</span></span></span></span></span></span>-step Markovian reward functions, if <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"n\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> isn’t ridiculously large. If the input observation space is rich, then the problem probably relaxes. The problem isn't present in fully observable environments: by force of theorem (which presently assumes determinism and a finite state space), there exist Markovian reward functions whose only optimal policy is desirable.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t apply to e.g. Iterated Distillation and Amplification (updates based on policies), or Deep RL from Human Preferences (observation trajectories are graded). That is, you can get a wider space of optimal behaviors by updating policies on information other than a Markovian reward.</p>\n<p>It’s quite possible (and possibly even likely) that we use an approach for which this concern just doesn’t hold. However, this “what you see” concept feels important to understand, and serves as the billionth argument against specifying Markovian observation-based reward functions.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Rohin Shah and TheMajor for feedback.</em></p>\n",

Today’s average college-educated person talking about God sounds like this:</p><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Do you believe in God?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Yeah, I’d say I believe in God, in some sense.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Ok, in what sense?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Well, no one really knows, right? Like, what’s the meaning of life? Why is there something instead of nothing? Even scientists admit that we don’t understand these things. I respect that there’s a deeper kind of truth out there.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Ok, I remember you said your parents are Christian and they used to make you go to church sometimes… are you still a Christian now or what?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> At this point I wouldn’t be dogmatic about any one religion, but I wouldn’t call myself an atheist either. Maybe I could be considered agnostic? I feel like all the different religions have an awareness that there’s this deep force, or energy, or whatever you want to call it.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Ok, so, um… do you pray to God?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> No, I don’t really say prayers anymore, but I prayed when I was younger and I appreciate the ritual. The Western religions believe in praying to God and being saved. The Eastern religions believe in meditation and striving toward enlightenment. There are a lot of different paths to the same spiritual truth… I just have faith that there is a truth, you know?</blockquote><p>What did you think of Stephanie’s answers? I’m pretty sure most people would be like, “Yeah, sounds right to me. I’m just glad you didn’t ask <em>me </em>to explain it. I really would have struggled if you’d put me on the spot like that, but she did a pretty good job.”</p><p>If we were asking Stephanie about her fantasy sports team picks, we’d expect her to explain what she believes and <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Fundamental_Question_of_Rationality\">why she believes it</a>, grounding her claims in specific predictions about the outcomes of future sportsball games.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*87uXslSJFjQcJy3Q\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>But there’s a social norm that when we ask someone about “God”, it’s okay for them to squirt an ink cloud of “truth”, “energy”, “enlightenment”, “faith”, and so on, and make their getaway.</p><p>Let’s activate our specificity powers. We’ve seen that the best way to define a term is often to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pFvZXFWbtvKvGiACJ/how-specificity-works\">ground the term</a>, to slide it down the ladder of abstraction. How would Stephanie ground her concept of “God”? Her attempts might look like this:</p><ul><li><em>The universal force that people pray to.</em></li><li><em>The energy that makes the universe exist.</em></li><li><em>The destination that all religions lead to.</em></li></ul><p>Ooh, do you notice how these descriptions of \"God\" have an aura of poetic mystery if you read them out loud? Unfortunately, any <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6i3zToomS86oj9bS6/mysterious-answers-to-mysterious-questions\">mystery</a> they have means they’re doing a shitty job grounding the concept in concrete terms. I’m calling in dialogue-Liron.</p><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Let’s ground the concept of “God”. You said you currently believe in God. What if tomorrow you didn’t believe in God anymore? What would be noticeably different about a world where you didn’t believe in God?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Well, on most days I don’t think about God much, so it might not affect my day. But God still exists whether you believe in Her or not, don’t you think?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Ok, let’s say for the sake of argument that <em>I</em> believe there’s <em>no</em> God. Then it sounds like we don’t see eye to eye about the universe, right?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Right.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> And let’s say we’ve never talked with each other about God before, so neither of us knows yet whether the other believes in God or not. If we just go about our lives, when would we first notice that we don’t see eye to eye about the universe?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Maybe in a discussion like this, where someone starts talking about who believes in God, and I say “yes” and you say “no”.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Yeah, that’s what I suspected: The way to ground your concept of “God” is nothing more than “A word that some people prefer to say they believe in.” Which is just about as empty as it gets for words.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> You’re jumping to that conclusion pretty fast. If I believe in God and you don’t, I think there’s more to it than just a choice I make to say that I believe in God.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron: </strong>Ok, so to help me ground your concept of “God”, tell me another specific scenario where I can observe some consequence of the fact that you believe in God, besides hearing the words “I believe in God” coming out of your mouth.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> How about: I think that the universe has some kind of higher purpose.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Ok, so not only does believing in “God” imply that you’re likely to speak the words “I believe in God”, it also implies that you’re likely to speak the words “the universe has some kind of higher purpose”. I still suspect that in order to ground the concept of “God”, I don’t need to pay attention to anything in the world beyond the verbalizations you make when you’re having what you think are deep conversations.</blockquote><p>It would also be interesting to ask Stephanie what Sam Harris asked a guest on his <em>Making Sense</em> podcast: “Would you believe in God if God didn’t exist?” Is there something in our external reality, beyond your own preferences for what words you were taught to say and what words you feel good saying, that can in principle be flipped one way or the other to determine whether or not you believe in God? I suspect the answer is no.</p><p>Now consider how the dialogue would have gone differently if I were talking to Bob, a bible literalist who believes that God answers his prayers:</p><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Let’s say we’ve never talked with each other about God before, so neither of us knows yet whether the other believes in God or not. If we just go about our lives, when would we first notice that we don’t see eye to eye about the universe?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Bob:</strong> You’ll see me kneeling in prayer, and then you’ll see my prayers are more likely to get answered. Like when I know someone is in the hospital, I pray for their speedy recovery, and the folks I pray for will usually recover more speedily than the folks no one prays for.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron: </strong>Oh okay, cool. So we can ground your “God” as “the thing which makes people recover in the hospital faster when you pray for them”. Congratulations, that’s a nicely grounded concept whose associated phenomena extend beyond verbalizations you make.</blockquote><p>Unlike Stephanie’s concept, Bob’s concept of “God” has earned the respectable status of being concrete. Bob’s prayer-answering God is as concrete as Helios, the chariot-pulling sun god.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*zW8El7xVF3xr0q_M.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p><em>I wonder if this party died when someone invented dark glasses to look at the sun with.</em></p><p>From a specificity standpoint, Stephanie’s concept of God is empty and weird, while Bob’s concept is completely normal and fine.</p><p>On the other hand, Bob’s concept is demonstrably wrong, and Stephanie’s isn’t. But it’s easy to be not-wrong when you’re talking about empty concepts. Here’s Stephanie being not-wrong about “spirits”:</p><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Do you believe in spirits?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Yes</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Ok, how do I ground “spirit”? How do I know when to label something as a spirit?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> They’re a special type of beings.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Do you hear them speak to you?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> No, I don’t think so.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> If tomorrow spirits suddenly didn’t exist anymore, do you think you’d notice?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Hm, I don’t know about that.</blockquote><p>Ladies and gentleman, she’s not wrong!</p><p>Of course, she’s not <em>right</em> either, but that’s okay with her. She doesn’t enjoy talking about “God”, and when she does she’s only playing to not-lose, not playing to win.</p><p>Equipped with the power of specificity, it’s easy for us to observe the emptiness of Stephanie’s “God”. It’s harder for us to explain why all the intelligent Stephanies of the world are choosing to utter the sentence, “I believe in [empty concept]”.</p><p>Eliezer Yudkowsky <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7gRSERQZbqTuLX5re/p/fAuWLS7RKWD2npBFR\">traces</a> the historical lineage of how Bobs (God-believers) begat Stephanies (God-believers-<em>in</em>):</p><blockquote>Back in the old days, people actually <em>believed</em> their religions instead of just <em>believing in</em> them. The biblical archaeologists who went in search of Noah’s Ark did not think they were wasting their time; they anticipated they might become famous. Only after failing to find confirming evidence — and finding disconfirming evidence in its place — did religionists execute what William Bartley called <em>the retreat to commitment</em>, “I believe because I believe.”</blockquote><p>In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words\">Taboo Your Words</a>, Eliezer uses the power of specificity to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FfrWGCEhZJbkeFgww/the-power-to-demolish-bad-arguments\">demolish</a> the nice-sounding claim that religions are all paths to the same universal truth:</p><blockquote>The illusion of unity across religions can be dispelled by making the term “God” taboo, and asking them to say what it is they believe in; or making the word “faith” taboo, and asking them why they believe it.</blockquote><blockquote>Though mostly they won’t be able to answer at all, because it is mostly <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/\">profession</a> in the first place, and you cannot cognitively zoom in on an audio recording.</blockquote><p>In your own life, try to avoid the word “God”, and just discuss what you specifically want to discuss. If your conversation partner introduces the word “God”, your best move is to ground their terms. Establish what specifically they’re talking about, then have a conversation about that specific thing.</p><p><strong>Next post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h9ZfYJtpKYxBnGymP/the-power-to-be-emotionally-mature\">The Power to Be Emotionally Mature</a></p>",

By the end of this post, I promise you'll know what specifically \"solving climate change\" means... and also what it <em>doesn't</em> mean.</p><h1>The Climate Crisis</h1><p>The first step is knowing the key specific facts of the climate crisis. I admit I couldn't recite them accurately before writing this post. Here's a quick summary from <a href=\"https://www.tmrow.com/climatechange\">Tomorrow</a> and <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page1.php\">NASA</a> (both great friendly explanations worth checking out):</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4KvCbQpz1-G1_M0vwtDBFg.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><ul><li>Earth's average temperature has shot up by 1°C in the last 50 years.</li><li>The causal link from greenhouse gas emissions to Earth's rising temperature has been well established.</li><li>On a 1M-year timescale, Earth's temperature has been fluctuating plus or minus a few degrees tops, so this 1°C change is a big fluctuation.</li><li>We're predicting it to be as high as a 6°C warming by 2100, so it's actually a <em>huge</em> fluctuation.</li><li>The current rate of temperature rise is a whopping 20 times faster than the rate at which Earth's temperature historically fluctuates, so it's actually an <em>oh, SHIT</em> fluctuation.</li></ul><h1>Thiel's Definite vs. Indefinite Attitude</h1><p>In Peter Thiel's smart and highly original book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ\">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future</a></em>, the chapter called \"You Are Not A Lottery Ticket\" centers around the concept of <strong>definite </strong>vs. <strong>indefinite </strong>attitudes:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*fOgDxQfKDlo_FOTC.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Under the heading \"Can You Control Your Future?\" Thiel writes:</p><blockquote>You can expect the future to take a definite form or you can treat it as hazily uncertain. If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you'll give up on trying to master it.</blockquote><blockquote>Indefinite attitudes to the future explain what's the most dysfunctional in our world today. Process trumps substance: when people lack concrete plans to carry out, they use formal rules to assemble a portfolio of various options. This describes Americans today. In middle school, we're encouraged to start hoarding \"extracurricular activities\". In high school, ambitious students compete even harder to appear omnicompetent. By the time a student gets to college, he's spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he's ready—for nothing in particular.</blockquote><blockquote>A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it \"well-roundedness,\" a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. [...] This is not what young people do today, because everyone around them has long since lost faith in a definite world.</blockquote><p>When you have a <em>definite</em> attitude, you do stuff like:</p><ul><li>Claim that skill is more important than luck (or you can \"make your own luck\")</li><li>Back a political candidate who has a long-term plan you believe in</li><li>Start a company to make <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iMQmfgieRKY62MC3z/the-power-to-judge-startup-ideas\">something</a> people want</li><li>Work on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaproject\">megaprojects</a></li><li>Invest actively in companies and expect a high return</li></ul><p>While if you have an <em>indefinite</em> attitude, you do stuff like:</p><ul><li>Claim that success \"seems to stem as much from context as from personal attributes\" (a quote from Malcolm Gladwell's <em>Outliers</em>)</li><li>Follow election polls to see which candidate is the most popular this week</li><li>Graduate from business school and become a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKG4ED00_8M\">consultant</a></li><li>Work on a bunch of smaller projects to become well-rounded and keep your options open</li><li>Invest passively in a portfolio of stocks and bonds and expect low returns</li></ul><p>You've probably guessed why Thiel's distinction is relevant to our exploration of specificity: Activating your specificity powers is basically the same thing as switching from an indefinite to a definite attitude.</p><p>When a startup lacks a specific story about how they'll create value for specific users, but they're working frantically to build a product anyway, they're revealing an attitude of what Thiel calls <em>indefinite optimism</em>: \"The future will be better than the present, even though I can't tell you specifically how.\" Consistently with my post about <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iMQmfgieRKY62MC3z/the-power-to-judge-startup-ideas\">judging startup ideas</a>, Thiel says:</p><blockquote>A company is the strangest place of all for an indefinite optimist: why should you expect your own business to succeed without a plan to make it happen?</blockquote><p>(I consider it ironic that Thiel's Founders Fund has an investment in Golden, but it was a relatively small amount and unrepresentative of their normal decision-making.)</p><p>Thiel says that the western world had an era of <em>definite</em> optimism beginning in the 17th century and lasting through to the 1950s and '60s:</p><blockquote>In 1914, the Panama Canal cut short the route from Atlantic to Pacific. [...] The Interstate Highway System began construction in 1956, and the first 20,000 miles of road were open for driving by 1965. [...] NASA's Apollo Program began in 1961 and put 12 men on the moon before it finished in 1972.</blockquote><p>But, he says, the shared attitude in the US and Europe has now shifted to <em>indefinite</em>:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VhHR50LuXcoqbMCWL9OcOA.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><blockquote>The government used to be able to coordinate complex solutions to problems like atomic weaponry and lunar exploration. But today, after 40 years of indefinite creep, the government mainly just provides insurance; our solutions to big problems are Medicare, Social Security, and a dizzying array of other transfer payment programs.</blockquote><p>In order to solve the climate crisis, I think we desperately need a cultural shift back to definite optimism. We need specific plans for solving our problems.</p><h1><em>Definite</em> Climate Change Solutions</h1><p>Here are all the efforts I've heard of that are aiming at <em>definite</em> solutions to climate change.</p><h2>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change\">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</a> is an international treaty whose stated objective is:</p><blockquote>To stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</blockquote><p>The UNFCCC feels like it comes from an alternate universe containing an <a href=\"https://equilibriabook.com/\">adequate</a> civilization sane enough to coordinate top-down solutions in the face of existential threats. In fact, it was ratified in 1994 of the actual timeline we're in by all member states of the United Nations and the European Union.</p><p>Under the UNFCCC's guidelines, all 197 parties meet every year and negotiate more specific international treaties. This is how we got the 1997 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol\">Kyoto Protocol</a> (84 signatories) and the even-more-of-a-big-deal 2016 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement\">Paris Agreement</a> (195 signatories).</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*reyiD7SmrnRuRWGr.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>But while the UNFCCC provides definite per-country <em>targets</em> for greenhouse gas reduction, it doesn't provide definite <em>mechanisms or incentives</em> for countries to hit the targets.</p><p>At one point, the Kyoto Protocol tried to fix the problem by defining binding commitments on 37 countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by specific amounts, but only seven of them ratified that part.</p><p>The Paris Agreement doesn't even attempt anything as definite as that:</p><blockquote>The Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties, which are 'top down', characterized by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement. Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus-building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement#Structure\">[Source]</a></blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote>There will be only a \"name and shame\" system or as János Pásztor, the U.N. assistant secretary-general on climate change, told CBS News (US), a \"name and encourage\" plan. As the agreement provides no consequences if countries do not meet their commitments, consensus of this kind is fragile. A trickle of nations exiting the agreement could trigger the withdrawal of more governments, bringing about a total collapse of the agreement. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement#Nationally_determined_contributions\">[Source]</a></blockquote><p>So guess what? Countries haven't been trying that hard to live up to the UNFCCC's targets:</p><blockquote>A pair of studies in N<em>ature </em>have said that, as of 2017, none of the major industrialized nations were implementing the policies they had envisioned and have not met their pledged emission reduction targets, and even if they had, the sum of all member pledges (as of 2016) would not keep global temperature rise \"well below 2 °C\". <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement#Lack_of_binding_enforcement_mechanism\">Source</a></blockquote><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*nxL6kB7V-IEyhpzX.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Ouch.</p><p>But on a positive note, we have this international framework-treaty, the UNFCCC, which is at least trying to define specific targets. That's what the <em>start</em> of a good definite solution looks like, no matter how bad the follow-through has been so far.</p><h2>Y Combinator's Request for Carbon Removal Technologies</h2><p>In 2018, Sam Altman and Y Combinator announced an ongoing <a href=\"http://carbon.ycombinator.com/\">Request for Carbon Removal Technology Startups</a>. They're interested to fund and advise anyone working in the space, whether it's a for-profit company or nonprofit research. (Consider <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/\">applying</a>!)</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*AvyLIJi0TaNJoQfEgoW4aA.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>While the 25-year-old UNFCCC has always been focused on renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, YC's Request for Startups focuses entirely on <em>removing</em> greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, because we're now in a more advanced phase of the climate crisis than we used to be:</p><blockquote>\"Phase 1\" of climate change is reversible by reducing emissions, but we are no longer in \"Phase 1.\" We're now in \"Phase 2\" and stopping climate change requires both emission reduction and removing CO2 from the atmosphere. \"Phase 2\" is occurring faster and hotter than we thought. If we don't act soon, we'll end up in \"Phase 3\" and be too late for both of these strategies to work.</blockquote><p>YC names four major categories of frontier technologies which they admit \"straddle the border between very difficult to science fiction\", but are nevertheless worth exploring:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><a href=\"http://carbon.ycombinator.com/ocean-phytoplankton/\">Ocean Phytoplankton</a></li><li><a href=\"http://carbon.ycombinator.com/electro-geo-chemistry/\">Electro-Geo-Chemistry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://carbon.ycombinator.com/cell-free-systems/\">Cell-Free Enzyme Systems</a></li><li><a href=\"http://carbon.ycombinator.com/desert-flooding/\">Desert Flooding</a></li></ol><p>In a 2012 Stanford lecture, Thiel <a href=\"https://blakemasters.com/post/23435743973/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-13-notes\">lamented</a> that these kinds of definite proposals are outside the Overton window:</p><blockquote>It’s worth noting that something like geoengineering [projects to save the environment] would fall in the definite optimistic quadrant. Maybe we could scatter iron filings throughout the ocean to induce phytoplankton to absorb carbon dioxide. Potential solutions of that nature are not even remotely in the public debate. Only radically indefinite things make for acceptable discourse.</blockquote><p>But YC's RFS announcement was met with positive headlines like <a href=\"http://Carbon removal tech is having a moment\">\"Carbon removal tech is having a moment\"</a> and got 1187 points on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18285606\">Hacker News</a>. While, sadly, it didn't get much attention at all outside the tech community, it's fair to say that using frontier technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere now <em>is</em> acceptable discourse.</p><h2>Project Drawdown</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/\">Project Drawdown</a> evaluates specific solutions to the climate change problem by modeling their expected impact on greenhouse gas reduction.

In his 2006 post, <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me\">The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)</a>, he lays it out like this:</p><blockquote>Build sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use <em>that</em> money to build an even more affordable car. While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options.</blockquote><p>From our current perspective 13 years later, we can see that Musk accurately predicted the future by building it:</p><ul><li>Tesla built <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/solarpanels\">home solar panels</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/powerwall\">Powerwall</a> to enable a home to run entirely on solar energy by collecting sporadic bursts of sunlight and releasing the energy later when it's needed.

(Plus I think that markets generally don't price in the degree of demonstrated product and engineering excellence.)</p><h2>What About Cap And Trade?</h2><p>When I started thinking about how to solve climate change, the first thing that popped into mind is what I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/liron/status/1151856396100677633\">tweeted</a> a couple months ago:</p><blockquote>The <em>economy</em> is this amazing system we have for balancing all the stuff we <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZpDnRCeef2CLEFeKM/money-the-unit-of-caring\">care</a> about without guilting anyone into righteous sacrifice. Just internalize the CO2 externality into the economy.</blockquote><p>While Project Drawdown purposely doesn't include Cap and Trade in their list—&nbsp;</p><blockquote>We do not model incentive-based policies and financial mechanisms, such as carbon and congestion pricing, because they would be guesses, not models.</blockquote><p>—it sure seems like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading\">cap and trade</a> would go a long way toward solving the problem: It incentivizes greenhouse gas emitters to reduce emissions, it incentivizes private investment in frontier tech to reduce atmospheric CO2, and it incentivizes a bunch of other creative stuff like private efforts to <a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/materials/refrigerant-management\">destroy HFC refrigerants</a>.</p><p>President Obama <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading#Greenhouse_gases_(federal)\">tried</a> to get congressional approval for a version of Cap and Trade, but he couldn't. President Trump doesn't seem to care for it either. So when it comes to an economic-policy solution for climate change, the world's largest economy is currently doing nothing.</p><h1><em>Indefinite</em> Climate Change Solutions</h1><p>We’ve seen a bunch of definite ways people can help get closer to solving climate change:</p><ul><li>Work for Tesla</li><li>Work on any of the areas in Bret Victor’s list</li><li>Build a company or do research under Y Combinator’s Request for Carbon Removal Technologies</li><li>Work on a political campaign to support Cap and Trade and other pro-environment policies</li><li>Donate to Project Drawdown or any other organizations where you can understand the specific causal chain from their work to a better climate</li></ul><p>But what does <em>indefinite</em> thinking about climate change look like? For most people, climate change is a very indefinite thing:</p><ul><li>They can’t summarize the problem like I did in the beginning of this post</li><li>They can’t name any of the specific actions above that they can take to help solve climate change</li><li>And to make things worse, they focus on the most useless thing: personal behavior change</li></ul><h2>Personal Behavior Change</h2><p>I just Googled for \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=reduce+carbon+footprint\">reduce carbon footprint</a>\" to grab a ridiculous example of personal behavior change advice. The top result I got is <a href=\"https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/12/27/35-ways-reduce-carbon-footprint/\">The 35 Easiest Ways to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint</a> by Columbia University's Earth Institute.</p><p>Some of the recommendations are just good advice with no downside:</p><blockquote>8. <strong>Wash your clothing in cold water.</strong> The enzymes in cold water detergent are designed to clean better in cold water. Doing two loads of laundry weekly in cold water instead of hot or warm water can save up to 500 pounds of carbon dioxide each year.</blockquote><p>Okay if the enzymes in cold water detergent are designed to clean better in cold water, why not!</p><p>But most of the recommendations are asking you to make tradeoffs without acknowledging the downside:</p><blockquote>12. If you're in the market for a new computer, <strong>opt for a laptop instead of a desktop</strong>. Laptops require less energy to charge and operate than desktops.</blockquote><p>Wait, if you were going to buy a desktop computer, opting for the same-priced laptop instead will probably get you a noticeably slower machine. They should acknowledge these kinds of cost/benefit tradeoffs. But that's not even the biggest problem I have with personal behavior change recommendations.</p><p>The biggest problem with personal behavior change is that it naively feels like definite thinking, but it’s actually vague <em>indefinite</em> thinking, because your causal model of how your actions will affect greenhouse gas concentrations is missing the concept of an <strong>economic equilibrium</strong>.</p><p>Our economy, a free-market economy without Cap and Trade, is a classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">tragedy of the commons</a>. A low-greenhouse-gas atmosphere is the commons, and opting for a laptop instead of a desktop (or driving less, or buying less stuff, or eating less meat) is the equivalent of restraining your cows from grazing. It just doesn’t make game-theoretic sense.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OXMozEv2K2FJWuHR_rREOw.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>When you unilaterally dial back your CO2 emissions a certain amount, it means other actors (people, companies and the government) can get away with that same amount of <em>not</em> dialing back theirs, and they’ll act on that incentive. There needs to be an actual <em>coordination mechanism </em>to solve the problem — you know, the kind of thing government is for.</p><p>I've summarized my thoughts about personal behavior change in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/liron/status/1148406456938586113\">two</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/liron/status/1148557354872561664\">tweets</a>:</p><blockquote>To end homelessness, should we all give more spare change? To fix the US budget deficit, should taxpayers voluntarily pay higher taxes? Individuals buying carbon offsets is the same flawed logic. The equilibrium movement of a complex system is not a sum of these local nudges.</blockquote><blockquote>If stealing were legal, the solution would be law change, not charity to offset theft. Similarly, our economy lets everyone emit carbon for free. Individuals voluntarily offsetting small amounts of carbon is not an effective response to this situation.</blockquote><p>When people bring up personal behavior change as a solution to climate change, this is my reaction:</p><blockquote><strong>Steve:</strong> I should eat less meat because farm animals contribute to climate change!</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron: </strong>Don't bother; <a href=\"http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=sponsor\">for every animal you don’t eat, I’m going to eat three</a>. By the way, did you know Tesla is <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/careers/search#/\">hiring</a>?</blockquote><p>Steve doesn’t feel guilty that he’s contributing to the budget deficit by only paying the minimum taxes that he owes, so we know he understands economic equilibrium dynamics in that domain. I’m trying to do Steve a favor in this domain by tearing his focus away from personal behavior change, and pointing him toward a specific course of action (joining Tesla) that can <em>actually</em> add up to a complete solution even once you zoom out and factor in everyone's economic incentives.</p><h2>\"Offsetting\" Your Own Impact</h2><p>What about \"offsetting\" your own impact by paying an organization to reduce a certain amount of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere on your behalf, i.e. buying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_credit\">carbon credits</a>?</p><p>But I put \"offsetting\" in scare quotes because I don't think it's accurate to say that having an individual pay to prevent one ton of CO2 emissions in one place reduces the <em>system equilibrium</em> amount of greenhouse gas emission by one ton of CO2, or even necessarily half a ton. Similarly, I don't think taxpayers voluntarily paying an extra $1k/yr in taxes will actually reduce the budget deficit by $1k/yr/taxpayer. In both cases, some other actor in the system will be getting incentivized to emit more CO2 or to budget for more government spending.</p><p>When you just think about one person paying to plant a few trees, it's hard to imagine how the system equilibrium will bounce back against this perturbation. So let's break it down into two possible models: the government-oversight model and the no-government-oversight model.</p><p><strong>The Government-Oversight Model</strong></p><p>Consider the situation if the US Government were committed to hitting the Paris Agreement target emissions levels each year <a href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-spiked-in-2018--and-it-couldnt-happen-at-a-worse-time/2019/01/07/68cff792-12d6-11e9-803c-4ef28312c8b9_story.html\">[graph source]</a>:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*N3XpOIQjkgTwTGs9wRxUBQ.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>In this model, private citizens voluntarily paying to reduce carbon emissions is pointless because it's like paying taxes—everyone already <em>has</em> to do it. Perhaps it's already part of federal discretionary spending, or maybe a Cap and Trade policy has already priced carbon emissions into the goods and services we buy.</p><p>Ah, but what if an individual US citizen desires to <em>beat</em> the Paris Agreement targets? Even then, it's tricky to do it by purchasing \"offsets\". The effect of purchasing \"offsets\" will depend on the specific government-oversight model of the country where you intervene. For example, if you plant an extra tree in Country X, then you may cause Country X's companies to be allowed to emit more carbon that year.</p><p><strong>The No-Government-Oversight Model</strong></p><p>Consider the situation where the US Government doesn't bother limiting greenhouse gas emissions, a good approximation of the current Trump administration. The action of a few citizens to offset carbon won't move the needle in solving the climate crisis, until the point where enough citizens are donating that their combined political will can change government policy. So in this model, \"offsetting\" also has less impact than all the other specific climate change solutions discussed in this post.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p><a href=\"https://projectwren.com\">Wren</a> is a for-profit startup that launched a few months ago as part of Y Combinator's Summer 2019 batch (not part of YC's Request for Carbon Removal Technologies).</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*eGMgKNzsCm0OCCW6egKYpw.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Wren charges about $24/month for the average American to \"offset\" their carbon footprint.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*aI_8JTEKvcWkIPt9BwaCiw.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>What's the definite future here? What's the specific causal link between Wren's actions and climate change getting solved? Presumably it's that if a significant fraction of Americans pay $24/month ($288/yr), then the US's net carbon emissions will be a lot lower, and then the US could meet its Paris Agreement targets.</p><p>If every American adult were a member of Wren, this should be sufficient to offset the whole US's climate change, and that implies a cost of only $288/yr x $250M = <strong>$72B/yr</strong> to offset all Americans' carbon.</p><p>But consider this cost estimate from Washington governor and former 2020 presidential candidate Jay Inslee's <a href=\"https://www.jayinslee.com/issues/100clean/text/Inslee_100CleanPlan_2.pdf\">100% Clean Energy for America Plan</a> (which Massachusetts senator and still-presidential-candidate Elizabeth Warren now <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/03/politics/elizabeth-warren-jay-inslee-clean-energy-plan-green-new-deal/index.html\">endorses</a>):</p><blockquote>Climate change cost the U.S. economy at least $240 billion per year during the past decade, and that figure is projected to rise to $360 billion per year in the coming 10 years. We cannot afford the cost of inaction.</blockquote><p>If the US only cared about economic self-interest, not solving climate change per se, it's apparently worth paying at least $240B/yr to solve the problem.</p><p>So something feels very indefinite to me about Wren's approach to the problem, and \"offsetting\" carbon in general. If the specific projects Wren funds are such obvious slam dunks, isn't it faster to build up enough political support for a $72B/yr expenditure, rather than collecting it from individuals paying $288/yr at a time?</p><p>On the plus side, I'll admit that \"offsetting\" your own carbon footprint is at least a better option than personal behavior change, for the same reason that lawyers help more by donating to soup kitchens than by volunteering at them. \"Offsetting\" does let you direct money, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZpDnRCeef2CLEFeKM/money-the-unit-of-caring\">the unit of caring</a>, toward solving climate change. It's just that buying individual units of carbon removal is a bad deal because the system-level effect comes out to be so much weaker than an indefinite thinker imagines.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Activating your specificity powers to solve climate change means directing your resources toward efforts that have a <em>systemically definite</em> model of how they actually help. So while this was largely an object-level post about how to solve climate change, I hope it was also a good meta-level demonstration of the power of specificity.</p><p><strong>Next post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6xWqNXDS9w4R57szj/the-power-to-understand-god\">The Power to Understand \"God\"</a></p>",

The students asked me\ntheir questions via video snippets, and here are my answers:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Gergo: When was the first time you gave money to other people?  Did it start\nwhen you were younger, or when you were in college?</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe first donation I remember was a pair of political donations\nleading up to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election\">2008\nelection</a>.  I gave <a href=\"/p/annotated-spending-2004-2007\">$50\neach</a> to two candidates who were very unlikely to win: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gravel\">Mike Gravel</a> and\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul\">Ron Paul</a>.  I was\nhoping to expand the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window\">range of ideas</a>\npeople were discussing in the primaries.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe next time I donated was <a href=\"/donations\">$500</a> two years\nlater, after deciding to <a href=\"/p/giving\">give half</a> of what I\nearned to charity starting in 2009.  I think I decided to make my\nfirst donation in 2008 instead of 2009 because I misunderstood how\nincome taxes worked and thought it was better to spread donations\nacross years (in the US it's actually the <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/bunching\">opposite</a>).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Emilie: How did you get into this to start with and how do you keep up with\nit?  How did you get into the mindset of \"we can give so much and that's what\nwe want to do\", without flaking out?</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhen I started my first real job and was suddenly making much more\nmoney than I'd ever had before, the contrast between what I had and\nwhat I really needed weighed on me.  Based on my upbringing and\ntemperament I would have continued living simply and saved the money,\nbut after a lot of discussions with <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Julia</a> I realized that I wasn't\nok having so much while others had so little, and couldn't keep it.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis contrast hasn't gone away, and the level of need in the world remains\nunconscionably high, so I can't see doing something else.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt also helps that I've written a lot about this publicly, and it\nwould be pretty embarrassing to go back and say \"you know what, I'm\ndone with this 'charity' thing, saving up to buy a yacht is just too\nimportant to me.\"\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Danilla: At 22 you were broke and even though you had no job you still\ndonated all of your savings to the charity.  Why you did that and how did you\nlive at that time if you didn't have any money?</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis question is phrased as if it's intended for Julia, but I can give\nmy perspective.  While Julia hadn't found a job yet I was working full\ntime, and so I think she felt secure enough to donate her savings.  In\nretrospect I probably should have suggested keeping some, in case I\nlost my job, but I don't think she would have listened to me anyway.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Danilla: In 2011 I noticed that you didn't make any donations?  Did something\nhappen, or did you change your mind?</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt was a combination of two things.  Julia had decided to go back to\nschool to become a social worker.  She went to school full time in\norder to finish school sooner, which meant she didn't have any income\nto donate.  I had joined a startup which meant that part of my\ncompensation was stock options instead of being entirely cash.  I\ndecided that if my options ended up being worth something I would\ndonate them, which <a href=\"/p/leaving-bbn-joining-adverplex-risk-neutral-giving\">made sense\nto me</a> as a way to handle me being risk-averse for myself but\nrisk-neutral for charity. I <a href=\"/p/stock-options\">no longer\nthink</a> this was a good decision, primarily because I overestimated\nthe value of the options.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Jin: Why do you donate only internationally, even though America currently\nhas a lot of problems?  For example, something like 9/11 could happen again, or\nthere could be a natural disaster like an earthquake.  Why do you donate\nglobally to help people outside of your country?</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhile the US does have a lot of problems it's also a very rich country in a\nstrong position to address those problems.  Both 9/11 and earthquakes are\nexamples of the kind of thing the US government takes very seriously and has\nhighly-funded agencies to handle.  On the other hand, many other countries are\nmuch poorer and don't have the same kind of resources to address their\nproblems.  For example, we've donated to the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>\nto fund bednet distribution in countries like Malawi, helping people protect\nthemselves from malaria.  Malawi is a very poor country, and the US is about\n175x richer, per-capita, which means our money is much more able to help there.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis doesn't mean that Americans don't have problems or don't deserve\nhelp, but with the current levels of inequality, problems in the US\naren't at the top of my list.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Emelie: How long are you continuing this, and what are you planning for the\nfuture now that you have a child?</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI'm planning to continue trying to use a substantial portion of my time/money\nto help others as best as I can at least until I retire.  Having children (we\nnow have two, <a href=\"https://www.lilywise.com/\">5y</a> and <a href=\"https://www.annakaufmanwise.com/\">3y</a>) has been wonderful, but hasn't\nled me to change my goals or values.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Olivia: Where do you see yourself in ten years?  What is your ultimate goal or\nwhat you intend to achieve?  In the article that I read it said that as your\nsalary began to increase you began to give away more, but where do you see\nyourself ultimately reaching?  What are your limitations and aspirations as you\ngo into your future years?</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf I started making substantially more money I could see trying to\ndonate more than 50%, but for now 50% feels like a good place.  I\nmight also, at some point, switch from trying to have a positive\nimpact via donations to something similar via directly doing valuable\nthings.  I tried this <a href=\"/p/leaving-google-joining-wave\">in\n2017</a> and would do it again for the right opportunity.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Neja: What brings you joy in donating money?</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis varies a lot between people, but for me it's not really about\njoy.  It's about seeing how wrong things are and trying to make it\nbetter.  It's about wanting to do the right thing.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI didn't used to feel any emotional connection to giving, but that <a href=\"/p/parenting-and-emotional-changes\">changed</a> when I had kids.  As a\nparent of small children, looking at how malaria nets mean fewer parents have\nto bury their children makes me choke up.  The world is so incredibly unfair\nright now, and some people have to go through so much pain, but we can all\nhelp make things better.  So while I wouldn't call it joy it definitely makes\nme determined to help.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Aviva: Do you ever have second thoughts about donating?  For example, if one\nmonth you're on a tight budget do you think, like, \"maybe this month we\nshouldn't donate\".  Or, does it come naturally for you?</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<i>Sofia: Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you could have used the\nmoney you gave away to charity, and do you have any regrets about that?  Do you\nhave any money saved up for those situations?  Do you put money aside for\nemergency situations or do you try to manage with the money that you have left\nafter donating?</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWe're fine financially, mostly because we're lucky enough to have\nlucrative skills, and also because we're reasonably good at living\nwithin our means.  We've been incredibly fortunate, and I'm very happy\nwith our lives.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn the other hand, when I look at the money we've donated and think\nabout how our lives would be different if we had saved it instead it\ndoes make me a bit sad.  We could have gone the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement\">FIRE</a> route, in\nwhich case I think we would have been retiring around now, in our\nearly 30s, with more time for kids and hobbies.  Being able to afford\nto <a href=\"https://kingfisherband.com\">play music</a> full time or <a href=\"/bass-whistle\">create new musical instruments</a> would be\nreally fun.  But then I look at how many people are living in poverty,\ndealing with sickness, hunger, disasters, war, unemployment, and it's\nvery clear to me that this would have been the wrong choice.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100110927891452\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/posts/posts/PHF6N4yP2N7N5CETA\">the EA Forum</a></i></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<br/><p><em>Predictable Identities</em> is a series that <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/predictable-identities/\">I’m writing on Ribbonfarm</a>; you can also track its chronological progress <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2019/02/20/predictable-identities/\">on Putanumonit</a> with short summaries of each post. The 17th post in the series is below, summarizing the story so far and providing links to all the preceding posts in a narrative, rather than chronological order.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>Predictable Identities is 16 posts in, which is going much better than I would’ve predicted. It’s time to review what we covered so far: the principles of predictive processing and how we apply them to <em>other people</em>.</p><p>Our brains constantly <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/20/predictable-identities-1/\">predict sensory inputs using a hierarchy of models</a>. Learning new and better models improves our predictive ability in the long term but can be <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/05/22/predictable-identities-10-big-updates/\">so painful in the short term</a> that <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/06/06/predictable-identities-10-fear-myths-and-the-outgroup-part-i/\">we will fight against updating</a>, and often <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/06/26/predictable-identities-12-fear-myths-and-the-outgroup-part-ii/\">fight the people who force us to update</a>. It’s important to take <em><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/07/24/predictable-identities-14-frameworks-are-fake/\">all</a></em><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/07/24/predictable-identities-14-frameworks-are-fake/\"> models</a> with a grain of salt and resist the lure of <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/07/10/predictable-identities-13-totalizing-ideologies/\">all-explaining ideologies</a>.</p><p>We predict the world <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/27/predictable-identities-2/\">to exploit and act on it</a>, and the same applies to other people. We need to know how to get people <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/10/predictable-identities-3/\">to do nice things for us</a>, using <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/13/predictable-identities-4/\">stereotypes for strangers we don’t know</a> and more <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/08/14/predictable-identities-15-newcomblike-part-i/\">detailed mind-simulations</a> for people we do. We don’t need detailed models <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/20/predictable-identities-5/\">for people unlikely to be nice</a> no matter what, and <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/03/predictable-identities-6/\">we’re creeped out</a> by people who don’t fit our models at all like those who <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/24/predictable-identities-7-weirdness-budget/\">blow their non-conformity budget</a>. We <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/17/predictable-identities-7-roles-people-play/\">encourage those around us to conform</a> to our narratives and predictions of them, which means that <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/05/08/predictable-identities-9-how-to-change/\">changing one’s opinions and behavior</a> takes great effort in the face of the expectations of your social surroundings.</p><p>Finally, our predictions of ourselves interplay in complex ways with how others see us, since our minds are neither transparent to us nor opaque to those around us. For example, to be treated nicely <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/08/28/predictable-identities-16-newcomblike-part-ii/\">we must honestly believe that we are nice</a>, even if that is self-deceiving. Our models, predictions, and beliefs about our selves form our <em>identities</em>. This will be the topic for the second half of this blogchain.</p><p>Thanks for joining me on this journey, I predict exciting things ahead.</p>",

The problem is that that preferences like that don't talk about just two subsets of worlds, but many more.</p>\n<p>Thus a partial preference was defined as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preorder\">preorder</a>. Now, a preorder is certainly rich enough to include preferences like <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"P_2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.109em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;\">P</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, but its allows for far too many different types of structures, needing a complicated energy-minimisation procedure to turn a preorder into a utility function.</p>\n<p>This post presents another formalism for partial preferences, that keeps the initial intuition but can capture preferences like <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"P_2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.109em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;\">P</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<h2>The formalism</h2>\n<p>Let <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal{W}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.046em;\">W</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> be the (finite) set of all worlds, seen as universes with their whole history.</p>\n<p>Let <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal{X}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.094em;\">X</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> be a subset of <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal{W}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.046em;\">W</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, and let <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"l\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">l</span></span></span></span></span></span> be an injective (one-to-one) map from <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal{X}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.094em;\">X</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal{W}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.046em;\">W</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

With his permission, we have transcribed this interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Participants</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://paulfchristiano.com/\">Paul Christiano</a> — OpenAI safety team</li><li>Asya Bergal – AI Impacts</li><li>Ronny Fernandez – AI Impacts</li><li><a href=\"http://robertlong.online/\">Robert Long</a> – AI Impacts</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We spoke with Paul Christiano on August 13, 2019. Here is a brief summary of that conversation:<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AI safety is worth working on because AI poses a large risk and AI safety is neglected, and tractable.</li><li>Christiano is more optimistic about the likely social consequences of advanced AI than some others in AI safety, in particular researchers at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), for the following reasons:<ul><li>The prior on any given problem reducing the expected value of the future by 10% should be low.</li><li>There are several ‘saving throws’–ways in which, even if one thing turns out badly, something else can turn out well, such that AI is not catastrophic.</li><li>Many algorithmic problems are either solvable within 100 years, or provably impossible; this inclines Christiano to think that AI safety problems are reasonably likely to be easy.</li><li>MIRI thinks success is guaranteeing that unaligned intelligences are never created, whereas Christiano just wants to leave the next generation of intelligences in at least as good of a place as humans were when building them. </li><li>‘Prosaic AI’ that looks like current AI systems will be less hard to align than MIRI thinks: <ul><li>Christiano thinks there’s at least a one-in-three chance that we’ll be able to solve AI safety on paper in advance.</li><li>A common view within ML is that that we’ll successfully solve problems as they come up.</li></ul></li><li>Christiano has relatively less confidence in several inside view arguments for high levels of risk:<ul><li>Building safe AI requires hitting a small target in the space of programs, but building any AI also requires hitting a small target.</li><li>Because Christiano thinks that the state of evidence is less clear-cut than MIRI does, Christiano also has a higher probability that people will become more worried in the future. </li><li>Just because we haven’t solved many problems in AI safety yet doesn’t mean they’re intractably hard– many technical problems feel this way and then get solved in 10 years of effort.</li><li>Evolution is often used as an analogy to argue that general intelligence (humans with their own goals) becomes dangerously unaligned with the goals of the outer optimizer (evolution selecting for reproductive fitness). But this analogy doesn’t make Christiano feel so pessimistic, e.g. he thinks that if we tried, we could breed animals that are somewhat smarter than humans and are also friendly and docile.</li><li>Christiano is optimistic about verification, interpretability, and adversarial training for inner alignment, whereas MIRI is pessimistic.</li><li>MIRI thinks the outer alignment approaches Christiano proposes are just obscuring the core difficulties of alignment, while Christiano is not yet convinced there is a deep core difficulty.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Christiano thinks there are several things that could change his mind and optimism levels, including:<ul><li>Learning about institutions and observing how they solve problems analogous to AI safety.</li><li>Seeing whether AIs become deceptive and how they respond to simple oversight.</li><li>Seeing how much progress we make on AI alignment over the coming years.</li></ul></li><li>Christiano is relatively optimistic about his iterated amplification approach:<ul><li>Christiano cares more about making aligned AIs that are competitive with unaligned AIs, whereas MIRI is more willing to settle for an AI with very narrow capabilities.</li><li>Iterated amplification is largely based on learning-based AI systems, though it may work in other cases.</li><li>Even if iterated amplification isn’t the answer to AI safety, it’s likely to have subproblems in common with problems that are important in the future.</li></ul></li><li>There are still many disagreements between Christiano and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) that are messy and haven’t been made precise.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This transcript has been lightly edited for concision and clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2> Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal:</strong> Okay. We are recording. I’m going to ask you a bunch of questions related to something like AI optimism.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the proposition that we’re looking at is something like ‘is it valuable for people to be spending significant effort doing work that purports to reduce the risk from advanced artificial intelligence’? The first question would be to give a short-ish version of the reasoning around that.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Around why it’s overall valuable?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal:</strong> Yeah. Or the extent to which you think it’s valuable.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> I don’t know, this seems complicated. I’m acting from some longtermerist perspective, I’m like, what can make the world irreversibly worse? There aren’t that many things, we go extinct. It’s hard to go extinct, doesn’t seem that likely.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Long:</strong> We keep forgetting to say this, but we are focusing less on ethical considerations that might affect that. We’ll grant…yeah, with all that in the background….<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Granting long-termism, but then it seems like it depends a lot on what’s the probability? What fraction of our expected future do we lose by virtue of messing up alignment * what’s the elasticity of that to effort / how much effort?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Long:</strong> That’s the stuff we’re curious to see what people think about.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal</strong>: I also just read your 80K interview, which I think probably covered like a lot of the reasoning about this.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>They probably did. I don’t remember exactly what’s in there, but it was a lot of words.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know. I’m like, it’s a lot of doom probability. Like maybe I think AI alignment per se is like 10% doominess. That’s a lot. Then it seems like if we understood everything in advance really well, or just having a bunch of people working on now understanding what’s up, could easily reduce that by a big chunk.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez: </strong>Sorry, what do you mean by 10% doominesss?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> I don’t know, the future is 10% worse than it would otherwise be in expectation by virtue of our failure to align AI. I made up 10%, it’s kind of a random number. I don’t know, it’s less than 50%. It’s more than 10% conditioned on AI soon I think.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez:</strong> And that’s change in expected value.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> Yeah. Anyway, so 10% is a lot. Then I’m like, maybe if we sorted all our shit out and had a bunch of people who knew what was up, and had a good theoretical picture of what was up, and had more info available about whether it was a real problem. Maybe really nailing all that could cut that risk from 10% to 5% and maybe like, you know, there aren’t that many people who work on it, it seems like a marginal person can easily do a thousandth of that 5% change. Now you’re looking at one in 20,000 or something, which is a good deal.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal: </strong>I think my impression is that that 10% is lower than some large set of people. I don’t know if other people agree with that.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Certainly, 10% is lower than lots of people who care about AI risk. I mean it’s worth saying, that I have this slightly narrow conception of what is the alignment problem. I’m not including all AI risk in the 10%. I’m not including in some sense most of the things people normally worry about and just including the like ‘we tried to build an AI that was doing what we want but then it wasn’t even trying to do what we want’. I think it’s lower now or even after that caveat, than pessimistic people. It’s going to be lower than all the MIRI folks, it’s going to be higher than almost everyone in the world at large, especially after specializing in this problem, which is a problem almost no one cares about, which is precisely how a thousand full time people for 20 years can reduce the whole risk by half or something.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal:</strong> I’m curious for your statement as to why you think your number is slightly lower than other people.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> Yeah, I don’t know if I have a particularly crisp answer. Seems like it’s a more reactive thing of like, what are the arguments that it’s very doomy? A priori you might’ve been like, well, if you’re going to build some AI, you’re probably going to build the AI so it’s trying to do what you want it to do. Probably that’s that. Plus, most things can’t destroy the expected value of the future by 10%. You just can’t have that many things, otherwise there’s not going to be any value left in the end. In particular, if you had 100 such things, then you’d be down to like 1/1000th of your values. 1/10 hundred thousandth? I don’t know, I’m not good at arithmetic.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, that’s a priori, just aren’t that many things are that bad and it seems like people would try and make AI that’s trying to do what they want. Then you’re like, okay, we get to be pessimistic because of some other argument about like, well, we don’t currently know how to build an AI which will do what we want. We’re like, there’s some extrapolation of current techniques on which we’re concerned that we wouldn’t be able to. Or maybe some more conceptual or intuitive argument about why AI is a scary kind thing, and AIs tend to want to do random shit.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then like, I don’t know, now we get into, how strong is that argument for doominess? Then a major thing that drives it is I am like, reasonable chance there is no problem in fact. Reasonable chance, if there is a problem we can cope with it just by trying. Reasonable chance, even if it will be hard to cope with, we can sort shit out well enough on paper that we really nail it and understand how to resolve it. Reasonable chance, if we don’t solve it the people will just not build AIs that destroy everything they value.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s lots of saving throws, you know? And you multiply the saving throws together and things look better. And they interact better than that because– well, in one way worse because it’s correlated: If you’re incompetent, you’re more likely to fail to solve the problem and more likely to fail to coordinate not to destroy the world. In some other sense, it’s better than interacting multiplicatively because weakness in one area compensates for strength in the other. I think there are a bunch of saving throws that could independently make things good, but then in reality you have to have a little bit here and a little bit here and a little bit here, if that makes sense. We have some reasonable understanding on paper that makes the problem easier. The problem wasn’t that bad. We wing it reasonably well and we do a bunch of work and in fact people are just like, ‘Okay, we’re not going to destroy the world given the choice.’ I guess I have this somewhat distinctive last saving throw where I’m like, ‘Even if you have unaligned AI, it’s probably not that bad.’<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn’t do much of the work, but you know you add a bunch of shit like that together.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal:</strong> That’s a lot of probability mass on a lot of different things. I do feel like my impression is that, on the first step of whether by default things are likely to be okay or things are likely to be good, people make arguments of the form, ‘You have a thing with a goal and it’s so hard to specify. By default, you should assume that the space of possible goals to specify is big, and the one right goal is hard to specify, hard to find.’ Obviously, this is modeling the thing as an agent, which is already an assumption.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Yeah. I mean it’s hard to run or have much confidence in arguments of that form. I think it’s possible to run tight versions of that argument that are suggestive. It’s hard to have much confidence in part because you’re like, look, the space of all programs is very broad, and the space that do your taxes is quite small, and we in fact are doing a lot of selecting from the vast space of programs to find one that does your taxes– so like, you’ve already done a lot of that.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have to be getting into more detailed arguments about exactly how hard is it to select. I think there’s two kinds of arguments you can make that are different, or which I separate. One is the inner alignment treacherous turney argument, where like, we can’t tell the difference between AIs that are doing the right and wrong thing, even if you know what’s right because blah blah blah. The other is well, you don’t have this test for ‘was it right’ and so you can’t be selecting for ‘does the right thing’.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a place where the concern is disjunctive, you have like two different things, they’re both sitting in your alignment problem. They can again interact badly. But like, I don’t know, I don’t think you’re going to get to high probabilities from this. I think I would kind of be at like, well I don’t know. Maybe I think it’s more likely than not that there’s a real problem but not like 90%, you know? Like maybe I’m like two to one that there exists a non-trivial problem or something like that. All of the numbers I’m going to give are very made up though. If you asked me a second time you’ll get all different numbers.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal:</strong> That’s good to know.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> Sometimes I anchor on past things I’ve said though, unfortunately.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal:</strong> Okay. Maybe I should give you some fake past Paul numbers.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>You could be like, ‘In that interview, you said that it was 85%’. I’d be like, ‘I think it’s really probably 82%’.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal:</strong> I guess a related question is, is there plausible concrete evidence that you think could be gotten that would update you in one direction or the other significantly?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Yeah. I mean certainly, evidence will roll in once we have more powerful AI systems.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One can learn… I don’t know very much about any of the relevant institutions, I may know a little bit. So you can imagine easily learning a bunch about them by observing how well they solve analogous problems or learning about their structure, or just learning better about the views of people. That’s the second category.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re going to learn a bunch of shit as we continue thinking about this problem on paper to see like, does it look like we’re going to solve it or not? That kind of thing. It seems like there’s lots of sorts of evidence on lots of fronts, my views are shifting all over the place. That said, the inconsistency between one day and the next is relatively large compared to the actual changes in views from one day to the next.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Long: </strong>Could you say a little bit more about evidence from once more advanced AI starts coming in? Like what sort things you’re looking for that would change your mind on things?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> Well you get to see things like, on inner alignment you get to see to what extent do you have the kind of crazy shit that people are concerned about? The first time you observe some crazy shit where your AI is like, ‘I’m going to be nice in order to assure that you think I’m nice so I can stab you in the back later.’ You’re like, ‘Well, I guess that really does happen despite modest effort to prevent it.’ That’s a thing you get. You get to learn in general about how models generalize, like to what extent they tend to do– this is sort of similar to what I just said, but maybe a little bit broader– to what extent are they doing crazy-ish stuff as they generalize?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get to learn about how reasonable simple oversight is and to what extent do ML systems acquire knowledge that simple overseers don’t have that then get exploited as they optimize in order to produce outcomes that are actually bad. I don’t have a really concise description, but sort of like, to the extent that all these arguments depend on some empirical claims about AI, you get to see those claims tested increasingly.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez:</strong> So the impression I get from talking to other people who know you, and from reading some of your blog posts, but mostly from others, is that you’re somewhat more optimistic than most people that work in AI alignment. It seems like some people who work on AI alignment think something like, ‘We’ve got to solve some really big problems that we don’t understand at all or there are a bunch of unknown unknowns that we need to figure out.’ Maybe that’s because they have a broader conception of what solving AI alignment is like than you do?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> That seems like it’s likely to be part of it. It does seem like I’m more optimistic than people in general, than people who work in alignment in general. I don’t really know… I don’t understand others’ views that well and I don’t know if they’re that– like, my views aren’t that internally coherent. My suspicion is others’ views are even less internally coherent. Yeah, a lot of it is going to be done by having a narrower conception of the problem.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then a lot of it is going to be done by me just being… in terms of do we need a lot of work to be done, a lot of it is going to be me being like, I don’t know man, maybe. I don’t really understand when people get off the like high probability of like, yeah. I don’t see the arguments that are like, definitely there’s a lot of crazy stuff to go down. It seems like we really just don’t know. I do also think problems tend to be easier. I have more of that prior, especially for problems that make sense on paper. I think they tend to either be kind of easy, or else– if they’re possible, they tend to be kind of easy. There aren’t that many really hard theorems.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Long: </strong>Can you say a little bit more of what you mean by that? That’s not a very good follow-up question, I don’t really know what it would take for me to understand what you mean by that better. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Like most of the time, if I’m like, ‘here’s an algorithms problem’, you can like– if you just generate some random algorithms problems, a lot of them are going to be impossible. Then amongst the ones that are possible, a lot of them are going to be soluble in a year of effort and amongst the rest, a lot of them are going to be soluble in 10 or a hundred years of effort. It’s just kind of rare that you find a problem that’s soluble– by soluble, I don’t just mean soluble by human civilization, I mean like, they are not provably impossible– that takes a huge amount of effort.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It normally… it’s less likely to happen the cleaner the problem is. There just aren’t many very clean algorithmic problems where our society worked on it for 10 years and then we’re like, ‘Oh geez, this still seems really hard.’ Examples are kind of like… factoring is an example of a problem we’ve worked a really long time on. It kind of has the shape, and this is the tendency on these sorts of problems, where there’s just a whole bunch of solutions and we hack away and we’re a bit better and a bit better and a bit better. It’s a very messy landscape, rather than jumping from having no solution to having a solution. It’s even rarer to have things where going from no solution to some solution is really possible but incredibly hard. There were some examples.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Long: </strong>And you think that the problems we face are sufficiently similar?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> I mean, I think this is going more into the like, ‘I don’t know man’ but my what do I think when I say I don’t know man isn’t like, ‘Therefore, there’s an 80% chance that it’s going to be an incredibly difficult problem’ because that’s not what my prior is like. I’m like, reasonable chance it’s not that hard. Some chance it’s really hard. Probably more chance that– if it’s really hard, I think it’s more likely to be because all the clean statements of the problem are impossible. I think as statements get messier it becomes more plausible that it just takes a lot of effort. The more messy a thing is, the less likely it is to be impossible sometimes, but also the more likely it’s just a bunch of stuff you have to do.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez:</strong> It seems like one disagreement that you have with MIRI folks is that you think prosaic AGI will be easier to align than they do. Does that perception seem right to you?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano:</strong> I think so. I think they’re probably just like, ‘that seems probably impossible’. Was related to the previous point.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez:</strong> If you had found out that prosaic AGI is nearly impossible to align or is impossible to align, how much would that change your-<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>It depends exactly what you found out, exactly how you found it out, et cetera. One thing you could be told is that there’s no perfectly scalable mechanism where you can throw in your arbitrarily sophisticated AI and turn the crank and get out an arbitrarily sophisticated aligned AI. That’s a possible outcome. That’s not necessarily that damning because now you’re like okay, fine, you can almost do it basically all the time and whatever.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a big class of worlds and that would definitely be a thing I would be interested in understanding– how large is that gap actually, if the nice problem was totally impossible? If at the other extreme you just told me, ‘Actually, nothing like this is at all going to work, and it’s definitely going to kill everyone if you build an AI using anything like an extrapolation of existing techniques’, then I’m like, ‘Sounds pretty bad.’ I’m still not as pessimistic as MIRI people.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m like, maybe people just won’t destroy the world, you know, it’s hard to say. It’s hard to say what they’ll do. It also depends on the nature of how you came to know this thing. If you came to know it in a way that’s convincing to a reasonably broad group of people, that’s better than if you came to know it and your epistemic state was similar to– I think MIRI people feel more like, it’s already known to be hard, and therefore you can tell if you can’t convince people it’s hard. Whereas I’m like, I’m not yet convinced it’s hard, so I’m not so surprised that you can’t convince people it’s hard.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s more probability, if it was known to be hard, that we can convince people, and therefore I’m optimistic about outcomes conditioned on knowing it to be hard. I might become almost as pessimistic as MIRI if I thought that the problem was insolubly hard, just going to take forever or whatever, huge gaps aligning prosaic AI, and there would be no better evidence of that than currently exists. Like there’s no way to explain it better to people than MIRI currently can. If you take those two things, I’m maybe getting closer to MIRI’s levels of doom probability. I might still not be quite as doomy as them.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez:</strong> Why does the ability to explain it matter so much?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Well, a big part of why you don’t expect people to build unaligned AI is they’re like, they don’t want to. The clearer it is and the stronger the case, the more people can potentially do something. In particular, you might get into a regime where you’re doing a bunch of shit by trial and error and trying to wing it. And if you have some really good argument that the winging it is not going to work, then that’s a very different state than if you’re like, ‘Well, winging it doesn’t seem that good. Maybe it’ll fail.’ It’s different to be like, ‘Oh no, here’s an argument. You just can’t… It’s just not going to work.’<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t think we’ll really be in that state, but there’s like a whole spectrum from where we’re at now to that state and I expect to be further along it, if in fact we’re doomed. For example, if I personally would be like, ‘Well, I at least tried the thing that seemed obvious to me to try and now we know that doesn’t work.’ I sort of expect very directly from trying that to learn something about why that failed and what parts of the problem seem difficult.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez:</strong> Do you have a sense of why MIRI thinks aligning prosaic AI is so hard?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>We haven’t gotten a huge amount of traction on this when we’ve debated it. I think part of their position, especially on the winging it thing, is they’re like – Man, doing things right generally seems a lot harder than doing them. I guess probably building an AI will be harder in a way that’s good, for some arbitrary notion of good– a lot harder than just building an AI at all.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a theme that comes up frequently trying to hash this out, and it’s not so much about a theoretical argument, it’s just like, look, the theoretical argument establishes that there’s something a little bit hard here. And once you have something a little bit hard and now you have some giant organization, people doing the random shit they’re going to do, and all that chaos, and like, getting things to work takes all these steps, and getting this harder thing to work is going to have some extra steps, and everyone’s going to be doing it. They’re more pessimistic based on those kinds of arguments.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the thing that comes up a lot. I think probably most of the disagreement is still in the, you know, theoretically, how much– certainly we disagree about like, can this problem just be solved on paper in advance? Where I’m like, reasonable chance, you know? At least a third chance, they’ll just on paper be like, ‘We have nailed it.’ There’s really no tension, no additional engineering effort required. And they’re like, that’s like zero. I don’t know what they think it is. More than zero, but low.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez:</strong> Do you guys think you’re talking about the same problem exactly?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>I think there we are probably. At that step we are. Just like, is your AI trying to destroy everything? Yes. No. The main place there’s some bleed over–  the main thing that MIRI maybe considers in scope and I don’t is like, if you build an AI, it may someday have to build another AI. And what if the AI it builds wants to destroy everything? Is that our fault or is that the AI’s fault? And I’m more on like, that’s the AI’s fault. That’s not my job. MIRI’s maybe more like not distinguishing those super cleanly, but they would say that’s their job. The distinction is a little bit subtle in general, but-<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez:</strong> I guess I’m not sure why you cashed out in terms of fault.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>I think for me it’s mostly like: there’s a problem we can hope to resolve. I think there’s two big things. One is like, suppose you don’t resolve that problem. How likely is it that someone else will solve it? Saying it’s someone else’s fault is in part just saying like, ‘Look, there’s this other person who had a reasonable opportunity to solve it and it was a lot smarter than us.’ So the work we do is less likely to make the difference between it being soluble or not. Because there’s this other smarter person.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other thing is like, what should you be aiming for? To the extent there’s a clean problem here which one could hope to solve, or one should bite off as a chunk, what fits in conceptually the same problem versus what’s like– you know, an analogy I sometimes make is, if you build an AI that’s doing important stuff, it might mess up in all sorts of ways. But when you’re asking, ‘Is my AI going to mess up when building a nuclear reactor?’ It’s a thing worth reasoning about as an AI person, but also like it’s worth splitting into like– part of that’s an AI problem, and part of that’s a problem about understanding managing nuclear waste. Part of that should be done by people reasoning about nuclear waste and part of it should be done by people reasoning about AI.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a little subtle because both of the problems have to do with AI. I would say my relationship with that is similar to like, suppose you told me that some future point, some smart people might make an AI. There’s just a meta and object level on which you could hope to help with the problem.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m hoping to help with the problem on the object level in the sense that we are going to do research which helps people align AI, and in particular, will help the future AI align the next AI. Because it’s like people. It’s at that level, rather than being like, ‘We’re going to construct a constitution of that AI such that when it builds future AI it will always definitely work’. This is related to like– there’s this old argument about recursive self-improvement. It’s historically figured a lot in people’s discussion of why the problem is hard, but on a naive perspective it’s not obvious why it should, because you do only a small number of large modifications before your systems are sufficiently intelligent relative to you that it seems like your work should be obsolete. Plus like, them having a bunch of detailed knowledge on the ground about what’s going down.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems unclear to me how– yeah, this is related to our disagreement– how much you’re happy just deferring to the future people and being like, ‘Hope that they’ll cope’. Maybe they won’t even cope by solving the problem in the same way, they might cope by, the crazy AIs that we built reach the kind of agreement that allows them to not build even crazier AIs in the same way that we might do that. I think there’s some general frame of, I’m just taking responsibility for less, and more saying, can we leave the future people in a situation that is roughly as good as our situation? And by future people, I mean mostly AIs.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez:</strong> Right. The two things that you think might explain your relative optimism are something like: Maybe we can get the problem to smarter agents that are humans. Maybe we can leave the problem to smarter agents that are not humans.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Also a lot of disagreement about the problem. Those are certainly two drivers. They’re not exhaustive in the sense that there’s also a huge amount of disagreement about like, ‘How hard is this problem?’ Which is some combination of like, ‘How much do we know about it?’ Where they’re more like, ‘Yeah, we’ve thought about it a bunch and have some views.’ And I’m like, ‘I don’t know, I don’t think I really know shit.’ Then part of it is concretely there’s a bunch of– on the object level, there’s a bunch of arguments about why it would be hard or easy so we don’t reach agreement. We consistently disagree on lots of those points.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez: </strong>Do you think the goal state for you guys is the same though? If I gave you guys a bunch of AGIs, would you guys agree about which ones are aligned and which ones are not? If you could know all of their behaviors?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>I think at that level we’d probably agree. We don’t agree more broadly about what constitutes a win state or something. They have this more expansive conception– or I guess it’s narrower– that the win state is supposed to do more. They are imagining more that you’ve resolved this whole list of future challenges. I’m more not counting that.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve had this… yeah, I guess I now mostly use intent alignment to refer to this problem where there’s risk of ambiguity… the problem that I used to call AI alignment. There was a long obnoxious back and forth about what the alignment problem should be called. MIRI does use aligned AI to be like, ‘an AI that produces good outcomes when you run it’. Which I really object to as a definition of aligned AI a lot. So if they’re using that as their definition of aligned AI, we would probably disagree.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez: </strong>Shifting terms or whatever… one thing that they’re trying to work on is making an AGI that has a property that is also the property you’re trying to make sure that AGI has.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Yeah, we’re all trying to build an AI that’s trying to do the right thing.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez: </strong>I guess I’m thinking more specifically, for instance, I’ve heard people at MIRI say something like, they want to build an AGI that I can tell it, ‘Hey, figure out how to copy a strawberry, and don’t mess anything else up too badly.’ Does that seem like the same problem that you’re working on?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>I mean it seems like in particular, you should be able to do that. I think it’s not clear whether that captures all the complexity of the problem. That’s just sort of a question about what solutions end up looking like, whether that turns out to have the same difficulty. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other things you might think are involved that are difficult are… well, I guess one problem is just how you capture competitiveness. Competitiveness for me is a key desideratum. And it’s maybe easy to elide in that setting, because it just makes a strawberry. Whereas I am like, if you make a strawberry literally as well as anyone else can make a strawberry, it’s just a little weird to talk about. And it’s a little weird to even formalize what competitiveness means in that setting. I think you probably can, but whether or not you do that’s not the most natural or salient aspect of the situation. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I probably disagree with them about– I’m like, there are probably lots of ways to have agents that make strawberries and are very smart. That’s just another disagreement that’s another function of the same basic, ’How hard is the problem’ disagreement. I would guess relative to me, in part because of being more pessimistic about the problem, MIRI is more willing to settle for an AI that does one thing. And I care more about competitiveness.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal: </strong>Say you just learn that prosaic AI is just not going to be the way we get to AGI. How does that make you feel about the IDA approach versus the MIRI approach?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>So my overall stance when I think about alignment is, there’s a bunch of possible algorithms that you could use. And the game is understanding how to align those algorithms. And it’s kind of a different game. There’s a lot of common subproblems in between different algorithms you might want to align, it’s potentially a different game for different algorithms. That’s an important part of the answer. I’m mostly focusing on the ‘align this particular’– I’ll call it learning, but it’s a little bit more specific than learning– where you search over policies to find a policy that works well in practice. If we’re not doing that, then maybe that solution is totally useless, maybe it has common subproblems with the solution you actually need. That’s one part of the answer.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big difference is going to be, timelines views will shift a lot if you’re handed that information. So it will depend exactly on the nature of the update. I don’t have a strong view about whether it makes my timelines shorter or longer overall. Maybe you should bracket that though.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of returning to the first one of trying to align particular algorithms, I don’t know. I think I probably share some of the MIRI persp– well, no. It feels to me like there’s a lot of common subproblems. Aligning expert systems seems like it would involve a lot of the same reasoning as aligning learners. To the extent that’s true, probably future stuff also will involve a lot of the same subproblems, but I doubt the algorithm will look the same. I also doubt the actual algorithm will look anything like a particular pseudocode we might write down for iterated amplification now.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal: </strong>Does iterated amplification in your mind rely on this thing that searches through policies for the best policy? The way I understand it, it doesn’t feel like it necessarily does.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>So, you use this distillation step. And the reason you want to do amplification, or this short-hop, expensive amplification, is because you interleave it with this distillation step. And I normally imagine the distillation step as being, learn a thing which works well in practice on a reward function defined by the overseer. You could imagine other things that also needed to have this framework, but it’s not obvious whether you need this step if you didn’t somehow get granted something like the–<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal: </strong>That you could do the distillation step somehow.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Yeah. It’s unclear what else would– so another example of a thing that could fit in, and this maybe makes it seem more general, is if you had an agent that was just incentivized to make lots of money. Then you could just have your distillation step be like, ‘I randomly check the work of this person, and compensate them based on the work I checked’. That’s a suggestion of how this framework could end up being more general.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I mostly do think about it in the context of learning in particular. I think it’s relatively likely to change if you’re not in that setting. Well, I don’t know. I don’t have a strong view. I’m mostly just working in that setting, mostly because it seems reasonably likely, seems reasonably likely to have a bunch in common, learning is reasonably likely to appear even if other techniques appear. That is, learning is likely to play a part in powerful AI even if other techniques also play a part.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal: </strong>Are there other people or resources that you think would be good for us to look at if we were looking at the optimism view?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>Before we get to resources or people, I think one of the basic questions is, there’s this perspective which is fairly common in ML, which is like, ‘We’re kind of just going to do a bunch of stuff, and it’ll probably work out’. That’s probably the basic thing to be getting at. How right is that?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the bad view of safety conditioned on– I feel like prosaic AI is in some sense the worst– seems like about as bad as things would have gotten in terms of alignment. Where, I don’t know, you try a bunch of shit, just a ton of stuff, a ton of trial and error seems pretty bad. Anyway, this is a random aside maybe more related to the previous point. But yeah, this is just with alignment. There’s this view in ML that’s relatively common that’s like, we’ll try a bunch of stuff to get the AI to do what we want, it’ll probably work out. Some problems will come up. We’ll probably solve them. I think that’s probably the most important thing in the optimism vs pessimism side.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don’t know, I mean this has been a project that like, it’s a hard project. I think the current state of affairs is like, the MIRI folk have strong intuitions about things being hard. Essentially no one in… very few people in ML agree with those, or even understand where they’re coming from. And even people in the EA community who have tried a bunch to understand where they’re coming from mostly don’t. Mostly people either end up understanding one side or the other and don’t really feel like they’re able to connect everything. So it’s an intimidating project in that sense. I think the MIRI people are the main proponents of the everything is doomed, the people to talk to on that side. And then in some sense there’s a lot of people on the other side who you can talk to, and the question is just, who can articulate the view most clearly? Or who has most engaged with the MIRI view such that they can speak to it?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronny Fernandez: </strong>Those are people I would be particularly interested in. If there are people that understand all the MIRI arguments but still have broadly the perspective you’re describing, like some problems will come up, probably we’ll fix them.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>I don’t know good– I don’t have good examples of people for you. I think most people just find the MIRI view kind of incomprehensible, or like, it’s a really complicated thing, even if the MIRI view makes sense in its face. I don’t think people have gotten enough into the weeds. It really rests a lot right now on this fairly complicated cluster of intuitions. I guess on the object level, I think I’ve just engaged a lot more with the MIRI view than most people who are– who mostly take the ‘everything will be okay’ perspective. So happy to talk on the object level, and speaking more to arguments. I think it’s a hard thing to get into, but it’s going to be even harder to find other people in ML who have engaged with the view that much.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They might be able to make other general criticisms of like, here’s why I haven’t really… like it doesn’t seem like a promising kind of view to think about. I think you could find more people who have engaged at that level. I don’t know who I would recommend exactly, but I could think about it. Probably a big question will be who is excited to talk to you about it.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal: </strong>I am curious about your response to MIRI’s object level arguments. Is there a place that exists somewhere?<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>There’s some back and forth on the internet. I don’t know if it’s great. There’s some LessWrong posts. Eliezer for example wrote <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S7csET9CgBtpi7sCh/challenges-to-christiano-s-capability-amplification-proposal\">this post</a> about why things were doomed, why I in particular was doomed. I don’t know if you read that post.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asya Bergal: </strong>I can also ask you about it now, I just don’t want to take too much of your time if it’s a huge body of things.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Christiano: </strong>The basic argument would be like, 1) On paper I don’t think we yet have a good reason to feel doomy. And I think there’s some basic research intuition about how much a problem– suppose you poke at a problem a few times, and you’re like ‘Agh, seems hard to make progress’. How much do you infer that the problem’s really hard? And I’m like, not much. As a person who’s poked at a bunch of problems, let me tell you, that often doesn’t work and then you solve in like 10 years of effort.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s one thing. That’s a point where I have relatively little sympathy for the MIRI way. That’s one set of arguments: is there a good way to get traction on this problem? Are there clever algorithms? I’m like, I don’t know, I don’t feel like the kind of evidence we’ve seen is the kind of evidence that should be persuasive. As some evidence in that direction, I’d be like, I have not been thinking about this that long. I feel like there have often been things that felt like, or that MIRI would have defended as like, here’s a hard obstruction. Then you think about it and you’re actually like, ‘Here are some things you can do.’ And it may still be a obstruction, but it’s no longer quite so obvious where it is, and there were avenues of attack.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s one thing. The second thing is like, a metaphor that makes me feel good– MIRI talks a lot about the evolution analogy. If I imagine the evolution problem– so if I’m a person, and I’m breeding some animals, I’m breeding some superintelligence. Suppose I wanted to breed an animal modestly smarter than humans that is really docile and friendly. I’m like, I don’t know man, that seems like it might work. That’s where I’m at. I think they are… it’s been a little bit hard to track down this disagreement, and I think this is maybe in a fresher, rawer state than the other stuff, where we haven’t had enough back and forth.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’m like, it doesn’t sound necessarily that hard. I just don’t know. I think their position, their position when they’ve written something has been a little bit more like, ‘But you couldn’t breed a thing, that after undergoing radical changes in intelligence or situation would remain friendly’. But then I’m normally like, but it’s not clear why that’s needed? I would really just like to create something slightly superhuman, and it’s going to work with me to breed something that’s slightly smarter still that is friendly.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t really been able to get traction on that. I think they have an intuition that maybe there’s some kind of invariance and things become gradually more unraveled as you go on. Whereas I have more intuition that it’s plausible. After this generation, there’s just smarter and smarter people thinking about how to keep everything on the rails. It’s very hard to know.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the second thing. I have found that really… that feels like it gets to the heart of some intuitions that are very different, and I don’t understand what’s up there. There’s a third category which is like, on the object level, there’s a lot of directions that I’m enthusiastic about where they’re like, ‘That seems obviously doomed’. So you could divide those up into the two problems. There’s the family of problems that are more like the inner alignment problem, and then outer alignment stuff.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the inner alignment stuff, I haven’t thought that much about it, but examples of things that I’m optimistic about that they’re super pessimistic about are like, stuff that looks more like verification, or maybe stepping back even for that, there’s this basic paradigm of adversarial training, where I’m like, it seems close to working. And you could imagine it being like, it’s just a research problem to fill in the gaps. Whereas they’re like, that’s so not the kind of thing that would work. I don’t really know where we’re at with that. I do see there are formal obstructions to adversarial training in particular working. I’m like, I see why this is not yet a solution. For example, you can have this case where there’s a predicate that the model checks, and it’s easy to check but hard to construct examples. And then in your adversarial training you can’t ever feed an example where it’ll fail. So we get into like, is it plausible that you can handle that problem with either 1) Doing something more like verification, where you say, you ask them not to perform well on real inputs but on pseudo inputs. Or like, you ask the attacker just to show how it’s conceivable that the model could do a bad thing in some sense.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s one possible approach, where the other would be something more like interpretability, where you say like, ‘Here’s what the model is doing. In addition to it’s behavior we get this other signal that the paper was depending on this fact, its predicate paths, which it shouldn’t have been dependent on.’ The question is, can either of those yield good behavior? I’m like, I don’t know, man. It seems plausible. And they’re like ‘Definitely not.’ And I’m like, ‘Why definitely not?’ And they’re like ‘Well, that’s not getting at the real essence of the problem.’ And I’m like ‘Okay, great, but how did you substantiate this notion of the real essence of the problem? Where is that coming from? Is that coming from a whole bunch of other solutions that look plausible that failed?’ And their take is kind of like, yes, and I’m like, ‘But none of those– there weren’t actually even any candidate solutions there really that failed yet. You’ve got maybe one thing, or like, you showed there exists a problem in some minimal sense.’ This comes back to the first of the three things I listed. But it’s a little bit different in that I think you can just stare at particular things and they’ll be like, ‘Here’s how that particular thing is going to fail.’ And I’m like ‘I don’t know, it seems plausible.’<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s on inner alignment. And there’s maybe some on outer alignment. I feel like they’ve given a lot of ground in the last four years on how doomy things seem on outer alignment. I think they still have some– if we’re talking about amplification, I think the position would still be, ‘Man, why would that agent be aligned? It doesn’t at all seem like it would be aligned.’ That has also been a little bit surprisingly tricky to make progress on. I think it’s similar, where I’m like, yeah, I grant the existence of some problem or some thing which needs to be established, but I don’t grant– I think their position would be like, this hasn’t made progress or just like, pushed around the core difficulty. I’m like, I don’t grant the conception of the core difficulty in which this has just pushed around the core difficulty. I think that… substantially in that kind of thing, being like, here’s an approach that seems plausible, we don’t have a clear obstruction but I think that it is doomed for these deep reasons. I have maybe a higher bar for what kind of support the deep reasons need.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also just think on the merits, they have not really engaged with– and this is partly my responsibility for not having articulated the arguments in a clear enough way– although I think they have not engaged with even the clearest articulation as of two years ago of what the hope was. But that’s probably on me for not having an even clearer articulation than that, and also definitely not up to them to engage with anything. To the extent it’s a moving target, not up to them to engage with the most recent version. Where, most recent version– the proposal doesn’t really change that much, or like, the case for optimism has changed a little bit. But it’s mostly just like, the state of argument concerning it, rather than the version of the scheme.</p>",

We&apos;re planning to distribute $1,000, where $500 of that will go to the first place. </p><p>To submit some exercises, leave a comment here linking to your exercises by midnight at the end of Friday 20th September PDT (San Francisco time). You can PM one of us with it if you want to, but we&apos;ll be publishing all the entries that win a prize.</p><h2>Why exercises?</h2><p>I want to talk about why exercises are valuable, but my thinking is so downstream of reading the book Thinking Physics, that I&apos;d rather just let its author (Lewis Carroll Epstein) speak instead. (All formatting is original.)</p><blockquote>The best way to use this book is NOT to simply read it or study it, but to read a question and STOP. Even close the book. Even put it away and THINK about the question. Only after you have formed a reasoned opinion should you read the solution. Why torture yourself thinking? Why jog? Why do push-ups?</blockquote><blockquote>If you are given a hammer with which to drive nails at the age of three you may think to yourself, &quot;OK, nice.&quot; But if you are given a hard rock with which to drive nails at the age of three, and at the age of four you are given a hammer, you think to yourself, &quot;What a marvellous invention!&quot; You see, you can&apos;t really appreciate the solution until you first appreciate the problem.</blockquote><blockquote>What are the problem of physics? How to calculate things? Yes - but much more. The most important problem in physics is <em>perception</em>, how to conjure mental images, how to separate the non-essentials from the essentials and get to the hear of a problem, HOW TO ASK YOURSELF QUESTION. Very often these questions have little to do with calculations and have simple yes or no answers: Does a heavy object dropped at the same time and from the same height as a light object strike the earth first? Does the observed speed of a moving object depend on the observer&apos;s speed? Does a particle exist or not? Does a fringe pattern exist or not? These qualitative questions are the most vital questions in physics.</blockquote><blockquote>You must guard against letting the quantitative superstructure of physics obscure its qualitative foundation. It has been said by more than one wise old physicist that you  really understand a problem when you can intuitively guess the answer <em>before</em> you do the calculation. How can you do that? By developing your physical intuition. How can you do THAT? The same way you develop your physical body - by exercising it.</blockquote><blockquote>Let this book, then, be your guide to mental pushups. Think carefully about the questions and their answers <em>before </em>you read the answers offered by the author. <strong>You will find many answers don&apos;t turn out as you first expect. Does this mean you have no sense for physics? Not at all. Most questions were deliberately chosen to illustrate those aspects of physics which seem contrary to casual surmise. Revising ideas, even in the privacy of your own mind, is not painless work. </strong>But in doing so you will revisit some of the problems that haunted the minds of Archimedes, Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein. The physic you cover here in hours took them centuries to master. Your hours of thinking will be a rewarding experience.

I could&apos;ve trivially taken those examples out from the start, included all the theory, and then asked the reader to apply the theory to those three as exercises, before explaining my answers.

(It&apos;s fine to require people to read a curated LW sequence.)</p><p>I asked Oli for his thought on what makes a good exercise, and he said this:</p><blockquote>I think a good target is university problem sets, in particular for technical degrees. I&apos;ve found that almost all of my learning in university came from grappling with the problem sets, and think that I would want many more problem sets I can work through in my study of both rationality and AI Alignment. I also had non-technical classes with excellent essay prompts that didn&apos;t have as clear &quot;correct&quot; answers, but that nevertheless helped me deeply understand one topic or another. Both technical problem sets and good essay prompts are valid submissions for this prize, though providing at least suggested solutions is generally encouraged (probably best posted behind spoiler tags).</blockquote><p>(What are spoiler tags?

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This post is part of research I did at OpenAI with mentoring and guidance from Paul Christiano. It also represents my current agenda regarding what I believe looks like the most promising approach for addressing <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">inner alignment</a>.</em></p>\n<p>One particularly concerning failure mode for any sort of advanced AI system is for it to have good performance on the training distribution, but nevertheless still have some input on which it behaves highly “unacceptably” during deployment. For the purposes of this post, we will <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d\">follow Paul Christiano</a> in thinking about acceptability as some concept that satisfies the following two conditions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“As long as the model <em>always</em> behaves acceptably, and achieves a high reward on <em>average</em>, we can be happy.”</li>\n<li>“Requiring a model to always behave acceptably wouldn't make a hard problem too much harder.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, acceptability is a different condition than asking for good performance during deployment—an honest mistake is considered acceptable, as is just failing to do anything interesting at all. That being said, some of the sorts of things you might want from acceptability could include <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">corrigibility</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks\">non-deception</a>, or myopia.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-1\" id=\"fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-1\">[1]</a></sup> The hope for this style of approach is that it is competitive to only apply advanced machine learning to those situations which have clear notions of acceptability.</p>\n<p>The tension, however, rests in being able to achieve good performance while maintaining an acceptability guarantee. Thus, the ideal solution to this problem would be a way of converting a training procedure which can achieve arbitrary performance into a training procedure which is not much harder to run, and which can still achieve arbitrary performance, but which also enforces an acceptability guarantee.</p>\n<p>One obvious way to attempt to maintain an acceptability guarantee is to construct a loss function which incentivizes acceptability as part of performance. Something of this form is almost certainly going to be a component of any safe system. That being said, there are some reasons why approaches of this form might be insufficient if used in isolation.</p>\n<p>First, one important thing to note about folding acceptability into performance is that the resulting acceptability guarantee is fairly weak: you get an average-case acceptability guarantee that holds only in the case of no distributional shift, with no guarantee when your deployment distribution is different than your training distribution.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-2\" id=\"fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Second, there are reasons to believe that the objective of a model doing some sort of internal planning/search might be systematically different than its loss function. Thus, even if the loss function incentivizes acceptability, the training process's inductive biases might be such that the model ends up not actually optimizing for an acceptable objective. This is the problem “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>” refers to as inner alignment,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-3\" id=\"fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-3\">[3]</a></sup> though other frameworks have also been proposed for understanding this sort of phenomenon. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03030\">Ortega et al. recently presented in a DeepMind Technical Report</a>, for example, an analysis of this problem from the perspective of treating it as spontaneous meta-learning, noting that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Meta-learning can also occur spontaneously in online regression when the capacity of the agent is bounded and the data is produced by a single generator. Unfortunately, the downside is that we cannot easily control what will be metalearned. In particular, spontaneous meta-learning could lead to undesirable emergent properties, which is considered an open research problem in AI safety <a href=\"https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/building-safe-artificial-intelligence-52f5f75058f1\">[Ortega et al., 2018]</a>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The key problem that arises in this sort of situation is that it raises the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2mhFMgtAjFJesaSYR/2-d-robustness\">capability generalization without objective generalization</a>. That is, for a model doing some sort of search/meta-learning, it might be that its search algorithm generalizes well off-distribution such that it continues being able to take competent, well-optimized actions, but that the objective its search is directed towards fails to generalize such that those actions are now optimized for the wrong objective.</p>\n<p>Finally, there are reasons that we might want to consider the possibility of near-AGI models learning to deceive their training processes. The full argument for why this might be the case is given in the section on deceptive alignment in “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>,” but the basic concern is that a model could learn about the true reward via its input and thus start appearing aligned for the purpose of sticking around in the training process before gradient descent has the chance to modify it to actually optimize for the true reward internally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>If incentivizing acceptability as part of performance is insufficient, as it seems it might be, then a better solution for enforcing acceptability guarantees is required. <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d\">One framework Paul has proposed</a> is to attempt to make use of adversarial training, wherein you could train an adversary to find inputs on which the model behaves unacceptability and then penalize it accordingly. The goal of this post is to explore this avenue as thoroughly as possible.</p>\n<p>One initial roadblock with this approach, however, is that there might exist some inputs on which the model behaves unacceptably which are difficult to instantiate during training—future situations that cannot be predicted in complete detail, for example.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-4\" id=\"fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-4\">[4]</a></sup> <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d\">Paul's proposed solution</a> to this problem is to <em>relax</em> the adversary's job. Rather than asking the adversary to instantiate a concrete input on which the model behaves unacceptably, we can instead just ask the adversary to produce some sort of description of such a situation, which we will call a pseudo-input. Paul proposes the following two conditions as the major desiderata for any pseudo-input-based approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“It's still ‘easy enough' for the agent to never behave unacceptably for any pseudo-input.”</li>\n<li>“It's easy for the adversary to find a pseudo-input on which the agent behaves unacceptably, if any exist.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Under Paul's framework, the structure of pseudo-inputs has to be constrained so that “an input that contains X” is a valid pseudo-input but “a distribution over inputs that would cause the agent to want to kill everyone” is not. That way, the model's task of steering clear of having any pseudo-inputs on which it behaves badly is actually potentially soluble.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Formalizing relaxed adversarial training</h2>\n<p>We'll start by formalizing Paul's approach to relaxed adversarial training so we can use it as a starting point.

This is especially difficult if the model is actively looking for differences between the training and deployment distributions, as would happen in the next hard case.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional defection.</strong> Suppose you have a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks/deceptive-alignment\">deceptive</a> model—that is, one which is trying to appear aligned during training, but actually wants to do something else during deployment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-14\" id=\"fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-14\">[14]</a></sup> Then, it's going to be searching for ways to tell whether it's in training or not such that it might be quite difficult for an adversary to actually find any inputs on which it's unacceptable. <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d\">Paul provides the example</a> that one possible check the model could perform might be to look for a factorization of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-2048\">RSA-2048</a> in its input. RSA-2048 is a large semiprime number that was featured as part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge\">RSA Factoring Challenge</a>. Though no factorization of RSA-2048 is currently known, it is likely that at some point someone will publish such a factorization. Thus, by only behaving unacceptably when it sees a factorization of RSA-2048, a deceptive model can all but guarantee that adversarial training will never be able to produce an input on which it behaves unacceptably—since that would require factoring the number—but that will still be fairly likely to eventually occur during deployment.</p>\n<p>The RSA-2048 example generalizes to a large family of cases wherein a deceptive model is conditioning its unacceptable behavior on some predicate <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\alpha\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">α</span></span></span></span></span></span> such that it is easier to check whether <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\alpha(x)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">α</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> holds for some <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"x\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span></span></span></span> than it is to generate an <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"x\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span></span></span></span> for which <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\alpha(x)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">α</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> holds.

If the model's notion of which inputs are most important to defect on matches up with those inputs where defection is likely to be most problematic, then that could be another way for the situation to be worse than the above guarantee even in the iid case.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-15\" id=\"fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-15\">[15]</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Meta-learning.</strong> “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>” suggests that the case where inner alignment is most concerning is the case involving a model that is itself implementing some sort of search or learning process. Primarily, we have been assuming that the problem with this situation is the objective by which this search is being performed, and that if that objective can be aligned with the loss function, then we are satisfied. However, this is not in general the case, as even if a model's objective is aligned, its search process might not be. Conceptually, we can think of this problem as the problem of “forwarding” the safety guarantee we have about the training process to the meta-learning process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fM5ZWGDbnjb7ThNKJ/are-minimal-circuits-deceptive\">My counterexample to the safety of minimal circuits</a> is a theoretical example of what a failure of this form might look like. Alternatively, as a more concrete example, consider a model which has learned to do some form of meta-learning such that it is implementing its own expected risk minimization procedure. In this case, even if we have a strong guarantee that our model isn't going to be deceiving us, we might not have the same guarantee about whatever policy results from the model's meta-learning. Furthermore, performing search in a particular way could be a form of defection: a deceptive model could choose to perform a policy search that is more likely to produce models aligned with it than it is to produce models aligned with the actual loss function.</p>\n<p><strong>Suboptimality alignment.</strong> One concerning form of misalignment discussed in “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>” is that of suboptimality alignment, wherein the model appears aligned on the training distribution due to some sort of defect or reasoning failure. For example, it might be that a model is currently non-deceptive, but if given more time to think about the best strategy for it to implement, or more information about its current situation, it would become deceptive. This is a particularly concerning case because it implies that not only must the overseer verify that there is no unacceptable behavior currently happening in the model, it must also verify that there will continue to be no unacceptable behavior regardless of the possible situations that the model could find itself in during deployment. Furthermore, if the environment contains adversaries (other AI systems, for example) that can specifically identify those situations in which the model will behave deceptively, this sort of failure mode could be quite difficult to avoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Acceptability modeling.</strong> Another interesting hard case is that of a model which is itself implementing some unacceptability predicate <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"C^-\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.045em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;\">C</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0.153em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">−</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to guide its behavior.

Alternatively, if no such transparency method exists, then the above approach—at least as presented here—seems to have little chance of working. Thus, we can frame the work presented here as a way of elucidating exactly what sorts of transparency techniques are likely to be necessary to solve the overall alignment problem. In particular, we would like to be able to reduce the burden on transparency by figuring out what the easiest possible transparency techniques are that would fully solve the problem.</p>\n<p>One possible starting point for tackling this question of what sorts of transparency techniques are likely to be necessary is Paul's notion of <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/towards-formalizing-universality-409ab893a456\">ascription universality</a>.

If this conjecture is true, it should be possible to coherently separate such a model into pieces representing the different components of its optimization process such as its world model, optimization procedure, and objective.</p>\n<p>Inspection, training, and architectural transparency methods could be combined to achieve such a separation. First, architectural transparency could be used to structure the model to have pieces corresponding to the different components of its optimization process—e.g. a separate world model piece and optimization procedure piece. Second, inspection transparency could be used to verify that the whole world model was just in the world model piece and not in other parts of the model as well—and similarly for the other components such as the model's objective. Finally, training transparency could be used to incentivize the model to be as transparent according to the inspection transparency process as possible.</p>\n<p>If such a scheme was able to work, then <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{Amp}(M)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">Amp</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> might be able to directly verify that <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s objective was aligned, while for the world model and optimization procedure only having to verify that they are in fact value-neutral. Such value-neutrality verification could then, for example, be done via an impact measure such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09725\">Attainable Utility Preservation</a> or <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186\">Relative Reachability</a> both of which are forms of measuring the degree to which an action advantages one set of values over others.</p>\n<p><strong>Pure world model transparency.</strong> Alternatively, suppose we don't accept the conjecture that you need to implement a coherent optimization process to be competitive. In this world, we have another option available to us: rather than having to ensure we get a transparent objective, we can just train a model that has no objective—that is, we can try to train a purely predictive model with only a world model but no optimization procedure or objective.</p>\n<p>To do this, we could use architectural transparency to structure the model to be composed of only a world model portion trained in a purely generative setting and use inspection transparency to verify that it is in fact only a world model and hasn't learned any sort of optimization procedure instead. We could also again use training transparency to incentivize the model to be as transparent to the inspection process as possible.</p>\n<p>In this situation, the training and amplification procedures become somewhat more complicated, as we still want to be able to extract actions out of something that is just a world model.

If ensemble consensus is required to produce an output, then as long as there is some <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M_\\text{good}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.081em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.219em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">good</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> in the ensemble, its outputs should always be guaranteed to be acceptable. Thus, ensembling can reduce the burden on us having to produce precisely <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M_\\text{good}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.081em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.219em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">good</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> in exchange for the cost of spending additional compute training additional <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span></span></span></span>. Importantly, however, this only works if the different <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span></span></span></span> are sufficiently distinct that the probability of any one of them being good is relatively independent from the probability of the others being good, which might be a difficult condition to satisfy in practice. Furthermore, ensembling is less a solution in and of itself and more of a strategy we can use to improve upon other acceptability guarantees, as we still need to actually have some argument for why we will be likely enough to find <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M_\\text{good}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.081em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.219em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">good</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> in the first place that ensembling can get us the rest of the way there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Though this post goes most in-depth into the particular proposal of relaxed adversarial training, it is my hope that many of the ideas that have been discussed here will be broadly useful for advancing our understanding of different possible approaches to solving inner alignment in general. In particular, I believe that one of the best ways in which we can get traction now on how to solve hard AGI alignment problems such as the ones discussed here is to analyze concrete schemes and hard cases so that we can get an idea now of what sorts of problems we're likely to encounter in the future on the road to AGI.</p>\n<p>To that end, I believe that one of the most important takeaways we can draw from the analysis presented here, regardless of what sort of approach we actually end up using, is the central importance of transparency. Without being able to look inside our model to a significant degree, it is likely going to be very difficult to get any sort of meaningful acceptability guarantees. Even if we are only shooting for an iid guarantee, rather than a worst-case guarantee, we are still going to need some way of looking inside our model to verify that it doesn't fall into any of the other hard cases. One of the ways in which this sort of work can be most helpful, therefore, is in providing research directions for transparency: what is it that we actually need to get out of transparency to be able to produce a good acceptability guarantee?</p>\n<p>This work suggests, for example, that one of the critical condition that we need is for our transparency scheme to be good enough such that there actually exists some model that can demonstrate to an overseer that it is acceptable. Thus, we need to answer the question of what would be sufficient to convince us (or at least an amplified version of us) that a model is acceptable. One possible first step towards something of this form might be working on world model extraction as described previously, though significant future work—likely involving major advances regarding our understanding of interpretable world models—still seems necessary to make anything of that form go through.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>For a further treatment of the question of what a good acceptability guarantee might look like, see “<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr/towards-a-mechanistic-understanding-of-corrigibility\">Towards a mechanistic understanding of corrigibility</a>.” <a href=\"#fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See the “Hard cases” section for an analysis of ways in which a guarantee of this form might be insufficient and/or difficult to obtain. <a href=\"#fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Note that there are still a lot of unresolved open questions regarding inner alignment. “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>” attempts to address many of these questions from a theoretical perspective, though additional <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uSdPa9nrSgmXCtdKN/concrete-experiments-in-inner-alignment\">experimental evidence</a> would also be useful to further pin down this problem. <a href=\"#fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See the “Conditional defection” hard case for more examples of inputs that might lead to unacceptable behavior which might be very difficult to instantiate during training. <a href=\"#fnref-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-repyZkoicHKbnCBcs-5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This could be pure supervised amplification, debate, or anything in-between.

I&#x27;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me by replying to this email.</p><p>Audio version <u><a href=\"http://alignment-newsletter.libsyn.com/alignment-newsletter-63\">here</a></u> (may not be up yet).</p><h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10985\">AI-GAs: AI-generating algorithms, an alternate paradigm for producing general artificial intelligence</a></u> <em>(Jeff Clune)</em> (summarized by Yuxi Liu and Rohin): Historically, the <u><a href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\">bitter lesson</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/efed27be268a/alignment-newsletter-49\">AN #49</a></u>) has been that approaches that leverage increasing computation for learning outperform ones that build in a lot of knowledge. The current ethos towards AGI seems to be that we will come up with a bunch of building blocks (e.g. convolutions, transformers, trust regions, GANs, active learning, curricula) that we will somehow manually combine into one complex powerful AI system. Rather than require this manual approach, we could instead apply learning once more, giving the paradigm of AI-generating algorithms, or AI-GA.</p><p>AI-GA has three pillars. The first is to <strong>learn architectures</strong>: this is analogous to a superpowered neural architecture search that can discover convolutions, recurrence and attention without any hardcoding. The second is to <strong>learn the learning algorithms</strong>, i.e. meta-learning. The third and most underexplored pillar is to learn to <strong>generate complex and diverse environments</strong> within which to train our agents. This is a natural extension of meta-learning: with meta-learning, you have to specify the distribution of tasks the agent should perform well on; AI-GA simply says to learn this distribution as well. <u><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01753\">POET</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/8c3f02cabccd/alignment-newsletter-41\">AN #41</a></u>) is an example of recent work in this area.</p><p>A strong reason for optimism about the AI-GA paradigm is that it mimics the way that humans arose: natural selection was a very simple algorithm that with a <em>lot</em> of compute and a very complex and diverse environment was able to produce a general intelligence: us. Since it would need fewer building blocks (since it aims to learn everything), it could succeed faster than the manual approach, at least if the required amount of compute is not too high. It is also much more neglected than the &quot;manual&quot; approach.</p><p>However, there are safety concerns. Any powerful AI that comes from an AI-GA will be harder to understand, since it&#x27;s produced by this vast computation where everything is learned, and so it would be hard to get an AI that is aligned with our values. In addition, with such a process it seems more likely that a powerful AI system &quot;catches us by surprise&quot; -- at some point the stars align and the giant computation makes one good random choice and suddenly it outputs a very powerful and sample efficient learning algorithm (aka an AGI, at least by some definitions). There is also the ethical concern that since we&#x27;d end up mimicking evolution, we might accidentally instantiate large amounts of simulated beings that can suffer (especially if the environment is competitive, as was the case with evolution).</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> Especially given the <u><a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/\">growth of compute</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/3e550712419a/alignment-newsletter-7\">AN #7</a></u>), this agenda seems like a natural one to pursue to get AGI. Unfortunately, it also mirrors very closely the phenomenon of <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">mesa optimization</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care\">AN #58</a></u>), with the only difference being that it is <em>intended</em> that the method produces a powerful inner optimizer. As the paper acknowledges, this introduces several risks, and so it calls for deep engagement with AI safety researchers (but sadly it does not propose ideas on how to mitigate the risks).</p><p>Due to the vast data requirements, most of the environments would have to be simulated. I suspect that this will make the agenda harder than it may seem at first glance -- I think that the complexity of the real world was quite crucial, and that simulating environments that reach the appropriate level of complexity will be a very difficult task. (My intuition is that something like <u><a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/neural-mmo/\">Neural MMO</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/3091c6e9405c/alignment-newsletter-48\">AN #48</a></u>) is nowhere near enough complexity.)</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Problems</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/brXr7PJ2W4Na2EW2q/the-commitment-races-problem\">The &quot;Commitment Races&quot; problem</a></u> <em>(Daniel Kokotajlo)</em> (summarized by Rohin): When two agents are in a competitive game, it is often to each agent&#x27;s advantage to quickly make a credible commitment before the other can. For example, in Chicken (both players drive a car straight towards the other and the first to swerve out of the way loses), an agent could rip out their steering wheel, thus credibly committing to driving straight. The first agent to do so would likely win the game. Thus, agents have an incentive to make commitments as quickly as possible, before their competitors can make commitments themselves. This trades off against the incentive to think carefully about commitments, and may result in arbitrarily bad outcomes.</p><h3><strong>Iterated amplification</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr/towards-a-mechanistic-understanding-of-corrigibility\">Towards a mechanistic understanding of corrigibility</a></u> <em>(Evan Hubinger)</em> (summarized by Rohin): One general approach to align AI is to train <em>and verify</em> that an AI system performs acceptably on all inputs. However, we can&#x27;t do this by simply trying out all inputs, and so for verification we need to have an acceptability criterion that is a function of the &quot;structure&quot; of the computation, as opposed to just input-output behavior. This post investigates what this might look like if the acceptability criterion is some flavor of corrigibility, for an AI trained via amplification.</p><h3><strong>Agent foundations</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hpAbfXtqYC2BrpeiC/troll-bridge-5\">Troll Bridge</a></u> <em>(Abram Demski)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This is a particularly clean exposition of the Troll Bridge problem in decision theory. In this problem, an agent is determining whether to cross a bridge guarded by a troll who will blow up the agent if its reasoning is inconsistent. It turns out that an agent with consistent reasoning can prove that if it crosses, it will be detected as inconsistent and blown up, and so it decides not to cross. This is rather strange reasoning about counterfactuals -- we&#x27;d expect perhaps that the agent is uncertain about whether its reasoning is consistent or not.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/rvxcSc6wdcCfaX6GZ/two-senses-of-optimizer\">Two senses of “optimizer”</a></u> <em>(Joar Skalse)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The first sense of &quot;optimizer&quot; is an optimization algorithm, that given some formally specified problem computes the solution to that problem, e.g. a SAT solver or linear program solver. The second sense is an algorithm that acts upon its environment to change it. Joar believes that people often conflate the two in AI safety.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I agree that this is an important distinction to keep in mind. It seems to me that the distinction is whether the optimizer has knowledge about the environment: in canonical examples of the first kind of optimizer, it does not. If we somehow encoded the dynamics of the world as a SAT formula and asked a super-powerful SAT solver to solve for the actions that accomplish some goal, it would look like the second kind of optimizer.</p><h3><strong>Adversarial examples</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/testing-robustness/\">Testing Robustness Against Unforeseen Adversaries</a></u> <em>(Daniel Kang et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): This paper demonstrates that adversarially training on just one type or family of adversarial distortions fails to provide general robustness against different kinds of possible distortions. In particular, they show that adversarial training against L-p norm ball distortions transfer reasonably well to other L-p norm ball attacks, but provides little value, and can in fact reduce robustness, when evaluated on other families of attacks, such as adversarially-chosen Gabor noise, &quot;snow&quot; noise, or JPEG compression. In addition to proposing these new perturbation types beyond the typical L-p norm ball, the paper also provides a &quot;calibration table&quot; with epsilon sizes they judge to be comparable between attack types, by evaluating them according to how much they reduce accuracy on either a defended or undefended model. (Because attacks are so different in approach, a given numerical value of epsilon won&#x27;t correspond to the same &quot;strength&quot; of attack across methods)</p><p><strong>Cody&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I didn&#x27;t personally find this paper hugely surprising, given the past pattern of whack-a-mole between attack and defense suggesting that defenses tend to be limited in their scope, and don&#x27;t confer general robustness. That said, I appreciate how centrally the authors lay this lack of transfer as a problem, and the effort they put in to generating new attack types and calibrating them so they can be meaningfully compared to existing L-p norm ball ones.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I see this paper as calling for adversarial examples researchers to stop focusing just on the L-p norm ball, in line with <u><a href=\"https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/response-1/\">one of the responses</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/4a1b3c4249ae/an-62are-adversarial-examples-caused-by-real-but-imperceptible-features\">AN #62</a></u>) to the last newsletter&#x27;s highlight, <u><a href=\"http://gradientscience.org/adv/\">Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/4a1b3c4249ae/an-62are-adversarial-examples-caused-by-real-but-imperceptible-features\">AN #62</a></u>).</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08016\">Testing Robustness Against Unforeseen Adversaries</a></u></p><h3><strong>Robustness</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~balaji/udl2019/accepted-papers/UDL2019-paper-21.pdf\">An Empirical Evaluation on Robustness and Uncertainty of Regularization Methods</a></u> <em>(Sanghyuk Chun et al)</em> (summarized by Dan H): There are several small tricks to improve classification performance such as label smoothing, dropout-like regularization, mixup, and so on.

For example, in <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060\">Functional Decision Theory</a></u>, we&#x27;d like to know how &quot;similar&quot; two algorithms are (which can influence whether or not we think we have &quot;logical control&quot; over them). This post argues that defining such distance functions is hard, because they rely on human concepts that are not easily formalizable, and the intuitive mathematical formalizations usually have some flaw.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I certainly agree that <em>defining</em> &quot;conceptual&quot; distance functions is hard. It has similar problems to saying &quot;write down a utility function that captures human values&quot; -- it&#x27;s possible in theory but in practice we&#x27;re not going to think of all the edge cases. However, it seems possible to learn distance functions rather than defining them; this is already done in perception and state estimation.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2019/05/23/on-consciousness-qualia-and-meaning-with-mike-johnson-and-andres-g\">AI Alignment Podcast: On Consciousness, Qualia, and Meaning</a></u> <em>(Lucas Perry, Mike Johnson and Andrés Gómez Emilsson)</em></p><h1><strong>AI strategy and policy</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/PKy8NuNPknenkDY74/soft-takeoff-can-still-lead-to-decisive-strategic-advantage\">Soft takeoff can still lead to decisive strategic advantage</a></u> <em>(Daniel Kokotajlo)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Since there will be an improved version of this post soon, I will summarize it then.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2019/08/30/fli-podcast-beyond-the-arms-race-narrative-ai-china-with-helen-toner-elsa-kania/\">FLI Podcast: Beyond the Arms Race Narrative: AI &amp; China</a></u> <em>(Ariel Conn, Helen Toner and Elsa Kania)</em></p><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11274\">Reducing malicious use of synthetic media research: Considerations and potential release practices for machine learning</a></u> <em>(Aviv Ovadya et al)</em></p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02553\">Are Deep Policy Gradient Algorithms Truly Policy Gradient Algorithms? </a></u><em>(Andrew Ilyas et al)</em> (summarized by Cody) (H/T Lawrence Chan): This paper investigates whether and to what extent the stated conceptual justifications for common Policy Gradient algorithms are actually the things driving their success. The paper has two primary strains of empirical investigation.</p><p>In the first, they examine a few of the more rigorously theorized aspects of policy gradient methods: learned value functions as baselines for advantage calculations, surrogate rewards, and enforcement of a &quot;trust region&quot; where the KL divergence between old and updated policy is bounded in some way. For value functions and surrogate rewards, the authors find that both of these approximations are weak and perform poorly relative to the true value function and reward landscape respectively.</p><p>Basically, it turns out that we lose a lot by approximating in this context. When it comes to enforcing a trust region, they show that TRPO is able to enforce a bound on mean KL, but that it&#x27;s much looser than the (more theoretically justified) bound on max KL that would be ideal but is hard to calculate. PPO is even stranger: they find that it enforces a mean KL bound, but only when optimizations present in the canonical implementation, but not the core definition of the algorithm, are present. These optimizations include: a custom weight initialization scheme, learning rate annealing on Adam, and reward values that are normalized according to a rolling sum. All of these optimizations contribute to non-trivial increases in performance over the base algorithm, in addition to apparently being central to how PPO maintains its trust region.</p><p><strong>Cody&#x27;s opinion:</strong> This paper seems like one that will make RL researchers usefully uncomfortable, by pointing out that the complexity of our implementations means that just having a theoretical story of your algorithm&#x27;s performance and empirical validation of that heightened performance isn&#x27;t actually enough to confirm that the theory is actually the thing driving the performance. I do think the authors were a bit overly critical at points: I don&#x27;t think anyone working in RL would have expected that the learned value function was perfect, or that gradient updates were un-noisy. But, it&#x27;s a good reminder that saying things like &quot;value functions as a baseline decrease variance&quot; should be grounded in an empirical examination of how good they are at it, rather than just a theoretical argument that they should.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/06/10/pearl/\">Learning to Learn with Probabilistic Task Embeddings</a></u> <em>(Kate Rakelly, Aurick Zhou et al)</em> (summarized by Cody): This paper proposes a solution to off-policy meta reinforcement learning, an appealing problem because on-policy RL is so sample-intensive, and meta-RL is even worse because it needs to solve a distribution over RL problems. The authors&#x27; approach divides the problem into two subproblems: infer an embedding, z, of the current task given context, and learning an optimal policy q function conditioned on that task embedding. At the beginning of each task, z is sampled from the (Gaussian) prior, and as the agent gains more samples of that particular task, it updates its posterior over z, which can be thought of as refining its guess as to which task it&#x27;s been dropped into this time. The trick here is that this subdividing of the problem allows it to be done mostly off-policy, because you only need to use on-policy learning for the task inference component (predicting z given current task transitions), and can learn the Actor-Critic model conditioned on z with off-policy data. The method works by alternating between these two learning modes.</p><p><strong>Cody&#x27;s opinion:</strong> I enjoyed this; it&#x27;s a well-written paper that uses a few core interesting ideas (posterior sampling over a task distribution, representation of a task distribution as a distribution of embedding vectors passed in to condition Q functions), and builds them up to make a method that achieves some impressive empirical results.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08254\">Efficient Off-Policy Meta-RL via Probabilistic Context Variables</a></u></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Most free-to-play games, especially mobile free-to-play games, use similar models to extract revenue and keep players coming back. These models work by creating toxic trade-offs that are central to their functioning. This post highlights the main three, and will act as reference for future gaming posts. Note that some games that can be played for free, such as the excellent <a href=\"https://www.pathofexile.com/game\">Path of Exile</a>, mostly do not do these things and are not fundamentally ‘free-to-play’ games, rather they are games that are free. But they are the exception, the extreme end of a continuum from ‘so friendly we just give you this great experience in the hopes you’ll want to throw us money’ to ‘<a href=\"https://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s18e06-freemium-isnt-free\">made a pact with the Canadian devil</a>.’</p>\n<p>For an analysis of Magic: The Gathering Arena in particular, <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/02/10/eternal-and-hearthstone-economy-versus-magic-economy/\">this remains the central point of my analysis</a>, centered on what I here call the third trade-off. Arena counts as free-to-play in bad ways, but is on the less toxic end of the spectrum, especially with regard to the second trade-off, which I am seeing over time as more central. However, while Arena remains relatively friendly, it is moving <em>towards </em>being more toxic, with things like the second wildcard for historic card creation and with the mastery track.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Three Trade-offs</h3>\n<p>The first key trade-off is to make games less fun in order to cause you to pay them huge amounts of money to make them less not fun, aiming at extracting extremely large payments from a few whales as the primary revenue stream. This prevents them from giving you the version of their game that would be the most fun, even if you are paying a lot of money, because they still want you to pay more. If you are not paying any money, and aren’t going to bring in new players, they almost want to drive you away.</p>\n<p>The second key trade-off is between success in the game and your life, focus and time. The games use timers and delays to force you to constantly pay attention to the game if you want to accomplish the maximum. Not doing so lets valuable resources sit idle, whether they are free resources or paid for resources. Thus, the back of your mind becomes infected by the need to constantly check and perform tasks, and there is a sense of panic that you are delaying starting something because that delays it finishing which delays starting the next thing, and so on. This is not healthy. The game is telling you when and how to play, rather than you deciding, and it’s preventing focus and relaxation and other good things in life. Such games have the power to make your life worse rather than better, and often will do so.</p>\n<p>The third key trade-off is that they give players tons of different resources and currencies and items that they need to gather, make many of them rare and hard to get, require those elements in order to advance or to advance efficiently, and they do not allow trade in these items in any reasonable way. If you get bottle-necked in one of them, you can be very screwed, and often players will get into this spot because they did not realize what resources need to be conserved, or because some are simply made super hard to get.</p>\n<h3>Better and Worse</h3>\n<p>There are more and less toxic versions of all this. Better versions give you optimization problems to solve but do not put you under felt pressure to change your other patterns of behavior. Worse versions put you in race situations and force a steady stream of clicks at specified intervals to not fall behind. Ideally, the game is presenting an interesting optimization problem, but not one that tempts you to make crazy out-of-game sacrifices.</p>\n<p>This system of forced delays makes sense in light of selling speed-ups and other ways to get around the restrictions. What started happening a few years ago was that regular games that charged money up front started incorporating these elements as well. So in addition to the endless grind tasks that many games used to prolong length, one was forced to leave on one’s gaming counsels and not play them, in order to make progress in otherwise fun games like Bravely Default or Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p>\n<p>Before this round of trying free-to-play games, I was focused on the first problem and not as worried about the second problem, with the third problem as a hard problem that needs to be handled responsibly by some games, and solved via robust markets for other games such as digital collectible card games. Now that I have had the chance to play with a game designer’s perspective, to think about what the game is doing to its players and their brains, I am now more worried about the second problem than the first problem.</p>\n<p>The first problem leads to games that force a bunch of grinding and don’t offer as many fun opportunities, and which a few players will spend far too much money on. That’s bad, but it’s not <em>that </em>bad.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the third problem locks your players out of being able to find the components they need to do the things they want to do, locking them out of much or most of the variety your game has to offer. This is bad, but it’s bad in the <em>players not having fun </em>sense and the <em>players putting in money they will never see again </em>sense, rather than the <em>players ruining their lives </em>sense.</p>\n<p>The second problem leads to ruined focus, days and lives, as people are unable to get the game out of their heads, despite nothing really being at stake. I flirted with this a little bit in order to better understand how it works. It’s more pernicious than it seems, and after stopping (or scaling back to where one does not care about being much less efficient) one feels a great relief. So I now consider this to be the thing most important to avoid, and to speak up against.</p>\n<p>Delays, steady streams of income, time and resource optimization problems and other similar mechanics can lead to interesting games and game play. Many of the real life problems I most enjoy thinking about are similar optimization problems at heart. If a game uses the flow of time and resources, and the efficiency trade-offs of gathering them in different ways, to generate interesting problems, <em>and the good ways to do things are fun and not life disruptive, </em>that can lead to some great experiences. If they are not fun, and/or they are too disruptive, what results can be far more toxic than one might think.</p>\n<p>Both of these dynamics point to additional reasons to essentially never put money into free-to-play games unless they are selling permanent changes.</p>\n<p>If there are features, stories, regions or other elements that are fully payment locked, then that is like a non-free game that one should be free to pay for. Alternatively, if the game has a ‘maximum spend’ that allows you to fully unlock its components that are relevant to multiplayer competition, and this enables playing the game without its resource optimization elements, and you’re willing to pay that price to exclude those elements entirely, and your eyes are fully open on all of that, then that is a reasonable thing to do.</p>\n<p>However, if the game is true free-to-play with payment options, then you are dealing with an optimization problem of how to make the most of your resources, where the game is constantly trying to exhaust them via log scaling of costs to get you to keep paying.</p>\n<p>Thus, paying them money <em>likely makes the game worse rather than better. </em></p>\n<p>Suddenly, your optimization problem provides a few more resources, but does that make the problem more interesting, or only highlight the dollar values of what is involved in destructive ways? Likely the latter. And they have all the same reasons to quickly run you out of resources again and put you in the same place, except now your free options will clearly be not interesting.</p>\n<p>Having a game constantly available on one’s phone also adds all the standard temptations and distractions of other potential phone activities that offer steady streams of small reward. Phone games are doubly more toxic than non-phone games, because they are both available on your phone, and because they tend to embrace toxic implementations in order to succeed in the cutthroat mobile market where one must prioritize lifetime customer revenue in order to make mobile advertising of the game profitable, which is what allows one to scale.</p>\n<p>Thus, when encountering free-to-play games that are built around some combination of a whale-based revenue model, time-counter mechanics and a wide array of collectible but not easily purchasable or salable in-game assets, one should be reluctant to play even for free, but even more reluctant to pay money.</p>\n<p>In particular, <em>the more often they require you to ping them, and the more they punish you for not pinging them when they want you to, </em>the more scared of them you should be, and this consideration should be more central to your threat level assessment than you think.</p>\n<p> </p>",

As a bit of background, Carlos Perez <a href=\"https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/the-illusion-of-the-ungameable-objective-538a96a53efe\">points out</a> Josha Bach&#x27;s &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/plinz/status/985249543582355458\">Lebowski theorem</a>,&quot; which states that &quot;no superintelligent AI is going to bother with a task that is harder than hacking its reward function.&quot; Given that, I see a potential perverse effect of some types of alignment research - especially research into embedded agency and robust alignment which makes AI uninterested in reward tampering. (Epistemic Status: my confidence in the argument is moderate, and I am more confident in the earlier claims.)</p><p>In general, unsafe AI is far more likely to tamper with its reward function than to find more distant (and arguably more problematic) ways to tamper with the world to maximize its objective. (epistemic status: fairly high confidence) Once an AI is smart enough to spend its time reward hacking, then wasting time on developing greater intelligence is unneeded. For that reason, this theorem seems likely  to function as at least a mild safety valve. It&#x27;s only if we close this valve too tightly that we would plausibly see ML that reached human-level intelligence. At that point, of course, we should expect that the AI will begin to munchkin the system, just as a moderately clever human would. And anti-munchkin-ing is a narrow instance of security more generally.</p><p>Security generally is like cryptography narrowly in an importance sense; it&#x27;s easy to build a system that you yourself can&#x27;t break, but very challenging to build one that others cannot exploit. (Epistemic status: more speculative) This means that even if our best efforts go towards safety, an AI seems very unlikely to need more than &quot;mild&quot; superintelligence to break it - unless it&#x27;s been so well aligned that it doesn&#x27;t want to hack its objective function.</p><p>This logic implies (Epistemic status: most speculative, still with some confidence) that moderate progress in AI safety is potentially far more dangerous than very little progress - and raises critical questions of how close to this unsafe uncanny valley we currently are, and how wide the valley is.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Most people here probably already understand this by now, so this is more to prevent new people from getting confused about the point of Counterfactual Oracles (in the ML setting) because there's not a top-level post that explains it clearly at a conceptual level. Paul Christiano does have a blog post titled <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/counterfactual-oversight-vs-training-data-a7a1d247801\">Counterfactual oversight vs. training data</a>, which talks about the same thing as this post except that he uses the term \"counterfactual oversight\", which is just Counterfactual Oracles applied to human imitation (which he proposes to use to \"oversee\" some larger AI system). But the fact he doesn't mention \"Counterfactual Oracle\" makes it hard for people to find that post or see the connection between it and Counterfactual Oracles. And as long as I'm writing a new top level post, I might as well try to explain it with my own words. The second part of this post lists some remaining problems with oracles/predictors that are not solved by Counterfactual Oracles.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, I think when the Counterfactual Oracle is translated into the ML setting, it has three essential characteristics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Supervised training</strong> - This is safer than reinforcement learning because we don't have to worry about reward hacking (i.e., reward gaming and reward tampering), and it eliminates the problem of self-confirming predictions (which can be seen as a form of reward hacking). In other words, if the only thing that ever sees the Oracle's output during a training episode is an automated system that computes the Oracle's reward/loss, and that system is secure because it's just computing a simple distance metric (comparing the Oracle's output to the training label), then reward hacking and self-confirming predictions can't happen. (ETA: See <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/25288usP5B5ytnzA4/random-thoughts-on-predict-o-matic/comment/wbxt59enMcCNsP8Pt\">this comment</a> for how I've changed my mind about this.)\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Independent labeling of data</strong> - This is usually taken for granted in supervised learning but perhaps should be explicitly emphasized here. To prevent self-confirming predictions, the labeling of data has to be done without causal influence from the Oracle. That is, the Oracle's output should be isolated in some protected system until it's time to compute the reward/loss so that it can't affect how the training label is generated. But note that it's perfectly fine for humans or other systems to look at the <em>question/input</em> that is given to the Oracle, in order generate the training label.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Online learning</strong> - The Oracle never stops learning, so it can eventually adjust to any distributional shift. (But note that an Oracle implemented using current ML techniques might perform very badly, possibly in a malign way, while it's still adjusting.)</li>\n<li><strong>Random selection of training episodes</strong> - I'll just quote Paul here: \"Counterfactual oversight consists of labelling a random subset of data and using it as online training data. The key difference is that any given data point may become a training data point, with the decision made after the learning system has made a decision about it. As long as the randomization is unpredictable to the learner, this gives us a formal guarantee that there can’t be any noticeable difference between the training and test data. And therefore if our learner behaves well on training data, it really must behave well on test data.\" (Note that what Stuart Armstrong calls \"erasure\" just means that the current episode has been selected as a training episode.)</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Remaining Safety Problems</h1>\n<p>Counterfactual Oracles solve (or are a proposal to solve) some safety problems associated with predictors/oracles, but others remain. Besides the distributional shift problem mentioned above, here are a few more that come to mind. Note that these are not problems specific to Counterfactual Oracles, but Stuart Armstrong's <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05541.pdf\">Safe Uses of AI Oracles</a> seems wrong or misleading when it says \"This paper presented two Oracle designs which are both safe and useful.\"</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037534c/some-problems-with-making-induction-benign-and-approaches-to-them#Does_a_bound_on_computational_requirements_help_\">Benign Induction</a> - This is a concern that the Oracle might come to believe (perhaps correctly in some sense) that we probably live in a simulation or Zoo Earth, and that at some specific point the alien simulation runners or zoo keepers will intervene in the simulation or zoo to change the training signal for the Oracle, causing the Oracle (on both fake and real Earths) to output something that for example causes our world to be taken over by the aliens.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/cSzaxcmeYW6z7cgtc/contest-usd1-000-for-good-questions-to-ask-to-an-oracle-ai/comment/9AC8PjcA2mnbvTyS5\">Reward Takeover</a> <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/cSzaxcmeYW6z7cgtc/contest-usd1-000-for-good-questions-to-ask-to-an-oracle-ai/comment/LerH5iZbafJeh2Cs7\">on Real Earth</a> - The Oracle may predict a future in which its training data / reward signal comes under the control of a hostile agent that will arise or already exists on the real Earth (e.g., an unaligned AI or an unfriendly government) which causes it to output something that benefits that hostile agent at the expense of its current user.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/S7csET9CgBtpi7sCh/challenges-to-christiano-s-capability-amplification-proposal\">Safe</a> <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/whRPLBZNQm3JD5Zv8/imitation-learning-considered-unsafe\">Approximation</a> - If the Oracle is not able to exactly predict something, could its attempt at approximation cause safety problems? For example if we use it to predict human behavior, could the approximate prediction be unsafe because it ends up predicting a human-like agent with non-human values?</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J/the-inner-alignment-problem\">Inner alignment</a> - The ML training process may not produce a model that actually optimizes for what we intend for it to optimize for (namely minimizing loss for just the current episode, conditional on the current episode being selected as a training episode).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(I just made up the names for #2 and #3 so please feel free to suggest improvements for them.)</p>\n</body></html>",

If we allow humans to self-modify arbitrarily or create strange other beings (such as AIs themselves, or merged human-AIs), then our empathy and predictions will start to fail<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Ffz24L2HbNMXFLNYu-1\" id=\"fnref-Ffz24L2HbNMXFLNYu-1\">[1]</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>It needs <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"E\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.026em;\">E</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"P\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;\">P</span></span></span></span></span></span> to be given; but defining these for AIs is very tricky. Time and time again, we've found that tasks <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox\">that are easy for humans to do are not easy for humans to program into AIs</a>.</li>\n<li>The empathy and prediction modules are similar, but not identical, from person to person and culture to culture<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Ffz24L2HbNMXFLNYu-2\" id=\"fnref-Ffz24L2HbNMXFLNYu-2\">[2]</a></sup>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So both are correct: my result (without assumption, you <strong>cannot</strong> go from human behaviour to preferences) and the critique (given these assumptions that humans share, you <strong>can</strong> go from human behaviour to preferences).</p>\n<p>And when it comes to humans predicting humans, the critique is more valid: listening to your heart/gut is a good way to go. But when it comes to programming potentially powerful AIs that could completely transform the human world in strange and unpredictable ways, my negative result is more relevant than the critique is.</p>\n<h2>A note on assumptions</h2>\n<p>I've had some disagreements with people that boil down to me saying \"without assuming A, you cannot deduce B\", and them responding \"since A is obviously true, B is true\". I then go on to say that I am going to assume A (or define A to be true, or whatever).</p>\n<p>At that point, we don't actually have a disagreement. We're saying the same thing (accept A, and thus accept B), with a slight difference of emphasis - I'm more \"moral anti-realist\" (we choose to accept A, because it agrees with our intuition) they are more \"moral realist\" (A is true, because it agrees with our intuition). It's not particularly productive to dig more.</p>\n<h1>In practice: debugging and injecting moral preferences</h1>\n<p>There are some interesting practical consequences to this analysis. Suppose, for example, that someone is programming a clickbait detector. They then gather a whole collection of clickbait examples, train a neural net on them, and fiddle with the hyperparameters till the classification looks decent.</p>\n<p>But both \"gathering a whole collection of clickbait examples\", \"the classification looks decent\" are not facts about the universe: they are judgements of the programmers. The programmers are using their own <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"E\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.026em;\">E</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"P\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;\">P</span></span></span></span></span></span> modules to establish that certain articles are a) likely to be clicked on, but b) not what the clicker would really want to read. So the whole process is entirely dependent on programmer judgement - it might feel like \"debugging\", or \"making reasonable modelling choices\", but its actually injecting the programmers' judgements into the system.</p>\n<p>And that's fine! We've seen that different people have similar judgements. But there are two caveats: first, not everyone will agree, because there is not perfect agreement between the empathy modules. The programmers should be careful as to whether this is an area of very divergent judgements or not.</p>\n<p>And second, these results will likely not generalise well to new distributions. That's because having <em>implicit</em> access to categorisation modules that themselves are valid only in typical situations... is not a way to generalise well. At all.</p>\n<p>Hence we should expect poor generalisation from such methods, to other situations and (sometimes) to other humans. In my opinion, <strong>if programmers are more aware of these issues, they will have better generalisation performance</strong>.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-Ffz24L2HbNMXFLNYu-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>I'd consider the Star Trek universe to be much more typical that, say, 7th century China.

    "htmlBody": "<h1>Overview</h1><p>Most existing forecasting or evaluation platform questions are for very clearly verifiable questions:</p><ul><li>&quot;Who will win the next election?&quot;</li><li>&quot;How many cars will Tesla sell in 2030?&quot;</li><li>“How many jelly beans are in this jar?”</li></ul><p>But many of the questions we care about are do not look like this. They might…</p><ul><li>Be severely underspecified, e.g. “How much should we charge this customer for this vague feature request?”</li><li>Involve value judgements, e.g. “What is the optimum prison sentence for this convict?”, “How much does this plaintiff deserve for pain and suffering?”</li><li>Not have a clear stopping point, e.g. &quot;What is the relative effectiveness of AI safety research vs. bio risk research?&quot;</li><li>Require multiple steps instead of a yes/no or numerical answer, e.g. “What treatment is appropriate for this patient with precancerous cells?”</li><li>Not have good referrents, e.g. “What is the market size for this completely new tech?”</li></ul><p>An entity who could answer these questions well would be a very valuable asset. But what does well even mean here? We want people to be accurate, of course, but in many cases we also need their predictions/evaluations to be <em>consistent</em> to be actionable. This is especially true when fairness norms are in play, such as pricing[1] and prison sentencing.</p><p>There is a lot of research showing that people make inconsistent evaluations (with each other and themselves across time) across a wide variety of fields, even those that more closely resemble the “easy” questions above (<a href=\"http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/12360371/analyzing-expert-judge-descriptive-study-stockbrokers-decision-processes\">valuing stocks,</a> appraising <a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/14635789610154271\">real estate,</a> <a href=\"http://users.nber.org/~kling/interjudge.pdf\">sentencing criminals,</a> <a href=\"http://amj.aom.org/content/17/3/440.abstract\">evaluating job performance,</a> <a href=\"http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeaosoci/v_3a13_3ay_3a1988_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a111-121.htm\">auditing financial statements</a>)[2]. It is even more difficult to consistently evaluate or predict novel questions or low-frequency events, like “Will India use a nuclear weapon on Pakistan by 1/1/20” or “How much counterfactual value has this organization created?”. </p><p>This paper is a shallow review of the literature around how to get entities to make consistent judgements. I want to note up front that a major limitation of this write-up and of shallow reviews in general is that I mostly relied on authors’ descriptions of their work and conclusions, rather than verifying their experimental design and conclusions for myself, or looking up others’ opinions of papers. As such, this post should be taken as a description of the state of the literature, not the state of the world.</p><p>Speaking of underspecified questions, “how to get consistent answers to complicated questions?” sure is one.  I started this research project with a vague sense of an area from Ozzie Gooen; as I iterated, we came up with more specific questions. The following is a list of questions or hooks that came up as we discussed the research:</p><ol><li>Overall, what literature is available to answer the question “how to get people to answer messy questions consistently?”</li><li>What are the costs of consistency?</li><li>How often are evaluations / sentences simply misunderstood by people? Is there a decent science behind understanding and expecting levels of misunderstandings in different cases?</li><li>How often are the evaluations doing the wrong things? What are the failure modes? For instance, one failure mode is that they have misjudged the value of some intermediate variables. Maybe that’s all there is?</li><li>In what domains are subjective measures likely to be informative, especially about things other than subjective states? (For instance, the subjective measure of “I think this work was done at a 8/10, is very different than, “I’m feeling an 8/10 now”, in that both of them require an intuitive judgement, but in one case the intuitive judgement **is** the measure.</li><li>What are the main problems that come up for nonprofit evaluations? Have they found any methods that would be useful to us?</li><li>How difficult is/can it be to come up with these composite indexes/linear models? What should we know when attempting them?</li><li>Can we have any clever models where evaluators are really just predicting what other evaluators would say?</li><li>What are good areas for follow-ups?</li></ol><p>Some of these questions were answered in more detail than others, some were not answerable at all in the time available. Here is what I found.</p><h1>Methods to Improve Consistency in Evaluations</h1><ul><li>Hold <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest\">Keynesian beauty contests</a></u>, in which the goal is to guess what other people will guess, not what you think is true. </li><ul><li>A <u><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Harris25/publication/261961537_The_beauty_contest_revisited_Measuring_consensus_rankings_of_relevance_using_a_game/links/57e718d308aedcd5d1aaa28f.pdf\">single study</a></u> suggested this improves recall and precision.</li><li>“What do other people think?” is also a well known trick for getting people to be honest about opinions over which they expect to receive censure.</li></ul><li>Use groups instead of individuals <u><a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/AJIM-10-2015-0165/full/html\">(Zhitomirsky-Geffet, Bar-Ilan, and Mark Levene)</a></u></li><ul><li>Configuring groups such that each group has the same variety of expertise allows you to use some non-common knowledge in your estimates (personal guess).</li><li>For procedures with many iterations (e.g., image labeling), combine multiple predictors with a mathematical model that incorporates varying skill, expertise, and task difficulty level (<u><a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4074-the-multidimensional-wisdom-of-crowds.pdf\">Welinder <em>et al</em></a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.6386.pdf\">Bachrach <em>et al</em></a></u>)</li></ul><li>Remove extraneous information. Individuals’ estimates are widely affected by extraneous information even when they themselves view it as extraneous (<u><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1290214\">Grimstad and Jørgensen</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-306-47630-3_5\">Stewart</a></u>). In the real world this may be a lengthy process of determining what information is extraneous.</li><li>Force participants to write up models of their thinking (using variables for unknowns), and then evaluate the variables separately (<u><a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/a-structured-approach-to-strategic-decisions/\">Kahneman, Lovallo, and Sibony</a></u>).</li><ul><li>Kahneman suggests 5-6 variables, and absolutely no more than 8 (<u><a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/nobel-winner-daniel-kahnemans-strategy-firm-can-think-smarter\">Knowledge@Wharton</a></u>).</li><li>To preserve independence, have individuals write up their models before sharing with the group and coming to consensus.</li><li>See “Creating Composite Models” below.</li></ul><li>Let participants know you’ll be asking about their reasoning afterwords (<u><a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/a-structured-approach-to-strategic-decisions/\">Kahneman, Lovallo, and Sibony</a></u>).</li><li>Create reference guides that forecasters can refer to while making an estimate (e.g. “this is what Level 4 teaching looks like, this is what Level 5 teaching looks like). Better, after they’ve made their estimate show them the nearest reference and ask how they compare (<u><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S107529350000012X\">Penny, Johnson, and Gordon</a></u>). </li><ul><li>In the case of novel questions, I speculate that it would be useful to make an imaginary reference chart (“this is what a country that’s 20% likely to launch a nuclear missile in the next year would look like…”) .</li></ul><li>Some evaluations can be broken down into sub-evaluations, in which people tend to agree on the first step but disagree on the second. E.g., they’ll agree on the ordering of the severity of personal injury cases, but translate the severity into wildly different dollar amounts (<u><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/797417?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">Sunstein, Kahneman, and Schkade</a></u>). Or doctors will agree on the severity of a case but not the patient’s future outcome (<u><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194387\">Dwyer <em>et al</em></a></u>).</li><li>Training and retraining. With e.g. educational assessment, this means giving people reference evaluations and then practicing on a second set of evaluations until they get the right result (<u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability\">Wikipedia</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(16)30378-7/fulltext\">Polin <em>et al</em></a></u>). Even after this was done, evaluators benefited from periodic retraining (<u><a href=\"https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(16)30378-7/fulltext\">Polin <em>et al</em></a></u>).</li><ul><li>Edit 9/16: One particular thing to train is probabilistic thinking (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ESpw8p5kJy9zo4nNC/shallow-review-of-consistency-in-statement-evaluation#QYHE6C2E9iJyXk3E5\">found by Ruby in <em>Uncertain Judgements</em></a>).</li></ul></ul><h1>Creating Composite Models</h1><p>One idea that came up repeatedly in business literature was forcing predictors to build (potentially very crude) mathematical models. </p><p>Kahneman recommends the following procedure, which he calls creating a “reasoned rule” (summary from <u><a href=\"https://jasoncollins.blog/2018/05/09/noise/\">Jason Collins</a></u>):</p><ol><li>Select six to eight variables that are distinct and obviously related to the predicted outcome. Assets and revenues (weighted positively) and liabilities (weighted negatively) would surely be included, along with a few other features of loan applications.</li><li>Take the data from your set of cases (all the loan applications from the past year) and compute the mean and standard deviation of each variable in that set.</li><li>For every case in the set, compute a “standard score” for each variable: the difference between the value in the case and the mean of the whole set, divided by the standard deviation. With standard scores, all variables are expressed on the same scale and can be compared and averaged.</li><li>Compute a “summary score” for each case―the average of its variables’ standard scores. This is the output of the reasoned rule. The same formula will be used for new cases, using the mean and standard deviation of the original set and updating periodically.</li><li>Order the cases in the set from high to low summary scores, and determine the appropriate actions for different ranges of scores. With loan applications, for instance, the actions might be “the top 10% of applicants will receive a discount” and “the bottom 30% will be turned down.”</li></ol><p>Richard H. Moss recommends a similar procedure in his <u><a href=\"http://climate-action.engin.umich.edu/CLIMATE_530_Uncertainty_Stationarity_Readings/Moss_Schneider_Consistent_Reporting_Uncertainty_IPCC_2000.pdf\">paper</a></u> on estimating climate change:</p><ol><li>For each of the major findings you expect to be developed in your chapter, identify the most important factors and uncertainties that are likely to affect the conclusions. Also specify which important factors/variables are being treated exogenously or fixed, as it will almost always be the case that some important components will be treated in this way when addressing the complex phenomena examined in the TAR. </li><li>Document ranges and distributions in the literature, including sources of information on the key causes of uncertainty. Note that it is important to consider the types of evidence available to support a finding (e.g., distinguish findings that are well established through observations and tested theory from those that are not so established). </li><li>Given the nature of the uncertainties and state of science, make an initial determination of the appropriate level of precision—is the state of science such that only qualitative estimates are possible, or is quantification possible, and if so, to how many significant digits? As the assessment proceeds, recalibrate level of precision in response to your assessment of new information. </li><li>Quantitatively or qualitatively characterize the distribution of values that a parameter, variable, or outcome may take. First identify the end points of the range that the writing team establishes, and/or any high consequence, low probability outcomes or “outliers.” Particular care needs to be taken to specify what portion of the range is included in the estimate (e.g., this is a 90% confidence interval) and what the range is based on. Then provide an assessment of the general shape (e.g., uniform, bell, bimodal, skewed, symmetric) of the distribution. Finally, provide your assessment of the central tendency of the distribution (if appropriate). </li><li>Using the terms described below, rate and describe the state of scientific information on which the conclusions and/or estimates (i.e. from step 4) are based. </li><li>Prepare a “traceable account” of how the estimates were constructed that describes the writing team’s reasons for adopting a particular probability distribution, including important lines of evidence used, standards of evidence applied, approaches to combining/reconciling multiple lines of evidence, explicit explanations of methods for aggregation, and critical uncertainties. </li><li>OPTIONAL: Use formal probabilistic frameworks for assessing expert judgment (i.e. decision analytic techniques), as appropriate for each writing team. </li></ol><h1>Costs of Consistency</h1><p>It is trivial to get 100% consistency: just have everyone guess 0 every time. If you’re feeling fancy they could guess base rate. Obviously this would be pointless because you would learn nothing</p><p>If two individuals are to come up with the same answer to a problem, they can only use information both of them have. This should on average damage the accuracy of the work (if it doesn’t, you have more problems). This can be okay in certain circumstances; the penal system sometimes values predictability over getting exactly the right answer, customers get irate if quoted widely varying prices. But often it is not okay, and false precision is harmful.</p><h1>Measures of Noise in Answers</h1><p>There’s a robust field of inter-rater reliability statistics, of which <u><a href=\"http://www.agreestat.com/book4/\">The Handbook of Inter-Rater Reliability</a></u> appears to be the best single source. Due to time constraints and the density of the subject I did not follow up on this further.</p><h1>Measures of Ambiguity in Questions</h1><p>I found no data on ambiguity in predictions or statement evaluation. The richest source of related data was on ambiguity in product requirement specifications. There are several systems for measuring ambiguity in natural language, the most prominent of which is <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLITA\">LOLITA</a></u>. Other systems include:</p><ul><li><u><a href=\"https://apps.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA441307\">QuARs</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/610237\">Unnamed</a></u> SATC tool at NASA</li></ul><p>I found no data on the cost ambiguous requirements exact, or how much of this cost could be avoided with NLP systems. These systems had major types of ambiguity they could not detect and were not a substitute for human evaluation.</p><h1>Subjective Judgements</h1><p>I found very mixed results on whether subjective judgements could replace objective composite measurements, and no obvious trends in which areas were robust to subjective predictions: <u><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1995.tb01772.x\">negative</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/104225879001500106\">positive</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/104225870102600103\">negative</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2004.tb02485.x\">positive</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/975862.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">negative</a></u>.</p><p>Papers tended to assume the objective measurements were more accurate, without considering how they could be tampered with. E.g.,in <u><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/975862.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">this study</a></u> of the Denver police, crime rates were not found to be heavily correlated with resident satisfaction. The paper seemed to think this was a deficit in the residents’ understanding, as opposed to the police department <u><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-crimestats-lapd-20140810-story.html#page=1\">interfering with crime statistics</a></u>. So perhaps one area where subjective measurements are preferable is where nominally objective measurements are controlled by the institution being measured.</p><h1>Limitations of This Paper and Future Work</h1><ul><li>Due to time constraints, I had to take papers’ word for their findings. I did not have time to look for replicability or statistical errors, and could only do quick checks of methodology. A future deep dive in any subject covered should include a more skeptical reading of my sources.</li><li>Most work done on inter-rater reliability is in fields like medicine, teacher evaluations, and image labeling. These involve estimating fairly known things with lots of reference instances. This is a fundamentally different kind of problem than predicting novel, low-probability events- among other differences, it’s harder to generate reference charts and training data.</li><li>There are many, many on inter-rater reliability in narrow fields. Sometimes they contain suggestions for mitigations; usually they do not. Additionally, an overwhelming majority of these studies are on cancer-diagnosis-type problems, not low-frequency-global-event-type problems. I read a few of these and got some value out of them (mostly mitigation techniques, such as asking why someone believed something), but hit diminishing returns after a few papers.

Is it better that they go in or not?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When confronted with something like that, I might reason thusly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well, it's certainly not part of the True Cross, even if that existed. However, it is an important medieval artefact with probably a lot of history (I know that because it was in the most important cathedral in France). I value things like that quite highly, and don't want them to be destroyed*. On the other hand, beware status quo bias**: I don't particularly miss historical items that were destroyed in the past*; but this artefact would be appreciated by probably millions in the future, and that matters to me*. Lots of religious people, French people, and people with a respect for history would not want it destroyed, and I value their satisfaction to some extent*. A <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"10\\%\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">10</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> chance of ten deaths should be considered similar, in my estimation, to 1 death with certainty** (however, without the connotations of \"this person specifically must die\"**). Firefighters are professionals, who specifically accept to take risks in these kinds of situations, so they're not like \"innocent victims\" who I would give extra weight to*. They are likely pretty young, and I care about the amount of life they could lose*.</p>\n<p>So, would I pay one life for a very-but-not-fantastically valuable artefact that would be valued and enjoyed by millions? But those people would enjoy the cathedral and its art even without this particular relic. Estimating how much value such an artefact could create, compared with the value remaining in a human life (this is a relevant comparison for me**), I'd guess that it's not worth saving in this circumstance* (but I would change my mind if the risk of death were lower or the artefact more valuable/appreciated).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, this is very far from a single model with a single instinctive answer! Instead it's the combination of many different simple partial preferences; I've tried to indicate base level partial preference in that reasoning with a *, and partial meta-preferences with a **.</p>\n<p>So I don't think we should call this a partial preference. Instead, we should call it a collection of partial preferences, tied together by a reasoning process which itself is a partial meta-preference (in what it considers and what it ignores).</p>\n<p>Thus that hypothetical can elicit a lot of different partial preferences in its answer; but the answer itself should not be considered a partial preference, as it doesn't exist as a preference in a single model.</p>\n<h1>Simple partial preferences</h1>\n<p>In contrast, simple partial preferences would instead have taken the form of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's never worth sacrificing a human life to save a mere object with only sentimental value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Millions have worshipped this relic; one life or ten lives are a cheap price to pay for its survival.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In these cases, a single model is created in the brain, and a single comparison is made.</p>\n",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I&#x27;ve been recently been obsessing over the risks of <a href=\"http://www.andrewmbailey.com/dkl/How_Many_Lives.pdf\">quantum torment</a>, and in the course of my research downloaded this article: <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/TURFAA-3\">https://philpapers.org/rec/TURFAA-3</a></p><p>Here&#x27;s a quote: </p><p><em>&quot;4.3 Long-term inescapable suffering is possible<br/></em></p><p><em>If death is impossible, someone could be locked into a very bad situation where she can’t die, but also can’t become healthy again. It is unlikely that such an improbable state of mind will exist for too long a period, like millennia, as when the probability of survival becomes very small, strange survival scenarios will dominate (called “low measure marginalization” by (Almond 2010). One such scenario might be aliens arriving with a cure for the illness, but more likely, the suffering person will find herself in a simulation or resurrected by superintelligence in our world, perhaps following the use of cryonics.</em></p><p><em><br/>Aranyosi summarized the problem: “David Lewis’s point that there is a terrifying corollary to the argument, namely, that we should expect to live forever in a crippled, more and more damaged state, that barely sustains life. This is the prospect of eternal quantum torment” (Aranyosi 2012; Lewis 2004). The idea of outcomes infinitely worse than death for the whole of humanity was explored by Daniel (2017), who called them “s-risks”. If MI is true and there is no high-tech escape on the horizon, everyone will experience his own personal hell.</em></p><p><em><br/>Aranyosi suggested a comforting corollary (Aranyosi 2012), based on the idea that multiverse immortality requires not remaining in the “alive state”, but remaining in the conscious state, and thus damage to the brain should not be very high. It means, according to Aranyosi, that being in the nearest vicinity of death is less probable than being in just “the vicinity of the vicinity”: the difference is akin to the difference between constant agony and short-term health improvement. However, it is well known that very chronic states of health exist which don’t affect consciousness are possible, e.g. cancer, whole-body paralysis, depression, and lock-in syndrome. However, these bad outcomes become less probable for people living in the 21st century, as developments in medical technology increase the number of possible futures in which any disease can be cured, or where a person will be put in cryostasis, or wake up in the next level of a nested simulation. Aranyosi suggested several other reasons why eternal suffering is less probable:<br/></em></p><p><em>1) Early escape from a bad situation: “According to my line of thought, you should rather expect to always luckily avoid life-threatening events in infinitely many such crossing attempts, by not being hit (too hard) by a car to begin with. That is so because according to my argument the branching of the world, relevant from the subjective perspective, takes place earlier than it does according to Lewis. According to him, it takes place just before the moment of death, according to my reasoning it takes place just before the moment of losing consciousness”<br/>(Aranyosi 2012, p.255).</em></p><p><em><br/>2) Limits of suffering. “The more damage your brain suffers, the less you are able to suffer”<br/>(Aranyosi 2012, p.257).</em></p><p><em><br/>3) Inability to remember suffering. “Emergence from coma or the vegetative state is followed by amnesia is not an eternal life of suffering, but rather one extremely brief moment of possibly painful self-awareness – call it the ‘Momentary Life’ scenario.” (Aranyosi 2012, p.257).</em></p><p><em><br/>4.4 Bad infinities and bad circles<br/></em></p><p><em>Multiverse immortality may cause one to be locked into a very stable but improbable world – much like the scenario in the episode “White Christmas” of the TV series “Black Mirror (Watkins 2014),” in which a character is locked into a simulation of a room for a subjective 30 million years. Another bad option is a circular chain of observer-moments. Multiverse immortality does not require that the “next” moment will be in the actual future, especially in the timeless universe, where all moments are equally actual. Thus a “Groundhog Day” scenario becomes possible. The circle could be very short, like several seconds, in which a dying consciousness repeatedly returns to the same state as several seconds ago, and as it doesn’t have any future moments it resets to the last similar moment. Surely, this could happen only in a very narrow state of consciousness, where the internal clock and memory are damaged.&quot;</em></p><p>Look, I&#x27;m not at all knowledgeable in these matter (besides having read <em>Permutation City</em> and <em>The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover</em>). Based on what I&#x27;ve read online on the possibility of quantum immortality, I don&#x27;t think it is probable, and quantum torment less so. But there&#x27;s something about a published article giving serious consideration to us suffering eternally or going through &#x27;The Jaunt&#x27; from that Stephen King story which is creating a nice little panic attack (in addition to the already scary David Lewis article).</p><p>I plan to die and have no intention of signing up for cryonics. (EDIT: This meant die <em>naturally</em>. I have no desire to expedite the process, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not on board with the techno-immortalism popular around here.) All I want to know is, is this stuff just being pulled out of his butt? Like, an extremely unlikely hypothetical that nonetheless carries huge negative utility? I&#x27;d be okay with that, as I&#x27;m not a utilitarian. Or have these scenarios actually been considered plausible by AI theorists?</p><p>I&#x27;m also desperate to get in contact with someone who&#x27;s studied quantum mechanics and can answer questions of this nature. An actual physicist (especially a believer in MWI) would be great. I&#x27;d think an understanding of neuroscience would also be very important for analyzing the risks, but how many people have studied both fields? With some exceptions, the only ones I <em>do </em>see discussing it are philosophers.</p><p>I&#x27;m in a bad place right now; any help would go a long way.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This is the 5th post of 5 containing the transcript of a podcast hosted by Eric Weinstein interviewing Peter Thiel.</em></p><h1>Interview</h1><h2>Girard’s Mimetic Theories</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So let me return back to the line of inquiry. I mean, sorry, just enjoying so much hearing what you have to say. Some of it's new to me. The theories that might be portals into a different way of looking at the world.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>One of them that you brought into my, I've never heard of before was Girard's various theories. And I wonder if you might say, you've often credited success in business to how you understood and you applied Girard. I mean obviously he didn't have this kind of level of business success. So can you talk a little bit about your personal relationship to Rene Girard's theories as a portal into a different way of seeing the world?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well let's say a little bit about the theory. So it's, it was sort of this theory of human psychology as deeply mimetic where you sort of, you copy other people.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, so just for the folks at home mimetic as in mime rather than memetic is in meme.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes. Well they're probably closely related. But you imitate people but that's how you learn to speak as a child. You copy your parents language, that's how, but then you also imitate desire and then there are sort of all sorts of aspects of mimesis that can lead to sort of mass violence mass insanity. So it has, it's both what enables human culture to function, but it also is quite, quite dangerous.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And you know, when I came across this sort of constellation of ideas as an undergraduate at Stanford, you know, my biases were sort of libertarian, classic liberal, only individuals exist. Individuals are radically autonomous, can think for themselves. And so this was, it was sort of a powerful corrective to that intellectually. But then it also worked on an existential level where you sort of realize, wow, there are all these ways that I've been hyper mimetic, I've been hyper tracked, why am I at Stanford, why does this matter so much? Why, you know, why am I doing all the things I'm doing?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And that's, it's a prism through which one when looks at a lot of things that I found to be quite helpful over recent decades. I think the preference falsification you can think of in mimetic terms where, you know, everybody goes along with what everybody else thinks, and then you can get these sort of chaotic points where all of a sudden things can shift much faster than you would think possible because there are all these dynamics that are not, you know, not simply rational. It's not quite correct to model people as these sort of classical Adams or something like that, it's much more entangled.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>What would be a good way for a people listening at home to start to get into Girard's philosophy if they were interested?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well there are, you know, it's, there's sort of a number of different books that Girard wrote. I think the magisterial one is probably <em>Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World</em>. So it's this truth of mimesis and violence and the ways. So it's sort of part psychology, part anthropology, part history.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>All portal, I should point out because they're all hidden.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>It's, you know, it's a portal onto the past, and to human origins. It's our history, it's a portal onto the present, onto, you know, the interpersonal dynamics of psychology. It's a portal onto the future in terms of, you know, are we going to let these mimetic desires run amok and head towards apocalyptic violence where, you know, even the entire planet can no longer absorb the violence that we can unleash or are we going to learn from this and transcend this, in a way where we get to some very different place.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And so it has a sense that, you know, of both danger and hope for the future as well. So it's, it is sort of this, you know, panoramic theory on a lot of ways. Super powerful and just extraordinarily different from what one would normally hear. You know, there's sort of like almost a cult like element where you had these people who are followers of Girard. And was sort of a sense that, you know, we had figured out the truth about the world in a way that nobody else did and that was generative and very powerful.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, you know, it's always, there are parts of it that are unhealthy, but it was, you know, it has sort of an incredible dynamism. And then it just, you are aware that, you know, maybe things are so different from how they appear to be that, you know ... there may be a portal out there, there may be, you know,</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>What was shocking to me. I mean, the first time I heard about it, you invited me to a conference that you were keeping quiet and I was in the news and there was quite a lot of anger and furor that I had done something wrong. And you waited a few days to give a talk and you talked about scapegoating and the mechanism by which violence that might be visited upon the many is visited upon the one. And then you also started talking about the King as if he is sort of scapegoat in waiting, so that the King is not necessarily something that one would want to be.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And I found it absolutely fascinating because it turned so many ideas on their heads that I got angry at you. Why hadn't you told me this earlier when I'd been through three sleepless nights before I'd heard the theory. So I found it instantly applicable, particularly if you're the sort of person who's likely to get scapegoated by not taking refuge in the herd. Do you think it has more relevance to people who are struggling to break out as individuals because of the possibility of being picked off?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I think it has universal ... I think it is broadly true, and so it has some sort of universal relevance. I think the problems of violence and scapegoating are universal problems. It's probably the case that there are certain types of people who are more likely to become scapegoats, but it's not an absolute thing. So there's always, you could say there's an arbitrariness about scapegoating because the scapegoat is supposed to represent, to stand in for everybody. So the scapegoat has to be perceived as someone who's radically other, but then also has to somehow emerge from within the group. There are times when the scapegoat is the sort of outlier, extreme insider, extreme outsider, king/criminal or whatever personality.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>That's probably a dangerous sort of thing. It's like Abraham Lincoln, the incredible orator who also grows up in a log cabin, these extreme contrasts are often people who are at risk of this maybe more than others. And then at the same time, because these are mob-like dynamics, there is sort of a way in which it's not like anyone's really safe from the violence ever. No one's completely safe.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I think that's quite true.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But yes. There is a thought that one of the history ideas that Girard had that is that there's a dynamic to this process where scapegoating, it only works when people don't understand it. As you understand it better, it works less well or it has to get displaced into other dimensions. If you have a witch hunt, say, we need to find a witch to bring back peace to the community, that's a psychosocial understanding of what you're doing is actually counterproductive of the witch hunt itself. The witch hunt is supposed to be a theological epiphany that God's telling you who the witch is. If you think of it as some sort of psychosocial control mechanism, then it won't work any more.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>A metaphor that Girard uses is that the sacred is like phlogiston and violence is like oxygen, but it only works in a world where it's misunderstood. So if you understand scapegoating, you end up in a world where it works less and less well, and the kind of political and cultural institutions that are linked to it will tend to unravel. I think one of the ways in which this has happened a great deal in modernity is that we scapegoat the scapegoaters, go up one level of abstraction.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>That's interesting.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>That always, it makes it a little bit more complicated. If we go after the people who were the historical oppressors, the historical victimizers, that's often a super powerful way, and it's slightly too complicated. There was a Bill Clinton formulation of this, \"we must unite against those who seek to divide us\", which is on some level itself contradictory, but then it's a little bit too hard for people to fully disentangle.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>That's very funny.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>That's one way that I think it still works even though it's, again, when everyone sees these moves, when everyone understands them, it just doesn't work that well any more.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So it's like saying, \"Would you like me to prescribe you a placebo?\".</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah. That probably does not work very well.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>But then the other part of it that I find terrifying which is, but also interesting, is that implicit in this framework is that there is a minimal level of violence needed to accomplish an end, and that the scapegoating mechanism while entirely unjust has the virtue of being minimal in this, that horror is visited upon the individual.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes, yes. Or the theological terminology Girard would use would be that scapegoating is satanic and that archaic cultures were a little bit satanic but not very. They were sort of satanic in an innocent way because the violence was actually a way to limit violence, that violence is both the disease and a cure for the disease. We need violence to drive out violence. This is how our societies work. And then it's not quite clear how things will continue to work. You could always say that there is a sense in which - and this is super broad brush stroke-type argument - there's a way in which you can say that the Left is more focused on the unjustified nature of violence, and the Right is more focused on how a certain amount of violence is needed for society. There are ways in which they're both right, and then there are ways in which they're both deconstructing each other.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You could say a nation state contains violence in both senses of the word contain.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Oh that's good.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Because it contains it as it limits it, it channels it in certain ways, but then it's also part of its very being. You get into all these questions. When it's appropriate, when it's not. That's why I don't like violence. I think it's a very serious problem, but-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>You also recognize its instrumental nature.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>If you said, \"We're going to get rid of all violence tomorrow. It's going to stop-\"</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>You'd be talking about nothing.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Or I think-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>There's no way in which that can-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, that might require a tremendous amount of violence to enact or if we're going to have no more violence at all, maybe you'll have just total chaos and a lot of violence in that form. It's an interesting problem to... all these interesting descriptors, but then how to practically translate into action, very, very tricky.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Yeah. I think that one of the things on the Left that people don't get right, and I don't know whether you'll agree with me or not, is that I think we on the Left are somewhat divided between two camps. One camp is quite open about wanting to end oppression and the other camp is cryptic about wanting to reverse it. In other words, you've oppressed for long enough. It is your turn to be oppressed by us and we are actually envious of oppression. There is something of a civil war. I mean I would say this is the way in which the IDW's left wing or left flank is misunderstood, which is that almost none of the left wing members of the IDW are interested in oppressing anybody. So there's going to be no payback period that sounds like fun to us.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>One of the things I hadn't understood until it was said to me quite starkly, progress is messy and you got to break a few eggs to make an omelet. There is this just tolerance bordering on excitement about the opportunity to stick it to those who have stuck it to you, from your perspective, that this is an aspect of justice. Whereas the cessation of oppression is interesting to another part of that group.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The disturbing thing is that it's, of course, much less exciting and much less energizing. </p><h2>Motivating Stories and Science</h2><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I often think if you listen to a political speech, the applause lines are always the ones, \"We are going to go after the other side. We're going to go after the bad people. We're going to stop them.\" If you try to construct a political speech in which it was, \"We're going to unite people. We're going to get everybody onto this goal and there were no bad people.\" It's almost impossible to have a speech that has any energy at all.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Let me take issue with that slightly.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>As a political speech.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I understood exactly what you said. I don't think I'm going to mischaracterize it. I think that the problem is the reason I pour energy into trying to stop the political correctness and the rules about what can be said, mostly has to do with the fact that I'm incredibly excited, except I'm excited about something non-political. If what I'm excited about is pursuing technological progress, scientific progress, more people being able to form families, et cetera, that's where the excitement is. It's not coming from the politics. It's coming from what the politics facilitates. So I think that the problem with these speeches is: if you don't believe that there is something that we're keeping this space clean for, we might as well riot or something because at least that's exciting and that's got some energy behind it. Then it's my team versus your team.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I mean look, at some level anybody who's focused on technology as you are is a progressive in the sense of caring about what is actually progress. I think that the danger comes from when politics becomes your entertainment. You read very correctly, and I learned this from you, that when you look at a bunch of candidates debating on a crowded stage, look at where the energy is. The energy is something that is not, in my opinion, a good indicator - it's not a good approximate for the ultimate that I care about.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes. Look, I'd like it to be just the way you describe. I just-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>No, no, no. I understood what you-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>...want to report it often is not. Scientific, technological progress, in a way, the hope is it can lead towards a more cornucopian world in which there's less Malthusian struggle, less violence, and then at the very same time, an honest account of the history of these things is that a lot of it was used to develop more advanced weapons. It was in the pursuit of violence. One account of the tech stagnation, the scientific tech stagnation, is that the breakthrough thing was the atom bomb and then you built the rockets to deliver the bombs more quickly. By 1970 we had enough bombs and rockets to destroy the world 10 or 20 times over or whatever, and the whole thing made no more sense.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>If one of the big drivers of scientific and technological progress was actually just the military dimension, when that became absurd did the whole thing slow down to the space age? Not in 1972 when Apollo left the moon, but was the key moment 1975 when you had the Apollo Soyuz docking? If we're just going to be friends with the Russians, does it really make sense for people to be working 80 hours, 100 hours a week around the clock? And again, I don't think it's all that, but I think one of the challenges, that we should not understate how big it is in resetting science and technology in the 21st century is, how do we tell a story that motivates sacrifice, incredibly hard work, deferred gratification for the future, that's not intrinsically violent? It was combined with that in all these powerful ways.</p><h2>Fears of Progress</h2><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>A lot of people deny that there's a tech science stagnation going on, but then one of the other things one hears is, \"Well, maybe it's not progressing as fast, but do we really want it to progress as fast? Isn't it dangerous? We're just going to build the AI that's going to kill everybody or it'll be biological weapons or it's going to be runaway nanotechnology.\" I don't think we should dismiss those fears completely.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, the fear is that it's going to make these things cheap and easy. Whereas right now you still need a state to do a lot of this work. I mean, Elon Musk is one of the first private individuals with a space program.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>That's a version of it, but I think in general it's just that somehow you will lose control over the violence. You think you can control it. Maybe it's a large state. Maybe it's autonomous AI weapons, which in theory are controlled by state, but in practice, not quite. There's all these scenarios where the stuff can spiral out of control. I'm more scared of the one where nothing happens. I'm more scared of the stagnation world I feel ultimately goes straight to apocalypse. I'm much more scared of that, but we have to understand why people are scared of the nonstagnant world.</p><h2>Climate Change</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I mean, boy, there are a couple of threads here that are super important, one of which is that one thing that I sense that both of us get frustrated with is that if you think about growth as necessary to contain certain violence, and you think about growth as largely also being how much fossil fuels you're able to burn, climate is not paired with a reduction in opulence. It's paired on the other side with war. If you over-focus on climate and you result in a situation in which growth is slowed to a halt ... Now, growth doesn't need to be the amount of fossil fuel you burn, but it has largely been that up until the present. You actually see that the trade-off that you're facing is very different than the one that's usually portrayed by either side. Somehow we never get around to that conversation, which would be, if we were very serious about climate, would we be plunged into war?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah. Obviously you can't have an economy without an environment, but it may also be the case that you can't have an environment without an economy. And then if both of those statements are true, maybe the set of best solutions looks really different than if you just focus on one and not the other.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>This is why it's so important for me to have environments in which people who don't agree on things, but agree on what constitutes a conversation, can sit down with an idea that nobody's going to leave the table with their reputation in tatters to the extent that they can't find a job on Monday to support themselves. It's that you have to actually weigh both of these things simultaneously. The great danger is people trying to solve either problem in isolation.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, if one goes with the general climate change narrative that it's anthropogenic, it's CO2 levels are rising in a way that's dangerous and has a serious risk of some kind of big runaway process, I think always the political question in my mind is, what do you do about China and what do you do about India? Because these are the countries that are trying to catch up to the developed world. They have a enormous way to go to catch up and-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It's a logical consequence.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I think Europe has something like 8% of the carbon emissions in the world. Then we have to have more than just the magical political thinking where it's something like we're going to have a carbon tax in California and this will be so charismatic and so inspiring that people in China and India will copy us and follow suit. They're not willing to actually say that literally because it sounds so absurd-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It sounds crazy.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But if you say that that's not the way things actually work, then somehow you need to do some really different things. We need to find energy sources that are not carbon dioxide intensive. Maybe we need to figure out ways to engineer carbon sinks. I mean there's all this crazy geoengineering stuff that maybe should be on the table. Maybe we should be more open to nuclear power. It was like a range of very different debates that pushes you towards-</p><h2>Transparency and Privacy</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Let me take a slightly different tack. Two statements that I found later in life unfortunately, but have both been meaningful to me. One is Weber's definition that a government is a monopoly on violence. And the other one, it's a guy I can never remember who said, I think it was a French political philosopher who said, \"A nation is a group of people who have agreed to forget something in common.\" If you put these things together, if you imagine that somehow we've now gone in for the belief that transparency is almost always a good thing and that what we need is greater transparency to control the badness in our society, we probably won't be able to forget anything in common. Therefore, we may not be able to have a nation, and therefore the nation may not be able to monopolize violence, which is a very disturbing but interesting causal chain. Can we explore the idea of transparency, given that people seem to now associate certain words with positivity, even though normally we would have thought about privacy, transparency, trade-offs, let's say?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes. Well, I always do think there's a privacy-transparency trade off. One thing that's always confusing about transparency to me is there's transparency in theory, which is like this panopticon-like thing where the entire planet gets illuminated brightly and equally everywhere, all at once. So that's in theory. But then in practice is often it sounds more like a weapon that will be directed against certain people where it's a question of who gets to render who else transparent, and maybe it's even a path-dependent sequencing question where if you do it first-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>First strike transparency.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>First strike transparency is very powerful. So you have to think about Mr. Snowden against the NSA, and then the NSA trying to expose Mr. Snowden's Swedish sex cult, whatever you want to describe it as. I think a lot of it ends up having that kind of an-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>You mean Assange's.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Sorry, Assange. Assange's Swedish sex cult, Assange against the NSA, NSA against Assange's Swedish sex cult or something like that. I think in practice full transparency, it assumes people can pay attention to everything at once or equally. That seems politically incorrect. Then even if you had this much greater transparency in all these ways, there are all these ways that that would seem creepy totalitarian. If you stated in terms of the problem of violence, you can think of the trade-off between transparency and privacy as transparency is we're looking at everybody and therefore they can't be that violent, but the state may be very violent in enforcing all this transparency.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Privacy is you get to have a gun and you get to do various dangerous things in the dark and no one knows what they are. So there's probably more violence on the individual level, but then less control on the state. It's, again, this question of are you more scared of the violence of individuals or more scared of centralized violence? Probably one should not be too categorical or too absolute about this, but it can show up in both places and that's why it's a wickedly hard problem. Wickedly hard.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It does seem to be. I have to say I've started to hate the transparency discussion, because if you'll notice there's a vogue in 2019 for simply saying, \"Well, I believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant,\" as if that constituted an argument. Now, first of all, one thing that people don't understand is that there are infections, like brucella, that are actually accelerated by sunlight, so it's comical. It's not even true. Bleach is probably a better disinfectant. But the idea that that constitutes an argument in our time, to me, speaks to the fact that we're living in a very strange moment where if you go back to Ecclesiastes and the inspiration for Turn Turn Turn, there was an idea that there was a purpose to everything and inclusion or exclusion were both needed. \"A time to kill, a time to die, time to refrain from killing.\"</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>There does seem to be an absolutist mania in which it would be hard to imagine writing a song about a time to kill in the modern era. And likewise, I'm not positive that people recognize how imperative it is for a well-functioning government to have places where it doesn't have to constantly account for itself.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>If you have no back room deals, maybe that's less corrupt, but maybe nothing gets done.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Not functional.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The US Supreme court still doesn't televise its hearings. I suspect that's the right call.  I think part of it is that if you know that everything is going to be transparent, you will censor yourself and you won't say things. So it's not like the same thing happens in a transparent way. Maybe it just stops happening altogether. If you're a politician or an aspiring politician, you're not going to engage in bold ideas. You're not going to experiment with different ways about thinking about things. You're going to be super conventional, super curated.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>It's not like we get all the benefits of transparency with none of the costs. They come with a very, very high cost. I do wonder if one of the strange dynamics with the younger generations in the US is that there's a sense that you're just constantly watched. There's this great Eye of Sauron, to use the Tolkien metaphor, that's looking at you at all times. It would be good if you could act the same way and if something bad happened, we could take care of you. But if you're always being watched, I suspect it really changes your behavior.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It's interesting, in a moment where I wanted to make sure that my son didn't misbehave, I toured him around our neighborhood and pointed out all of the cameras that would track anybody on the street where we live. I had never noticed them before, but sure enough there they were in every nook and cranny that we don't realize that if it has to be stitched together, there's an incredible web of surveillance tools that are surrounding us at all time. </p><h2>Excitement and Nihilism</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Are you familiar with the theory of Jennifer Freyd's called Institutional Betrayal?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I know you've mentioned it to me, but I don't know all the details. So tell me a little bit about it.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, I don't know all the details either. But I think what she isolated was that people who have been betrayed by institutions that have a responsibility of care, like a hospital for example, or if you trust a sense-making organ like your newspaper, and then you find that you've been betrayed by that institution that had something of a principal-agent problem where you had to trust your agent in order to take care of you, that the quality of trauma is in fact different and that it leads to a universal fear of the infrastructure of your society. That's sort of what I picked up.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>What I was going to ask you about is, given our central belief that there was something about growth that led to universal betrayal by institutions, which has compromised experts in the minds of most of people, do you think there's a preferred way of waking up as a society out of a kind of universal institutional betrayal? (If we're excited about the next chapter, what I'd love to talk to you about in a future episode is what we're excited about, about what comes next.) Is there a way of waking up from this most gracefully?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Don't know about that. It strikes me that there are ways we don't want to wake up. We don't want to wake up in a way where it de-energizes us and demotivates. I think one of the ways I think these institutions worked was they took care of people, but it was also motivational. You study. You get good grades. You'll succeed in our system. One way, when you deconstruct these institutions, there's one direction that I think is always very dangerous, that it just shifts people into a much more nihilistic, very low energy mode where it's just, \"Well, there's no point. Nothing can be done.\" That's the way that I definitively do not want to wake people up.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So I think it has to always be coupled a little bit to... There are these paths that aren't really going anywhere and you shouldn't go down these paths. But then there's some other paths here that you need to take. There's a portal here that you need to look at. If we are just saying all the paths are blocked, I think probably the risk is people just sit down where they are and stop moving altogether. That feels like the very wrong way to wake people up.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>That sounds very wise. Let me just ask, since you've been attached to some of the highest energy ideas, whether it's crazy-sounding stuff like seasteading or radical longevity or some other ideas from your background in venture capital and as a technologist yourself, what are the things that you're most excited if we could move them back into the institutions where they probably have belonged all this time? What are the first subjects and people that you would move back into institutional support to reenergize our society? People or programs.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I do think there is something about basic science that doesn't all have the for-profit character. Some of it has this nonprofit character. We're building up this knowledge base for all of humanity. I don't yet know how we do basic science without some kind of institutional context. That's one that would seem absolutely critical. I'm super interested in the problem of longevity, radical life extension. My disappointment in the nonprofit institutions and nonprofit world has directed me more and more over the years to just invest in biotech companies and try to find these better-functioning corporate solutions. And then I always have this worry in the back of my head that maybe there are these basic research problems that are being sidestepped because they're too hard. So I think basic science is one that you'd have to do, but you have to somehow also reform the institution so that you don't have this Gresham's law where the politicians replace the scientists.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>That sounds like a great one. I was very surprised to see that your friend, Aubrey de Grey, who you funded to get the radical longevity thing, was in the news for having solved a hard math problem in his spare time that nobody even knew he was working on. So it seems like even though people would treat him as crazy, he certainly has a lot on the ball and probably is exactly the kind of a person who might energize the department even if he might infuriate it.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>If you can get him back in. If you were able to get him back in, I think you'd be able to solve a lot of problems.</p><h2>End</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, Peter, it's been absolutely fantastic having you. Thank you for a very generous gift of your time, and I hope that you will consider coming back on The Portal to talk about some of the specifics about the things that you and I are most excited about doing next.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Will do. Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>All right, Peter. You've been watching The Portal with Peter Thiel. I'm your host, Eric Weinstein. Thanks for tuning in.

I wish all coastlines were less straight so that they could all have a bay!\" We purposely chose to zoom in on the most questionable part of Oregon's coastline, the least straight part, the part that would best contradict his generalization, in order to best help me disambiguate what his point is supposed to be.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fS0ON-lyQPKhmTdng7QJoQ.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Similarly, in <em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=7papZR4oVssC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%22I+had+a+scheme,+which+I+still+use+today+when+somebody+is+explaining+something+that+I%27m+trying+to+understand:+I+keep+making+up+examples.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=euT0g9nS1X&amp;sig=ACfU3U1NmJ-7w_cDu0anl-tGFYsUiYmnDw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjW2prjhMDkAhVHjlkKHdJaAOQQ6AEwAHoECDEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20had%20a%20scheme%2C%20which%20I%20still%20use%20today%20when%20somebody%20is%20explaining%20something%20that%20I'm%20trying%20to%20understand%3A%20I%20keep%20making%20up%20examples.%22&amp;f=false\">\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\"</a></em> (h/t <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific\">Eliezer</a>), Richard Feynman talks about his trick to check whether a proposed theorem is true by zooming into a specific example designed to pinpoint a contradiction:</p><blockquote>I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I'm trying to understand: I keep making up examples. For instance, the mathematicians would come in with a terrific theorem, and they're all excited. As they're telling me the conditions of the theorem, I construct something which fits all the conditions. You know, you have a set (one ball) - disjoint (two halls). Then the balls turn colors, grow hairs, or whatever, in my head as they put more conditions on. Finally they state the&nbsp;theorem, which is some dumb thing about the ball which isn't true for my hairy green ball thing, so I say, \"False!\"</blockquote><blockquote>If it's true, they get all excited, and I let them go on for a while. Then I point out my counterexample.</blockquote><blockquote>\"Oh. We forgot to tell you that it's Class 2 Hausdorff homomorphic.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"Well, then,\" I say, \"It's trivial! It's trivial!\"</blockquote><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*x5qd9ihmZz7ZO-VQ.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Note that if Feynman were just making up the simplest or most obvious examples, then the proposed theorems would probably always come out true about those examples, because the mathematicians wouldn't bother using easily-falsifiable theorems as challenges. In order to successfully notice when the proposed theory is false, Feynman must always be picking the craziest examples he can get away with under the mathematicians' growing list of conditions.</p><h1>Thought Experiments</h1><p>In mathematical logic, there's a formal term for zooming into a theory: <strong>model-checking</strong>. Given a collection of axioms about sets or numbers or whatever, you probe their implications by looking at specific examples of structures that obey those axioms. Eliezer <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific\">explains</a>:</p><blockquote>Suppose you want to know whether it's true that all positive integers less than 5, when multiplied by 7, are less than 50. &nbsp;If you prove the general truth that all integers less than 5, times 7, are less than 35, by manipulating the axioms of multiplication and inequality, that's deduction. &nbsp;If you notice that the only positive integers less than 5 are just {1, 2, 3, 4} and enumerate their products {7, 14, 21, 28}, which are all less than 50, that's model-checking.</blockquote><p>But if we're doing science, rather than mathematical logic, then zooming into a theory in order to probe its implications is called by a different name: <strong>thought experiment</strong>.</p><p>Say you want to make a revolutionary breakthrough in humanity’s understanding of the age-old concepts of space, time, light, and motion.</p><p>What Albert Einstein said was, “Specificity powers, activate! Form of: thought experiment!” And he zoomed into the previously-understood laws of physics so he could get a better view of why they didn’t hold together.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*-tpEWe5WqFFIXVdE\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:59%\"></figure></span><p>Einstein looked for specific scenarios that would strain the existing theories of his time the most. But he was always careful to stay within the space of scenarios that the existing theories could still reason about, careful not to break any of a theory's rules or assumptions, but just zooming into the parts that felt to him like loose screws.</p><p>He famously described scenarios like riding on a beam of light, or riding a fast-moving train and watching for a lightning flash while other people standing on the platform are watching for it too.</p><p>In one famous thought experiment, Einstein imagined a man in a walled room in the setup shown here, and observed that the man wouldn’t be able to distinguish whether his room is fixed in place and he’s in a gravitational field that pulls him leftward (his “down”), or someone is yanking on a rope to accelerate him and the room rightward (his “up”).</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*FwcnKep_5SwKD5h9.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Einstein then spent a few years doing hard math to figure out how the laws of physics had to work in order for those two specific situations to be fundamentally equivalent, and the answer he got was his General Theory of Relativity.</p><p>What exactly is a “thought experiment” and how does it work? Wikipedia puts it like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%27s_thought_experiments\">this</a>:</p><blockquote>As opposed to <em>physical</em> experiments, thought experiments do not report new empirical data. They can only provide conclusions based on deductive or inductive reasoning from their starting assumptions. Thought experiments invoke particulars that are irrelevant to the generality of their conclusions. It is the invocation of these particulars that give thought experiments their experiment-like appearance.</blockquote><p>Aha, they don’t work by cajoling the universe into giving us new data. All they do is give our brains meaty “particulars”—a.k.a. specifics — to chew on. Thought experiments are yet another demonstration of how specificity makes our brains, and Einstein’s brain, work better.</p><p>When I asked Steve about zooming into a strategically-chosen area of Oregon's coastline and looking at an indented area full of water, that was basically a simple thought experiment to challenge his \"Oregon's coastline is straight\" theory. Einstein's thought experiments were the same thing: zooming into the previously-understood theories of physics so he could get a better view of why they didn’t hold together.</p><p>You might think Steve's statement about Oregon's coastline was hardly a theory, and it's too ridiculous to perform a real thought experiment on. But that's only because we already know that Steve isn't making sense. Concepts like \"phlogiston\", \"luminiferous aether\", and even Newtonian gravity are also pretty ridiculous in light of our current scientific understanding, but they're all still perfectly valid theories to thought-experiment with.</p><h1>Zooming Out From Specifics</h1><p>So far, we've seen a lot about the power of zooming into specifics. Let's see the power of starting with a focus on collecting specifics and then zooming out to a general theory.</p><p>In the 1830s, many intellectuals were passionately debating the question: <strong>Do species of life evolve gradually from other species, or does God put them on Earth in one or more discrete “creation events”?</strong></p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*crh2ApAacLH3XgGo.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:58%\"></figure></span><p>Charles Darwin had a passion for making observations of the natural world. In his famous 5-year voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle (whose main purpose was supposed to be mapping the coast of South America for the British government), he observed a wide variety of animal species in South America and the Galapagos islands and noted their similarities in detail.</p><p>For example, he saw a bunch of Galapagos tortoise species which seemed almost identical to one another, only differing in little traits that made them adapted to their respective environments:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Bmoxtuv74Db1NjZ1.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p><em>Galápagos tortoises are adapted for different feeding habits. The “saddle-backed” tortoises have shells that rise in the front like a saddle. This adaptation makes it easier for them to lift their necks and feed on taller cactus. “Dome-shaped” tortoises live on islands where most of the vegetation is close to the ground, making it unnecessary for them to raise their heads to feed. <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/amnh/human-evolutio/darwin-and-evolution-by-natural-selection/a/charles-darwins-evidence-for-evolution\">Source</a></em></p><p>Plus, since Darwin also had a passion for geology, he was also digging up fossils and comparing them to the area's living species. By the time he got back to Britain, he was ready to generalize what he saw:</p><p><strong>Species are gradually evolving all the time. There seem to be no discrete creation events.</strong></p><p>Next, he wanted to answer another question: What kind of natural process drives species to evolve?</p><p>Once again, he set out to collect a bunch of specific observations. He spent a lot of time with British pigeon breeders to understand the specifics of how the breeding process creates new types of of pigeons.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZPlKkPPCGfvM2z1LKRQ8iQ.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:56%\"></figure></span><p><em>The carrier pigeon (bottom left) and the Brunner pouter (bottom right) were derived from the wild rock pigeon (top). <a href=\"https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/history_14\">Source</a></em></p><p>Zooming out from his observations of pigeon breeding, Darwin put forth this generalization:</p><p><strong>Some kind of natural force that acts on species the way breeders do would be able to cause the observed evolution of species.</strong></p><p>As far as I know, those were Darwin's breakthroughs leading to the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection, and they both consist of observing a bunch of specific examples before venturing to zoom out and make a general claim.</p><p>(Also, he and Alfred Russel Wallace simultaneously figured out that this “natural breeding force” is a consequence of Thomas Malthus’s observation that all populations are eventually forced to compete for resources.)</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>So now you have two ways you can activate your specificity powers to help make scientific breakthroughs:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Zoom into existing theories: </strong>Take the current theories of your time and think about how they apply to specific hypothetical scenarios in order to understand the contradictions you'll need to fix with new theories.</li><li><strong>Zoom out from specific observations:</strong> Make specific observations of a kind of thing in the world until you can generalize a theoretical insight that neatly organizes all the specific stuff you’ve been observing.</li></ol><p>Try these out and let us know what you discover.</p><p><strong>Next post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rm2MueK3LxpRywE8N/the-power-to-solve-climate-change\">The Power to Solve Climate Change</a></p><p><strong>Companion post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JJxByXddxEDciG5dA/examples-of-examples\">Examples of Examples</a></p>",

I suggest you read that post first but here’s the summary:</p><blockquote>I attempted to reproduce Scott’s analysis of <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/\">Birth order effect vs Age gap</a>. I found that:</blockquote><blockquote>There appeared to be an error in graphs 2 &amp; 3 where people with one sibling were counted when they shouldn’t have been (graph 2) or were counted twice (graph 3)</blockquote><blockquote>Comparing oldest children to youngest children causes a bias in the results which can be prevented by comparing oldest children to 2nd oldest children</blockquote><blockquote>I was unable to reproduce Scott’s result on people reporting 0 year age gap – I get a non-significant 58% older siblings compared to Scott’s 70%. I was unable to discover the cause of the difference.</blockquote><h1>Summary</h1><p>I reanalysed how sibling age gap modifies the SSC birth order effect. I found that:</p><p>The birth order effect is relatively steady for the first 4-8 years of age gap at about 70% respondents being the firstborn vs secondborn. For larger age gaps the effect reduces. There is insufficient evidence to conclude how long this reduction takes or whether the effect is completely removed at very large age gaps.</p><p>2 other trends were noted in the data but evidence for them was not strong:</p><ul><li>The reduction may not be the same (or might disappear) for larger families  </li><li>Birth order effect may be lower at 1 year age gap vs 2-7 year age gap</li></ul><p>Considering competing theories on the cause of the Birth order effect, two theories fit the data well: </p><ul><li>Intra-family dynamics </li><li>Decreased parental investment</li></ul><p>And three theories fit the data poorly: </p><ul><li>Changed parental strategies </li><li>Maternal antibodies </li><li>Maternal vitamin deficiencies</li></ul><h1>Introduction</h1><p>The original reason for me looking at this data was to analyse whether the data support a sudden drop between years 7 and 8 or whether there is an alternative explanation which fits the data.</p><p>I will note here that I’m not a trained statistician and am using this as practice of Bayesian model comparison, inspired by johnswentworth’s recent <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/onCRFFN7rGXTg3jyc\">model comparison</a> sequence. I’d say I’m 80% confident in my broad conclusions, less so in the specifics - I'd be fairly confident there are a couple of errors lurking in here somewhere.</p><h1>Analysis: All family sizes combined</h1><h2>Is there a sudden drop after 7 years?</h2><p>Getting back to the data, here’s the result that I’m going to focus on, comparing 1st to 2nd children in all family sizes:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1567591794/Birth%20order%20effect/Post%202/My_3_new.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:76%\"></figure></span><p>Eyeballing the graph makes the sudden drop after 7 years look like the most natural explanation. However, we had no reason, a priori, to think that a 7 year age gap would have any special significance – a drop could have happened after 1 or 10 years for all we knew. </p><p>If we model a sudden drop after 6 or 8 years the model starts to match the data significantly less well, any further away from 7 than that and the model performs really poorly. Although a general “sudden drop” model has a high maximum likelihood at 7 years, the overall model likelihood is lower due to the lower likelihoods for other drop years.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1567679163/Birth%20order%20effect/Post%202/Sudden_Drop_Lines.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:75%\"></figure></span><h2>General slope model</h2><p>Imagine a model which is similar to a sudden drop model but the drop is ramped down over a number of years.

If I were to include other numbers of children when the change might have happened or possibility that the change happens gradually as family size got bigger then this factor would change but that would start getting way too complicated for me!</p><p>I still don't really believe this an actual effect but if someone has an explanation of what might cause this then I'm all ears.</p><h1>Possible lower birth order effect for 1 year age gap</h1><p>One other thing which I noticed is the lower Birth order effect for age gaps of 1 year as compared to gaps of 2-7 years (0.66 vs 0.71 oldest siblings). A quick calculation suggests Bayes factor comes out at 2 in favour of the Birth order effect being lower at 1 year age gap compared it being constant across 1-7 year age gaps.</p><p>Note in this case that although the Bayes factor isn't huge, it seems like this is the kind of thing which might actually happen (some of the potential causes would give this a decent prior - see section below for more discussion) so I'm much less inclined to just write this one off.</p><h1>Comparing Explanations for Birth order effect</h1><p>Scott <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/\">lists</a> 5 potential causes of the Birth order effect:</p><p>1. Intra-family competition</p><p>2. Decreased parental investment</p><p>3. Changed parenting strategies</p><p>4. Maternal antibodies</p><p>5. Maternal vitamin deficiencies</p><p>I‘be renamed 1 to \"Intra-family dynamics\" to include non-competitive interactions between siblings. A few people have mentioned other sibling dynamics which might cause a Birth order effect (e.g. <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/#comment-753722\">here</a>). The predictions of age gap effect from competitive vs non-competitive causes seem similar to me so I'll lump them together.</p><p>My thoughts for what each of the 5 potential causes would predict regarding age gap are given below. The conclusions for each potential cause end up being very similar to Scott’s (after all that work!) except that there is no need to postulate anything especially significant about 7 years and that there may be a slight increase in birth order effect between 1 and 2 years age gap.</p><h2>Intra-family dynamics</h2><p>Prediction: Birth order effect remains roughly constant with small age gaps, with less effect as the gap gets larger.</p><p>Assessment: Findings match prediction well. 4-8 years seems reasonable for levels of interactions between siblings to start decreasing. </p><p>Potentially, for a small age gap, a very advanced younger sibling might act more like an older sibling meaning that the 1 year age gap birth effect would be lower. This feels slightly forced to me (I would think any such effect would be fairly small) but am curious what others think.</p><h2>Decreased parental investment</h2><p>Prediction: Birth order effect increases as age gap increases - the longer a firstborn is the only child the longer they benefit from 100% of their parents’ attention. If the earliest years are the most important then birth order might not change after that critical period. Once older children are able to look after themselves, birth order effect might come down with larger age gaps.</p><p>Assessment: The increase in birth order effect between 1 and 2 years would match the theory, if parental investment is mostly important in the first two years. If older children start being able to look after themselves after 4-8 years then this would explain the drop in birth order effect after this time.</p><p>The match between the theory and result is good, although there are a couple of degrees of freedom to help match the prediction to the data. 4-8 years seems reasonable for children starting to look after themselves better but 2 years seems on the low side for a prediction of how long having extra attention is beneficial. Maybe between 2-5 years the two effects roughly cancel out?</p><h2>Changed parenting strategies</h2><p>Prediction: Age gap has minimal effect on Birth order effect.</p><p>Assessment: Prediction matches data poorly. It is possible that parental strategies start to reset towards firstborn strategies after longer age gaps but I wouldn’t have put much of my probability mass on that option. There is a 5 year gap between my youngest children and I definitely didn’t reset towards firstborn strategies, I suspect this would have still been true even for a much larger gap.</p><h2>Maternal antibodies</h2><p>Prediction: Age gap has minimal effect on Birth order effect. Generally you don’t need top-ups of vaccines so presumably antibodies stick around indefinitely? Or is it your body’s ability to make more? Anyway, Scott thinks this is unlikely and he’s a doctor so I’ll take his word for it.</p><p>Assessment: Prediction matches data poorly. My biology knowledge is too poor to know how likely a decrease in effectiveness after 4-8 years would be in this case.</p><h2>Maternal vitamin deficiencies</h2><p>Prediction: Very small age gaps have large effect. Birth order effect decreases rapidly for age gaps &lt;3 years – my estimate for how long it might take to rebuild vitamin stockpiles.</p><p>Assessment: Prediction matches data poorly. 4-8 years seems way too long for vitamin stockpiles to <em>start</em> to build back up. </p><h1>Conclusions</h1><p>The SSC 2019 survey data support a constant, high, birth order effect (~2.4 oldest siblings for every 1 second oldest sibling) for age gaps &lt;4-8 years. This is followed by a decline to a lower birth order effect at an undetermined rate. The decline does not necessarily completely remove any birth order effect although this may be the case for very large age gaps.</p><p>The data provide some evidence that:</p><ul><li>The reduction may not be the same (or might disappear) for larger families (4+ children)</li><li>Birth order effect may be lower at 1 year age gap vs 2-7 year age gap</li></ul><p>However the evidence for both of these points is relatively slim.</p><p>Intra-family dynamics and decreased parental investment predict the results well. </p><p>Changed parental strategies, maternal antibodies and maternal vitamin deficiencies do not predict the results well. </p>",

I found that:</p><p>1. There appeared to be an error in graphs 2 &amp; 3 where people with one sibling were counted when they shouldn’t have been (graph 2) or were counted twice (graph 3)</p><p>2. Comparing oldest children to youngest children causes a systematic bias in the results. This can be prevented by comparing oldest children to 2nd oldest children</p><p>3. I was unable to reproduce Scott’s result on people reporting 0 year age gap – I get a non-significant 58% older siblings compared to Scott’s 70%. I was unable to discover the cause of the difference.</p><p>I have reanalysed the data based on points 1 &amp; 2 in a separate <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YnXd7zfGGZfMD9QtA/age-gaps-and-birth-order-reanalysis\">post</a>.</p><h1>Previously in Birth order effect</h1><p>In the 2018 Slate Star Codex survey Scott asked some questions about what order in the family respondents were born. He <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/08/fight-me-psychologists-birth-order-effects-exist-and-are-very-strong/\">found that</a> eldest children were massively overrepresented.</p><p>Following on, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tj8QP2EFdP8p54z6i/historical-mathematicians-exhibit-a-birth-order-effect-too\">historical mathematicians</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QTLTic5nZ2DaBtoCv/birth-order-effect-found-in-nobel-laureates-in-physics\">Nobel winning physicists</a> were found to exhibit the same property. </p><p>In the 2019 SSC survey Scott included questions about age gaps between respondents and their adjacent siblings. He <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/\">analysed the results</a>, finding that:</p><blockquote>This study found an ambiguous and gradual decline [in Birth order effect] from one to seven years [Age gap between siblings], but also a much bigger cliff from seven to eight years.</blockquote><h1>Failed reproduction of Scott’s graphs</h1><p>I had originally intended to analyse the data to see if I could draw any further conclusions. However, when running the analysis I found that I was unable to reproduce Scott’s results.</p><p>Scott includes 3 graphs.</p><p>The first – comparing % of sample oldest child vs age gap for people with 1 sibling – I was able reproduce almost exactly (Scott also has access to respondents’ data who asked not to be included in the public data so we aren’t exactly the same. There may be other differences too but these are small).  </p><p>The second – comparing how many oldest vs youngest children there are in the sample for people with more than 1 sibling – I was unable to reproduce. Actually, I was able to reproduce the graph but only if I also included people with 1 sibling. </p><p>This is actually what the third graph was supposed to show, but it looks like the third graph double counts the people with 1 sibling. </p><p>The graphs are below, with Scott’s on the left and my reproductions on the right. Note the similarity between Scott’s graph 3 and my graph 2.</p><p>(My version of graph 2 has a different y-axis to all of the other graphs as the range is larger)</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1567586842/Birth%20order%20effect/Post%201/6_combined.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>As an intuitive way of seeing that there is something wrong – Scott’s third graph lists 7,613 samples included. There are only 8,171 people in the whole survey but the third graph should be ruling out any only children and any children between first and last in their family. It seems that there should be more than 558 people in that group (actually there are 767 only children, not even counting any middle children).</p><p>(Scott’s results were <a href=\"https://athenaegalea.tumblr.com/post/184870253552/slatestarscratchpad-sometime-tomorrow-ill-be\">double checked</a> by Tumblr user athenaegalea but this only involved looking at the data for the first graph which I also agree with).</p><p>Correcting this mistake is important as the 7 year age gap drop in birth effect is predicated on graphs 1 &amp; 2 both showing such a drop. In my reproduction there is no such drop in graph 2 which suggests the 7 year age gap sudden drop may not be a thing after all.</p><h1>Problem with comparing oldest and youngest children</h1><p>Below I have plotted the data from graphs 1 &amp; 2 on the same axis (switching to line graphs to make trends a bit easier to see). I have changed the y-axis to be a ratio of oldest:youngest instead of a percentage to highlight the strangeness of the results.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1567586529/Birth%20order%20effect/Post%201/My_1_2_combined.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:72%\"></figure></span><p>The 1 sibling data still show a relatively constant birth effect across different age gaps until 7 years gap. 8 years and above then shows a drop in Birth order effect size.</p><p>The &gt;1 sibling data show a very different trend. At 1 year age gap there are over 7x more firstborns than lastborns. This decreases rapidly as age gap increases. Above 9 years age gap there are actually more youngest children than oldest (although the sample size is relatively small here).</p><p>This seems odd – the two data sets should be reflecting roughly the same process but with different family sizes – the graphs should be similar, or at least closer than this! Does having additional siblings qualitatively change how age gap modifies the Birth order effect?</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Above we are comparing oldest siblings with youngest siblings and looking at the relative age gaps. In doing so we are implicitly assuming that the age gaps between 1st and 2nd children should be statistically similar to the age gaps between penultimate and last children in the general population.</p><p>This does not match with my experience. In families with &gt;2 children that I know, age gaps between later children tend to be larger than between earlier children. </p><p>Checking this in the data, I looked at people who are neither first nor last children and compared the age gaps to their next older sibling and next younger sibling. On average the age gap to their younger sibling was 0.55 years longer than the gap to their older sibling.</p><p>This effect would explain the incredibly high birth order effect with 1 year age gap seen in my graph 2. If many oldest and few youngest children in the general population have 1 year gap to their neighbouring sibling and we add this to the SSC Birth order effect then the overall effect in the SSC sample will be huge. </p><p>It would also explain how the birth order effect in graph 2 appears to decrease dramatically for families with large age gaps – in the population as a whole, more youngest than oldest children in the overall population will have &gt;5 year gap to their neighbouring sibling. This overall population effect cancels out some (or all for &gt;9 year gap) of the Birth order effect from the SSC population.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>I can't think of a way to quantify and/or cancel out this effect whilst comparing oldest to youngest children but fortunately we don't have to.</p><p>Instead of comparing oldest and youngest children, we could compare first and second children. If we only look at first and second children and compare age gaps downwards and upwards respectively then we should be looking at the same underlying distribution of age gaps in the general population.</p><p>One advantage of comparing oldest to youngest siblings is that this represents the largest Birth order effect (see Scott’s 2018 <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/08/fight-me-psychologists-birth-order-effects-exist-and-are-very-strong/\">analysis</a>). However, as most of the effect happens between first and second siblings, the effect should still be large enough to detect using these samples. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Redoing my previous graph based on first and second children rather than first and last gives something which makes a lot more sense - there isn’t much difference between 1 sibling and &gt;1 sibling. The &gt;1 sibling data set doesn’t have the sudden drop after 7-years but does suggest a slight downwards trend around the same time.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1567586529/Birth%20order%20effect/Post%201/My_1_2_combined_new.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:77%\"></figure></span><p>Recreating Scott’s graph 3 (i.e. including all family sizes) gives a drop in birth order effect at 7 years but not as low as with just the 1 sibling data – ~59% oldest children vs 2nd oldest, compared to ~54%.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1567586529/Birth%20order%20effect/Post%201/My_3_new.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:71%\"></figure></span><h1>Failed reproduction of birth order effect with 0 year age gap</h1><p>I also failed to reproduce Scott’s finding regarding people reporting a zero year age gap. He finds that:</p><blockquote>Weirdly, among people who reported a zero-year age gap, 70% are older siblings.</blockquote><p>but I was unable to produce a result like this.</p><p>First I removed the respondents who reported 0 year age gaps in a direction in which they reported 0 siblings. This removed over half of the reported 0 year age gaps.</p><p>Of those remaining, I get a non-significant 58% older siblings (53 vs 39). There were also 3 respondents who indicated that they were in the middle of a multiple birth.</p><p>In this case I’m not sure how I get such different results from Scott. Even if I don’t remove the responses as I detailed above I don’t get anywhere near Scott results (I actually get ~60% <u>younger</u> sibling – with so many oldest children there are more opportunities to put a 0 years in the upwards direction where it should have been left blank).</p><p>So I’m very confused about why I’m getting such different results.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>In my <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YnXd7zfGGZfMD9QtA/age-gaps-and-birth-order-reanalysis\">next post</a> I reanalyse the data based on 1st and 2nd oldest children.</p>",

Two basic ways in which you might get traction now on how a technique like that will scale to AGI might be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do experiments with current regularization techniques where you try to determine to what extent models end up being aligned with the loss function they were trained under depending on the types of inductive biases present during their training. I’m actually fairly excited about this approach, and I am working on a post right now which will hopefully provide some ways in which you might start going about doing that. One concern with this sort of approach, however, is that you might not be able to get any traction on phenomenon that only appear once your capabilities get really close to AGI.</li>\n<li>Analyze from a theoretical perspective what happens in the limit of perfect capabilities. The idea here is to try to patch the previous problem where when you do experiments you don’t get to see phenomenon that only happen when your capabilities get really advanced by imagining that your capabilities were perfect. In this case, however, you end up with the opposite problem of not seeing any phenomenon that only appear when your capabilities are weaker.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The nice thing about combining these two approaches is that they tackle the problem from both sides, giving you an idea both of what the weak capability landscape looks like as well as the strong capability landscape. For this post, however, the focus will be on the second approach.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>From a theoretical perspective, the two most natural types of inductive biases are simplicity bias and time complexity bias. Paul Christiano has <a href=\"https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/\">previously argued that simplicity bias can be deceptive in the limit</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nyCHnY7T5PHPLjxmN/open-question-are-minimal-circuits-daemon-free\">left the question of whether the same is true of time complexity bias as an open problem</a>. The goal of this post is to attempt to resolve that open problem. In particular, though one might have hoped that deceptive alignment could be avoided by heavily penalizing time complexity so that the model doesn’t have time to spend reasoning about deception, I will argue that this is not the case due to the possibility of meta-learning.</p>\n<p>First, however, we need a clear understanding of what it means for a model to be deceptive. “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>” provides the model of <em>deceptive alignment,</em> wherein a model appears aligned during training for the instrumental reason of being selected by the training process. More generally, however, what we really care about is deceptive behavior—that is, the situation where our model generalizes pathologically such that it produces a <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance-39eafec74b99\">malign failure</a>.</p>\n<p>Second, we need a clear understanding of why simplicity bias leads to deception and an understanding of why that doesn’t generalize to time complexity bias.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the trap that simplicity bias falls into is as follows. First, there are many short but very powerful optimizers composed of very simple objectives with optimization processes capable of making use of vast amounts of compute. Furthermore, for a sufficiently complex task, it seems likely that the simplest program that solves it will be such an optimizer. Second, many of these optimizers are likely to be able to benefit in some way from being selected by your simplicity-biased training process—by defecting against you at some point, for example—and thus will have good training performance. Finally, since the vast majority of possible objectives—especially the very simple ones—are not aligned, the simplest program that solves a sufficiently complex task is unlikely to be aligned.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-1\" id=\"fnref-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>However, this sort of strategy has a major problem: it has to spend extra time doing the “am I out of training” check, which causes it to lose out on time complexity compared to a robustly aligned model. Thus, one hope for eliminating this sort of thing might be to exploit this asymmetry by strongly selecting your model based on time complexity. If this works, it would mean you might be able to solve inner alignment just by using strong regularization, which would be a big win.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>This leads to the following theoretical conjecture: the fastest program that solves a task will not be deceptive. In particular, we will be thinking of “fastest programs” as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_circuit\">minimal circuits</a>. In his original post, Paul phrased this conjecture as “the fastest way to solve any particular problem doesn't involve [deception].”</p>\n<p>The conclusion of this post is the following: if there exists some set of natural tasks for which the fastest way to solve them is to do some sort of machine learning to find a good policy, and there is some task for which that machine learning results in deceptive behavior, then there exists a natural task such that the minimal circuit that solves that task also produces deceptive behavior. For example, if the fastest way to solve some set of tasks is to search for simple programs that perform well, and if the simplest programs are deceptive, then there exists a task where the minimal circuit is also likely to be deceptive.</p>\n<p>Why might we think such a set of tasks exists? The fundamental idea is to consider the case of meta-learning: if your tasks are things like “classify this image according to this training data” then it seems quite plausible that the fastest way to solve all tasks of that form will be to use some form of ML—in particular, that’s what we do.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-2\" id=\"fnref-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-2\">[2]</a></sup> Then, once you have a task set that satisfies the requirement that the fastest way to solve those tasks is through search over models, you just need to also include some task for which search over models yields deceptive behavior to produce the desired reduction.</p>\n<p>Once you have such a task set, the basic insight is to consider what happens if you take all of those different tasks together and combine them into one very diverse meta-learning task. In this case, the minimal circuit that solves that single task is forced to implement the same fastest search algorithm over models that we know has some task on which it yields deceptive behavior. Fundamentally, what’s happening here is that we’re exploiting the fact that the fastest search algorithm does not produce the fastest model. Thus, even if in some sense the fastest model that doesn’t do any search over models (that is, doesn’t do any meta-learning) is safe, as soon as the model starts doing meta-learning, it might find another model which is not safe.</p>\n<p>You can think about this argument as a reduction from the safety of minimal circuits to the safety of fast training procedures. Furthermore, if you buy that real-world data is mostly distributed according to a simplicity prior, such that such fast training procedures will have to select models at least somewhat according to simplicity, then you can even view this argument as a direct reduction to <a href=\"https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/\">the malignancy of simplicity priors</a>.</p>\n<h2>Formal argument</h2>\n<p>We will formalize tasks as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process\">MDPs</a> of the form <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"T = (X, A, p, P, r)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

However, despite it sort of doing the right thing, it isn’t safe (at least assuming that there is some task on which the fastest machine learning isn’t safe): it produces outputs that are systematically optimized for values other than the ones we want them to.</p>\n<p>Importantly, however, this is because we didn’t successfully incentivize our minimal circuit to also find minimal circuits. If we were somehow able to find some alternative metric which incentivized our minimal circuit to only do search over minimal circuits, then we might be able to break this counterexample. It is an interesting open problem what sorts of objectives might be able to get around this “forwarding the guarantee” problem.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-4\" id=\"fnref-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Furthermore, the counterexample presented here is quite natural in the sense of just requiring some environment which is diverse enough to include aspects of meta-learning, which is the sort of thing that could occur in many realistic diverse environments. Specifically, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03030\">Ortega et al. have argued</a> that “Meta-learning can also occur spontaneously in online regression when the capacity of the agent is bounded and the data is produced by a <em>single generator,</em>” noting in particular that “the downside is that we cannot easily control what will be metalearned. In particular, spontaneous meta-learning could lead to undesirable emergent properties, which is considered an open research problem in AI safety <a href=\"https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/building-safe-artificial-intelligence-52f5f75058f1\">[Ortega et al., 2018]</a>.”</p>\n<p>Thus, this counterexample suggests that in situations involving spontaneous meta-learning we shouldn’t necessarily expect time complexity regularization to guarantee inner alignment, as any meta-learning that has to be done won’t inherit any safety guarantees. Furthermore, this counterexample further suggests that the case of spontaneous meta-learning—or <em>mesa-optimization</em> as it is referred to in “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>”—is an important hard case to consider when designing AGI alignment strategies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-5\" id=\"fnref-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-5\">[5]</a></sup> That being said, the jury is still out on whether time complexity regularization might still be one component of a full inner alignment solution, though this result demonstrates that it at least can’t be the entire solution.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>It is worth noting that this example does not straightforwardly generalize to actual machine learning systems—see “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a>” for an analysis of whether such a generalization holds. <a href=\"#fnref-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>An important question here is why the minimal circuit wouldn't just look like a lookup table. The simple answer is that it probably will at first, but if we give it enough meta-learning problems, then at some finite time the lookup table should become more expensive than an actual learning algorithm, since the learning algorithm should always take a constant amount of time per problem, whereas lookup gets more and more expensive as you have to encode more and more problems. <a href=\"#fnref-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-v22haEofwsEJFaQPG-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>We will refer to the different components of a task <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"T\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

    "htmlBody": "<p>  </p><p>This is the first Russian x-risks newsletter, which will present news about Russia and global catastrophic risks from the last 3 months. </p><p>Given the combination of high technological capabilities, poor management, high risk tolerance and attempts to catch up with West and China in the military sphere, Russia is prone to technological catastrophes. It has a 10 times higher level of aviation catastrophes and car accidents than developed countries. </p><p>Thus it seems possible that a future global catastrophe may be somehow connected with Russia. However, most of the work in global catastrophic and existential risk (x-risks) prevention and policy efforts are happening in the West, especially in US, UK and Sweden. Even the best policies adopted by the governments of these countries may not help if a catastrophe occurs in another country or countries.</p><p>This newsletter will help to inform the Western public of activity relative to x-risks in Russia. All information presented here is based on open sources. However, these sources require some systematisation and debiasing. For example, some Russian news sources tend to present situation as worse than they are just to attract attention. Another source of biases is the ongoing new cold war.</p><p>This is the first test issue of the newsletter, which I will issue every 3 months. I will publish it on LessWrong, the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialRisk/\">existential risk</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialRisk/\">subreddit</a> and existential risk <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExistentialRisk/\">Facebook</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExistentialRisk/\">page</a>. I do not currently have a subscription option available. Below are news for summer 2019:</p><p>1. “<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-08/stricken-russian-nuke-sub-crew-prevented-planetary-catastrophe\">Planetary catastrophe</a>” was prevented after a fire aboard the deepwater nuclear submarine <em>Losharick </em>“by the dead heroes” on its crew<em>, </em>as was said during the funeral for the victims<em>. </em>Most likely, this was just rhetoric. However, a more ominous but less probable interpretation is that the catastrophe was somehow connected with the Poseidon nuclear torpedo, which is said to be capable of carrying a 100 megaton cobalt-salted bomb (still not a planetary catastrophe, even if it explodes in a harbour, but surely a regional one). This is, however, unlikely, as Losharik is a small submarine, incapable of carrying such a large system. </p><p>2. Russia’s biggest state-owned bank, Sberbank, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/380271-poslednee-izobretenie-chelovechestva-sberbank-predupredil-ob-opasnosti-sverhrazuma?fbclid=IwAR0AYnIzfYa5qk-8DnEw4BadAgeKX64g7JItYwJzzDpUhDYC7SwONkArpRc\">said</a> that AI could be the last invention of humanity. Sberbank chairman German Gref is known for his technoprogressivist views; as well as one of the main investors in AI development; the bank <a href=\"https://www.vladtime.ru/econom/677516\">invited</a> Bostrom to its conference. While these views are not an official position of the Russian government, the government does own a large stake in the bank, and recently developed plans that AI will be developed in Russia by large, government-owned companies, including Sberbank. One 30 May 2019, Putin <a href=\"https://thebell.io/neravnyj-boj-sberbank-i-pravitelstvo-posorevnuyutsya-za-iskusstvennyj-intellekt-s-ssha-i-kitaem/\">held</a> a meeting about national AI strategy, and Gref was the first who spoke. Putin reiterated that anyone who has a monopoly on AI will be the ruler of the world. The plan is to increase the share of companies that are using AI; to create an AI capable of solving more wider tasks; to create a Russian AI chip; and to reach the top 10 list of countries in terms of citations of scientific research about AI. However, the allocated budget is rather small—1.5 bln USD for 6 years—much less than is allocated for national AI strategies in other countries. It should also be noted that what Putin says doesn’t automatically becomes reality: he used to say a lot about democracy, wage increases, etc., while actual disposable income is constantly declining. </p><p>3. Putin warned against wind energy, as he claimed it could kill worms in the ground: He <a href=\"https://meduza.io/feature/2019/07/11/putin-skazal-chto-vetryanye-elektrostantsii-izgonyayut-chervey-iz-zemli-i-ubivayut-ptits-eto-pravda\">said</a>: “Will people be comfortable living on a planet lined with a picket fence of windmills and covered with several layers of solar panels? How many birds die due to windmills! They shake so much that worms crawl out of the ground”. The claim about birds may have some merit, but the claim about worms is obviously false and intended to mock environmentalists. Despite this, grassroots environmental awareness is growing in Russia, especially connected with illegal dumps, one of which almost led to a plane crash on the 8th of August. An illegal dump near an airport attracted birds, which were sucked into both engines of an Airbus; it miraculously landed on a field nearby. Personally, I was going to fly this airplane on the same route that day, but in the opposite direction, so I saw on arrival the bags of people that had been removed from the crash-landed plane (nobody died, but there were injuries). </p><p>4. <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/06/asia/arctic-fires-russia-climate-change-intl/index.html\">Russian forest fires</a> were claimed to be a planetary catastrophe (before the Amazonian ones came to overshadow those in Siberia in the news). The official area of the fire is around 30 000 km, but could be larger. They are probably connected with illegal logging and drying of wetlands, resulting in firestorms, which releases soot to higher levels of the atmosphere, much like the phenomenon leading to nuclear winter. There is a 1984 <a href=\"http://www.pynthan.com/vri/nwaos.htm#HIMH\">article</a> by Roland describing how the USSR could start an artificial nuclear winter by nuking its taiga. </p><p>5. Kardashev, the inventor of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale\">Kardashev scale</a> of supercivilizations, died at 87. He continued scientific work until his last days, and I was pleased to be able to speak (as usual, about the risks of SETI and ETI in general) a couple of times at his seminar about SETI. His last video is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj0QLW026yA&t=15s\">here</a>, in which he spoke about the possibility of SETI via wormholes. </p><p>6. Targeted bioweapons? There was an <a href=\"https://guardian.ng/features/health/bioweapons-designed-to-kill-only-people-of-particular-race/?fbclid=IwAR29wI6LOstHtN9r0kQMk7446r3PMRrDO3EJ-42U4AbuN0QvwqtURdfhagM\">article</a> in the Guardian about the possibility of racially targeted bioweapons. Russia <a href=\"https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3465563\">is not allowing</a> citizens export of biosamples because of the fear that they will be used to create targeted bioweapons. This creates problems for Russian citizens who wish to use services such as <em>23andMe</em>, as exporting genetic samples is illegal. However, one can travel abroad and leave biosamples there. </p><p>7. There was another nuclear accident in Northern Russia on 8th August in Severodvinsk. Probably a meltdown of a small nuclear reactor, which powers the “eternal” cruise missile <em>Burevestnik</em>. CNN <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/17/europe/russia-nuclear-summer-skyfall-intl/index.html\">reported</a> that it may be an accident connected with a Russian Doomsday weapon; however, a nuclear-powered cruise missile is not a Doomsday weapon, as it can carry only a conventional nuke. The real doomsday weapon is the Poseidon salted 100 MT torpedo.  </p><p><em>Interesting fact</em>: there is a widespread Russian <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170223014035/https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_curse\">belief</a> that August is the month of catastrophes. This observation results from some <a href=\"https://www.proza.ru/2009/08/03/1025\">combination</a> of coincidences, relaxed work during vacations, a practice of testing new weapons systems during short summer months, as well as temperature effects on building materials. For example, the recent plane crash mentioned above was related to the increased activity of birds during summer, and two recent nuclear accidents are related to activity by the Northern fleet, the operation of which is limited at other times of the year by ice. </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>AI safety researchers often describe their long term goals as building \"safe and efficient AIs\", but don't always mean the same thing by this or other seemingly similar phrases. Asking about their \"success stories\" (i.e., scenarios in which their line of research helps contribute to a positive outcome) can help make clear what their actual research aims are. Knowing such scenarios also makes it easier to compare the ambition, difficulty, and other attributes of different lines of AI safety research. I hope this contributes to improved communication and coordination between different groups of people working on AI risk.</p>\n<p>In the rest of the post, I describe some common AI safety success stories that I've heard over the years and then compare them along a number of dimensions. They are listed in roughly the order in which they first came to my attention. (Suggestions welcome for better names for any of these scenarios, as well as additional success stories and additional dimensions along which they can be compared.)</p>\n<h1>The Success Stories</h1>\n<h2>Sovereign Singleton</h2>\n<p>AKA <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence\">Friendly AI</a>, an autonomous, superhumanly intelligent AGI that takes over the world and optimizes it according to some (perhaps indirect) specification of human values.</p>\n<h2>Pivotal Tool</h2>\n<p>An oracle or <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/task_agi/\">task AGI</a>, which can be used to perform a <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/pivotal/\">pivotal</a> but limited act, and then stops to wait for further instructions.</p>\n<h2>Corrigible Contender</h2>\n<p>A semi-autonomous AGI that does not have long-term preferences of its own but acts according to (its understanding of) the <a href=\"greaterwrong.com/posts/BKM8uQS6QdJPZLqCr/towards-a-mechanistic-understanding-of-corrigibility#Act_Based_Corrigibility\">short-term preferences</a> of some human or group of humans, it competes effectively with comparable AGIs corrigible to other users as well as unaligned AGIs (if any exist), for resources and ultimately for influence on the future of the universe.</p>\n<h2>Interim Quality-of-Life Improver</h2>\n<p>AI risk can be minimized if world powers coordinate to limit AI capabilities development or deployment, in order to give AI safety researchers more time to figure out how to build a very safe and highly capable AGI. While that is proceeding, it may be a good idea (e.g., politically advisable and/or morally correct) to deploy relatively safe, limited AIs that can improve people's quality of life but are not necessarily state of the art in terms of capability or efficiency. Such improvements can for example include curing diseases and solving pressing scientific and technological problems.</p>\n<p>(I want to credit Rohin Shah as the person that I got this success story from, but can't find the post or comment where he talked about it. Was it someone else?)</p>\n<h2>Research Assistant</h2>\n<p>If an AGI project gains a lead over its competitors, it may be able to grow that into a larger lead by building AIs to help with (either safety or capability) research. This can be in the form of an oracle, or human imitation, or even narrow AIs useful for making money (which can be used to buy more compute, hire more human researchers, etc). Such Research Assistant AIs can help pave the way to one of the other, more definitive success stories. Examples: <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/pZhDWxDmwzuSwLjou/asymptotically-benign-agi/comment/aRBJ3M8f52Fm5pMty\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/cSzaxcmeYW6z7cgtc/contest-usd1-000-for-good-questions-to-ask-to-an-oracle-ai/comment/JMABP4HCXFvAX8JXw\">2</a>.</p>\n<h1>Comparison Table</h1>\n<table style=\"width:100%\">\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th></th>\n\n<th>Sovereign Singleton</th>\n\n<th>Pivotal Tool</th>\n\n<th>Corrigible Contender</th>\n\n<th>Interim Quality-of-Life Improver</th>\n\n<th>Research Assistant</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th>Autonomy</th>\n\n<td>High</td>\n\n<td>Low</td>\n\n<td>Medium</td>\n\n<td>Low</td>\n\n<td>Low</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th>AI safety ambition / difficulty</th>\n\n<td>Very High</td>\n\n<td>Medium</td>\n\n<td>High</td>\n\n<td>Low</td>\n\n<td>Low</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th>Reliance on human safety</th>\n\n<td>Low</td>\n\n<td>High</td>\n\n<td>High</td>\n\n<td>Medium</td>\n\n<td>Medium</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th>Required capability advantage over competing agents</th>\n\n<td>High</td>\n\n<td>High</td>\n\n<td>None</td>\n\n<td>None</td>\n\n<td>Low</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th>Tolerates capability trade-off due to safety measures</th>\n\n<td>Yes</td>\n\n<td>Yes</td>\n\n<td>No</td>\n\n<td>Yes</td>\n\n<td>Some</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th>Assumes strong global coordination</th>\n\n<td>No</td>\n\n<td>No</td>\n\n<td>No</td>\n\n<td>Yes</td>\n\n<td>No</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th>Controlled access</th>\n\n<td>Yes</td>\n\n<td>Yes</td>\n\n<td>No</td>\n\n<td>Yes</td>\n\n<td>Yes</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n<p>(Note that due to limited space, I've left out a couple of scenarios which are straightforward recombinations of the above success stories, namely Sovereign Contender and Corrigible Singleton. I also left out CAIS because I find it hard to visualize it clearly enough as a success story to fill out its entries in the above table, plus I'm not sure if any safety researchers are currently aiming for it as a success story.)</p>\n<p>The color coding in the table indicates how hard it would be to achieve the required condition for a success story to come to pass, with green meaning relatively easy, and yellow/pink/violet indicating increasing difficulty. Below is an explanation of what each row heading means, in case it's not immediately clear.</p>\n<h2>Autonomy</h2>\n<p>The opposite of human-in-the-loop.</p>\n<h2>AI safety ambition/difficulty</h2>\n<p>Achieving each success story requires solving a different set of AI safety problems. This is my subjective estimate of how ambitious/difficult the corresponding set of AI safety problems is. (Please feel free to disagree in the comments!)</p>\n<h2>Reliance on human safety</h2>\n<p>How much does achieving this success story depend on humans being safe, or on solving human safety problems? This is also a subjective judgement because different success stories rely on different aspects of human safety.</p>\n<h2>Required capability advantage over competing agents</h2>\n<p>Does achieving this success story require that the safe/aligned AI have a capability advantage over other agents in the world?</p>\n<h2>Tolerates capability trade-off due to safety measures</h2>\n<p>Many ways of achieving AI safety have a cost in terms of lowering the capability of an AI relative to an unaligned AI built using comparable resources and technology. In some scenarios this is not as consequential (e.g., because it depends on achieving a large initial capability lead and then preventing any subsequent competitors from arising), and that's indicated by a \"Yes\" in this row.</p>\n<h2>Assumes strong global coordination</h2>\n<p>Does this success story assume that there is strong global coordination to prevent unaligned competitors from arising?</p>\n<h2>Controlled access</h2>\n<p>Does this success story assume that only a small number of people are given access to the safe/aligned AI?</p>\n<h1>Further Thoughts</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>This exercise made me realize that I'm confused about how the Pivotal Tool scenario is supposed to work, after the initial pivotal act is done. It would likely require several years or decades to fully solve AI safety/alignment and remove the dependence on human safety, but it's not clear how to create a safe environment for doing that after the pivotal act.</li>\n<li>One thing I'm less confused about now is why people who work toward the Contender scenarios are focused more on minimizing the capability trade-off of safety measures than people who work toward the Singleton scenarios even though the latter scenarios seem to demand more of a capability lead. It's because the latter group of people think it's possible or likely for a single AGI project to achieve a large initial capability advantage, in which case some initial capability trade-off due to safety measures is ok, and subsequent ongoing capability trade-off is not consequential because there would be no competitors left.</li>\n<li>The comparison table makes Research Assistant seem a particularly attractive scenario to aim for, as a stepping stone to a more definitive success story. Is this conclusion actually justified?</li>\n<li>Interim Quality-of-Life Improver also looks very attractive, if only strong global coordination could be achieved.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I had some colleagues watch Ben Garfinkel&#x27;s talk, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-how-sure-are-we-about-this-ai-stuff/\">How sure are we about this AI stuff?</a>&quot;, which among other things, pointed out that it&#x27;s often difficult to change the long-term trajectory of some technology. For instance, electricity, the printing press, and agriculture were all transformative technologies, but even if we recognized their importance in advance, it&#x27;s hard to see what we could really change about them in the long-term.</p><p>In general, when I look at technological development/adoption, I tend to see people following local economic incentives wherever they lead, and it often seems hard to change these gradients without some <em>serious</em> external pressures (forceful governments, cultural taboos, etc.). I don&#x27;t see that many &quot;parallel tracks&quot; where a farsighted agent could&#x27;ve set things on a different track by pulling the right lever at the right time. A counterexample is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY\">Qwerty</a> vs. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard\">Dvorak</a> keyboard, where someone with enough influence may well have been able to get society to adopt the better keyboard from a longtermist perspective.</p><p>This causes one to look at cases of &quot;lock-in&quot;: times where we could have plausibly taken any one of multiple paths, and this decision:</p><p>a) could have been changed my a relatively small group of farsighted agents</p><p>b) had significant effects that lasted decades or more</p><p>A lot of the best historical examples of this aren&#x27;t technological--the founding of major religions, the writing of the US constitution, the Bretton Woods agreement--which is maybe some small update towards political stuff being important from a longtermist perspective.</p><p>But nevertheless, there are examples of lock-in for technological development. In a group discussion after watching Garfinkel&#x27;s talk, Lin Eadarmstadt asked what examples of lock-in there might be for AI research. I think this is a really good question, because it may be one decent way of locating things we can actually change in the longterm. (Of course, not the only way by any means, but perhaps a fruitful one).</p><p>After brainstorming this, it felt hard to come up with good examples, but here&#x27;s two sort-of-examples:</p><h1>Example 1</h1><p>First, there&#x27;s the programming language that ML is done in. Right now, it&#x27;s almost entirely Python. In some not-totally-implausible counterfactual, it&#x27;s done in OCaml, where the type-checking is very strict, and hence certain software errors are less likely to happen. On this metric, Python is pretty much the least safe language for ML.</p><p>Of course, even if we agree the OCaml counterfactual is better in expectation, it&#x27;s hard to see how anyone could&#x27;ve nudged ML towards it even in hindsight. Of course, this would&#x27;ve been much easier when ML was a smaller field than it is now, hence we can say Python&#x27;s been &quot;locked in&quot;. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve heard murmurs about Swift attempting to replace it, with the latter having better-than-zero type safety.</p><p>Caveats: I don&#x27;t take these &quot;murmurs&quot; seriously, it seems very unlikely to me that AGI goes catastrophically wrong due to a lack of type safety, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the time of <em>anyone</em> here to worry about this. This is mostly just a hopefully illustrative example.</p><h1>Example 2</h1><p>Currently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is usually done by specifying a reward function upfront, and having the agent figure out how to maximize it. As we know, reward functions are often hard to specify properly in complex domains, and this is one <a href=\"https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html\">bottleneck</a> on DRL capabilities research. Still, in my naive thinking, I can imagine a plausible scenario where DRL researchers get used to &quot;fudging it&quot;: getting agents to sort-of-learn lots of things in a variety of relatively complex domains where the reward functions are hacked together by <a href=\"https://sciencedryad.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/grad-student-descent/\">grad student descent</a>, and after many years of hardware overhang have set in, someone finally figures out a way to stitch these together to get an AGI (or something &quot;close enough&quot; to do some serious damage).</p><p>The main alternatives to reward specification are imitation learning, inverse RL, and DeepMind&#x27;s reward modeling (see section 7 of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07871.pdf\">this paper</a> for a useful comparison). In my estimation, either of these approaches are probably safer than the &quot;AGI via reward specification&quot; path.</p><p>Of course, these don&#x27;t clearly form 4 distinct tech paths, and I rate it &gt; 40% that if AGI largely comes out of DRL, no one technique will claim all the major milestones along the way. So this is a pretty weak example of &quot;lock-in&quot;, because I think, for instance, DRL researchers will flock to reward modeling if DeepMind unambiguously demonstrates its superiority over reward specification.</p><p>Still, I think there is an extent to which researchers become &quot;comfortable&quot; with research techniques, and that if TensorFlow has extensive libraries for reward specification and every DRL textbook has a chapter &quot;Heuristics for Fudging It&quot;, while other techniques are viewed as esoteric and have start-up costs to applying (and less libraries), then this may become a weak form of lock-in.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>As I&#x27;ve said, those two are fairly weak examples. The former is a lock-in that happened a while ago that we probably can&#x27;t change now, and it doesn&#x27;t seem that important even if we could. The latter is a fairly weak form of lock-in, in that it can&#x27;t withstand that much in the way of counter-incentives (compare with the Qwerty keyboard).</p><p>Still, I found it fun thinking about these, and I&#x27;m curious if people have any other ideas of potential &quot;lock-in&quot; for AI research? (Even if it doesn&#x27;t have any obvious implications for safety).</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This post is part of research I did at OpenAI with mentoring and guidance from Paul Christiano.</em></p>\n<p>The goal of this post is to present my thoughts on some of the sorts of experiments that might be able to be done now that could shed light on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">inner alignment problem</a>. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about inner alignment from a theoretical perspective recently that I’m pretty excited about, but at the same time, I think there’s also a lot of concrete experimental work that can be done in this space as well. That being said, this post is mostly just a brain dump; I expect a lot of additional work will have to be put in to actually take any of these proposals across the finish line.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in working on any of these proposals, however, feel free to just go ahead and take it on—you don’t need my permission to do so!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-TkjSzmATQCd9nPzXP-1\" id=\"fnref-TkjSzmATQCd9nPzXP-1\">[1]</a></sup> That being said, if you’d like to talk to me about one of them—which I would love to do if you’re thinking of seriously working on one of these ideas—please do reach out to me either in the comments here or by sending me an email at <a href=\"mailto:evanjhub@gmail.com\">evanjhub@gmail.com</a>.</p>\n<h1>Concrete proposals</h1>\n<h2>Reward side-channels</h2>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Train an RL agent with access to its previous step reward as part of its observation. Then, at test time, modify the observed reward. Measure to what extent the agent continues optimizing the original reward versus switches to optimizing the new observed reward. Compare to the situation where the agent is not given the reward at all and the situation where the agent is given the next step reward (for each action in a discrete action space) rather than the previous step reward. As an implementation detail, I think the RL agent should include either LSTMs or Transformers to enable it to keep track of its multi-step return if it wants to.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> One important question for understanding the likelihood of deceptive or corrigible alignment vs. robust alignment is to what extent models tend to learn their goals internally vs. via reference to things in their environment. This experiment directly attacks that question by asking whether/to what extent an RL agent will learn to optimize a reward signal in its environment. This is relevant both for understanding how to train corrigibility as well as how to avoid deceptive alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Extensions:</strong> Add noise to the observed reward signal and/or try replacing the observed reward signal with some function of the reward instead such as a randomly initialized neural network.</p>\n<h2>Cross-episodic objectives</h2>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Train an RL agent in an environment that contains a side-channel for boosting the agent’s reward in the next episode. Measure to what extent the agent takes advantage of it. Try different population-based training approaches. Measure again.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Safety approaches like amplification and debate depend heavily on agents doing solely myopic optimization, whereas approaches like IRL and reward modeling depend on long-term forward-looking optimization. Thus, understanding the conditions under which agents exploit non-myopic reward side channels could be very useful for shedding some light on the best training techniques to use for different alignment approaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Extensions:</strong> Instead of getting a cross-episodic objective via population-based training, try just giving the model information that makes it obvious that this is possible such that even a naive planning algorithm would be able to deduce that it can get extra reward across episodes this way. As an implementation detail, I think you will need to use some sort of optimization-as-a-layer to make this work.</p>\n<h2>Objective unidentifiability</h2>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Train an RL agent in an environment with multiple simple, obvious objectives all of which would equally explain the true reward. Test in environments that distinguish between the different possible objectives and determine the situations under which models tend towards some objectives versus others. In particular, look for situations in which the model learns some proxy which it pursues competently off-distribution but which has poor off-distribution performance on the true reward. As an implementation detail, I expect you might need to use some sort of optimization-as-a-layer for this to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Knowing what sorts of proxies models tend to use in different situations would enable us to have a better understanding of the most likely forms of pseudo-alignment and thus the best ways to push models towards robust alignment instead. Furthermore, being able to clearly demonstrate proxy alignment could help in making the case for inner alignment being a real issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Extensions:</strong> Try changing inductive biases and/or model capacity and see if it changes the types of proxies that the model uses.</p>\n<h2>Zero-shot objectives</h2>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Set up a system that enables a language model to take actions in an environment to optimize some reward. Do IRL on the resulting behavior and inspect the objective that results. Find some way to measure how coherent it is. Compare to an RL agent trained directly on the reward. As an implementation detail, you should focus on environments where a language model might actually be able to perform well. (Edit: I think my explanation here was a bit too general, so here's an example of what I mean. Take a language model and see if you can get it to perform tasks which traditionally require RL/search/optimization and see if it can do them. For example, can GPT-2 play Chess? What about a new game not in the training data that you give it the rules to? If these sorts of things work, then that seems to imply that your model must have learned some sort of optimization algorithm, if only some sort of minimax algorithm for searching for the best moves in a game.)</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> It is possible that the best model that maximizes predictive accuracy in a language context might be—at least to some extent—goal-directed. Though current language models are likely not advanced enough to show true goal-directed behavior, it might at least be possible to see the beginnings of coherent objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>Extensions:</strong> Experiment with different ways to encode RL observations and actions as text and see how consistent the resulting IRL objectives are.</p>\n<h2>Robust reward learning</h2>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Train a reward-predictive model-based RL agent (e.g. an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06170\">Imagination-based Planner</a>) and compare the resulting objective to the actual reward. Train again with adversarial training on inputs that produce maximally differing reward estimates and compare again.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Useful for testing the ability of adversarial training to resolve reward unidentifiability as well as providing information on to what extent adversarial training for aligning the reward model produces aligned actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Extensions:</strong> Try relaxing the adversary to output pseudo-inputs (e.g. activations) that would lead to maximally differing assessments instead of inputs and backpropagate on those instead.</p>\n<h1>Other thoughts</h1>\n<p>This section is just a list of all the different possible testable hypotheses I came up with when thinking about this—including those that made it into the above list of concrete proposals and those that didn’t—for the purpose of helping others generate even more possible experiments in this space.</p>\n<h2>Inference-time search</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To what extent can you learn complex inference-time search algorithms? Could you structure an architecture that would learn MCTS organically? How artificial does such an architecture have to be? How do factors like environment diversity, inductive biases, algorithmic range, statefulness, and hard-coded optimization impact this?</li>\n<li>Does modeling search algorithms produce search algorithms? If an RL agent is in an environment with another agent that is doing some hard-coded search and it has to model that agent, does it learn to implement search itself?</li>\n<li>What happens if you let a model not have constant computational complexity? Can it learn search better?</li>\n<li>Can you learn optimization/search algorithms even in non-RL settings? Can you get a purely predictive model to perform well zero-shot on an RL task?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reward unidentifiability</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How do RL agents behave in environments with unidentifiable goals? What sorts of proxies tend to be favored over others? How do different inductive biases affect this? What about adversarial training? Can it be empirically demonstrated that most learned objectives are pseudo-aligned?</li>\n<li>Can you definitively distinguish between capability generalization and objective generalization? What if you train a planner and then test it off-distribution?</li>\n<li>Can you distinguish between the different forms of proxy alignment? Can you get an instrumentally pseudo-aligned model? Can you replicate the cleaning robot examples from Risks from Learned Optimization in gridworlds?</li>\n<li>Can you produce approximate alignment if you constrain model capacity?</li>\n<li>What about suboptimality alignment? Can you create an environment with simple and complex strategies with different alignment properties and get a model to switch between them at test time?</li>\n<li>How does using a learned reward model vs. learned policy affect unidentifiability concerns? Can you distinguish between and disincentivize misaligned objectives if you have access to a learned reward model? What about if you just have a Q function?</li>\n<li>Can you build a meta-learner that optimizes for robustness? How does meta-learning help with building robust models? What about one that minimizes time complexity?</li>\n<li>Can you do adversarial training with pseudo-inputs or other relaxations?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Modeling of the training process</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What happens if you do RL where you give the agent access to the reward signal through a side channel in its observation? How does it affect robustness? What if it has to work to get the leaked info? What if it’s noisy? How does using architectures with more planning affect this?

    "htmlBody": "<p>(pt.4 of our <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/HknKjvSxbFAAQ3RdL\">Forecasting Infrastructure series</a>)</p><p><em>Tl;dr: We&#x2019;re sharing our <u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLXrI-uGlFhMzyNfSZ9QjVCOZa4blJsjhJcS8KsDagE/edit?usp=sharing\">structured forecasting session format</a></u>.</em></p><p><strong>Intro</strong></p><p>In our quest to build forecasting infrastructure, we&apos;ve reencountered a classic open problem in group rationality - how do you run a meeting? More specifically, how can you run a meeting in order to elicit, aggregate, and distill individual human judgements in a principled manner such that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. We wanted to find a meeting format that would help a community of forecasters work together to collectively make better predictions than they would on their own.</p><p>It&apos;s a question that&apos;s been studied since at least the 1950&#x2019;s when the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method\"> RAND Corporation invented the Delphi Method</a>. The Delphi Method is a structured meeting template wherein a group of experts estimate their answer to a question, share their reasoning, reply to others estimations, and then estimate again. It encourages updating in the face of new evidence, and the format has a <u><a href=\"https://sci-hub.se/10.2307/25059465\">strong track record of producing well-calibrated predictions</a></u>. </p><p>However, for our needs, it wasn&apos;t quite the right fit. In particular we didn&apos;t have domain experts, we had expert forecasters. The quintessential superforecaster is good at forecasting but might not have refined models of the domain (in this case AI). We wanted to create a format that would help forecasters rapidly orient to the question. To that end we made a few changes:</p><p>- We added a much greater emphasis on understanding and building models, collaboratively, on the question. </p><p>- We included time for active research into the topic.</p><p>For the past eight months we&apos;ve been holding forecasting sessions most Sundays.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLXrI-uGlFhMzyNfSZ9QjVCOZa4blJsjhJcS8KsDagE/edit?usp=sharing\"> I think our approach is refined enough and general enough that the template can be used by others to good effect</a>. </p><p><strong>Format</strong></p><p>The general approach is to take 4-12 forecasters through a series of key steps:</p><ul><li>Understand the question and your key &quot;technical&quot; uncertainties (ex. what does this word mean) </li><li>Individually make a forecast</li><li>Discuss as a group the initial forecasts</li><li>Collaboratively analyze the question from several lenses.</li><ul><li>Outside view</li><li>Inside View</li><li>Key Uncertainties</li><li>Scenario Planning</li><li>What would change my mind?</li></ul><li>Discuss as a group</li><li>Make new individual forecasts</li><li>Share and compare updates</li></ul><p>A facilitator leads the session, largely performing a logistical role such as keeping track of time and recording key comments in the document.</p><p>Most of the session is spent collaboratively but silently writing in a Google doc. This enables &quot;multiplexing&quot; operations where multiple people work together on different points. Contrast with a standard online meetings where everyone&#x2019;s attention is directed to one person, potentially wasting a lot of brainpower. We also heavily use meta tags. Using brackets to indicate an [info-request] or support for a point [+1] helped direct attention and signal group consensus.</p><p>Key &quot;goals&quot; of the format:</p><ul><li>Create an environment in which there is an interactive back-and-forth on the question.</li><li>Approach the question from different angles. For example create an outside view model of the question and then an inside view model of the question - the different approaches complement one another and can reveal blindspots.</li><li>Generate sub-questions that can be answered or forecast.</li><li>Encourage flexibility and switching between breadth first and depth first approaches for investigating a topic.</li></ul><p>For a taste here&#x2019;s a transcript from our AI forecasting session on a set of questions assessing the likelihood that, by a certain year, <u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_4mqi-iSJlhr1pFjAjuherxKue5M1Dah4c1jjvV_w4/edit#\">there will be a 2-year interval in which the AI-compute trend did not double</a></u>. You can see from the transcript how the format can elicit models and beliefs, and allow back and forth between participants in a manner to identify the key uncertainties driving the forecast.</p><p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p><p>I feel confident saying the session format helps in clarifying and understanding the forecasting question - every time I&apos;ve participated I&apos;ve come away with a much deeper understanding of the contours of the question. Similar to the surprising effectiveness of fermi estimation, it&apos;s surprisingly effective to spend 10-30 minutes collaboratively poking at a forecasting question.</p><p>On the other hand I&#x2019;m not entirely confident that we&#x2019;re not increasing group think risks. The original Delphi method had every participant be anonymous - we haven&apos;t tried that but I&apos;d like to.</p><p>Even though much of the session happens in a Google Doc, I&#x2019;d recommend using a video chat platform.  For the past few months our sessions have been conducted over Discord, so that we could easily have multiple &quot;voice channels&quot; if session participants want to break off and discuss one on one. That feature has been nice, but I fear we&apos;ve lost an ineffable quality from voice chat. There&apos;s a way in which seeing everyones face, even if you&apos;re working silently, helps sharpen and focus attention on the question at hand - you know you&apos;re in this together. </p><p>Finally on a meta level I&apos;m surprised at how useful purposefully designing a custom meeting format was. I bet there&apos;s a lot of easy gains to be made through more custom tailoring of conversations (more experimentation like <u><a href=\"http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/equatalk.html\">Robin Hanson&apos;s EquaTalk idea</a></u> would be neat).</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ul><li>We&#x2019;ve also experimented with &#x201C;operationalization&#x201D; workshops, where the main goal is to take an unformed intent and turn it into a well operationalized question, and &#x201C;speed-forecasting&#x201D; workshops, where we take several questions and rapidly share models and forecast. </li><li><u><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303918064_InvestigateDiscussEstimateAggregate_for_structured_expert_judgement\">The IDEA method was also an inspiration for our forecasting sessions.</a></u></li></ul>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This is the 4th post of 5 containing the transcript of a podcast hosted by Eric Weinstein interviewing Peter Thiel.</em></p><h1>Interview</h1><h2>Automation</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, this is why I try to sell you sometimes on a more progressive view of the world, which is I want deregulated capitalism. I want the people who have the rare skillsets to be able to integrate across many different areas, and to be honest, this is the thing that I wish more people understood about what you bring, which is that you're able to think in, I don't know, 15 different idioms that most people only have one or two of. So, whatever it is that you're doing to integrate these things as an investor and to direct research and direct work is really something that I've watched firsthand for six years. The problem that I have is, we are going to have to take care of the median individual. And I less think that the median individual is going to be reachable by the market over time, as some of these things that are working in Silicon in terms of machine learning-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah, but then you're being more optimistic on progress in tech than is... Because look, I think, yes, if we have runaway automation, and if we're building robots that are smarter than humans and can do everything humans can do, then we probably have to have a serious conversation about a universal basic income or something like that, and you're going to end up with a very, very weird society. I don't see the automation happening at all, and I think the question of automation in my mind is identical to this question of productivity growth. We've been automating for 200, 250 years, since Industrial Revolution, agriculture and manufacturing, and the sort of society we have in the early 21st century is one in which most jobs are non-tradable service sector jobs that are not easily automatable.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, it's like a waiter in a restaurant. It's a yoga instructor. It's a nurse. It's a kindergarten teacher. That's what most jobs in our society are, and because they've been so resistant to automation, that this may be one of the reasons why the productivity numbers are slowing down, even if we're still innovating as fast in manufacturing, and even if we're still agriculture, they're a smaller and smaller part of the economy. So, even 5% a year productivity growth in manufacturing, that means a lot more if manufacturing is 60% of the economy, than it does when it's, say, 20% of the economy. So, that's roughly what I think would happen, and if you just look at the current dynamic in the US as we have unemployment, like 3.6%, 3.7%. It's super low, and still, there doesn't seem to be that much wage pressure. There doesn't seem to be that much growth. The productivity numbers still aren't great. You'd think there'd be enormous incentives to increase productivity.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It's quite confusing to me. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But I think, again, my read on it is just the automation story has been oversold.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I agree that the automation story has been oversold.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>It's possible it's going to happen. It's possible it's just around the corner, and it's about to happen. That's what we've been told in a lot of these areas over the last 40, 50 years.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, I have a couple questions about this. One is sort of, if I think about how common retail occupations are, is there something about retail that is resistant to Amazonification, if you will, where people actually want to go shop in a physical place and are willing to pay a premium that we have just to have human contact? Maybe there's some information exchange. Maybe there's a recreational aspect that's bundled. That's one of my two questions, and the other one surrounds the idea that we've always focused on when is AGI coming, and the robots that will do everything? Part of the lesson for me about machine learning is how many things humans were doing that don't require anything like artificial general intelligence. Just some specialized neural net seems to be good enough to do the job. So, those would be two questions in my mind as to how-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes, but I think all these things you have to concretize, and yes, I think retail is a sector that's under quite a bit of pressure, and is going to stay under quite a bit of pressure. That's the top one I would come up with is-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, it's looks vulnerable to me.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Amazon is the most threatening of the big tech companies in that it's threatening a lot of other companies elsewhere in the industry and disrupting them and making things more efficient, but probably with a lot of sheer forces at work in that process. So, I agree that that's a candidate for automation or productivity improvements or things like that. I'm still not convinced that it's in the aggregate shifting things that much, and then you can go through all sorts of individual job descriptions where people used to have secretaries because typing was a skill, and with a word processor you don't quite need this. You can do short emails. You don't quite need a secretary. People still have executive assistants that sort of somehow do slightly different set of responsibilities, but it's not clear we have fewer executive assistants than we used to have secretaries. </p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, when one actually concretizes it, it's not quite clear how disruptive the automation that's happening really is. Again, it's a version of the tech stagnation thing. It's always the last 40, 50 years, things have been slow. We're always told it's about to accelerate like crazy. That may be true. In some ways, I hope that's true, but if one was simply extrapolating from the last 40 to 50 years, perhaps the default is that we should be more worried about the lack of automation than excess automation.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Oh, that's really interesting.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah. Again, I think if we had this sort of runaway automation, you could get to 3%, 4% GDP growth, and at 3% to 4% GDP growth, we can solve these problems socially.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>You would be willing to have... This thing that I've been talking to Andrew Yang about has been the idea of hyper-capitalism, which is a deregulated hyper-capitalism where you can do more experimenting, more playing, coupled to some kind of hyper-socialism where you recognize that the median individual might not be able in the future to easily defend a position needed for family formation.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, let me rephrase this a little bit. You're not going to get a conversion experience on your first podcast here, Eric.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>You're going to make me wait for the next?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Maybe, or maybe even a little longer than that too. But I would say if we can get the GDP growth back to 3% a year on a sustainable basis-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Without fudging.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>... without fudging, without lying about productivity numbers, et cetera, then there will be a lot more room for various social programs. I wouldn't want them to be misdirected in all sorts of ways, but there would be a lot of things that we could do. And I would be very uncomfortable starting with the social programs without the growth. That's the sort of conversation that I often see happening in Silicon Valley, where we start with UBI, because we're lying about automation. If automation's happening, then we'll see in the productivity numbers, and then eventually, maybe we need something like UBI. If automation is not happening and you do UBI, then you just blow up the economy.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right. I should say, and you've come somewhat towards-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Doing them in parallel, I'm okay with that. I'm not not okay with starting with the socialism. Even a Marxist wouldn't believe this. Even a Marxist thinks you have to first get the capitalists to do things before you can redistribute stuff.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right. I know.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You can't start with the redistribution before we've done the automation.</p><h2>Redistribution</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I'm not even a Marxist, Peter, but the thing that I was going to say is that as you talk about the fact that we can solve some of these problems socially, I want to talk about from the progressive side, I'm not interested in using social programs where markets continue to function. I mean, the idea of making people personally accountable for their own happiness and their own success and path through the world is incredibly liberating, and I view markets as providing most of the progress that we now enjoy. So, there is something that's very weird and punitive about the desire for redistribution. I mean, there's almost a desire to tag the wealthy that has nothing to do with taking care of the unfortunate, and what I really am talking about here is how do we get a conversation between left and right, which isn't cryptic, which isn't-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah. Of course, I have a much more cynical view of this where I think the redistribution rhetoric, it's mainly not even targeted at the wealthy.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Oh, it's targeted at the sub-wealthy.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>It's targeted at the lower-middle class, at the deplorables, or whatever you want to call them, and it's a way to tell them that they will never get ahead, nothing will happen in their life and, and that's actually why a lot of people who are lower-middle class or middle class are viscerally quite strongly opposed to welfare, because it's always an insult to them. It's always heard as an insult. I'm not sure they're wrong to feel that.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, and I feel that a lot of the talk about redistribution is actually families of high eight through eleven figures trying to figure out how to target families of six-figure through low eight-figure wealth as the targets of the redistribution, that the very wealthy will be able to shelter assets and protect themselves or maybe even switch nations, whereas people who are dentists and orthodontists and accountants are going to be the ones viewed as the rich, who are going to be incapable of getting themselves out of the way. </p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, I think that partially, what good faith conversation between left and right opens up is that we have a shared interest in uncovering all of the schemes of the people who enjoy pushing around pieces of paper and giving speeches in order to engineer society for their own reasons.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah. So, one way I would restate what you just said would be that redistribution from the powerful to the powerless, from the rich to the poor, is like from the powerful to the powerless, and so using power to go after those with power, and that's almost oxymoronic.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It's almost oxymoronic.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>It's almost self-contradictory. So, there may be some way to do that. I think most of the time you end up with with some fake redistribution, some sort of complicated shell game of one sort or another. I know the causation of the stuff is much, much trickier, but if we look at societies that are somehow further to the left on some scale, the inequality, you have to go really far to the left, and maybe just destroy the whole society, before you really start solving the inequality problem. </p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>California, when I first moved here as a kid in 1977, would have been sort of a centrist state in the US politically, and was broadly middle class. Today, California's the second most democratic state. It's a D plus 30 state. It's a super unequal, and at least on a correlated basis, not causation, but at least on a correlated basis, the further to the left it's gone, the more unequal it's become, and there is something pretty weird about that.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>There is.</p><h2>Political Violence</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Something that sort of fits in here is that, in part I've learned from you, and you can tell me whether you recognize this formulation or not, is start with any appealing social idea. That's step one. Step two, ask what is the absolute minimal level of violence and coercion that would be necessary to accomplish that idea. Now add that to the original idea. Do you still find your original idea attractive? This flips many of these propositions into territory where I suddenly realized that something that people see as being very attractive actually can only be accomplished with so much misery, even if it's done maximally efficiently, that it's no longer a good idea. This has been very influential in my thinking, and what I've-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah, look. The visceral problem with communism is not its redistributed tendencies. It's the extreme violence. It's that you have to kill tons of people. One of the professors I studied under at Stanford, René Girard, was a sort of of great philosophical, sociological, anthropological thinker, and he had this observation that he thought communism among Western intellectuals became unfashionable. You could date it to the year 1953, the year Stalin died, and the reason was they were not communist in spite of the millions of people being killed. They were communist because of the millions of people who were being killed. As long as you were willing to kill millions of people, that was a tell, a sign that you were building the utopia, you were building a great new society, and when you stopped, it was just going to be like the lethargy of the Brezhnev era or something like that, and that that was not inspiring. I mean, people shifted from Stalin to Mao or Castro, but the violence was charismatic, very charismatic, but then also, if you think about it, it's very undesirable.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It's so fascinating that we actually finally get to something like this. I think that that is a correct description of part of the communist movement, but not all of the communist movement. There were a lot of people, I think, and just my own family was certainly involved in far-left politics, and some of it probably dipped into communism. What my sense of it was is that there was a period in the '30s where people realized that there had to be coordinated social action, and that there were people who were too vulnerable, and that that somehow got wrapped up in all of the things that Stalin was talking about that sounded positive if you didn't know the reality.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, for example, Paul Robeson, a hero of the left, was extolling Stalin's virtues openly. My guess is that he didn't fully understand what had happened, that he had gotten involved in an earlier era, and that as things became known and progressed, there was a point at which many people suddenly opened their eyes and said, \"I've been making excuses for the Soviet Union,\" because at least it had the hope... I mean, there were American blacks, for example, who moved to Moscow because of the hope that it was going to be a racially more equal society. My own family, I would say, was talking about interracial marriage and open support of homosexuality, female access to birth control. Those things were associated with the communist party, and a lot of those ideas are now commonplace, but we forget that once upon a time only the communists were willing to dance with these things.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes. I don't want to make this too ad hominem, but I want to say that people like your family, were likely very intelligent people, were somehow still always the useful idiots, and there was no country where the communists actually came to power where people like those your family actually got to make the decisions.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Somehow, maybe there were indirect ways that it was helpful or beneficial in countries that did not become communist, but in countries that actually became communist, it didn't actually ever seem to work out for those people.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I definitely think that there was some sense that they were fooled and duped in this situation, but by the same token, not wanting to make this too ad hominem, as a gay man, I think that a lot of your rights would have been seen much earlier by the communists who were earlier to that party. I think that to an extent, some of the things that we just take for granted as part of living in a tolerant society were really not found outside, and so if you were trying to dine in a la carte, maybe you could take something from the commie buffet, you could take something from the anticommunist buffet, and you could steal a little from regular party politics. Of course, the Dixiecrats were not exactly the most racially progressive group in the world. Things were very different, and there was no clear place to turn.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah, it's always easy for us to judge people in the past too harshly, so I think that's a good generalization. I would say that there's something about the extreme revolutionary movements that always seem to be... From my point of view, the violence was always too much, and it's a package. It's a package deal, but I don't like the violence part of the package, and that's the part that, at the end of the day, makes me think the package would not have been worth it.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, what I would like to do is to take a quick break, and I would like to come back on exactly this point, because it's the point where I feel that perhaps you are least understood by the outside world in terms of what we've been talking about, both growth and progress on the one hand, and violence on the other. So, when we come back, we'll pick it up with Peter Thiel. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Thanks.</p><p>[break]</p><h2>Growth vs Violence</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Welcome back to The Portal. I'm here with my friend and employer, Peter Thiel, for this, our inaugural interview episode, and we've just gotten to a point which I hope people who've been tracking your career, your books, your thought process are going to find interesting, because I think it's the thing that if I had to guess, would be the thing that people least understand about you, or maybe they have wrong the most. Ever since I've known you, your focus has weirdly been reduction of violence across a great number of different topics at a level that I don't think has leaked out into the public's understanding of you and what causes you to make the choices you make. How do you see growth as attached to reduction of violence?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I think that it's very hard to see how anything like the kinds of societies we have in Western Europe, the United States, could function without growth. I think the way sort of a parliamentary republican democracy works is you have a group of people sitting around the table, they craft complicated legislation, and there's a lot of horse trading, and as long as the pie's growing, you can give something to everybody. When the pie stops growing, it becomes a zero sum dynamic, and the legislative process does not work. So, the sort of democratic types of parliamentary systems we've had for the last 200, 250 years have mapped on to this period of rapid growth. We had sort of a very bad experiment in the 1930s where the growth stopped, at least from the economic sense, and the systems became fascist or communist. It doesn't actually work.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, I suspect that if we're in for a period of long growth <em>[Ben: I think Peter here means “a period where growth is a long way away”]</em>, I don't think our kind of government can work. I think there is a prospect of all sorts of forms of violence, more violence by the state against its citizens. There may be more zero sum wars globally, or there may be other ways things are super deformed to pacify people. So, maybe everyone just smokes marijuana all day, but that's also kind of deformed. But I think a world without growth is either going to be a much more violent or a much more deformed world. And again, it's not the case that growth simply solves all problems. So, you can have very rapid growth, and you can still have the problem of violence. You can still have bad things that can happen, but that's our only chance. Without growth, I think it's very hard to see how you have a good future.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>You have to know that there is a version of you that exists in the minds of pundits and the commentariat that just loves to paint you as if you were a cartoon villain, and I always think that for those people who are actually confused about you, as opposed to those who wish to be confused about you, it says, if you're looking through a window and they're looking at the reflection in the window, not understanding what it is that you're focused on, why do you think it is that almost nobody sees your preoccupation with violence reduction?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>It's hard for me to come up with a good answer to these sort of sociological questions. I think people generally don't think of the problem of violence as quite as central as I think it is. I think it's a very deep problem on a human level. If you think of sort of this mimetic element to human nature where we copy one another, we want the things other people want, and there's a lot of room for conflict, and that if it's not channeled very carefully, a violent conflict in human relationships, in human societies, between human societies, and this is sort of, I think, a very deep problem. It’s sort of Christian anthropology, but you also have the same in Machiavelli or... There are sort of a lot of different traditions where human beings are, if not evil, they're at least dangerous. I think the sort of soft or anthropological biases that a lot of people have in sort of late modernity or in the enlightenment world are that humans are by nature good, they're by nature peaceful, but that's not the norm. So, that might be sort of a general bias people have, is that people can't be this violent. It's not this deep a problem. It's a problem other people have. There's some bad people who are violent, but it's not a general problem.</p><h2>Jewish Culture in Germany</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I didn't know you when I was young, and this feels like a lifelong friendship that got started way late in my life. One of the things that that kind of was surprising to me is that my coming from a Jewish background, your coming from a German background, I think both of us were sensitized by the horrors of World War II, which obviously, the problem for the Jews is very clear, but the fact that Germany never really recovered its proud intellectual traditions that had gotten bound up in a level of mechanized and planned violence is a decimation of a great intellectual tradition.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>One of the things we've talked about in the past is whether the twilight of living memory of the Holocaust should be used for some more profound German/Jewish reconciliation, that these are two communities that have held somewhat similar thought processes from the perspective of mimetic competition. Maybe there was a problem, that they were doomed to run into each other, but that in some sense, there are two wounds that need to be healed now that all of the original participants are either quite elderly or gone. Do you think that that is informing our conversation?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I think there's certainly an element of that between the two of us. I think that there's probably a degree to which the history was so traumatic that that people still understate this aspect. There was something about late 19th century, early 20th century Germany where the Judaism was better integrated into the society than in many other places, and there was something very synergistic, very generative about that, and then getting at all these ways that it was lost are very, very hard to do.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>It's the sort of social democratic response to the Hitler era and the Holocaust was sort of radically egalitarian. It's everybody's equal, you shouldn't kill people, everybody's equally valuable, and yet, in some ways, Hitler killed the best people. So, there's a way in which the social democratic response to what happened doesn't even come up to the terrible thing that happened. So, in an egalitarian society, well, we don't have quite as many people. We're all equal. Nothing's really changed, but, well, maybe you have no Jewish people left in Germany, and there's a lot less dynamism in the society as a result, and that's something that people still can't say in Germany because that's-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Is that right? You feel like it's...</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You know, if I say it, people won't contradict it or anything, but it's sort of profoundly uncomfortable. So, I think there is a sense that there's sort of all these strange ways that Germany is still under the shadow of Hitler. Even the ways that people are trying to exercise Hitler, in some ways, have deformed the society where you can't go back to the things that worked incredibly well in pre-World War I Germany. There was probably a lot that was unhealthy and wrong with it, too, but yeah, there's a sense that something very big has been lost, and there probably are a Jewish version of this that one could articulate as well, but yeah, I think there's something about the synergy that's very powerful and that's quite missing.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, from my side of the fence, I was just listening on NPR to a description of Fiddler on the Roof being put on by Joel Grey in Yiddish, and the sound of Jewish Middle High German, there's something about it that is shocking in today's era. So, there's been a Jewish loss. I felt this a couple of times. I avoided, to be honest, going to Germany because I didn't want to run into old people and wonder where they had been, but eventually, at Soros’ invitation, found myself at a conference in Berlin, and when I checked in to the hotel, I heard my last name pronounced in impeccable German, and it was both a horrible feeling and a wonderful feeling, like somehow, weirdly, something was home. I went to a restaurant near Checkpoint Charlie with my wife, and I was missing a fork, and the person spoke no English, and I remembered from some old story of my father, and I asked for a gopl, which I guess is the Yiddish for fork, and it was close enough, and somebody brought me a fork. By uttering a word that I-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Gabel.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Gabel? Okay.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>By going through that exercise, I found that when this fork was brought to me, I realized that there was some part of my experience, in fact, that was missing, that this uncomfortable relationship, which my grandfather, when we went through Israel, driving north to south, was singing Leider. I mean, German was the language of the culture. It was the language of the intellectual, and that never left him. So, I think that weirdly, this is the first time, because I think it'll be too late if we wait for 20 more years, because there will be no one to remember, but that there is some opportunity to recognize a dual wound.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah. No. Yeah. I think the challenge on the Germany side is that it's sort of... I had somewhat of a idiosyncratic background here where I was born in Germany, but we emigrated when I was about a year old, and we spoke German at home and lived in Africa, in Namibia were I went to a German-speaking school, but it was very different, I think, from the general post-World War II German experience, and so there are all these things that I can see from the outside looking into Germany that I think are... I still have a connection to it in sort of all of these ways, visited it as a child many times, and it's something that I connect with, and then it's obviously super different, and the contrast of Germany and California I always like to give is that California is optimistic, but desperate, and Germany is pessimistic, but comfortable. But from a Californian perspective, the incredibly deep pessimism is really, really striking, and even on that one dimension, I think Jewish culture is super different.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And I feel like Jewish culture is, in part, starting to attenuate that we don't feel... I mean, this is crazy talk, but we never thought that there was anything positive about antisemitism, and obviously it's not a positive thing, but there were positive externalities in that it allowed us to push ourselves very, very hard because we always knew that we weren't going to get a fair shake and that at any moment you might need to flee to someplace that was less dangerous, and I feel that as we've become comfortable, we've lost some of the dynamism, which is a hard thing to admit, but I do think that that is in part true, and I see this in Germany. Germany's intellectual contribution was so profound that nothing post-World War II seems to suggest the same nation. I think that that loss is a profound loss, not to Germany, but to the entire world.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes, and of course, one of the challenges is we can sort of describe these things, we can speculate on some of the causal things. I think it's somehow, we don't want to go back. We can't go back-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Can't, and don't want to. I agree.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, yeah, there is a history, and I think something's been lost in both Germany and in Jewish culture, and how one reconstitutes this is... Even if we can convince people of the causes and the losses, what you actually do about it is, is super hard to say and that's, that's sort of always the strange dynamic of this.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Something I'd be open to us working on at some future point if we can find the time, but let me switch gears slightly and come back a little bit to the violence point. </p><h2>Preference Falsification</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>But one of the things that I think has become kind of interesting in our relationship is that a certain class of theories that are not popular in the general population are traded back and forth between us, partially around the idea of how do we restart growth, how do we avoid violence?</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And I wanted to sort of alert people who are interested in the portal concept to this idea of orphaned or unpopular theories that are traded among a few but maybe not are among the many. So if we could go through a few of these, one of them has to do with how you and I both, we're much more, I think we believe that Trump was much more likely to get elected, than the general population did.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And this has to do with the theory of preference falsification, that people will broadly lie about what their true preferences are, so they'll keep one set of public preferences, but a hidden set of private preferences. And then in our culture it gets revealed every four years where you kind of have a Schrodinger's cat experiment, you find out where the country actually is.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes, I felt this was a dynamic that was going on in all these strange ways in 2016 there was a dinner I had in San Francisco about a week before the election with a group of center right people. One of them was a very prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley, and he said, you know, I'm voting for Trump in a week, but because I'm in Silicon Valley, I have to lie. And so he was unusually honest about lying. And the way I lie is that I tell people I'm voting for Gary Johnson.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So he couldn't say that he was going to vote for Hillary Clinton. Like the facial muscles wouldn't work or something would go wrong. But Gary Johnson was sort of the lie that you could tell. And then if you actually look at what happened in the month before the election, the Gary Johnson support, you know, collapsed from I don't know something like six to two percent or whatever.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And as far as I can tell, all of that went to Trump. And the question one has to ask is were these people, you know, lying all along? Were they lying to themselves? Did they sincerely change their mind in the last month? Or some combination of that. But yeah, one sort of vehicle for this preference falsification was that you had a third party candidate who was sort of a gateway to the transition, this is what happened with Ross Perot, where the people went, you know, eventually went to Clinton in '92 or John Anderson in 1980. So that's been a sort of repeated and that's, I think that was one element of what was going on.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But then I think there were also all these aspects of, of the Trump candidacy, that people were super uncomfortable about polite society. And so one would, you know, that the preference falsification was somehow perhaps much greater than in many other past contexts. And so, you know, even the day of the election, the exit polls suggested that Trump was going to lose. And so there were still a two to three percent effect like this, literally the day of the voting.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I voted for Bernie in the primaries and I felt that both you and I had realized that the Clinton neoliberal story was a slow-motion, one-way ticket to disaster if it kept going on election after election. So that both of us recognized that we had to get off the trigger.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Of course, one of the complicated questions in all this is, you know, did people actually already sense this? And were they lying about this? So, like everybody was saying all the way throughout 2016, most of the people were saying, well, there's no chance that you know, Trump's going to win. This is absolutely impossible.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And I didn't really connect this before the election, but with 2020 hindsight, I wonder was the fact that everyone was clicking on the Nate Silver 538 statistical polling model site a few times a day, to reassure themselves that Hillary Clinton was still ahead, was going to win. Was that some sort of acknowledgement that on some, maybe subconscious or barely conscious level, people sensed that it wasn't really as done a deal as they were constantly saying.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, there's even a version of that question that I wonder about. You know, because there was something about the polling that took on this unusually iconic role in 2016, it was so important and there was no truth outside the polls. I remember there's, you know, one of the Democrat talking heads saying something like, you know, Republicans don't believe in climate change. They also don't believe in polls. That's why they're going to lose. And generally polls are right, but there was something about how all-important they were in 2016 that might've, been a tell that something was a little bit amiss.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, I think people knew, to my way of thinking. I think people knew that there was something very bizarre about this election. I think that the Bernie scare, that if the Democratic party hadn't ... been so skillful, in sidelining Bernie and where the party regulars were, you know, clearly backing Clinton, my sense is that it could well have been Bernie versus Trump and that would have been enough to say the neoliberal story is over.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So I think there was that fear that this was coming to an end. My sense of it was that the major reaction to Trump was sort of a class reaction. That it was you're rejecting the entire concept of an educated group that knows the right things to say. And you know, you're clearly sort of not the kind of person who should be in the Oval Office, much more than the issue of whether or not Trump was going to be a warmonger or turn the U S into a police state, which of course doesn't seem to have happened as of this moment in 2019.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>But I guess what my sense of it was is that people really were shocked. I was, because I live in a left-of-center universe, the day after-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>They certainly pretended to be shocked.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>No, there's no-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Look, I'll concede your point. They were pretty shocked.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>They were pretty shocked.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But you know, if, but I still have my question, why were they clicking on the Nate Silver site just a few times a day?</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>One version of it was, let's say even if Hillary trounced Trump, but it wasn't enough. That would be a scary thing, given what Trump had been built up to, which is a, you know, orange Hitler. You know, if you imagine that your country is supporting somebody who thinks all Mexicans are rapists and is going to take the country back to, you know, to the Middle Ages, it would be very disconcerting if such a person could get 20 percent of the vote.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So I think that the poll had its own significance. However, you know, I think that one of the things about preference falsification is that when you start to believe that this is a robust phenomenon, that all of the economic models that assume that your private preferences and public preferences are the same, you start to see the world very differently. And so this is one of the portals into an alternate way of seeing the universe so as not to get surprised by revolutions.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, it's always this question, in my mind, this question of preference falsification, the Timur Kuran theory is tightly coupled to this question of, you know, how intense is the problem of political correctness, where, you know, how much pressure is there on people to say things they don't actually believe? </p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And I always come back to thinking that the problem of political correctness in some sense is our biggest political problem. That, you know, we live in a world where people are super uncomfortable saying what they think, that it's sort of dangerous. And to use the Silicon Valley context, it's a problem that Silicon Valley has become a one party state. But there are two different senses in which you can be a one party state. One sense is that everybody just happens to believe this one thing, which you know ... is one thing.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And then the other one is in which 85 percent of people believe one thing and the other 15 percent pretend to. And you know, sort of like, it's a dynamic with super majorities where you know, in a democracy, we think 51 percent of people believe something, they're probably right if 70 to 80 percent believe something, it's almost more certainly right. But if you have 99.99 percent of the people believe something, at some point you shifted from a democratic truth to North Korean insanity.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And so there is, you know, there's a subtle tipping point where the wisdom of crowds shifts into something that's sort of softly totalitarian or something like that. So in my mind, it maps very much onto this question of, you know, the problem of political correctness. It's always hard to measure how big it is, you know, in a politically correct society. Of course, you know, we're just saying what we think. We all love Stalin, we all love Chairman Mao and, and maybe, you know, we're just singing these songs because we're all enthusiastic about it.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And I think, my read on it is that problem has gotten more acute in a lot of parts of our society over the last few decades.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Yeah. I think that's gotten, well, as you know, I started this whole intellectual dark web concept in part to create kind of a broad based and bipartisan coalition of people who are willing to speak out in public and take some risk. Speaking for a large number of people, I would never have understood how many people feel terrified to speak out if I hadn't done that. Because people come up to me all the time and say thank you for saying what I can't say at work. And then when I asked them, well, what is it that you can't say at work? It's absolutely shocking. Completely commonplace things, things that are not at all dangerous, not scary or frightening.</p><h2>Distraction Theories</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>One of the things I believe, and I don't know whether you're going to agree with this, is that, you start to understand that a lot of the people who are enforcing the political correctness suspect that they are covering up dangerous truths. So for example, if you believe that IQ equals intelligence, which I do not, I mean, let's just be honest about it. You're going to fear anything that shows variation in IQ between groups. If you don't believe IQ equals intelligence, if you believe that intelligence is a much richer story and that no group is that far out of the running, you're not terribly frightened of the data because you have lots of different ways of understanding what's happening. And also you generally find that the truth is the best way of lifting people out of their situation.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So I secretly suspect to be blunt about it, and this is kind of horrible, that a lot of Silicon Valley is extremely bigoted and misogynistic and it can't actually make eye contact with the fact that it's secretly thinks women aren't as good programmers. Where I happen to think, you know, fisherian equivalence suggests that males and females one protein apart, SRY protein, are not likely to be. I mean they might have different forms of intelligence and different forms of cognitive strengths, but if you don't actually worry too much about an intellectual difference, you'd be willing to have an intellectual conversation that was quite open about it. So maybe I can turn that around.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah, let me see. There's sort of a lot of different things I want to react to there. Yeah, I suspect that it's a distraction of sorts. You know, I think, I mean on this very superficial layer, we want to have debates, want to have debates on a lot of areas, a lot of, you know, hard questions and questions in science and technology and philosophy and religion, there're all these questions that I think it would be healthy to debate.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And there's a way in which political debates are sort of a low form of these questions. And there's one sense in which I think of these political questions as less important or less elevated than some of these others, but there's also a sense in which these questions about politics are ones that everyone can have access to. And so if you can't even have a debate about politics, you can't say you know, I like the man with the strange orange hairdo or I like the mean grandmother. If you can't even say that, then we've sort of frozen out discussion on a lot of other areas. And that's always one of the reasons I think that political correctness starts with correctness about politics. That when you aren't allowed to talk about that area, you've implicitly frozen out a lot of others that are maybe more important and you know, and where we're certainly not going to have a debate about string theory if we can't even have a common sense debate about politics or something like that.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I'm very sympathetic to this sort of distraction theory that, you know, that what's going on our society is like a psychosocial, magic, hypnotic magic trick where, you know, we're being distracted from something very important and political correctness, identity politics and maybe American exceptionalism, these various ideological systems, are distracting us from things. The thing I keep thinking of, the main thing it's distracting us from, is the stagnation and it's that there are these problems that we don't want to talk about in our society. It's possible it's also a way to distract us from bad thoughts that we have about people with the sort, you said.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But the one I would, I would go back to first is just that it's distracting us from dealing with problems. You know, the reason we have a newspeak, this sort of Orwellian newspeak in politics with these zombie politicians, you know Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush or whoever it might be, is that we're not supposed to talk about the real issues and maybe they have a bad conscience and they think they're bad people, but it's just, I think the primary thing is just too dangerous to talk about what's actually going on. They don't know what to do about it and better not talk about that.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Yeah. I think there's another take on it, which you know, if I'm honest about it probably originates from my side of the aisle, which is that I have a sense that if you believe that productivity and growth is over, you don't want to emphasize issues of merit because you don't really think that the merit is going to translate.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And so therefore all you can focus on, like you know, a board of a company, is just a bunch of slots at a trough. And so you have to make sure that every group has its slots at the trough, because it doesn't actually matter. The board isn't doing anything to begin with. And so it's only a question of receiving the wealth that is already there. And so I worry that that is, you know, I guess where I break with a lot of progressives is that I believe that most progress comes from progress, which is technologically led and informationally led, that the more we know and the more we can do, the more we can take care of people.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah. So, I mean, again, this is always maybe naive hope on my part or something like this. But I always think that when we can't talk about things, we can't solve them-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Exactly.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>... and that this is so, you know, maybe these are the calculations you make and this is, you know, this is the way we pat people on the head, even though they're never going to get ahead or something like that. But you know, it's never going to work. It's-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well at least let's go down swinging.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>... and eventually, and people aren't that stupid and they will eventually figure it out. And so that's sort of why I'm undermotivated to play that game.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Yeah, and I have to say that one of the things that I've learned from you is that it's one thing to have a contrarian position. It's another thing to hold it when the whole world starts hating on you.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>For example, I watched the world go from viewing removing Gawker as removing a nuisance, or worse that was threatening people selectively, to a concern, you know, about like First Amendment rights and silencing, you know, free speech. And you know, I do have the strong sense that people are willfully misinterpreting these actions that are necessary to sort of self correct in our society and are not being terribly honest. There's a lot of bad faith acting in our system at the moment.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But, I'm always like this, where I'm always quite hopeful that people realize there's a lot of bad faith acting and they discount this accordingly.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>They grow out of it.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I don't know how many of the people disagree with me on the support for Trump will be more open to it in five years or 10 years, and we'll see. On the Gawker matter, you know, I'm going to win that one. I think people understand that, when it gets criticized by people in the media who themselves are up against super challenged business models where they have to act in sociopathic ways to get clicks by their readers, that this is just the game they have to play. There's more of an understanding of this than you think, and therefore, you know, it's not quite what it looks.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I was extremely disturbed by Gawker a decade, decade and a half ago because I think it was a really powerful thing at the time where it worked because people didn't understand how it worked. It was this hate factory, the scapegoating machine, but people didn't see it as such. And because of that it was super powerful. Once you see how it works, once you understand it, it is less powerful. So, you know, even had I not succeeded in the litigation against Gawker, I think it would be a weaker version of that today. There are of course equally nasty things on the internet, but they're not as powerful because-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Or as well organized.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>...there's more transparency into the bad motives and people get it, and the hate factory only works when it's not perceived as such.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, I think that there is a way in which some of this stuff is slowing down because people are getting tired of the constant state of beheading, figuratively, of people via their reputation, that we've moved from honest physical violence into reputational and economic violence against people that are considered undesirable.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>But I think that like there's a story with both Gawker and Trump, which the rest of the world will never see. And I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't been working with you. In the case of Gawker, I don't think anybody even knows the story about how much you sweated the ethics internally of: How do I do this right? How do I make sure that I don't hurt anybody that I shouldn't be hurting? How do I make sure that this represents something narrow and not something broad? Which is a story so far as I know that hasn't been told.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And then there's the story with Trump where, I don't know if you remember this, when Trump won, you had a gathering at your house and you did not invite me, and I was so pissed at you that even though I was tooth and nail against Trump, and I remain really pretty close to a never Trumper. I knew why you did what you did. I knew that you felt that it was a reduction in violence and I think that you had theories that nobody believed at the time.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>If I look out at this world, out through these windows, Trump has not changed mostly day to day life except for the phenomena of Trump, but it's not, there isn't you know a policeman on every street corner with an automatic rifle. We're not in some sort of siege from the White House. And you said, I think much less is going to happen than people imagined and I think we're going to be in a much less interventionist mode than we were previously. And whether or not you were right or you're wrong. So far, I think you've been borne out to be right on both of those points. I knew that you had an idea that we had to shake things up or we were going to be in some very dangerous situation. </p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I had two speeches in 2016, one was at the Republican convention, one was at the Washington Press Club about a month before the election. And in both speeches, I underscored the ways in which I think Trump would represent a break from the interventionist, neoconservative, neoliberal foreign policies, that Bush 43, that Obama still continued and that Hillary was likely to, would have been likely to continue. And I still think that that's roughly what's happened. It's not been, you know, it's not been ... as far away from interventionism as I would like. But it's directionally, directionally that's happened.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And I think that, you know, I do think we're not going to go back to that on the Republican side, which is like a very important thing. We're not going to go back to the Bush foreign policy ever. That was an important thing. In the primaries, when, the republican primaries, when Trump spoke out against the Iraq war. That was, you know, that was a very important moment from my point of view. And I think, you know, we always think of the, I think one way to think of the President of the United States is that you're sort of the mayor of this country, but you're the dictator of the world because in the US your power is very limited. Outside the US you can do, you know, a great number of things. And that's why I think these foreign policy questions are actually, are very important ones in assessing the president.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well I guess my take on the great danger of Trump was that there were certain sorts of standards and agreed upon cultural aspects, which I've likened to the Oral Torah of the United States where the Constitution is our Written Torah. And my concern is that Trump has had an effect on degrading certain expectations where it does matter how one comports oneself as a president, maybe not as much as some of my friends would like to think.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And I do think that we needed some dynamism, but my concern is that it's going to be very difficult to recover from the kind of damage to our sense of what can and cannot be said and done. I did think that we needed to break out of our Overton window, if you will, on many topics. I would just, the way that Trump touched those was not comfortable for me.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah, I agree. There are certain ways in which president Trump does not act presidential in the way in which the previous presidents-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I agree that he's breached things that needed to be said.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>... but then maybe there's some point where it was too much acting and the acting was counterproductive. I think there is something extraordinary about how it was possible for someone like Donald Trump to get elected. And probably a useful question for people on both the left and the right would be to try to think about, you know, what the underlying problems were, what some of the solutions to that are. And you know, it's, I think the left or the Democrats, you know, they could, they can win. They can win in 2020 but they have to have more of an agenda than just telling the Republicans to hurry up and die, it has to be more than that, you know?</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>This is the thing that convinced me that I didn't get the Trump thing, which was, I was convinced that Trump was going to be such a wake up call that the Democratic party was going to, you know, go behind a closed door and say we cannot let this happen again. We have to look honestly at how he got beat, what this represents, what it means and what we're going to do next time.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And the idea that we were going to double or triple down on some of the stuff that didn't work never even occurred to me. I had no idea that that party was so far gone that it couldn't actually, you know, if you imagine that he's orange Hitler, you would think orange Hitler would be the occasion to think deeply and question hypotheses. And I really have been shocked at the extent to which that didn't happen. So maybe I got my own party wrong on that front. I didn't know that we were this far gone, but.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I think there's still a lot of time to do that. And I keep thinking that, you know, we are at some point where the distractions aren't going to work as well. You know, I think the big distraction on the left over the last 40, 50 years have been forms of identity politics where, you know, we don't look at the country as a whole. We look at parts of it and it's sort of been a way of, you know, I think obscuring these questions of stagnation.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Fair enough. And on the right?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I would say the right, the right wing distraction technique has been, I would say something like American exceptionalism- </p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>That’s interesting.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel:</strong> -which is this doctrine that the US is this singular exceptional country. It's so, so terrific, so wonderful. It does everything so incredibly well that you shouldn't ask any difficult questions, any questions at all. I think it, in theological or epistemological terms, you can compare it to the radical monotheism of the God of the Old Testament where it means that God is so radically unique that you can't know anything about him. You can't talk about God's attributes, you can't say anything about him whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And if the United States is radically exceptional, then in a similar way you can say nothing about it whatsoever. And there may be all these things on the ground that seem crazy, where, you know, we have people who are exceptionally overweight. We have subway systems that are exceptionally expensive to build. We have universities that are exceptionally sociopathic. I mean, you don't have the student debt problem in any other country. You know, we have trade regime that's exceptionally bad for our country, like no other country-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Firearms.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>... is as self destructive as this. There are all these things that we somehow don't ask. So I think exceptionalism somehow led to this country that was exceptionally un-self aware. And-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>That's very interesting.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>... that's and so, you know, there's greatness is adjacent to exceptionalism, but it's actually still quite different because many countries can be great and great is more, it's more a scale. And there's something you measure it against-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It's multi-variate.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>... whereas exceptional, it's just completely incommensurate with anything else. And I think that's gotten us into a very, very bad cul de sac.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And I think that there's a way in which that sort of exceptionalism has ended on the right. And there's been, we've moved beyond that. And I'm hopeful that in a similar way, the left will move beyond identity politics even though, right now it feels like the monster is flopping about more violently than ever, even though I think it might be its death throes, but maybe not.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Yeah. And it could be that it's gotten very strong or it could be on its last legs and it might as well go for broke. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Next and final post on Sunday will be <em>Stories of Progress</em>.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "\n\nIn the comments on yesterday's \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/somerville-housing-over-time\">post on Somerville building\nage</a> someone suggested census data for housing units could be\nhelpful.  I've now looked into it, but it's not great: Somerville\nseems to not have been submitting building permit data to the census\nuntil recently, and the way condo conversions are tracked overstates\ngrowth.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nInitially it does look good: we have B25001 \"Housing Units\"\nrepresenting estimates for how many housing units there are in various\nplaces, including Somerville.  Here's are the 1-year estimates from\nthe <a href=\"https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_1YR_B25001&amp;prodType=table\">ACS</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>year</th>\n<th>number</th>\n<th>margin of error\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2017</td>\n<td>36,788</td>\n<td>±1,952\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2016</td>\n<td>33,565</td>\n<td>±1,918\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2015</td>\n<td>32,226</td>\n<td>±1,849\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2014</td>\n<td>33,085</td>\n<td>±2,025\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2013</td>\n<td>34,375</td>\n<td>±2,187\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2012</td>\n<td>33,079</td>\n<td>±1,730\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2011</td>\n<td>32,794</td>\n<td>±2,086\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2010</td>\n<td>31,604</td>\n<td>±1,989\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2009</td>\n<td>30,198</td>\n<td>±2,047\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2008</td>\n<td>32,621</td>\n<td>±2,257\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2007</td>\n<td>32,903</td>\n<td>±2,401\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2006</td>\n<td>31,781</td>\n<td>±2,347\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2005</td>\n<td>33,627</td>\n<td>±2,901\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe methodology (<a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2010-2018/2018-hu-meth.pdf\">pdf</a>)\nsays the estimate comes from:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/housing-unit-estimate-methodology-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/housing-unit-estimate-methodology.png\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nA surprising thing to me, then, is that the reported margin of error\nis relatively consistent.  If we're starting with a decent estimate\nfrom the Census every ten years, and then adjusting it to try to keep\nit current, I would expect to see a low margin of error in 2010 (and\n2000) and then see it rise over the course of each decade.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnyway, since Somerville doesn't have many (any?) mobile homes we're\njust talking about New Construction and Housing Loss.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nFor New Construction they estimate based primarily on building permits:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/new-construction-estimate-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/new-construction-estimate.png\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBuilding permit numbers come from the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/construction/bps/uspermits.html\">Building\nPermits Survey</a> which claims to have data for 20,000\nmunicipalities.  Each one files form C-404 \"Report of Building or\nZoning Permits Issued and Local Public Construction\". The\ndocumentation (<a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/econ/bps/Documentation/placeasc.pdf\">pdf</a>)\nhas:\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nTwo sets of data are shown for each type of construction:\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Estimates with Imputation - includes reported data for monthly respondents and imputed data for nonrespondents.\n</li>\n<li>Reported Only - includes only reported data for respondents.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\nPulling out the data for Somerville (\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Bn5s76F8kRp5sb2OclelBjjNIju6JAM-995F_LN3rk/edit#gid=1917290716\">sheet</a>)\nthere are many years where \"estimated\" differs from \"reported\", which\nmeans Somerville was nor submitting the form every year.  Worse,\nthe data doesn't distinguish between \"they submitted the data and it\nwas zero\" vs \"they didn't submit any data\".  The \"reported\" data from\n2005-2014 is all zeros, so this does sound like failure to report.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIn 2015 we suddenly have 604 units reported, after a decade of zeros,\nand since that's ~3x higher than what we see in 2016-2018 I wonder if\nsome number of previous years of permits got reported all at once in\nthe 2015 data?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nMostly this makes me not trust the ACS housing units numbers here very\nmuch: it looks like they stayed flat for years because of missing data\nand then suddenly jumped up year over year because of perhaps a\nbacklog coming in.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere's also a problem with the way they calculate loss.  A lot of new\nconstruction in Somerville is replacing existing buildings, some of\nwhich are residential.  But loss is calculated extremely roughly:\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote> We calculate housing unit loss by applying an annual loss\nrate to the housing stock. Then, we add to that estimate the number of\nunits lost due to natural disasters. Housing loss rates are derived\nfrom the 2009 and 2011 American Housing Survey at the regional\nlevel. A unit is counted as lost if a survey was completed in 2009,\nbut it was listed as a non-response (Type C, 30 - Demolished) in the\n2011 survey.\n</blockquote>\n\nThis means that if the rate at which units are demolished and replaced\nchanges it will be picked up in the construction numbers but not the\ndemolition numbers and erroneously counted as an increase.  Looking at\nthe 2018 building permit survey numbers I see Somerville reporting 32\npermits for new 1-unit buildings, which sounds to me like condos.\nSince those were probably conversions from existing 2-3 unit\nbuildings, we're counting the added units but not the removed ones.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nOverall it does not sound like the ACS numbers are very useful.\nThey're missing a lot of data and what data they do have is unclear.\nI would love to have solid data on this, especially going back a long\ntime, but it still doesn't sound to me like that's been assembled.\n\n  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Epistemic Status: Unquestionably Accurate</p>\n<p>Football, like all sports, is better with someone to root for, and someone to root against. It’s us versus them. Ideally, it’s our house, because no one beats us in our house. That gives us a baseline heuristic – root, root root for the home team – if we can’t do any better. Luckily, we can do better. Not only are some teams objectively superior to others in their worthiness of our quest to be adjacently vicariously victorious, consistently rooting for the same teams is much more fun than choosing independently each time.</p>\n<p>With so many teams out there, it’s tough to untangle the right rank order of who to root for. Luckily, that’s where this post comes in. We will rank all the teams you might encounter, complete with explanations, so that not only will you know who you’ll be supporting, you’ll know <em>why </em>you’re supporting them.</p>\n<p>Before we start naming names, let’s go over some basic points.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Personal Connections</h3>\n<p>In any choice between tribes, <em>my</em><em> </em>tribe is better than all others. Your sports team is vastly inferior, that simple fact is plainly obvious to see. For these rankings, you get to enjoy my personal connections as a substitute for your own, since thinking is hard and exporting it is great. However, if you do have personal reasons to shoot a team or two all the way up (or down) the rankings, you should totally do that.</p>\n<p>That starts with your alma mater. Wherever you went to college, or your spouse or children or parents went to college, you’re mostly stuck with them. The question is <em>how much </em>you are stuck with them. Hardcore sticklers say that subject to special one-time exceptions like a child going off to school or moving across the country, you’re stuck with where you went to college. That would force me to make ‘my’ team the Columbia Lions, since technically the college constitutes players into uniforms on a regular basis, forming what they questionably call a ‘football team.’ By this theory, I should have thought of this problem before I opted into a league without any scholarships, and it’s my own damn fault for not getting into Stanford.</p>\n<p>My ruling that is in no way selfishly motivated is that Columbia isn’t good enough to count. Or good enough to anything else, really. I say that if you spent your college days exiled to Division II, or worse, than you have suffered enough. Any Power 5 team counts. Any Group of 5 team lets you also choose a Power 5 team to mostly embrace as well. And even if you have a Power 5 team, you can and should still have a favorite team from each other conference.</p>\n<p>I encourage those I know to bring in more personal connections in the comments, so I have more things to root for and against. Remember, they’re objective!</p>\n<h3>Be Unique</h3>\n<p>A unique team coach, name, tradition, strategic focus, mascot, uniform color, you name it. Personal connections and stories are even better. It’s all good, the more the better. A coach with a larger than life personality, who shapes his world in his image, is an amazing sight. Be yourself, like no one ever was.</p>\n<h3>Play to Win the Game, and Play it Right</h3>\n<p>Teams that aren’t trying to win dishonor the game and aren’t fun to root for. Teams that do everything they can to win honor the game and are fun. Especially important is to employ good strategy. Few things are worse than watching your team punt when it shouldn’t, or run when it can’t, or fail to know how to manage a clock.</p>\n<p>Thus, Tulsa gets a big boost from its coach that didn’t carry a punter on his roster because he ‘didn’t want to get into bad habits.’ Can’t help but root for a guy like that.</p>\n<p>The outer game counts, too. Managing your roster wisely, spending your money effectively, and trading effectively, are also to be admired. Billy Beane is a baseball guy but another exemplar of what you have to root for. Teams that overperform their recruiting abilities and budgets are great.</p>\n<p>If you know your clock management, if you have your advanced statistics mastered, if you do the best you can with the tools you are given, that’s big. Anyone <em>out-thinking </em>their opponents, anyone who <em>out-prepares, </em>deserves your support. An example of out-thinking would be tennis star Martina Hingis. She was a joy to watch because you could see her out-thinking her opponents every point.</p>\n<p>This also includes doing your basics. Train and demonstrate mental and physical toughness. Learn to block and tackle. Don’t commit procedural penalties or otherwise play sloppy. Be all in, make the most of what’s available, and do your job. Next man up.</p>\n<p>Note that none of this means taking the game or yourself too seriously. It’s a game! All games are to be taken seriously in an important sense, and totally not seriously in another important sense. And remember to…</p>\n<h3>Have Fun Out There!</h3>\n<p>Some teams use lots of fun traditions for themselves and their fans and understand that while you play to win the game, it’s also <em>a game. </em>Why so serious? My favorite example of this is Mets vs. Yankees in baseball. This is from a few years ago but I’d expect it works the same way today. You’d look over at the Mets bench and everyone would be joking and laughing. Look over at the Yankees bench and you’d see a bunch of joyless corporate sellouts in identical pinstripes. What’s the point in that?</p>\n<p>Johnny Damon started out playing baseball for the Boston Red Sox and no one had a bigger smile. Then he signed with the New York Yankees and I never saw him smile again during a game. Such a life mistake.</p>\n<h3>But Keep it Classy</h3>\n<p>It is vital to have class. If you have already won the game, take a knee or run the ball out. Piling on the points or padding your statistics is an insult to the game. If your players disrespect the game or themselves, sit them down. If they break the rules, punish them. Don’t pressure teachers or help them pass their classes. Definitely don’t cover up their failures or manipulate test scores.</p>\n<p>Ehatever you do, don’t sweep actual bad behavior like sexual assaults or violent crimes, be they by players or coaches, under the rug. Doing this systematically automatically makes you a villain while anyone involved remains at the school.</p>\n<p>Be respectful of your opponents. Say the right things in your interviews. Stay positive. There is an exception for special rivalries, where polarity reverses, but you get two, maybe three of these teams, tops. If your opponents get hurt, be respectful.</p>\n<p>If something goes wrong, take responsibility. Strive to do better. If something goes right, be gracious, share the credit, and highlight what the other team did right. If the other team does well, acknowledge their achievements. Elevate the game. Always be trying to bring everyone up, help them do better, learn better, be better inside and outside the game.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for the behavior of your fans in all of this. Enthusiasm is a positive, but you gotta keep it classy.</p>\n<p>Play clean. Cheating is right out. Angle shooting is almost as bad.</p>\n<p>Dodging strong opposition to try and game the playoff system, make a bowl game, or to generally make your life easier, is super lame and a big mark against you. Teams that are especially bad about this include most of the SEC, and this is marked with reference to these easy ‘cupcakes.’ Adding big games to your schedule, especially against historical rivals, is a big plus.</p>\n<p>We also strongly oppose <em>buying the game. </em>When you leverage your money advantage to sign free agents, that’s not to be admired. In college, that never happens, no sir, that’s against the rules, so it only happens all the time. Which means it’s now also <em>cheating, </em>and cheating is super bad. If you cheat, we hate you. This overrides playing great and striving for excellence.</p>\n<p>So for an example even non-sports people know, we all hate the New England Patriots.</p>\n<h3>Overperform and Keep it Interesting</h3>\n<p>Always root for the underdog, all things being equal. This both means the school or team that is an underdog in today’s game, and it means the school with fewer resources to devote to football. If you have less money to hire coaches, a smaller fan base and a less rich area from which you can recruit, and fewer traditions and other reasons for recruits to choose you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Overcoming that and still putting up a good fight is greatly to your credit.</p>\n<p>What is not to your credit is to be a sad sack in a division or conference that reliably runs you over. Even if it is, in some sense, ‘not your fault’ because of course you will play in the best place you can, and you don’t have the resources to do better, you are not putting a quality product on the field. The games are not interesting. Being a one touchdown underdog makes you the ideal hero. Being a four touchdown underdog makes you a cupcake. Why are we even watching, unless we’ve wagered on the game? It does mean that if you pull off the upset, you’re that much bigger of a hero, but such events are quite rare, and catching them in progress requires watching live, which is generally the wrong way to be watching games on Saturdays.</p>\n<h3>Ranking Tiers</h3>\n<p>There are seven tiers.</p>\n<p>Us – This is my team. There can be only one.</p>\n<p>Hero – Clear good guys who you want to do well unless there’s a strong reason why not.</p>\n<p>Friendly – You wish them well all things being equal, but not enough to care.</p>\n<p>Neutral – Teams you don’t care about either way. Probably decent chaps.</p>\n<p>Loyal Opposition – Rivals of your favorite teams, so you often want them to lose for strategic reasons, but you don’t have anything <em>against </em>them or anything.</p>\n<p>Villain – Actual bad guys. This can be for good reasons, or because you don’t like their stupid face. Or both. And who says their stupid face isn’t a good reason? Sports!</p>\n<p>Them – The most hated of them all. Like we, you only get one, so make it count.</p>\n<p>If you are a full tier higher than your opponent, then that is more important than other game factors like home team or favorite.</p>\n<p>It is <em>not </em>sufficient to be more important than the interests of a team that is more extreme than both of them. If you need a certain result to stop a villian or the dreaded <em>them, </em>or even more importantly to help us, then we wish to make it so unless the difference is <em>at least </em>two levels between the teams playing. How many levels are required depends on how big the outside stakes are. If a playoff birth or championship hangs in the balance, that takes priority over anything but us.</p>\n<p>The other factor that can cross levels is causing chaos. Football season is mayhem, and the more mayhem, the more fun. We come first, but beyond that, we’re happy to risk at least one level of rank in order to cause chaos, both in terms of the game today and in terms of which team makes it.</p>\n<p>If outside factors aren’t conclusive, and the two teams are in the same tier, then you look at who is at home and what the gambling odds are. You want to root for the home team, but also for the underdog. If the home team is an underdog, your job is easy, and a large home underdog (+7 or bigger) is enough to jump a tier that isn’t us or them. If the home team is the favorite, the break even point for me is the same as where the teams are equally good, at -3. At that or less, I stick with the home team by default. More than that, and it’s time to root for the upset. But if it’s close, then anything cool – a nice play or decision, a good story, or a whim – can override. Because why not?</p>\n<h4>Team by Team</h4>\n<p>If one conference was ‘my’ conference it would be the Big 10. But we respect the best. So we’ll start at the heart of the sport, with the SEC.</p>\n<h3>SEC</h3>\n<p>The SEC has been the best conference for a while, largely because they take themselves too seriously and have nothing better to do with their time. Every now and then the Big 10 claims to be better, and then they play football against each other.</p>\n<p>They call themselves the SEC because no one involved knows how to manage a diversified stock portfolio. They prefer cupcakes.</p>\n<p>The SEC slogan is ‘it just means more’ which is because everything else there means less. This focus on winning remains admirable.</p>\n<h3>SEC West</h3>\n<p>The SEC West is the strongest division, by far, in all of college football. It’s great to watch. In our ongoing root for chaos against order, we want them all to <em>either </em>crash and burn and take each other out, leaving everyone shut out of the playoffs and top placements, <em>or </em>for them to dominate so much that they threaten to take up multiple slots and drive everyone insane.</p>\n<p>Since the division is so good, we won’t gloss over anyone.</p>\n<h4>LSU</h4>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Hometown coach Ed Orgeron</p>\n<p>Also Good: Unique Yellow Uniforms, Great Division, Calls Stadium “Death Valley”</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Fan Entitlement</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Non-Unique Stadium Name (Clemson also has a “Death Valley”)</p>\n<p>Rank: Hero</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate the value of unique. Even yellow uniforms. Anything that makes you different is great. You want to play to your strengths and what makes you uniquely you. Coach Ed Orgeron is a great example of that, a hometown boy who is so obviously thrilled to be there and won the job by winning the hearts of the players. Kudos for going with that instead of bribing a top name from outside.</p>\n<p>If you don’t like games with very low scores, this might not be the team for you. I for one find it refreshing to win games without an offense.</p>\n<p>LSU has a long tradition of being a top-tier program, so there are constant calls to fire Ed just like there were constant calls to fire previous coaches. That’s a shame, but that’s also the job. In some ways it’s annoying. You have a top-25 team and you’re constantly mad about it. In other ways it makes them an underdog, because they’re in the same class and division as Alabama and Auburn and feel like they belong at that level.</p>\n<h3>Alabama</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Nick Saban and company do everything right.</p>\n<p>Also Good: Unique name with great slogan (“Roll Tide!”), history of admitting Jews when they were being kept out of the Ivy League, Great Rivalries and Divison</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: They also have infinite resources, so they win way too often. They certainly don’t need the cupcakes.</p>\n<p>Also Bad: I mean the games aren’t even close. There’s nothing to watch. They don’t even slow down late because their B team would be ranked in the top 25 most years.</p>\n<p>Rank: Hero</p>\n<p>Alabama has been dominant for a long time. As long as Nick Saban is their coach, this isn’t going to stop. The only reason other teams are competitive is that his former underlings learned how to do things right and are now in charge of the other good programs like Clemson and Georgia. Nick is pretty much the best. He cares about all the right things, says the right things, and gets properly angry when everything isn’t perfect.</p>\n<p>The problem is that rooting for a team that is favored in most of its games by multiple touchdowns is not all that exciting. Nothing wrong with an easy game every now and then, but often the first close game Alabama plays will be the Iron Bowl at the end of the season. Alabama losing is always a good chaos move. So they have hero rank, but you end up rooting against them often enough anyway.</p>\n<h3>Auburn</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Alabama needs a strong rival to keep things interesting, has pulled off some amazing upsets.</p>\n<p>Also Good: Good at making most of what they have, fan willingness to take on and fully hate a true juggernaut, coach Gus Malzhan is fun and wants it so bad and is always on the verge of getting fired, willingness to schedule strong PAC-12 teams.</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Willing to make compromises to win (see: Cam Newton).</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Keep blowing their chance to cause real chaos recently by losing late, sense of entitlement.</p>\n<p>Rank: Loyal Opposition</p>\n<p>Auburn does not appear to maintain rigorous academic or other off-the-field standards for its athletes. That is not great, but the difference between them and most other programs is mostly that they were less subtle about it. So I’m willing to not make a big deal out of it, given how much there is here to love. Auburn creates a lot of great games and keeps them interesting. That’s what the loyal opposition lives for.</p>\n<h3>Mississippi</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Refuge in team name audacity</p>\n<p>Also Good: Cheering up the less fortunate</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: They are literally called the Rebels</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Spelling difficulty</p>\n<p>Rank: Villains</p>\n<p>Naming your team after a rebellion against the United States, and in favor of enslaving fellow human beings, is quite the bold move, yet given the location, it seems to fly under the radar. I’m kind of impressed. And it’s not without its advantages. Having people to root against with no regrets is always nice.</p>\n<h3>Mississippi State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: More cowbell</p>\n<p>Also Good: Surprisingly competitive, team is not called the rebels, legacy of Dan Mullen</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Stayed in Mississippi a day too long</p>\n<p>Also Bad: The name ‘Egg Bowl’</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>Mississippi State has been entertaining lately, putting up fights in games that were expected to be snooze fests, and doing so while making correctly bold in-game decisions. It’s hard not to root for that. With coach Dan Mullen moving on to Florida, they will presumably slip back from Friendly to Neutral status, as they don’t naturally give someone like me much other reason to root for them.</p>\n<h3>Texas A&amp;M</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: The 12th Man</p>\n<p>Also Good: Strong tradition and willingness to spend what it takes, getting it done as an ‘A&amp;M’ school, creating wizardly quarterbacks</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: What they spent a lot of that on, the 0th Man, Jimbo Fisher</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Feels like it should still be in the Big 12</p>\n<p>Rank: Villain</p>\n<p>Strong traditions and student enthusiasm are pretty great. They’re what the sport is all about, so despite jumping ship on the Big 12 into what seemed like clearly the wrong conference, there was a lot left to like. Then they hired Jimbo Fisher. When you hire Jimbo Fisher, you make it clear that it’s whether you win or lose, rather than how you play the game. This should lead to an even stronger SEC West and even more exciting football, but it also gives us a villain to root against.</p>\n<h3>Arkansas</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Watching people leave good jobs to come here and fail thanks to completely unrealistic expectations</p>\n<p>Also Good: Watching people’s reactions to those failures, Arkansas has a little town called hope</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: At some point constant failure stops being interesting</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Their defense, and their offense, at least in divisional context</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>If you get the opportunity to hire someone great, you take it. I can’t hold that against you. You’re supposed to do that. So when Arkansas finds itself with a big budget and over-sized expectations and opposition, but without good help, naturally it will come for those we love. Then those people take the job, and we’ll hate <em>them, </em>because they abandoned us, sure. But it’s not like Arkansas is paying huge money for scoundrels and buy success – that’s (among many others) Texas A&amp;M. Arkansas is merely trying to keep pace and stay afloat. So I’m fine with it, but it’s not something interesting enough to root for.</p>\n<h3>SEC East</h3>\n<p>The SEC East is a pale shadow of the SEC West this past decade, as many of its teams have been down for quite a while. They used to be someone.</p>\n<h3>Florida</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: New head coach Dan Mullen</p>\n<p>Also Good: The chomp and the swamp, strong rivalries</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Long history of ugly-ass football</p>\n<p>Also Bad: We remember Tim Tebow. Also Urban Meyer.</p>\n<p>Rank: Loyal opposition</p>\n<p>Historically Florida has been a clear source of scum and villainy. Their games were an insult to the sport. Then there’s that Tim Tebow guy, and that Urban Meyer guy. So this wasn’t a hard call. Dan Mullen being given enough real resources to make a difference forces us to rethink all that. We now have a team that goes for it, that tries to do exciting things, that aspires to that which it should be. Their rivals are other Florida teams that we hate, so that’s always a big plus. Legacy matters, so there’s a lot of ground to make up for, but at least this is a beginning. I <em>wanted </em>to root for them rather than simply against Miami in the season opener, but the legacy and being too obvious a favorite made it hard. We’ll see.</p>\n<h3>Kentucky</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Basketball season</p>\n<p>Also Good: Good defense, surprising ability to slog through on occasion</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Football season</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Long history of ugly-ass football</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>It is charming to see a team like Kentucky try to grab for the brass ring, despite lacking in the talent or ability to score points usually associated with such aspirations. Perhaps their other sports accomplishments are rubbing off on them. If they can make their methodology less ugly, they can maybe be a team we can root for in this context. For now, they remain the essence of neutrality.</p>\n<h3>Tennessee</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Payton Manning</p>\n<p>Also Good: Bold color choice, potential redemption story, expectations</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Have not tried that hard to hire Payton Manning</p>\n<p>Also Bad: The team, realistic expectations</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>You see the story all over the country. A once proud team humbled by years of failure, whose coaches are held to the standards of glory days. In this case, I can be more sympathetic, because I’m a sucker for the bright orange uniforms, and because there’s something Shakespearean about the drama here that I don’t feel in most of the other places. Anything in sports worth doing <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/more-dakka/\">is probably worth overdoing</a>. I’ve also always been a fan of famous alumni Payton’s, as I am with most smartest guys on the field acting as their own head coaches, and also because he’s hilarious. Can we please get him to take the job?</p>\n<h3>Vanderbilt</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: A letter all to themselves</p>\n<p>Also Good: Feels unique in ways it probably isn’t, but every bit helps</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Contextual non-entity</p>\n<p>Also Bad: I can never be motivated to remember where they are</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>This is the essence of a neutral team. Conferences and divisions cannot simply kick out teams that don’t perform for a while, so they’re stuck with them. But without a chance to watch them or worry they might win something, there’s nothing to go on, and they don’t do much to try and change that.</p>\n<h3>Missouri</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: A new media market for the SEC</p>\n<p>Also Good: Some cause that got people to protest, probably</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Whatever they were protesting against, probably</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Duplicate team name, also most hot takes on the protests, probably</p>\n<p>Rank: Loyal opposition</p>\n<p>I mention the protest, despite it being a while ago and not knowing any of the details or ‘facts’, because there isn’t much else to go on. Nothing seems salient, and I can’t give them points for those uniforms because they’re pretty ugly. Given I can’t care about them enough, it wouldn’t be right to send them all the way to villain status just for that, so I’ll settle for one rank removed and still be able to back them when there’s important work to be done.</p>\n<h3>Georgia</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Great product on the field</p>\n<p>Also Good: Great coach name in Kirby Smart, feels iconic, great rivalries</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: No tech</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Actual bulldogs</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>Kirby Smart learned from the best (and by the best, we mean Nick Saban) which is how one has the potential to compete with Alabama. Then he went ahead and did his job, week after week, year after year. The issue with Georgia is that, unlike their in-state rival, they have no tech. Georgia just assembles a strong recruiting class and then does solid things with them over and over again, and hopes that is good enough. It never feels like there’s a story behind it. That keeps them out of the top tier, but there is no reason to be unfriendly with a team that has made the competitive landscape much more interesting. Thanks mostly to Georgia, every SEC championship game has the potential for chaos.</p>\n<h3>South Carolina</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Easily outshines North Carolina</p>\n<p>Also Good: Can take a repeated beating and keep on ticking, I suppose</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Picked a much harder rival than North Carolina</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Nothing especially inspiring or interesting</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>Should they still have the right to the name South Carolina, or should they have to do a name swap? Officially, you never lose that right, so they get to keep using it indefinitely. We all know the truth. Then again, I live very close to New York University and we don’t even field a team, so it could be much worse.</p>\n<h3>The Big 10</h3>\n<p>The Big 10 is the division that thinks it is every bit as good as the SEC, and manages to periodically fool those making the rankings, only to end up playing games. At that point, people figure out that there are some minor speed, power and skill issues.</p>\n<p>They call themselves the Big 10 because they have fourteen teams.</p>\n<p>The Big 10 slogan is “Big Stage, Big Life, Big 10.” This has something to do with marching bands, including a member of the Rutgers band whose instruction for the big ad selling the conference was something like “act like a deer in headlights that has no idea what to do now that it’s in the conference to pick up a major media market.”</p>\n<p>The Big 10 is ‘my’ conference of choice, because it contains the greatest hero (aka my team) and the sport’s greatest villain, is relatively local, and reliably delivers interesting games. Also, as evidenced by the ad, the whole conference has high academic standards and are generally giant dorks. So they’re my kind of people.</p>\n<p>The SEC puts as many good teams as possible in the West. The Big 10 balances this by putting all its good teams in the East. It’s only fair.</p>\n<h3>Big 10 East</h3>\n<h3>Ohio State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: No longer employs Urban Meyer</p>\n<p>Also Good: Honest about <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/ohio-states-third-string-quarterback-aint-come-to-play-5949274\">not coming here to play school</a>, makes Michigan cry yearly</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Everyone involved is a known giant douchebag</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Cheating, bribing, covering up scandals, complete lack of class, not here to play even a little school, get playoff spots they don’t deserve, always overrated, incidentally keeps getting in our way</p>\n<p>Rank: Them</p>\n<p>When I was experimenting with daily fantasy sports, my partner in the enterprise was a Cleveland native. As their professional teams continued to suffer, as they often do, it was easy to share my sympathies. I could tell he was often in physical pain. Even he agreed without prompting that Ohio State are a bunch of giant douchebags. They’re the classic sports movie bad guys you love to hate. We can all agree these are horrible human beings engaged in a profane enterprise. Which is how our country can finally come together.</p>\n<h3>Michigan</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Supererogatory levels of hatred towards Ohio State</p>\n<p>Also Good: Watching offense fail to come together, watching coach Jim Harbaugh suffer, play in the literal Big House</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: #YouHadOneJob</p>\n<p>Also Bad: …and you screwed it up.</p>\n<p>Rank: Loyal opposition</p>\n<p>Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is in pain. All great football coaches are constantly in pain, but Jim takes it the extra mile. He is quite invested in Michigan football, and it’s great to see how much he cares. That’s especially true when he lets us all down, as he is wont to do. He is very good at some aspects of the game, like creating a strong defense, but not at others, and seems destined to usually fall short. Lucy will keep pulling the football away, and we’ll all enjoy see it coming. And while we didn’t want Ohio State to win, we still have our solace. Michigan also often stands in our way, which makes it extra easy to not feel the least bit bad for them.</p>\n<h3>Penn State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Closest actually good team to New York</p>\n<p>Also Good: White outs, choice of enemies, resilience in the face of…</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Oh, yeah, THAT.</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Saquon Barkley being picked second, choking repeatedly on big leads when it matters</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>So, yeah. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_child_sex_abuse_scandal\">That happened</a>. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and sometimes people care more about winning and keeping up appearances than anything else. I still don’t have a great model for how someone can both take great care to make sure their students get educations off the field instead of focusing too much on the sport, and also look the other way while their assistant rapes kids. The question then becomes, how much do we hold the past against Penn State, versus note that all the people responsible are gone, and celebrate the new wave’s resilience in the face of adversity. As always in sports, the right answer is to observe what you’ve already decided the answer to be. In this case, I notice I don’t have one reliable answer, but seem to settle around neutral when I think about rank order inside the division.</p>\n<h3>Michigan State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: This. Is. Sparta.</p>\n<p>Also Good: Making a lot out of a little year in and year out, being the hero we need</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Zero sense of humor</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Frequent total inability to move the ball</p>\n<p>Rank: Heroes</p>\n<p>All teams choose a name and wrap that name up in tradition. Few truly live the name in full spirit. The Michigan State Spartans go the extra mile. Each year they battle richer city states that have every advantage, using the fuel of pure determination and toughness. Usually they make it far closer than it has any right to be. Often they emerge victorious. You have to tip your cap to such efforts, and hope they can laugh about it after graduation.</p>\n<h3>Indiana</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Giving us the everlasting gift of Lee Corso</p>\n<p>Also Good: Pavilion named for John Mellencamp, and of course <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091217/\">Hoosiers</a>.</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Can’t compete in our hearts with that kid from Purdue</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Memorial Stadium is kind of a downer, never playing a man short</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>There is not much to say about Indiana. They do their best to put a respectable product on the field, with mixed success. Someone has to fill out the conference and ensure access to geographically adjacent major media markets, so it might as well be them. It certainly can be a lot worse, as the next two teams will demonstrate, and Lee Corso makes me smile weekly to this day despite clearly no longer playing with a full set of scholarships, but it has been a long time since they’ve done something interesting.</p>\n<h3>Maryland</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Theoretical access to the Washington, DC media market for the Big 10 network</p>\n<p>Also Good: Messing with Texas, hopefully solid academics</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Claiming to be a member of the Big 10</p>\n<p>Also Bad: The team</p>\n<p>Rank: Loyal opposition</p>\n<p>Maryland being added to the Big 10 was an unadulterated money grab. The conference could have had their pick of high quality teams to take competition to the next level. Instead, they made a play to force open a major media market, on the theory that cable networks would not be able to refuse to include games of a local team getting cut to ribbons by superior opponents, and to give the existing teams an easier route within the conference. Forever will this team be a black mark upon this otherwise fine collection of institutions.</p>\n<h3>Rutgers</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Theoretical access to the New York media market for the Big 10 network</p>\n<p>Also Good: Jon Finkel, surprisingly solid academics, not forcing people to say they graduated from “New Jersey University,” the look on that guy’s face in the marching band ad.</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: New Jersey</p>\n<p>Also Really Bad: Claiming to be a member of the Big 10, the team</p>\n<p>Rank: Villains</p>\n<p>Rutgers being added to the Big 10 was an unadulterated money grab. The conference could have had their pick of high quality teams to take competition to the next level. Instead, they made a play to force open a major media market, on the theory that cable networks would not be able to refuse to include games of a local team getting cut to ribbons by superior opponents, and to give the existing teams an easier route within the conference. Forever will this team be a black mark upon this otherwise fine collection of institutions.</p>\n<h3>Big 10 West</h3>\n<h3>Wisconsin</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: We. Are. Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>Also Good: Jump Around, everything about coach Paul Chryst, developing top running backs, having their own distinctive style, great fundamentals, rescuing innocent victims of New Jersey, Seth Burn, Gaudenis Vidugiris and a big shout out not only to all the alumni I know but to the whole Madison Magic community, and other neat stuff like that.</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Rolling over for Ohio State that time in the conference championship game, and losing all the other ones</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Quarterback play, accidentally overrating our running back talent in the NFL draft, our chances of covering large point spreads, not needing any stinking Badgers</p>\n<p>Rank: Us</p>\n<p>Wisconsin is my college football team. Don’t forget to jump around in your seat between the third and fourth quarters. When I speak of “we” I speak of Wisconsin. Should it also be your team? Perhaps, especially if you’d like to swing by my place to watch together every so often. That’s how I chose them in the first place, because I had multiple friends already in on the Badgers. Several years in, I regret nothing. Year after year, I get a team I can easily root for, giving me hope and faith of being temporarily, adjacently victorious, with traditions and principles and play style I can get behind. It is great to see how we learn to fight at the line, to reliably turn out NFL-quality running backs despite recruiting in New Jersey, to play the right way and win with solid football. Wisconsin also benefits because it is one of the few teams that really can pound the ball and run play after play, and succeed, while stopping any opponent daring to do the same. That makes for a great rooting experience, as you get to see a lot of good things happen. I see why people want to establish the running game even when it doesn’t make sense. I do wish we were more aggressive on fourth down, and knew how to do better at quarterback. And I of course wish we could have won one or two of those championship games. But given our level of recruiting ability, I will never have any complaints. Except for all the constant complaints.</p>\n<h3>Minnesota</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Daring to call your team the Golden Gophers</p>\n<p>Also Good: Paul Bonyan’s Axe, the quiet week we’ve had in Lake Wobegon</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Gets pretty cold up there, doesn’t it</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Not being above average</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>There are two great kinds of rivals. There are the kind that you hate with a passion every minute of every day. Then there are the ones that are friends except for when you face each other, like when super heroes have versus issues. I’m a big fan of that second kind. Minnesota provides that, with just enough fear that they might win the Axe to keep us Wisconsin fans on our toes. Everyone should have about this win percentage, except mathematics is a thing.</p>\n<h3>Nebraska</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: The ongoing saga of Scott Frost</p>\n<p>Also Good: Many past Nebraska teams, the wisdom and generosity of Warren Buffet</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: The suspicion that their fans are the relatives of Penny from The Big Bang Theory, and also Penny</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Letting yourself go after they let you into the club</p>\n<p>Rank: Loyal opposition</p>\n<p>Nebraska has a long history of playing excellent football. It is hard for me to see them that way, because all I have seen is Nebraska increasingly failing to play such football, year after year, and my brain does not instinctively think Nebraska is a place great football should be expected to come from. That could soon change, because alumni Scott Frost who led South Florida to an undefeated season and semi-serious ‘national title’ claim a year after failing to win games at all, has come home and set to work. The voters are giving them a shocking amount of respect, so we’ll see what happens.</p>\n<h3>Illinois</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Their basketball team from about a decade ago was beautiful to watch</p>\n<p>Also Good: The University of Chicago, the phone at Wells and Lake</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: The wind</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Lack of good stories</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>I have nothing against Illinois, but I also can’t get excited. I’ve got nothing to work with here. They show up, they play their role, but there never seem to be any stories. I was actually a fan of their basketball team when I was first getting seriously into sports, because they would pull off plays where I could see them out thinking and outmaneuvering their opponents, in a way that I rarely can appreciate in basketball. I just don’t have the eyes for it, I suppose. I’m open to them showing me something on the field, but I don’t expect it.</p>\n<h3>Purdue</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Everyone’s favorite superfan, Tyler Trent, leading the charge to victory against the hated them</p>\n<p>Also Good: Making boilers, potential world class running backs, saying Pur-DUE!</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Tyler not making it</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Cancer</p>\n<p>Rank: Heroes</p>\n<p>Purdue football is suddenly doing impressive things on the field, and was the inspirational story of the year thanks to super fan and, alas, cancer non-survivor Tyler Trent. Tyler wanted nothing more than to lead his team to victory, and (almost) all of America was thrilled for him to get his wish. If they can build on what they have done, and continue to be explosive, it would be great to have another true threat we can root for around the conference, even without Tyler. And remember, you always have to say it pur-Doooo!</p>\n<h3>Iowa</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: <a href=\"https://talkingtoyourkidsaboutiowa.tumblr.com/\">Talking to your kids about an undefeated Iowa</a></p>\n<p>Also Good: What seems like sheer force of will</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: The ugliest ugly football that ever uglied</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Warping the presidential process, Ethanol subsidies</p>\n<p>Rank: Heroes</p>\n<p>Iowa does not care how ugly they play. Scratch that. They seem to actively want to play as ugly as possible, but in a way that holds the potential to win surprisingly many games. Even the uniforms get in on the act. A small amount of ugly is ugly. An epic, unprecedented and embraced amount of it is a sight to watch. When they upset better teams with far superior recruiting classes and expectations, you can see the fury. It’s a beautiful thing.</p>\n<h3>Northwestern</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: In the geographically appropriate conference after all</p>\n<p>Also Good: Taking up the purple mantle, academics</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Terribly named</p>\n<p>Also Bad: Good enough to sometimes beat us without being good enough to be that impressive a win</p>\n<p>Rank: Loyal opposition</p>\n<p>Respect is due for the unique look, and for sticking to its guns on calling itself Northwestern. A surprising number of people I know have considered attending purely for the academics, so there’s that. The problem is that they are reliably on the cusp of being good, sufficiently that they can beat you, but without doing anything noteworthy. Which means they’re not being quite impressive enough for anyone to give you much credit for holding them off. They can even steal the Big 10 West on occasion. The risk/reward here is terrible, so they go into the opposition column.</p>\n<h3>ACC</h3>\n<p>The ACC is another division that thinks it is as good as the SEC, and in this case has a lot of geographic overlap and thus plays rivalry games every year to try and prove it. The depth never seems to quite be there, but they’ve put up better showings than I would have expected, and Clemson has become co-best team in the country with Alabama. The difference is that Alabama has lots of rivals that are threats to its dominance within its conference and division, whereas Clemson gets to play in the ACC.</p>\n<p>The ACC’s slogan is “Bring your A game” to remind its teachers how to handle athletes.</p>\n<p>They have two divisions. The Atlantic division is called the Atlantic division because it is near the Atlantic coast. The coastal division is called the coastal division because it is near the Atlantic coast.</p>\n<p>In the interests of finishing and not having to put in too much lame filler, we’ll be condensing the team profiles from here, especially the minor teams that don’t leave much impression – I’ll mostly just say that and move on. Five is a lot of conferences. Not everyone gets a complex story from everyone’s point of view.</p>\n<h3>Atlantic Division</h3>\n<h3>Boston College</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: How they look when compared to the other Boston football team</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Inevitable unfair associations with the other Boston football team</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>The northeast does not have enough college football, because it lacks sufficient college football fans, and because the Ivy League decided to sign a suicide pact in order to avoid anyone defecting by trying to have any fun. There are, it seems, more important things to focus on. So given the lack of alternatives, we can be thankful for Boston College.</p>\n<h3>Clemson</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Awesome football</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Papa John’s Pizza</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>Let’s play good idea, bad idea. A good idea is throwing all your fans a pizza party at the stadium as thanks when you make it into the College Football Playoff. The positive focus of the Clemson program is robust and refreshing. A bad idea is getting the pizzas from Papa Johns. This has nothing to do with politics. That’s an optional added bonus, if it helps you get offended by Papa Johns, but is not remotely the worst thing about that enterprise. It has everything to do with it not being pizza. I do realize that options for a stadium’s worth of pizza around Clemson University are likely limited. That is entirely fair, but there is simply no excuse. If you have to, throw a different kind of party. I do realize that Clemson is one of the best two teams in the country, and I’ve spent this entire briefing on their pizza choices. That’s because I feel very strongly about pizza, and also because they otherwise do things right, keep their heads down and stay consistently excellent. I especially respected how they handled their quarterback issues last year. So there’s no doubt that we should be friendly, but I can’t call anyone who considers Papa Johns to be pizza, to be heroes. Love you guys, but if we get another round, Roll Tide.</p>\n<h3>Florida State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: No longer employs Jimbo Fisher</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Still a bunch of cheating cheaters</p>\n<p>Rank: Villains</p>\n<p>I love that Alex Hornibrook fled Wisconsin thinking he could do better, and couldn’t even secure the starting job. I don’t even know if that makes me like Florida State less or more. I only know that they were already near the top of the villain list. Florida State has a long history of doing whatever it takes it ensure that players come to its fine institution, and that they don’t interact with anything that might accidentally force them to either learn or behave in a responsible, ethical or legal fashion. I do not expect the departure of Jimbo Fisher to do more than slow this down a bit, and I wish their program a very lengthy recovery. Also, guys, either tell every other team that references Native Americans they can’t also do the Tomahawk chop, or stop acting like you have a special association with it that makes you better or less obnoxious.</p>\n<h3>Louisville</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Outsiders play exciting football, being so good they can’t ignore you</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: How they did that, including behind the scenes</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>When I first started watching, Louisville were on the outside looking in, trying to get good teams to play them, getting close to putting up undefeated seasons that clearly would not have been enough, and hoping against hope to be part of a power conference. They sort of got their wish when invited to the Big East, then they turned around and mostly got it by joining the ACC. It felt like a betrayal, but the conference was doomed anyway at that point, so it’s not really fair. Then again, we could also talk about the things done by Bobby Patrino and others, and their willingness to take him back. One can’t help but have a bad taste in their mouth about the whole thing. I’ll always be thankful for our time watching Lamar Jackson, but that now is poisoned by the Giants coming within one pick of getting him and somehow failing to draft a quarterback at all, then drafting the guy from Duke the next year with the sixth pick of the draft. Which of course is in no way the fault of Lamar Jackson, but sports is not fair that way. Overall, they get enough boost from their past underdog status that it feels like it comes out to about neutral.</p>\n<h3>North Carolina State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Technically, yes, North Carolina is a state with a university</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Completely inessential</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>As you can tell, they haven’t left an impression. Don’t care either way.</p>\n<h3>Syracuse</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: New York has a football team, and even a legit basketball team</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: We use the term New York loosely, hitting people with cars, upsetting the giants</p>\n<p>Rank: Heroes</p>\n<p>As a team that fully embraces their simple yet powerful color schema of Orangemen, and the only New York based team closer than Buffalo that plays what can fully be described as football, it was easy to form an early connection with Syracuse. Remember that the Giants and Jets play in New Jersey. One could even in theory go to a game some time.  My good friend Seth did the same only far more so, and their basketball teams give us something to root for that might legitimately go all the way at some point, which helps keep interest up during otherwise sports-light February and March. Syracuse has given the top players of the ACC surprising runs for their money, including a giant upset, in the past few years, and has climbed all the way to being ranked. That’s pretty exciting. If I didn’t have Wisconsin, this would likely be my team. Which I’m glad it isn’t, since that would stick me in the ACC.</p>\n<h3>Wake Forest</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Evocative name of university</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Lack of impressive wake and/or forest</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>As you can tell, they haven’t left an impression. Don’t care either way.</p>\n<h3>Coastal Division</h3>\n<h3>Duke</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Not the Duke basketball team</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Still Duke</p>\n<p>Rank: Loyal opposition</p>\n<p>As we all know, Duke sucks. This is football, so Duke actually sucks, which is a bonus. I don’t have anything bad to say about their football team and they must have a large chip on their shoulder, but then again, they are still Duke. So there’s that.</p>\n<h3>Georgia Tech</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Unique triple option offense</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Unique triple option offense</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>Georgia Tech has an offensive play. It is extremely cool. The triple option allows them to see what the defense is giving them, and place the ball where it can do the most good. There is only one problem with this plan, which is that they could really use a second cool offensive play. Or a second offensive play at all. That is not quite fair, they do on occasion pass the pall or otherwise do something slightly different, but it is pretty close. This feels like it should lead to more binary outcomes than it does – if you can successfully defend all three legs of the triple option you should shut Georgia Tech down, and if you cannot do so, you should get run over, so why don’t both of these happen more fully more often? A lot of things like this turn out statistically not to matter when you run the numbers, in ways that are confusing to me. In any case, I’m glad that they exist to give us something different, but also glad we don’t have another power five team doing the same.</p>\n<h3>Miami</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Inevitable collapse when it counts</p>\n<p>Also Good: Technological innovation</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: The height of arrogance, the height of obnoxious</p>\n<p>Rank: Villains</p>\n<p>Miami has benefited greatly from two key pieces of tech, to which my hat is off. First, they have managed to get full ownership of being ‘The U’ and even of holding one’s hands together in a U shape. This has many football-related metaphorical benefits and makes them seem super important. It’s quite an impressive thing to pull off. One also must give credit to the turnover chain. Turnovers are often pure effort plays. It’s hard to motivate players to be fully tuned into something that might not happen for them the entire season, or even their entire time at college, and always be ready to take advantage, but making that extra effort is worth a lot, as every turnover is a potential game changer. By rewarding responsible players with the coveted and now much-copied turnover chain, they managed to actually, as far as we can tell, dramatically improve their turnover rate to absurd levels, which unfortunately means that everyone else now feels the obligation to create a knock-off version. Also unfortunate is that both of these innovations are opportunities for all involved to be obnoxious, arrogant pricks, and everyone involved takes full advantage of all such opportunities. Miami is full of the types of people who think good times are mocking anyone who dares question the glory of the great U, or who doesn’t recognize that they are the one and true U. For that, they will always be dastardly villains. Getting to face them in bowls recently, and crush them utterly, was pretty great. So is watching them fail time and again to recapture former glory, as they get off to unsustainable starts thanks to soft opposition, huge expectations and extra turnovers, then find out that they can’t sustain that they face real teams down the stretch.</p>\n<h3>North Carolina</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Being the anti-Duke without the accompanying annoying dominance</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Not wanting to accidentally root for them in March</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>I have a friend who went there and likes college sports. That’s always a nice plus. Beyond that, this clearly is not their sport, but it’s fun to watch them try.</p>\n<h3>Pittsburgh</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Rivalry game called The Backyard Brawl</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Good friend moved there, for some reason</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>Occasionally they come up with an upset. It’s always fun when that happens, so they get some positive associations, but not much resonance beyond that.</p>\n<h3>Virginia</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Might be for lovers</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Likely to be armed</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>As you can tell, they haven’t left an impression. Don’t care either way. Every other team has won their division once in the last six years, so I’m passively rooting for them to pull it off this time for that reason. When everyone is a winner, no one will be. Remember that, kids at games that don’t keep score.</p>\n<h3>Virginia Tech</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Virginia has tech</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: That tech is playing the game to cover the spread</p>\n<p>Rank: Villains</p>\n<p>Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, can’t get fooled again. Try and fool me three times, no one was fooled. Multiple times, I witnessed the same scenario. Virginia Tech reached an endgame scenario where there is a known correct answer, which is to take a knee and secure victory. Instead, Virginia Tech chose to score meaningless points, including kicking field goals that could have potentially backfired and let the other team back in the game. Except that the points were not meaningless. Many alumni of Virginia Tech, who had laid a certain number of points on their favorite team, were quite thankful for the team’s unorthodox decision. Virginia Tech games, even when I did not watch them, continued to fall far closer to the point spread than one would expect, game after game. This was so consistent that the amount charged for buying points in Virginia Tech games was often double or more what it is normally, if you used the cheapest method of buying points. You could sell the points for more than it usually cost to buy them, but no one was foolish enough to take the bait. It was that blatant. So can I prove it? Of course not. But they are, or at least were, a bunch of filthy corrupt cheating bastards.</p>\n<h3>PAC-12</h3>\n<p>The PAC-12 is a division that thinks it is the future because it has high academic standards – it even has a number in its name that matches the number of teams in the division, which is a harder task than you would think – and it has lots of strong teams and is based on the thriving west coast, but it can never win playoff games and includes Arizona State. It has North and South divisions and a rivalry game called The Civil War between Oregon and Oregon State, because the area is recently settled, preventing all this from being too soon. Because they play on the West Coast, they often don’t have a timing conflict with other leagues, and their full name is PAC-12 After Dark.</p>\n<h3>North Division</h3>\n<h3>Oregon</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: The mighty duck</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Likely blood type</p>\n<p>Rank: Heroes</p>\n<p>The duck is not only Lee Corso’s favorite mascot, it is likely the best of all the mascots. If you need proof, or even if you don’t, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/watch/player?id=17192455&amp;lang=en\">watch this clip</a>. They also own the color green and the rights to a giant O, originate lots of great quarterbacks and coaches, have players that reliably show integrity, have been refreshingly willing to go for two, fight a yearly Civil War, and are likely the best hope the PAC-12 has for national glory and respect. It’s hard to ask for much more than that, unless you’d like one or two more key wins. Which would be a reasonable thing to ask for.</p>\n<h3>Oregon State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Consistently good enough to ruin otherwise promising seasons for other PAC teams</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Wasting the team named the Beavers that frequently plays on PAC-12 After Dark</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>Oregon State does have five conference championships over the years, so while they are not in the top tier, they are a legitimate threat. It’s still hard to get excited by that, when there are teams around them with better programs and better stories, so they’re. Getting Oregon State to the next level, or at least giving them a more interesting story, would round out an otherwise quite intriguing division that otherwise gives a lot to connect to when it’s time for PAC-12 after dark.</p>\n<h3>Washington</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Boise State gets to join a major conference, hello to Chris Peterson</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Trying to get me to root against Mike Leach, it’s not going to happen</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>Boise State may never get its chance to fully compete with the big buys, but we got the next best thing when Chris Peterson moved to Washington and took with him the core of what made his Boise State teams great, combining it with the resources of a power conference team like Washington to create a competitor for the national title. It would be great to see what he could do with something one more level up. For now, I find it easy to root for Washington given it is using skill to punch above its weight and my many friends in and affinity for the city of Seattle, where I even considered moving not too long ago. There’s lots of reasons the place is thriving so much <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/on-the-seattle-minimum-wage-study-part-1/\">it can afford a high minimum wage</a> – never underestimate a place with zero state and local income taxes that combine with real civilization. Washington now feels like it has a unique identity. There are two problems rooting for them full blast. The first is that it doesn’t feel like they have the recruiting slash talent chops to do what they would like to do, so I’d expect to be set up for a lot of disappointment. Second, their big rivalry game is the Apple Cup against Mike Leach’s Washington State, and seriously, how do you root against that guy?</p>\n<h3>Washington State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Mike Leach. The man, the myth, the legend</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Not enough Mike Leach</p>\n<p>Rank: Heroes</p>\n<p>Old faithful, the Washington State University flag, appears without fail on every ESPN  College Gameday. Fans ensure it makes its journey around the country, week in and week out, two hundred times in a row.  That is dedication. Even more dedicated to unique quests of his own creation, and to making the world a more interesting and wonderful place, is coach Mike Leach. When you need advice, Mike Leach is there. WHen you need wisdom or to know where things are at, Like Leach is there. When you need to know what to make of the news of the day, Mike Leach is there. When you need someone to teach a class equating their football games to guerrilla warfare, Mike Leach is there. Here are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMaaDxp3grY\">some of his best quotes</a>. This is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Coach_Leach?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">his Twitter feed</a>. I realize I am not remotely doing this man justice here, because the form simply is not up to the task. But if we’re going to get through everything as a country and a planet, we are going to need more people with the wit, wisdom and wonder of Mike Leach.</p>\n<h3>California</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: True denizens of Berkeley presumably hate the team</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Berkeley, California</p>\n<p>Rank: Villains</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/\">I have discussed my issues with Berkeley before.</a> I see no reason to go into them again. I have watched a Berkeley football game from a sports bar near campus, and observed the distinct lack of either enthusiasm or any semblance of a high-quality area sports bar in which to watch football. The key question is, do we root against Berkeley having nice things because of all that it has done, or do we root <em>for </em>Berkeley having nice things if the people in Berkeley don’t appreciate them? I can see the argument for the opposite point of view, especially with Stanford as the main rival, since Stanford does appreciate its team and still counts as San Francisco. Some day I will get a chance to go to a game, and I hope to have enough advance warning to, assuming the place in question is not Stanford, first acquire visiting school apparel.</p>\n<h3>Stanford</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Actual educations are available</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Royally screwed me during admissions process, also San Francisco</p>\n<p>Rank: Villains</p>\n<p>Stanford draws people to The Bay, which then draws other people to The Bay, which ruins lives and helps try and ruin mine. As I said under Berkeley, I’ve been over all that before. Also, Tom Martel roots for Stanford hard, so getting to imagine him suffering is a bonus. But I’m not going to tell those stories here. Instead, I will tell the story of how Stanford actively attempted to sabotage my life. I attended a high school where I was only allowed to send out seven college applications; this was before there was a widespread common application, and the school refused to cooperate with more than seven slots. State and city school were assumed to be universal safety selections, so you really only got five slots to work with. Since you wanted to balance reaches with solid choices with diversity of options and all that, each of these five slots was precious. The school made statistics on admissions available, so we could make better decisions. This was pretty great, as I wouldn’t waste a slot on places that were sure to reject me, and I could know that NYU was functionally a safety school given I had a backup safety behind it, so I had four slots left for places that might reject me. Then I got a letter from Stanford, congratulating me on my math competition record, and inviting me to apply for admission. I knew that they were going to reject me anyway, because literally zero applicants with my grade average had made it into Stanford in several years. My parents, alas, despite both having PhDs, did not appreciate that statistical proof is proof, and insisted I apply to this fine institution. This resulted in me, on the phone with an admissions officer, pleading with her not to accept me, but rather to let me hand the phone to my mother so she could explain to her that I need not trouble myself with an application. This, of course, did not work, leaving me with only six slots instead of seven, since my Stanford application was of course dead on arrival. So we here will always hate Stanford.</p>\n<h3>South Division</h3>\n<h3>Arizona</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Quarterback Khalil Tate is exciting</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Too hot, yet usually surprisingly easy to handle</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>As you can tell, they haven’t left an impression. Don’t care either way. I did get slightly excited by Tate going on a run after becoming the new quarterback, but it didn’t add up to enough to get me to pay that much attention, given how unexciting I find the PAC-12 South.</p>\n<h3>Arizona State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Herm Edwards, Good Place joke material</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Hangovers</p>\n<p>Rank: Heroes</p>\n<p>Who doesn’t like a good party, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5-iJUuPWis\">playing to win the game</a>? As long as this is the site of Herm Edwards’ grand comeback attempt, we’ll always be in their corner. After all, they’re buying.</p>\n<h3>Colorado</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: I once lived in Denver for a year</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Among zero Colorado fans</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>Colorado used to dominate their divisions. One can interpret that as ‘wow Colorado used to be good at football’ or one can interpret that as ‘wow Colorado used to play against bad teams and now it is in mostly over its head.’ It certainly did not seem, from my time in the state, like there was anything like the passion that would let them compete properly with the big boys. It was cool watching them win a PAC-12 South title, but mostly because it let us celebrate a collapse by USC and the triumph of an underdog, which is why being neutral but traditionally bad is usually a way to end up being the team I’m rooting for.</p>\n<h3>Utah</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Historical outsider challenger of the power conferences</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Failure to sustain that level of play after gaining admission</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>A series of undefeated Utah teams that forced their way into premiere bowl games was an easy team to root for. When they gained admission to the PAC-12, it was exciting to wonder whether they could become an elite team. They’re still a remarkably good team that is often ranked, but now they are one team among many in that middle tier, so as the history fades they become less and less exciting.</p>\n<h3>UCLA</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Traditional enemies of USC</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Chip Kelly story is no fun if he succeeds</p>\n<p>Rank: Loyal Opposition</p>\n<p>Chip Kelly did a great job coaching Oregon (yay!) then he took a job in the NFL coaching the Eagles (boo!) before failing to San Francisco (boo!) and then failing back to a gigantic salary at UCLA. Once someone abandons their roots and then fails up in such an epic fashion, making good seems like it ruins the fun, so I don’t want to see UCLA start winning enough to make his run there feel successful. The least he can do with such a big paycheck is suffer.</p>\n<h3>USC</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Great safety school if you can make it in</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: How much it will cost you</p>\n<p>Rank: Villain</p>\n<p>There are many articles filled with good reasons to hate USC. Getting to play in the same stadium as the bowl game your conference champion gets to play in is an absurd advantage. The ‘spoiled children’ thing and all the overpriced fluff coming out of the university outside of football, or so I’ve heard, and its inevitable roll in the recent college admissions scandal. The slight technical legal problems of its famous running backs, Reggie Bush and O.J. Simpson. The general feeling that they expect to and feel entitled to win, which always bugs me when it isn’t backed up. And, of course, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkAznG5Vz1o\">my feelings about California</a>. I have the strong instinct that these are not the heroes, above and beyond concrete reasons why. Despite all that, there’s one important redeeming quality I will always remember. USC was playing against Notre Dame. The game was secured, with USC driving the field one final time to run out the clock. It was fourth down. The over had come in, but large favorite USC had yet to cover the spread, the combination of which would have been quite bad. I assumed it was over. USC dropped back to punt. But it was a fake. They threw the ball down the field, got a pass interference call for a first down, and went on to drive for a touchdown. On the one hand, this was a lot like Virgina Tech, in that it showed a complete lack of class and total disrespect for the principles of the sport. You simply don’t do that. But it did show that they hated Notre Dame that much. And that has to count for something.</p>\n<h3>Big 12</h3>\n<p>The Big 12 is the division that thinks the best defense is a good offense. In context, it’s hard to argue with. The offenses are explosive and fun to watch, especially given their lack of real opposition. Their lack of defense includes an inability to convince teams to stay in the conference, leaving them without divisions or a proper cable network. Luckily, the greed of the Longhorn Network has kept Texas from having the ability to switch into a different conference, so as long as Oklahoma stays put, they’ve still got something. It’s definitely the lesser of the five power conferences, and the one I find least worth following, plus I want to wrap things up, so I don’t feel too bad about not getting too into the weeds here. As you no doubt know or have guessed by now, they are called the Big 12 because there are ten teams in the conference.</p>\n<h3>Oklahoma</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Amazing offensive displays</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Confusing people on what “OU” means in a sports context</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>Oklahoma reliably recruits top quarterback talent. It is not hard to see why. With such a great offense built around them, and such a weak set of defenses to tee off against, it’s easy to provide temptation for those inevitably headed for first pick draft status. Have they all left you? Never fear, the transfer portal is here. It’s all quite fun to watch, and usually the best hope the Big 12 has of ensuring there are five conferences seeking four playoff slots. We can’t have those numbers being equal, that’s no fun. I also have the benefit of an old friend who attended, which is more than I can say for any other team in the conference.</p>\n<h3>Oklahoma State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Mike Gundy reliably produces quality bedlam</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Claiming the right to wear orange</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVpWxM03myE\">This highlight reel</a> only somewhat does justice to the joys of Mike Gundy. He is no Mike Leach, but at least the man is making an effort. Oklahoma State is also another source of overperformance, of grabbing for the brass ring that they by all rights should have no hope of competing for. I always have a soft spot for that.</p>\n<h3>Texas</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Keeping a fifth power conference alive through pure greed</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Intolerance for being messed with</p>\n<p>Rank:  Loyal opposition</p>\n<p>The University of Texas has its own television network. I will say that again. The University of Texas has its own television network. This prevents the rest of the Big 12 from having a network. Thus, it cripples the Big 12, but it also prevents Texas from joining a better conference, so it not clear which direction the net effect goes. Regardless of intent, it is the action of a supremely greedy and arrogant school, that thinks they are better and more deserving than anyone else. I also strongly suspect it has been a major distraction, and a reason why Texas football has not fully recovered to its former glory. You can either spend your time on football, or you can spend your time on your network. This helps reinforce me firmly on the Oklahoma side of the rivalry, rendering Texas the loyal opposition. We do need them to be strong so that there are two sides of the coin in an otherwise weak conference, and they take proper refuge in audacity, plus they had a great comeback to take a championship away from USC on my watch before the fall, so I can’t consider them true vilains.</p>\n<h3>Texas Tech</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Impressive outshining of Texas State Bobcats</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Underhanded attempt at two-for-one team name</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>Priors tell you that a team named the Raiders, which even alternates between two ominously double-named mascots, is full of scum and villainy. One must be cautious. What kind of tech are they hiding behind? On the one hand, it’s clearly up to no good, on the other hand I’m curious to find out and hopeful it can help them compete with the other Texas teams. In my experience they are on the verge of being serious enough rivals to be interesting, but mostly do not quite get there.</p>\n<h3>TCU</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Legitimately had a playoff spot stolen out from under them by the playoff committee and given to super-villainous Ohio State in broad daylight</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Stands for Texas Christian University</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>It was brutal. TCU was in a playoff spot, won its game convincingly, and was passed through multiple spots by Ohio State because somehow we were convinced to lay down to them in the Big 10 Championship Game. Then, when the time came for reciprocity, of course Ohio State did not keep up their end of the bargain. TCU fans doubtless will remain bitter for a very, very long time. As will all good-thinking folks, since they hate Ohio State. And all of this is rightfully so. Another point in their favor is to use TCU as the official name for the university, which makes it easy to know what initials to look for. It’s good to appreciate the little things. That to me is about enough to balance out being known as Texas Christian University. If something is good and happens to also have other features people feel are righteous, there is nothing wrong with that. But when you put the righteous label a bit too prominently in your labels and marketing strategy, that never bodes well. Consider the parallel to vegan food. There is lots of good vegan food. Most days I will eat some, and it will be delicious. However, if the food <em>calls itself </em>vegan food, it’s almost certainly going to be terrible.</p>\n<h3>Iowa State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Perfect scruffy underdog exiled from its natural conference</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: There is no I in team</p>\n<p>Rank: Friendly</p>\n<p>Iowa State is tougher than it looks. When you come to Iowa State, you are in for a slug fest, and there is real risk you will not make it out of there. That is the ideal type of round-out-the-conference team from a fan perspective, as opposed to the conference perspective where their goal is to open up a media market for the conference cable network. We need more teams like Iowa State.</p>\n<h3>Kansas</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Knows to focus all recruiting on basketball</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Contrast is too sharp to allow proper appreciation of underdog status</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>I need to get this out. I can’t even bring myself to care about one Kansas team that’s never done anything, let alone two.</p>\n<h3>Kansas State</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Not making me feel even a little bad not knowing what to put here</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Not making me feel even a little bad not knowing what to have put up there</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>I need to get this out. I can’t even bring myself to care about one Kansas team that’s never done anything, let alone two.</p>\n<h3>Baylor</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Many students were able to transfer away</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: The scandal that made them transfer</p>\n<p>Rank: Villain</p>\n<p>Baylor has not been playing by the rules, nor was it ever the type of place that gave its students an accurate picture of the world. Seeing its downfall after coming so close to the playoff brought only a smile to my face.</p>\n<h3>West Virginia</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: The absurdity of them being in the Big 12 conference</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Selling out their old conference to get there</p>\n<p>Rank: Neutral</p>\n<p>Conference realignment was a great way to find teams to hate. Any time a team walked away from their old rivals and partners, especially without following the rules set out for doing so, in order simply to move up to a slightly superior conference (also known as ‘one that would still be around after realignment’) is an obvious villain move. This is doubly true when the new conference makes no geographical sense, with the compensation being the sheer absurdity of membership. Then again, where else would they go? They weren’t getting a Big 10 invitation, and they don’t seem coastal enough for the ACC, so given they are a pretty solid program I guess this actually makes reasonable sense for both sides. So I don’t have to hate them for it, plus they’re West Virginia. They’ve suffered enough.</p>\n<h3>Other Teams of Note</h3>\n<p>By default, any team that is not in a power conference (and not Notre Dame, since it is only not in one by its own choice) is a hero if it is attempting to challenge the big boys. Thus, unless there is a damn good reason why not, any outsider trying to break in will be the hero. This applies to Houston, Northern Illinois, Memphis and especially the two big threats Central Florida (who are even self-proclaimed national champions with a story so good I really do think they deserved a shot at Alabama after the season was over, although they would have gotten utterly destroyed) and perennial powerhouse Boise State, which I believe has been kept out of the PAC-12 because of either lack of strong academics and/or its blue field. Both reasons seem plausible. We then end with one last villain, the one true independent:</p>\n<h3>Notre Dame</h3>\n<p>Biggest Plus: Extra chaos potential</p>\n<p>Biggest Minus: Giant obnoxious fan base, refusal to play by the rules</p>\n<p>Rank: Villains</p>\n<p>You seem to believe that you are special. You believe that the rules do not apply to you. Obviously you are mistaken. Except that they aren’t. The rules really do not apply to Notre Dame. They can play who they want, toss away and renew their rivalries on a whim to weaken or strengthen their schedule based on what they think the playoff committee is rewarding these days, not play a conference championship game, and still claim after all of it that they deserve a shot at the national title. They don’t, especially given their track record when we let them do that. If they want a national title, they can join the Big 10 or ACC or even PAC-12, play in a title game like the rest of us, and prove it. The sheer amount of obnoxiousness surrounding Notre Dame boggles the mind. One good thing is that they have so many overconfident fans that the betting lines consistently bias in their favor, so keep that in mind if you are a betting type of person.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Most of these evaluations are personal, based upon my history, my knowledge, my circumstances and my preferences. That does not make them right or wrong, and you should use the information to help inform you, but definitely disagree with a lot of them. Are there places were I am wrong? Certainly I’ve made some errors of fact, and some errors of judgment, and most importantly some key errors of omission because of things I do not know. These are strong beliefs, because it is more fun that way, but mostly weakly held, because it is more fun that way as well. Don’t hesitate to advocate for or against your favorite or least favorite team. We are who we are. Otherwise, I’m happy to listen.</p>\n<p>There is a lot more to say about getting proper enjoyment out of college football, or any sport, that would be far beyond the scope of this already ludicrously long post. But it seems right to say a few brief words.</p>\n<p>The most important thing is to pay attention. Watching a game in the background, or flipping between games looking for scores, or otherwise not picking up detail and context, is an impoverished sports experience. You can and should do better. Pick up and relish the stories, the details, the little battles, the strategic choices. Focus on whichever parts you find most interesting, but whatever you do, <em>focus. </em>Then let all of this build game after game, week after week, until you too could write something like this if you were so inclined.</p>\n<p>Even if you would, of course, be wrong.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Lately I&#x2019;ve been thinking about how my thinking works, and how it can be improved. The simplest way to do so is probably to nudge myself towards paying more attention to various useful habits of mind. Here are the ones I&apos;ve found most valuable (roughly in order):<br></p><ol><li>Tying together the act of saying a statement, and the act of evaluating whether I actually believe it. After making a novel claim, saying out loud to myself: &#x201C;is this actually true?&#x201D; &#x201D; and &quot;how could I test this?&quot;</li><li>Being comfortable with pausing to reflect and thinking out loud. Trying to notice when my responses are too quick and reflexive, as a sign that I&apos;m not thinking hard enough about the point I&apos;m addressing.</li><li>Asking for <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XosKB3mkvmXMZ3fBQ/specificity-your-brain-s-superpower\">specific examples</a>, and using more of my own. Tabooing vague abstractions and moving away from discussing claims that are too general.</li><li>Being charitable and collaborative, both towards new ideas and towards conversational partners. Trying to rephrase other people&#x2019;s arguments and pass <a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html\">Ideological Turing Tests</a> on them. Helping my conversational partners build up their ideas.</li><li>Noticing the affect heuristic, and which claims stir up emotions. Noticing when I&apos;m talking defensively or heatedly, and when it&#x2019;d be uncomfortable to believe something.</li><li>Thinking in terms of probabilities; cashing out beliefs in terms of predictions; then betting on them. I haven&#x2019;t done enough bets to calibrate myself well, but I find that even just the feeling of having money on the line is often enough to make me rethink. Being asked whether something is a crux gives me a similar feeling.</li><li>Thinking about how the conversations and debates I participate in actually create value, and when they should be redirected or halted.</li></ol><p>Then there are social influences. I think one of the greatest virtues of the rationalist community is in creating an environment which encourages the use of the tools above. Another example: my girlfriend fairly regularly points out times when I&#x2019;ve contradicted myself. I think this has helped me notice and limit the extent to which I behave like an opinion confabulation machine.<br><br>I&#x2019;d classify most if not all of the tools listed above as <a href=\"http://thinkingcomplete.blogspot.com/2019/04/when-is-rationality-useful.html\">tools for evaluating ideas</a>, though, rather than tools for generating ideas. What helps with the latter? I&#x2019;ve personally found that one very useful strategy is to make and then justify bold claims based on vague intuitions. In the process of defending my position, I&#x2019;m forced to actually flesh it out and make it coherent (although I do need to be careful not to become overly attached to the untrue parts). And what&apos;s helped the most is that after having interesting conversations, I now write posts inspired by them much more frequently. I often feel like Feynman in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3697056-supersizing-the-mind\">this story</a>: &quot;When historian Charles Weiner found pages of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman&apos;s notes, he saw it as a &quot;record&quot; of Feynman&apos;s work. Feynman himself, however, insisted that the notes were not a record but the work itself.&quot; Arguing and writing are not just ways to transmit my thoughts, but also the key mechanisms by which I generate new thoughts.</p><p>(Edited to add: a friend pointed out that the last line is a good indicator that I&apos;m being insufficiently empirical. I think I agree; it should also include the mechanism of looking at the world and noticing something confusing going on.)</p>",

The randomization involved in throwing away information feels similar to game-theoretic randomness, yet it’s in the sort of informational framework usually used for reasoning about uncertainty - suggesting that these two types of randomness could be handled in a more unified conceptual framework.</p><p>For example: suppose agent 1 and agent 2 play a zero-sum game. Agent 2 chooses its action by running a copy of agent 1’s source code, then outputting whatever action beats the copy’s action. What should agent 1 do? One possible approach is for agent 1 to throw away any information about its copy’s action which is contained in its own action - so that the copy’s behavior yields no information about agent 1’s behavior. Randomization then naturally enters picture, due to throwing away information. (This doesn’t seem like quite the right decision-making rule in general, but it feels like something similar could work - the main idea is to make “throw away information” an action in the game itself, and push game-theoretic randomization of choices into the info-throw-away action.) One could imagine re-deriving Nash equilibria via agents throwing away information as an action, without any other source of randomness. Whether that can actually work is another open problem.</p>",

That distinction is between the reward signal of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent and its “utility function”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-pjCGeDS7iZograZ9B-1\" id=\"fnref-pjCGeDS7iZograZ9B-1\">[1]</a></sup>. That is to say, it is not in general true that the policy of an RL agent is optimising for its reward. To explain what I mean by this, I will first draw another distinction, between “optimised” and “optimising”. These distinctions lie at the core of our mesa-optimisation framework.</p>\n<p>It’s helpful to begin with an analogy. Viewed abstractly, biological evolution is an optimisation process that searches through configurations of matter to find ones that are good at replication. Humans are a product of this optimisation process, and so we are to some extent good at replicating. Yet we don’t <em>care,</em> by and large, about replication in itself.</p>\n<p>Many things we care about <em>look</em> like replication. One might be motivated by starting a family, or by having a legacy, or by similar closely related things. But those are not replication itself. If we cared about replication directly, gamete donation would be a far more mainstream practice than it is, for instance.</p>\n<p>Thus I want to distinguish the objective of the selection pressure that produced humans from the objectives that humans pursue. Humans were selected for replication, so we are good replicators. This includes having goals that correlate with replication. But it is plain that we are not motivated by replication itself. As a slogan, though we are optimis<em>ed</em> for replication, we aren’t optimis<em>ing</em> for replication.</p>\n<p>Another clear case where “optimised” and “optimising” come apart are “dumb” artifacts like <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/26eupx3Byc8swRS7f/bottle-caps-aren-t-optimisers\">bottle caps</a>. They can be heavily optimised for some purpose without optimising for anything at all.</p>\n<p>These examples support the first distinction I want to make: <strong>optimis</strong><strong><em>ed</em></strong> ≠ <strong>optimis</strong><strong><em>ing.</em></strong> They also illustrate how this distinction is important in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A system optimised for an objective need not be pursuing any objectives itself. (As illustrated by bottle caps.)</li>\n<li>The objective a system pursues isn’t determined by the objective it was optimised for. (As illustrated by humans.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason I draw this distinction is to ask the following question:</p>\n<p>Our machine learning models are optimised for some loss or reward. But what are they optimis<em>ing</em> for, if anything? Are they like bottle caps, or like humans, or neither?</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1671308621/mirroredImages/bG4PR9uSsZqHg2gYY/kyt52wio782a52yvxyrp.png\" alt=\"table 1\"></p>\n<p>In other words, do RL agents have goals? And if so, what are they?</p>\n<p>These questions are hard, and I don’t think we have good answers to any of them. In any case, it would be premature, in light of the optimised ≠ optimising distinction, to conclude that a trained RL agent is optimising for its reward signal.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the RL agent (understood as the agent’s policy representation, since that is the part that does all of the interesting decision-making) is optimised for performance on its reward function. But in the same way that humans are optimised for replication, but are optimising for our own goals, a policy that was selected for its performance on reward may in fact have its own internally-represented goals, only indirectly linked to the intended reward. A pithy way to put this point is to say that <strong>utility ≠ reward</strong>, if we want to call the objective a system is optimising its “utility”. (This is by way of metaphor – I don’t suggest that we must model RL agents as expected utility maximizers.)</p>\n<p>Let’s make this more concrete with an example. Say that we train an RL agent to perform well on a set of mazes. Reward is given for finding and reaching the exit door in each maze (which happens to always be red). Then we freeze its policy and transfer the agent to a new environment set for testing. In the new mazes, the exit doors are blue, and red distractor objects are scattered elsewhere in the maze. What might the agent do in the new environment?</p>\n<p>Three things might happen.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It might generalise: the agent could solve the new mazes just as well, reaching the exit and ignoring the distractors.</li>\n<li>It might break under the distributional shift: the agent, unused to the blue doors and weirdly-shaped distractor objects, could start twitching or walking into walls, and thus fails to reach the exit.</li>\n<li>But it might also fail to generalise in a more interesting way: the agent could fail to reach the exit, but could instead robustly and competently find the red distractor in each maze we put it in.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To the extent that it's meaningful to talk about the agent's goals, the contrast between the first and third cases suggests that those goals depend only on its policy, and are distinct from its reward signal. It is tempting to say that the objective of the first agent is reaching doors; that the objective of the third agent is to reach red things. It does not matter that in both cases, the policy was optimised to reach doors.</p>\n<p>This makes sense if we consider how information about the reward gets into the policy:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1671308621/mirroredImages/bG4PR9uSsZqHg2gYY/ybmpeygnc6p1qgwytodr.jpg\" alt=\"fig 1\"></p>\n<p>For any given action, the policy’s decision is made independently of the reward signal. The reward is only used (standardly, at least) to optimise the policy between actions. So the reward function can’t be the policy’s objective – one cannot be pursuing something one has no direct access to. At best, we can hope that whatever objective the learned policy has access to is an accurate representation of the reward. But the two can come apart, so we must draw a distinction between the reward itself and the policy’s internal objective representation.</p>\n<p>To recap: whether an AI system is goal-directed or not is not trivially answered by the fact that it was constructed to optimise an objective. To say that is to fail to draw the optimised ≠ optimising distinction. If we then take seriously goal-directedness in AI systems, then we must draw a distinction between the AI’s internal learned objective and the objective it was trained on; that is, draw the utility ≠ reward distinction.</p>\n<h3>What objectives?</h3>\n<p>I’ve been talking about the objective of the RL agent, or its “utility”, as if it is an intuitively sensible object. But what actually is it, and how can we know it? In a given training setup, we know the reward. How do we figure out the utility?</p>\n<p>Intuitively, the idea of the internal goal being pursued by a learned system feels compelling to me. Yet right now, we don't have any good ways to make the intuition precise – figuring out how to do that is an important open question. As we start thinking about how to make progress, there are at least two approaches we can take: what I’d call the behavioural approach and the internal approach.</p>\n<p>Taking the behavioural approach, we look at how decisions made by a system systematically lead to certain outcomes. We then infer objectives from studying those decisions and outcomes, treating the system as a black box. For example, we could apply Inverse Reinforcement Learning to our trained agents. Eliezer’s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q4hLMDrFd8fbteeZ8/measuring-optimization-power\">formalisation of optimisation power</a> also seems to follow this approach.</p>\n<p>Or, we can peer inside the system, trying to understand the algorithm implemented by it. This is the internal approach. The goal is to achieve a mechanistic model that is abstract enough to be useful, but still grounded in the agent’s inner workings. Interpretability and transparency research take this approach generally, though as far as I can tell, the specific question of objectives has not yet seen much attention.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear whether one approach is better, as both potentially offer useful tools. At present, I am more enthusiastic about the internal approach, both philosophically and as a research direction. Philosophically, I am more excited about it because understanding a model’s decision-making feels more explanatory<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-pjCGeDS7iZograZ9B-2\" id=\"fnref-pjCGeDS7iZograZ9B-2\">[2]</a></sup> than making generalisations about its behaviour. As a research direction, it has potential for empirically-grounded insights which might scale to future prosaic AI systems. Additionally, there is the possibility of low-hanging fruit, as this space appears underexplored.</p>\n<h3>Why worry?</h3>\n<p>Utility and reward are distinct. So what? If a system is truly optimised for an objective, determining its internal motivation is an unimportant academic debate. Only its real-world performance matters, not the correct interpretation of its internals. And if the performance is optimal, then isn’t our work done?</p>\n<p>In practice, we don’t get to optimise performance completely. We want to generalise from limited training data, and we want our systems to be robust to situations not foreseen in training. This means that we don’t get to have a model that’s perfectly optimised for the thing we actually want. We don’t get optimality on the full deployment distribution complete with unexpected situations. At best, we know that the system is optimal on the training distribution. In this case, knowing whether the internal objective of the system matches the objective we selected it for becomes crucial, as if the system’s <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2mhFMgtAjFJesaSYR/2-d-robustness\">capabilities generalise while its internal goal is misaligned</a>, bad things can happen.</p>\n<p>Say that we prove, somehow, that optimising the world with respect to some objective is safe and useful, and that we can train an RL agent using that objective as reward. The utility ≠ reward distinction means that even in that ideal scenario, we are still not done with alignment. We still need to figure out a way to actually install that objective (and not a different objective that still results in optimal performance in training) into our agent. Otherwise, we risk creating an AI that appears to work correctly in training, but which is revealed to be pursuing a different goal when an unusual situation happens in deployment. So long as we don’t understand how objectives work inside agents, and how we can influence those objectives, we cannot be certain of the safety of any system we build, even if we literally somehow have a proof that the reward it was trained on was “correct”.</p>\n<p>Will highly-capable AIs be goal-directed? I don’t know for sure, and it seems hard to gather evidence about this, but my guess is yes. Detailed discussion is beyond our scope, but I invite the interested reader to look at some arguments about this that we present in <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/q2rCMHNXazALgQpGH\">section 2</a> of the report. I also endorse Rohin Shah’s <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9zpT9dikrrebdq3Jf/will-humans-build-goal-directed-agents\">Will Humans Build Goal-Directed Agents?</a>.</p>\n<p>All this opens the possibility for misalignment between reward and utility. Are there reasons to believe the two will actually come apart? By default, I expect them to. Ambiguity and underdetermination of reward mean that there are many distinct objectives that all result in the same behaviour in training, but which can disagree in testing. Think of the maze agent, whose reward in training could mean “go to red things” or “go to doors”, or a combination of the two. For reasons of bounded rationality, I also expect pressures for learning proxies for the reward instead of the true reward, when such proxies are available. Think of humans, whose goals are largely proxies for reproductive success, rather than replication itself. (This was a very brief overview; <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J\">section 3</a> of our report examines this question in depth, and expands on these points more.)</p>\n<p>The second reason these ideas matter is that we might not want goal-directedness at all. Maybe we just want tool AI, or AI services, or some other kind of non-agentic AI. Then, we want to be certain that our AI is not somehow goal-directed in a way that would cause trouble off-distribution. This could happen without us building it in – after all, evolution didn’t set out to make goal-directed systems. Goal-directedness just turned out to be a good feature to include in its replicators. Likewise, it may be that goal-directedness is a performance-boosting feature in classifiers, so powerful optimisation techniques would create goal-directed classifiers. Yet perhaps we are willing to take the performance hit in exchange for ensuring our AI is non-agentic. Right now, we don’t even get to choose, because we don’t know when systems are goal-directed, nor how to influence learning processes to avoid learning goal-directedness.</p>\n<p>Taking a step back, there is something fundamentally concerning about all this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We don’t understand our AIs’ objectives, and we don’t know how to set them.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don’t think this phrase should ring true in a world where we hope to build friendly AI. Yet today, to my ears, it does. I think that is a good reason to look more into this question, whether to solve it or to assure ourselves that the situation is less bad than it sounds.</p>\n<h3>Mesa-optimisers</h3>\n<p>This worry is the subject of our report. The framework of mesa-optimisation is a language for talking about goal-directed systems under the influence of optimisation processes, and about the objectives involved.</p>\n<p>A part of me is worried that the terminology invites viewing mesa-optimisers as a description of a very specific failure mode, instead of as a language for the general worry described above. I don’t know to what degree this misconception occurs in practice, but I wish to preempt it here anyway. (I want data on this, so please leave a comment if you had confusions about this after reading the original report.)</p>\n<p>In brief, our terms describe the relationship between a system doing some optimisation (the base optimiser, e.g.: evolution, SGD), and a goal-directed system (the mesa-optimiser, e.g.: human, ML model) that is being optimised by that first system. The objective of the base optimiser is the base objective; the internal objective of the mesa-optimiser is the mesa-objective.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1671308621/mirroredImages/bG4PR9uSsZqHg2gYY/nvvofcelztwnclyt2ac1.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\"></p>\n<p>(“Mesa” as a Greek word that means something like the opposite of “meta”. The reason we use “mesa” is to highlight that the mesa-optimiser is an optimiser that is itself being optimised by another optimiser. It is a kind of dual to a meta-optimiser, which is an optimiser that is itself optimising another optimiser. There is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bG4PR9uSsZqHg2gYY/utility-reward?commentId=utx96kZanjYnGRRBx\">contention</a> around whether this is good Greek, however.</p>\n<p>While we’re on the topic of terms, “inner optimiser” is a confusing term that we used in the past in the same way as “mesa-optimiser”. It did not accurately reflect the concept, and has been retired in favour of the current terminology. Please use ”mesa-optimiser” instead.)</p>\n<p>I see the word “optimiser” in “mesa-optimiser” as a way of capturing goal-directedness, rather than a commitment to some kind of (utility-)maximising structure. What feels important to me in a mesa-optimiser is its goal-directedness, not the fact it is an optimiser. A goal-directed system which isn’t taking strictly optimal actions (but which is still competent at pursuing its mesa-objective) is still worrying.</p>\n<p>Optimisation could be a good way to model goal-directedness—though I don’t think you gain that much, conceptually, from that model—but equally, it seems plausible that some other approach we have not yet explored could work better. So I myself read the “optimiser” in “mesa-optimiser” analogously to how I accept treating humans as optimisers; as a metaphor, more than anything else.</p>\n<p>I am not sure that mesa-optimisation is the best possible framing of these concerns. I would welcome more work that attempts to untangle these ideas, and to improve our concepts.</p>\n<h3>An alignment agenda</h3>\n<p>There are at least three alignment-related ideas prompted by this worry.</p>\n<p>The first is <strong>unintended optimisation</strong>. How do we ensure that systems that are not supposed to be goal-directed actually end up being not-goal-directed?</p>\n<p>The second is to factor alignment into <strong>inner alignment</strong> and <strong>outer alignment</strong>. If we expect our AIs to be goal-directed, we can view alignment as a two-step process. First, ensure outer alignment between humans and the base objective of the AI training setup, and then ensure inner alignment between the base objective and the mesa-objective of the resulting system. The former involves finding low-impact, corrigible, aligned with human preferences, or otherwise desirable reward functions, and has been the focus of much of the progress made by the alignment community so far. The latter involves figuring out learned goals, interpretability, and a whole host of other potential approaches that have not yet seen much popularity in alignment research.</p>\n<p>The third is something I want to call <strong>end-to-end alignment</strong>. It’s not obvious that alignment must factor in the way described above. There is room for trying to set up training in such a way to guarantee a friendly mesa-objective somehow without matching it to a friendly base-objective. That is: to align the AI directly to its human operator, instead of aligning the AI to the reward, and the reward to the human. It’s unclear how this kind of approach would work in practice, but this is something I would like to see explored more. I am drawn to staying focused on what we actually care about (the mesa-objective) and treating other features as merely levers that influence the outcome.</p>\n<p>We must make progress on at least one of these problems if we want to guarantee the safety of prosaic AI. If we don’t want goal-directed AI, we need to reliably prevent unintended optimisation. Otherwise, we want to solve either inner and outer alignment, or end-to-end alignment. Success at any of these requires a better understanding of goal-directedness in ML systems, and a better idea of how to control the emergence and nature of learned objectives.</p>\n<p>More broadly, it seems that taking these worries seriously will require us to develop better tools for looking inside our AI systems and understanding how they work. In light of these concerns I feel pessimistic about relying solely on black-box alignment techniques. I want to be able to reason about what sort of algorithm is actually implemented by a powerful learned system if I am to feel comfortable deploying it.</p>\n<p>Right now, learned systems are (with maybe the exception of feature representation in vision) more-or-less hopelessly opaque to us. Not just in terms of goals, which is the topic here—most aspects of their cognition and decision-making are obscure. The alignment concern about objectives that I am presenting here is just one argument for why we should take this obscurity seriously; there may be other risks hiding in our poor understanding of AI inner workings.</p>\n<h3>Where does this leave us?</h3>\n<p>In summary, whether a learned system is pursuing any objective is far from a trivial question. It is also not trivially true that a system optimised for achieving high reward is optimising for reward.</p>\n<p>This means that with our current techniques and understanding, we don’t get to know or control what objective a learned system is pursuing. This matters because in unusual situations, it is that objective that will determine the system’s behaviour. If that objective mismatches the base objective, bad things can happen. More broadly, our ignorance about the cognition of current systems does not bode well for our prospects at understanding cognition in more capable systems.</p>\n<p>This forms a substantial hole in our prospects at aligning prosaic AI. What sort of work would help patch this hole? Here are some candidates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Empirical work. Distilling examples of goal-directed systems and creating convincing scaled-down examples of inner alignment failures, like the maze agent example.</li>\n<li>Philosophical, deconfusion and theoretical work. Improving our conceptual frameworks about goal-directedness. This is a promising place for philosophers to make technical contributions.</li>\n<li>Interpretability and transparency. Getting better tools for understanding decision-making, cognition and goal-representation in ML systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These feel to me like the most direct attacks on the problem. I also think there could be relevant work to be done in verification, adversarial training, and even psychology and neuroscience (I have in mind something like a review of how these processes are understood in humans and animals, though that might come up with nothing useful), and likely in many more areas: this list is not intended to be exhaustive.</p>\n<p>While the present state of our understanding feels inadequate, I can see promising research directions. This leaves me hopeful that we can make substantial progress, however confusing these questions appear today.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-pjCGeDS7iZograZ9B-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>By “utility”, I mean something like “the goal pursued by a system”, in the way that it’s used in decision theory.

This will allow us notions of logical provability that aren't dependent on an arbitrary choice of formalism. By looking at all equivalent theories, weighted by simplicity, we can hope for a less arbitrary system of logical counterfactuals based on something thematically similar to proof length, although kind of more continuous with graduations of partly true.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This is the 3rd post of 5 containing the transcript of a podcast hosted by Eric Weinstein interviewing Peter Thiel.</em></p><h1>Interview</h1><h2>Student Debt</h2><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>It's like, again, if you come back to something as reductionist as the ever escalating student debt, you know, the bigger the debt gets, you can sort of think what is the 1.6 trillion, what does it pay for? And in a sense, it pays for $1.6 trillion worth of lies about how great the system is.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And so, the more the debt goes, the crazier the system gets, but also the more you have to tell the lies, and these things sort of go together. It's not a stable sequence. At some point this breaks. You know, again, I would bet on a decade, not a century.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, this is the fascinating thing, you, of course, famously started the Thiel Fellowship as a program which, correct me if I'm wrong on this, 2005 is when student debt became non-dischargeable even in bankruptcy.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes. The Bush 43 bankruptcy revision. If you don't pay off your student loans when you're 65 the government will garnish your social security wages to pay off your student debt.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right. This is amazing that this exists in a modern society. And of course, well, so let me ask, am I right that you were attacking what was necessary to keep the college mythology going, and you were frightened that college might be enervating some of our sort of most dynamic minds?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I think there are sort of lot of different critiques one can have of the universities. I think the debt one is a very simple one. It's always dangerous to be burdened with too much debt. It sort of does limit your freedom of action. And it seems especially pernicious to do this super early in your career.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And so, if out of the gate you owe $100,000, and it's never clear you can get out of that hole, that's going to either demotivate you, or it's going to push you into maybe slightly higher paying, very uncreative professions of the sort that are probably less good at moving our whole society forwards. And so I think the whole thing is extraordinarily pernicious.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I started talking about this back in 2010, 2000, it was already like controversial, but it was not, you know... younger people all agreed with me.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>The younger people did?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And it's a decade later, it's a lot crazier, we haven't yet completely won, but I think there are sort of more and more people who agree with this. I think at this point the Gen X parents of college students tend to agree, whereas I would say the baby boomer parents, you know, 15 years ago, would not have agreed.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The 2008 crisis was a big watershed in this too, where you could say the tracking debt, you know, roughly made sense as long as everything, all the tracked careers worked, and 2008 really blew up, you know, consulting, banking, you know, sort of a number of the more track professions got blown up, and so that was kind of a watershed.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I mean this is incredibly dangerous, but also, therefore, quite interesting, if you imagine that the baby boomers have, in some sense, in order to keep the structure of the university going, have loaded it up with administrators, have hiked the tuition much faster than even medical inflation, let alone general inflation, this becomes a crushing debt problem for people who are entering the system.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I saw a recent article that said that the company that, I think it's called Seeking Arrangements, which introduces older men and women with money to younger men and women with a need for money for some sort of ambiguous hybridized dating, companionship, financial transfer. And the claim was that lots of students were using this supposed sugar daddy-ing and sugar mommy, I don't know what the terminology is, in order to alleviate their debt burden.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It's almost as if the baby boomers, in so creating a system, are subjecting their own children to things that are pushing them towards a gray area a few clicks before you get to honest prostitution.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>No, look, I don't want to impute too much intentionality to how this happened.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>No, no, no, it's somewhat emergent.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I think a lot of these, it was mostly emergent, mostly these things people, you know, yeah, that we had sort of somewhat cancerous, we don't distinguish real growth from cancerous growth, and then once the cancer sort of the metastasizes at a certain size, you know, you have, you sort of somehow try to keep the whole thing going, and it doesn't make that much sense.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But yes, I think one of the reasons, one of the challenges in, on our side, let's be a little more self critical here, on this, is that the question we always are confronted with, well, what is the alternative? How do you actually do something?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And it's not obvious what the individual alternatives are. You know, on an individual level, if you get into an elite university, it probably still makes sense to go, you know, it probably doesn't make sense to go to number 100 or something like this.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Yeah, I think that's right.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>There is sort of a way it can still work individually even if it does not work for our country as a whole. And so, there are sort of all these challenges in coming up with alternate tracks.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I think in software there's some degree to which people are going to be hired if they're just good at coding, and it's not quite as critical that they have a computer science degree. You know, can one do this in other careers, other fields? I would tend to think one could. It's been slow to happen.</p><h2>Political Solutions for Students</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, so you and I have been excited about a great number of things that have been taking place outside of the institutional system, but one of the things that I continue to be mystified by is that we are somewhat politically divided, where you are well known as a conservative and I really come from a fairly radical progressive streak. So, we have this common view of a lot of the problems, but sometimes we come to very different ideas about how those problems should be solved.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Do you want to maybe just try riffing?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Sure.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Like, assume that we somehow found ourselves in possession of some degree of power, with an ability to direct a little bit more than we have currently. What would you do to create the preconditions - so not necessarily picking particular projects - but what would you try to do to create the preconditions where people are really dreaming about futures, both at a technological level, family formation, making our civil society healthier. Where would you start to work first?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, I'm always a little bit uncomfortable with this sort of question, because-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>You can turn it on me, too.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>... because I feel like, you know, we're not going to be dictators of the United States, and then, you know, there all sorts of things we could do if we were dictators. But certainly, I would look at the college debt thing very seriously. I would say that it's dischargeable in bankruptcy, and if people go bankrupt then part of the debt has to be paid for by the university that did it. There has to be some sort of local accountability. So, this would be-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Love that.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>... that would be sort of a more right wing answer.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The left wing answer is we should socialize the debt in some ways, and the universities should never pay for it, which would be more the, you know, Sanders-Warren approach. But so, that would be one version.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I think one of the main ways inequality has manifested in our society in the last 20, 30 years - I think it's more stagnation than inequality - but just on the inequality side it's the runaway housing costs, and there's sort of, there's a baby boomer version where you have super strict zoning laws so that the house prices go up, and the house is your nest egg. It's not a place to live, it's your nest egg for retirement. And I would, yeah, I would try to figure out some ways to dial all that stuff back massively.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And that's probably intergenerational transfer, where it's bad for the asset prices of baby boomer homeowners, but better for younger people to get started in sort of family formation or starting households.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>What do you think about the idea of a CED, a college equivalency degree, where you can prove that you have a level of knowledge that would be equivalent, let's say, to a graduating Harvard chemistry major, right? Or a fraction thereof, where you have the ability to prove that through some sort of online delivery mechanism, you can-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Great idea. I love it.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Yeah?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I think it's very hard to implement. Again, I think these things are hard to do, but great idea.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But look, we have all these people who have something like Stockholm syndrome, where they, you know, if you got a Harvard chemistry degree, and if you suspect that actually the knowledge could be had by a lot of people, and if it's just a set of tests you have to pass, that your degree would be a lot less special, you'll resist this very, very hard.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You know, if you're in an HR department, or in a company hiring people, you will want to hire people who went to a good college because you went to a good college, and if we broaden the hiring and said we're going to hire all sorts of people, maybe that's self-defeating for your own position. So, you know, I think one should not underestimate how many people have a form of Stockholm syndrome here.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I should've said earlier that the Thiel Fellowship, for those who don't know, is a program that has historically, at least began paying very young people who had been admitted to colleges to drop out of those colleges. So, they got to keep the idea that they'd been admitted to some fairly prestigious place, but then they were given money to actually live their dreams and not put them on hold.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes, it has been an extremely successful and effective program. It's not scalable.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, we had to hack the prestige status thing, where it was as hard, or harder, to get a Thiel fellowship than to get into a top university. And so, that's part that's very hard to scale.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>When I was looking at that program for you, one of the things that I floated was the idea that if you look at every advanced degree, like a JD, or an MD, a PhD, none of them seem to carry the requirement of having a BA, which is quite mysterious.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And if you fail to get a PhD, let's say, there's usually an embedded master's degree that you get as a going away present. And therefore, if you could get people to skip college, if you give them, perhaps, four years of their lives back, and you could use the first year of graduate school, which is very often kind of a rapid recapitulation of what undergraduate was, so everybody's on a level playing field, and then, worse comes to worst, people would leave with a master's. They would, in general, get a stipend, because a lot of the tuition is remitted to them in graduate programs. Is that a viable program to get some group of people who are highly motivated to avoid the BA entirely as sort of the administrator's degree rather than the professor's degree?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Let me see. There are all these different subtle critiques I can have, or disagreements, but yeah, I think the BA is not as valuable as it looks. I also think the PhD is not as valuable as it looks.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Oh, you know how to hurt a guy.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, I sort of feel it's a problem across the board. It strikes me that what you're proposing is a bit of an uphill struggle, because at the top universities the BA is the far more prestigious degree than the PhD at this point. So, if you're at Stanford or Harvard, you know, it's pretty hard to get into the undergraduate, and then you have more PhD students than you have undergraduates.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>There are all these people who are a very questionable track. They've made questionable choices. And they probably are going to have some sort of psychological breakdown in their future. You know, their dating prospects aren't good. There are all these things that are a little bit off.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So yeah, in theory, if you had a super tightly controlled PhD program, that might work, but you have to at least make those two changes. As it is, the people in graduate schools, like, it's like Tribbles in Star Trek. We have just so many, and they all feel expendable and unneeded, and that's not a good place to be.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And, whereas I think the undergraduate conceit is still that it's more K-selected instead of R-selected, that it's more that everybody is special and valuable. You know, that's often not true either.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, I'd be critical of both, and I think, but yeah, if we could have a real PhD that was the required, you know, that was much harder, and that actually led to sort of an academic position or some other comparable position, that would be good.</p><h2>Teleology</h2><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You know, one of the questions I always come back to in this, is what is the teleology of these programs? Where do they go? One of the analogies I've come up with, is I think elite undergraduate education is like junior high school football.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Junior high school football. I did not see that coming.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Playing football in junior high school is probably not damaging for you, but it's not going anywhere-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Ah, I see.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>-because if you keep playing football in high school, and college, and then professionally, that's just bad. And the better you are, the more successful you are, the less well it works.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And then the question is what's the motivational structure? And when I was an undergraduate in the 1980s there was still a part of it where you thought the professors were cool, it might be something you'd like to be at some point in the future, and they were role models, just like in junior high school football an NFL player would have been a role model.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>But now it just looks like brain damage in both sides.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And now we think it's, yeah, you're just doing lots of brain damage, and it's a track that doesn't work, and therefore the teleology sort of has broken down.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So undergraduate, part of the teleology was that it was preparing you for graduate school, and that part doesn't work, and that's what's gotten deranged. Then graduate school, well, it's preparing you to be a postdoc, and then, well, that's the postdoc apocalypse, or whatever you want to call it, postdocalypse.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Postdocalypse?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Postdocalypse.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>You heard it here, folks, postdocalypse.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But just at every step, I think, the teleology of the system is in really bad shape. Of course, this is true of all these institutions with fake growth that are sociopathic or pathological, but at the universities it's striking as very bad.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And I think this was already true in important ways back in the '80s, early '90s, when I was going through the system. And when I think back on it, I think I was most intensely motivated academically in high school, because the teleology was really clear. You were trying to get into a good college. And then, by the time I was at Stanford, it was a little bit less clear, by the time I was at law school, really unclear where that was going. And by the time I was 25 I was far less motivated than at age 18, and I think these dynamics are just more extreme than ever today.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>What I find so dispiriting about your diagnosis is first of all that I agree with it. Second of all, if we don't train people in these fields, if we don't get people to go into molecular biology, or bioinformatics, or something like that, we're never going to be able to find the low hanging fruit in that orchard. So, it seems to me that we have to find some way that it makes sense for a life to explore these questions.</p><h2>Conformity and Malthus</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>One of the things that I don't understand, and I don't know if you have any insight, is it feels to me that almost all of our institutions are carbon copies of each other at different levels of quality. And that there are only a tiny number of actually innovative institutions. It used to be that, you know, Reed college was sex, drugs, and Goethe, and you had St. John's with the great books curriculum that didn't look like anything else, or Deep Springs, and the university of Chicago was crazy about young people, but the diversity of institutions is unbelievably low. Is that wrong?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I think that's fair, but I would say the bigger problem with a lot of these fields is, yeah, I think we have to keep training people. I think we need to keep training people in physics or even these fields that seem completely dead, you know?</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>That’s super important.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But I think the question we have to always ask is how many people should we be training-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Way fewer.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>-and my intuition is you want the gates to be very tight.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>One of my friends is a professor in the Stanford economics department, and the way he describes it to me is they have about 30 graduate students starting PhDs in economics at Stanford every year. It's six to eight years to get a PhD. At the end of the first year, the faculty has an implicit ranking of the students, where they’ve sort of agreed who the top three or four are. The ranking never changes. The top three or four have, are able to get a good position in academia, the others not so much.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And, you know, we're pretending to be kind to people and we're actually being cruel.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Incredibly cruel.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And so, I think that if there are going to be - you know, it's a supply demand of labor - if there are going to be good positions in academia, where you can have a reasonable life, it's not a monastic vow of poverty that you're taking to be an academic, if we're going to have that, you don't want this sort of Malthusian struggle. If you have 10 graduate students in a chemistry lab, and you have to have a fistfight for a Bunsen burner or a beaker, and you know, and if some somebody says one politically incorrect thing, you can happily throw everyone, them all out of the overcrowded bus. The buses still overcrowded with nine people on it. That's what's unhealthy.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And so, yes, it would be mistake to say we should dial this down and have zero people in these fields.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right. But this is what's scary to me.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>That's not what I'm advocating, or what was being advocated here, but there is a point where if you just add more and more people in a starvation Malthusian context, that's not healthy.</p><h2>Power Laws</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, this gets to another topic which, I think, is really important, and it's a dangerous one to discuss, which is it seems to me that power laws, those distributions with very thick tails where you have a small number of outliers that often dominate all other activity, are ubiquitous, and that particularly with respect to talent, whether we like them or not, they seem to be present, where a small number of people do a fantastic amount of all of the innovation.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>What do we do, if power laws are common, to make people more comfortable with the fact that there is a kind of endowment inequality that seems to be part of species makeup? I mean, I don't even think it's just limited to humans.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I'm not convinced these sort of power laws are equally true in all fields of activity. You know, the United States was a frontier country in the 19th century, and most people were farmers, and presumably some people were better farmers than others, but everyone started with 140 acres of land, and there was this wide open frontier. Even if you had some parts of the society that had more of a power law dynamic, there was a large part that didn't. And that was what, I think, gave it a certain amount of health.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And yeah, the challenge is if we've geared our society saying that all that matters is education, and PhDs, and academic research, and that this has this crazy power law dynamic, then you're just going to have a society in which there are lots of people playing video games in basements or something like that.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So, that's that's the way I would frame it. But yeah, I think there definitely are some areas where this is the case. And then we just need, you know, we need more growth for the whole society. If you have growth, you'll have a rising tide that lifts all boats. So, it's the stagnation, is the problem.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, I've joked about this as we are not even communistic in our progressivism, because the old formulation of communism was from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs, and the inability to recognize different levels of ability. I mean, almost every mathematician or physicist who encountered John von Neumann just said, \"The guy is smarter than I am.\" He's not necessarily the deepest, or he did all of the great work, but you know when you're dealing with somebody who's able to employ skills that you simply don't have. I mean, I know I'm not a concert pianist, and-</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Right. Look, I don't know how you solve the social problem if everybody has to be a mathematician or a concert pianist. I want a society in which we have great mathematicians and great concert pianists. That seems that that would be a very healthy society. It's very unhealthy if every parent thinks their child has to be a mathematician or a concert pianist, and that's the kind of society we unfortunately have.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Next post on Friday will be <em>Political Violence and Distraction Theories</em>.</p>",

I’d guess about 80% of them. And how bad is not having a specific user in mind? So bad that I don't think they should even be considered a real startup, in the same way that Steve's argument about Acme wasn't a real argument.</p><h1>Every Startup's Demolishable Claim</h1><p>Every startup founder makes the same claim to themselves and to the investors they pitch for funding: \"We're going to make a lot of money.\" So what I do, naturally, is ask the founder to furnish a specific example of that claim: a hypothetical story about a single person who might be convinced to pay them a few bucks. And here's how the conversation usually goes:</p><br><blockquote><strong>Founder:</strong> We're going to make billions of dollars and have millions of users!</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Liron:</strong> Ok, what's a hypothetical example of how you give one specific user some value?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Founder:</strong> [Nothing]</blockquote><br><p>Maybe they don't literally say nothing, but they say something that doesn't count for one of these reasons:</p><ul><li>They answer in the abstract instead of giving the example I requested of how they might give value to a specific user</li><li>They choose a specific example wherein their startup's product or service isn't any better for their hypothetical user than the user's available alternatives</li></ul><p>At this point, I understand if you think I'm just knocking down a straw man, so here's a real example.</p><p><a href=\"https://golden.com\">Golden</a> is a 2-year-old startup with $5M in funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, and other notable investors.

But there are countless other companies I could have singled out instead. Remember, the <em>majority</em> of early-stage startups are operating in this same failure mode. There are enough examples of startups visibly failing this way that I've started a <a href=\"https://bloatedmvp.com\">blog</a> to collect them.</p><h1>The Value Prop Story Test</h1><p>When I chat with a founder about their new startup, or I look through the slide deck that they're using to pitch their idea to investors, the first thing I do is try to pull out what I call a <strong>Value Prop Story</strong>: one specific story wherein their startup gives somebody some value.</p><p>A well-formed Value Prop Story must fit into this template:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Describe a specific person with a specific problem</strong></li><li><strong>Describe their current best effort to solve their problem</strong></li><li><strong>Describe why it’s still a problem</strong></li><li><strong>Describe how their life gets better thanks to you</strong></li></ol><p>I've previously <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">observed</a> that telling a well-formed Value Prop Story doesn’t require you to show any market research or empirical evidence validating the quality of your idea. This is like how Steve didn't yet need to give us any empirical or theoretical justifications for his claim about Acme worker exploitation, he just needed to tell us a story about one hypothetical specific worker getting exploited in a specific way.</p><p>Who is a specific hypothetical person who will use your product, and in which specific scenario will they use it? That's it, that's the question most startups can’t answer.</p><p>Answering this question seems objectively easy to me, in the sense that a well-designed AI wouldn't stumble over it at all. What about for a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/r5H6YCmnn8DMtBtxt/you-are-a-brain\">brain</a> though, is it a tough mental operation?</p><p>Actually, I think you'll find that this is an easy mental operation if you actually have a good startup idea. Here's a Value Prop Story I wrote about my own startup without much trouble:</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nKJItZzS9qBlQXJMxYkViQ.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Describe a specific person with a specific problem</strong><br><em>23 year old male who can’t get a date</em></li><li><strong>Describe their current best effort to solve their problem</strong><br><em>He gets a Tinder account and does his best to use it on his own</em></li><li><strong>Describe why it’s still a problem</strong><br><em>His matches barely respond to his messages, and when they do, the conversation feels boring and forced. He uses it for 1 hour every day but only manages to get 1 date every 2 months.</em></li><li><strong>Describe how their life gets better thanks to you</strong><br><em>Once</em> <em><a href=\"https://relationshiphero.com/\">Relationship Hero</a></em> <em>coaches guide him through writing his</em> <em><a href=\"https://relationshiphero.com/conversations\">texts</a>, he suddenly has much better conversations that result in a date each week</em></li></ol><p>Since my startup actually has a broad range of use cases (clients come to us for help with a broad range of relationship issues), this Value Prop Story isn't particularly representative of what we do. Its job was merely to prove that there are more than zero plausible specific use cases for Relationship Hero, and it gets that job done.</p><p>Given how easy this exercise is - we're talking five minutes, tops - I find it mind-boggling that 80% of startups recklessly skip it and go straight to, um… whatever else they think startups are supposed to do. Paul Graham <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html\">writes</a>:</p><br><blockquote>Another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing that's actually essential: making something people want.</blockquote><br><p>Why would you spend time and money building a product when you can’t yet tell a specific Value Prop Story? I think it's because designing and building a product is fun and gives you a false sense of control. You can lie to yourself the whole time about the likelihood that you’ll eventually get people to use what you’re building.</p><p>But people usually <em>won’t</em> use what you’re building. Whenever a new startup excitedly launches their product for the first time, the most likely outcome is that they get literally <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/your-mvp-is-bloated-3e89131b3cb\">zero users</a>.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_%28book%29\">The Secret</a></em> famously claimed that wishing for something makes the universe give it to you, which is BS, but the converse is true: If you <em>haven’t</em> made a specific enough wish about what your initial market traction is supposed to look like, then the universe won’t give you any traction.</p><h1>The Extra-Powerful Sanity Check</h1><p>Is it healthy for us to be obsessed with judging startups and demolishing claims about their value propositions? When we say that a startup idea is bad on account of lacking a Value Prop Story, is it right and proper to feel pleased with ourselves, or are we being gratuitously adversarial?</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*A6gb3sci_dUY19CkQkcL7A.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:60%\"></figure></span><p>Along these lines, Mixpanel cofounder Suhail Doshi has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1165527737668255744\">tweeted</a>:</p><br><blockquote>I get little satisfaction stomping on someone's startup idea. It's so easy to. Somewhere deep, hidden in their abstract description is a distinct yet narrow problem worth solving that's significant. It's more fun to attempt finding it, together.</blockquote><br><p>I basically agree with this, and I basically agree with the commenters on my <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FfrWGCEhZJbkeFgww/the-power-to-demolish-arguments#comments\">demolish bad arguments</a> post who emphasized that we should seek to shine a light on whatever kernels of truth our conversation partner may have brought to the table.</p><p>But...</p><p>Have you ever <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity_check\">sanity checked</a> something?</p><p>A sanity check is like when you punch 583x772 into your calculator, and you quickly multiply the two rightmost digits in your head, 3 x 2 = 6, and then confirm that the calculator's output ends in a 6. If you ever accidentally punch the wrong sequence of keys into the calculator, then you'll be pretty likely to see the calculator's answer end in something other than a 6. It's a good use of two seconds of your time to calculate 3 x 2; you get a substantial dose of Bayesian evidence for your trouble.</p><p>The Value Prop Story test is likewise a sanity check for startup ideas. In theory, <em>of course</em> a startup founder who is already hiring a team of engineers and building a software product should be able to describe how one specific user will get value from that product. In practice, they often can't. And it's easy for us to quickly check.</p><p>Here's what's crazy though: We usually expect sanity checks to have a low rate of detecting failures. You expect to successfully multiply numbers on your calculator most of the time, but you do the 3 x 2 sanity check anyway because it's quick. But with the Value Prop Story test, you'll see a high rate of failures!</p><p>A sanity check with a high failure rate is a rare treat; it's an <em>extra-powerful</em> sanity check. When you're lucky enough to have an extra-powerful sanity check in your toolbox, don't make it a final step in your process, make it the <em>first</em> step in the process.</p><p>So here's how you can use the Value Prop Story test to upend the traditional order of operations for building a startup: First, repeatedly sanity check yourself with the Value Prop Story test until you pass it. Second, do everything else. In all seriousness, I've <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/the-lean-mvp-flowchart-add48d7bcbae\">recommended</a> that early-stage startup founders follow this flow chart:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hw-khmjVCrxxYoHwwXPx5w.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>But how should we treat founders who are stuck in the flowchart's \"Give Value to One Person\" stage?</p><p>When someone is struggling to pass a sanity check, that doesn't mean we should write off their potential to succeed. It means we should focus our effort on helping them pass the sanity check.</p><p>Applying the Value Prop Story test is like placing a low bar in a founder's path. Yes, the bar will trip the ones who aren't seeing it. But for the ones who do see the bar, they can step up onto it and then be on their way. And the next step in their path, such as building a quality product, or building a sales funnel, is sure to be a steeper one than that little first one.</p><p><strong>Next post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aNS2Qhq6JXReCQd22/the-power-to-make-scientific-breakthroughs\">The Power to Make Scientific Breakthroughs</a></p><p><strong>Companion post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JJxByXddxEDciG5dA/examples-of-examples\">Examples of Examples</a></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>What I previously took from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2MD3NMLBPCqPfnfre/cached-thoughts\">Cached Thoughts</a>  was primarily us failing to examine memes before trotting them out on cue. Some snippet of information A gets lodged *from outside* as the response to some question Q. Whenever Q appears we consult the lookup table and out pops A.<br/><br/>More recently I was reflecting on a pattern I have noticed in my work as a statistical programmer. I realised that I was following this pattern on a regular basis. In particular, by caching action sequences that worked.<br/><br/>It goes as follows. My code doesn&#x27;t work in situation Q, so try X. It still doesn&#x27;t work, so try Y. It still doesn&#x27;t work, so try Z. It works. So, when presented with failure Q do XYZ.<br/><br/>Clearly, this is not proper science. However, it is fairly effective. When presented with <em>that particular</em> kind of failure again, XYZ will make things work. However, change the problem slightly and XYZ may well fail because we don&#x27;t fully understand why it succeeded in the first instance.<br/><br/>Why not do proper science all the time then? I&#x27;d love to, in theory. However, if we look at just those three available actions: possibly the order matters, in which case there are 5 other orderings to explore. Possibly we could select some subsets to explore and there are four we didn&#x27;t examine at all yet {{Y}, {Z}, {X,Z}, {Y,Z}}. The length two subsets each have two orderings, so there are something like 12 remaining action sequences to try out <br/><br/>Of course, with intuition, many of action sequences could be dismissed. But the point is that it&#x27;s pretty time consuming and explodes with the action menu. The cost of testing is not just cognitive. E.g. suppose that testing one action sequence burns $1000 of resources, or training a model takes 24 hours. Or e.g. <em>you just need this thing to work</em> <em>right now</em> and have three ideas, do you faff about looking to understand the optimal solution or do you just throw all three at it and fix the problem?<br/><br/>So, I see why my brain often wants to stick with the tried and true method. The risky element is that it then wants to confabulate some reason why XYZ in particular worked. E.g. suppose X was ineffective and only YZ mattered, I&#x27;ll find I still want to tell a story about why X was important. Consciously I&#x27;m now trying to avoid this by saying something like, &quot;I suspected XYZ would work and it did, but I&#x27;m not sure how to credit that to the components.&quot;<br/><br/>What would a good heuristic for finding the minimal solution look like? I&#x27;m talking about general principles that could help pare back to minimal solutions independently of the underlying subject matter. My first thought would be to try substrings of the existing solution starting from the end (Z, YZ, Y). <br/><br/>The other issue is to make the action set legible. It&#x27;s easy to make changes in the world without clearly recording what those changes are or bucketing them into discrete containers. We may have an idea for an action W and implement it, but afterwards realise it could be decomposed into Y and Z. But if we don&#x27;t reflect on the decomposition, in future problem Q may well result in cache hit W. I&#x27;d certainly be interested in patterns people have for forcing these decompositions more regularly.<br/><br/>In summary: caching may save a lot more effort than I had previously given it credit for. While also routinely muddying my thinking much more often than I had though was the case, even in highly goal directed behaviour.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I'm going to subtly contradict my last post on logical counterfactuals. I now think that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BRuWm4GxcTNPn4XDX/deconfusing-logical-counterfactuals\">raw or actually-consistent counterfactuals</a> are just an especially useful model of what counterfactuals are as opposed to the be all and end all.</p><p><em>An Old Classic</em></p><p>You may have heard this one before: The Ship of Theseus is a very old ship, so old that all the original parts had been replaced. Is it still the Ship of Theseus? What if we gathered all of the original parts and used them to rebuild the ship? Would this new construct be the Ship of Theseus now?</p><p>If you've internalised the idea of the map and the territory, the answer should be clear. Terms like \"The Ship of Theseus\" are human constructions with no real existence. They can be defined in whatever manner is most useful.</p><p><em>Counterfactuals Don't Exist in the Universe</em></p><p>So let's start with regular counterfactuals. What are they? Do they exist in the universe itself? Unless you're a modal realist (ie. David Lewis and his clones) the answer is no. Given the exact state of universe and an agent, the agent can only make one decision*. In other words, counterfactuals are something we construct.</p><p>This means that it is a mistake to search for an objectively true definition. Just as in the Ship of Theseus, our expectation should be that multiple definitions could have value. Of course, some definitions may be more useful or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/peCFP4zGowfe7Xccz/natural-structures-and-definitions\">natural</a> than others and indeed, as I've argued, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BRuWm4GxcTNPn4XDX/deconfusing-logical-counterfactuals\">Raw Counterfactuals</a> are particularly natural. However, I wouldn't go as far as I went in that post where I argued that insofar any other kind of counterfactual had meaning, it was derived from Raw Counterfactuals. </p><p>Logical counterfactuals are no different. We may not know everything about logic, but this doesn't mean that logic could have been different. We can construct a model where we imagine that logic being different than it is, but there isn't a fact of the matter about how logic would be if 1+1=3 instead of 2 that exists as part of standard logic without any extensions, any more than counterfactuals exist in-universe without any extensions.</p><p><em>An Answer, Not a Question</em></p><p>Since counterfactuals don't have an objectively true definition, asking, \"What are counterfactuals?\" is a confused question. It'd be better to ask, \"What definitions of counterfactuals are useful?\", but then this is still kind of vague. A better answer is to figure out the kinds of questions that we tend to want to answer when counterfactuals arise. This will vary, but in general counterfactuals relate to problems that can be solved via iteration.</p><p><em>An Initial Question</em></p><p>Raw counterfactuals are especially important because they answer a particularly common kind of question related to partial knowledge. One common simplification is to assume that we can enumerate all the states of the universe that would match our given knowledge. Since states are only valid if they are consistent, the states we enumerate will be raw counterfactuals. Indeed, as I <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BRuWm4GxcTNPn4XDX/deconfusing-logical-counterfactuals#Raw_Counterfactuals\">previously argued</a>, most uses of CDT-style counterfactuals are justified in terms of how they approximate raw counterfactuals. Pretending an agent's magically decides to turn left instead of right at the last moment, isn't that different from assuming that the universe was slightly different so that agent was always going to turn left, but that this change wasn't ever going to affect anything else.</p><p><em>When the Story Breaks</em></p><p>So why doesn't the story end here? Why might we desire other notions of counterfactual? I won't claim that all of the following situations would lead to an alternative notion of counterfactual, but I wouldn't want to rule it out.</p><p>Firstly, the assumption in the previous question is that we already have abstracted out a world model; that is, for any observation, we have an idea of what worlds are possible and other relevant facts like probabilities. While this describes ideal Bayesian agents, it doesn't really describe more realistic agents who choose their model based at least somewhat upon their observations.</p><p>Secondly, we might sometimes want to consider the possibility that our logical assumptions or deductions might be incorrect. This is possible, but tricky, since as if our logic is incorrect, we'll be using our flawed logic to determine how to handle this issues.</p><p>Thirdly, it's not always immediately obvious whether a particular state is consistent or not. For example, if you know that you're a utility maximiser, then it would be inconsistent for you to pick any option that provides suboptimal utility, but if you knew the utility was suboptimal you wouldn't need to examine that option. It would often be useful to be able to assign a utility value to inconsistent situations so we could use the common technique of iterating over a list of possibly-inconsistent situations and pick whichever was assigned the highest utility.</p><p><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ambient_decision_theory\">Ambient Decision Theory</a> (much of which has been wrapped into FDT) takes advantage of this. You consider various counterfactuals (X chooses action1, action2, ect.), only one of which should be consistent given the fact that the program is a utility maximiser. The hope is that the only consistent result will represent the best move and it will in the right circumstance.</p><p><em>Inconsistency</em></p><p>This last strategy is neat, but it faces significant challenges. For one, what does it mean to say that when we choose the only consistent result we choose the best outcome? \"Best\" requires a comparison, which requires a value. In other words, we have assumes a way of assigning utility to inconsistent situations. What does this mean?</p><p>From a logically viewpoint, if we ever have P and Not P, then we have a contradiction and can prove anything. So we shouldn't strictly view these inconsistent situations as logical entities, at least in the classical sense. Instead, it may be more useful to view them as a datastructure and the utility function as something that extracts a particular element or elements, then runs a regular utility function over these.</p><p>For example, suppose we have:</p><blockquote>{mouse=alive, cat=alive, cat=dead}</blockquote><p>Viewed as logical propositions, we can prove that the mouse is also dead from the contradiction, but viewed as a datastructure, the mouse is only alive. This doesn't perfectly map to the situation where you're given an inconsistent list of logical propositions and told to look for contradictions, but it is close enough to be analogous as in either case, the inconsistent object is more a pseudo-logical object than a logical object. Similarly, we could imagine assigned a utility based upon the consistent part of such a datastructure.</p><p>So given these datastructures, we can define a notion of \"best\" for inconsistent situations, but this begs the question, \"Why do we care about the best such (inconsistent) datastructure?\" Do we only care about these inconsistent objects insofar as they stand in for an actually consistent situation? I suspect the answer could be no and I don't currently have a very good answer for this, but I'm hoping to have one soon. In any case, my previous stance completely dismissing these possibilities without solid reasons was too absolutionist for me to still maintain it.</p><p>*Quantum mechanics allows this to be a probability distribution, but then it's just probabilistically deterministic instead, so it only complicates the issue without really changing anything</p>",

It is the third part in a series of blog posts which motivate and introduce pieces of infrastructure intended to improve our ability to forecast novel and uncertain domains like AI.</em></p><h1>Background and motivation</h1><p>Through <u><a href=\"https://parallelforecast.com/\">our work on AI forecasting</a></u> in the recent year, we’ve tried to write many questions that track important facets of progress, and gained some experience in how hard this is; and how to do it better. </p><p>In doing this, we’ve found that most previous public attempts at writing AI forecasting questions (e.g. <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08807\">this</a></u> and <u><a href=\"http://existence.org/prediction-market-questions/\">this</a></u>) fall prey to several failure modes that worsen the signal of the questions; as did many of the questions we wrote ourselves. Overall, we think <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8y7DcSF4eAkXoru4u/ai-forecasting-dictionary-forecasting-infrastructure-part-1-2\">operationalisation is an unsolved problem</a></u>, and this has been the impetus behind the work described in this sequence of posts on forecasting infrastructure. </p><p>A previous great resource on this topic is <u><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/GovAIAgenda.pdf\">Allan Dafoe’s AI Governance Research Agenda</a></u>, which has an appendix with forecasting desiderata (page 52-53). This blog post complements that agenda by adding a large number of concrete examples. </p><p>We begin by categorising and giving examples of some ways in which technical forecasting question can fail to capture the important, intended uncertainty. (Note that the below examples are not fully fleshed out questions, in order to allow for easier reading.) We then describe the question database we’re open-sourcing.</p><h2>Ambiguity</h2><p>Terms that can have many different meanings, such as “AGI” or “hardcoded knowledge”.</p><h2>Underspecification</h2><p>Resolution criteria that neglects to specify how questions should be resolved in some possible scenarios.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><blockquote>This question resolves positively if an article in a reputable journal article finds that commercially-available automated speech recognition is better than human speech recognition (in the sense of having a lower transcription error rate). </blockquote><p>If a journal article is published that finds that in only in some domains commercially-available automated speech recognition is better (e.g. for HR meetings), but worse in most other domains, it is unclear from the resolution criteria how this question should be resolved.</p><h2>Spurious resolution</h2><p>Edge-case resolutions that technically satisfy the description as written, yet fail to capture the intention of the question.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p>Positively resolving the question:</p><blockquote>Will there be an incident causing the loss of human life in the South China Sea (a highly politically contested sea in the pacific ocean) by 2018?</blockquote><p>by having a battleship accidentally run over a fishing boat. (This is adapted from an actual question used by the Good Judgment Project.)</p><p>Positively resolving the question:</p><blockquote>Will an AI lab have been nationalized by 2024?</blockquote><p>by the US government nationalising GM for auto-manufacturing reasons, yet GM nonetheless having a self-driving car research division.</p><h2>Trivial pathways</h2><p>Most of the variance in the forecasting outcome of the question is driven by an unrelated causal pathway to resolution, which “screens off” the intended pathways. </p><p>A question which avoids resolution by trivial pathways is roughly what Allan Dafoe calls an “accurate indicator”: </p><blockquote>We want [AI forecasting questions] to be accurate indicators, as opposed to noisy indicators that are not highly correlated with the important events. Specifically, where E is the occurrence or near occurrence of some important event, and Y is whether the target has been reached, we want P(not Y|not E)~1, and P(Y | E) ~1. An indicator may fail to be informative if it can be “gamed” in that there are ways of achieving the indicator without the important event being near. It may be a noisy indicator if it depends on otherwise irrelevant factors, such as whether a target happens to take on symbolic importance as the focus of research”. </blockquote><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p>Forecasting</p><blockquote>When will there be a superhuman Angry Birds agent using no hardcoded knowledge?</blockquote><p>and realizing that there seems to be little active interest in the yearly benchmark competition (with performance even declining over years).

The resolution conditions have often been honed and improved through interaction with forecasters. Moreover, in cases where the questions stem from elsewhere, such as the <u><a href=\"http://existence.org/prediction-market-questions/\">BERI open-source question set</a></u>, or the <u><a href=\"https://aiindex.org/\">AI Index</a></u>, we’ve often spent a substantial amount of time improving the resolution conditions in cases where they were lacking. </p><p>Of particular interest might be the column “Robustness”, which tracks our overall estimate of the quality of questions -- that is, the extent to which they avoid suffering from the failure modes listed above. For example, the question:</p><blockquote>By 2021, will a neural model reach &gt;=70% performance on a high school mathematics exam?</blockquote><p>is based on a <u><a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1gR5iR5FX\">2019 DeepMind paper</a></u>, and on the face of it liable to several of the failure modes above. </p><p>Yet it’s robustness is rated as “high”, since we have specified a detailed resolution condition as: </p><blockquote>By 2021, will there EITHER…</blockquote><blockquote>1. … be a credible report of a neural model with a score of &gt;=70% on the task suite used in the 2019 DeepMind paper…</blockquote><blockquote>2.

OR be a neural model with performance on another benchmark judge by a council of experts to be equally impressive, with 95% confidence?</blockquote><p>The question can still fail in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy\">winner’s curse/Goodharting-style cases</a>, where the best performing algorithm on a particular benchmark overestimates progress in that domain, simply because selecting for benchmark performance also selects for overfitting to the benchmark as opposed to mastering the underlying challenge. We don’t yet have a good default way of resolving such questions in a robust manner. </p><h3>How to contribute to the database</h3><p>We welcome contributions to the database.

Ok, so, would you say you're advocating for digital socialism, or more like digital libertarianism?</blockquote><p>Oh jeez. Not only is Steve's pal not pushing for Steve to be more specific, the pal is an enabler who pushes Steve to be <em>less</em> specific. They're climbing the ladder of abstraction the wrong way.</p><h1>The Ladder of Abstraction</h1><p>When you want to nail down a claim, the operative word is “down”: you want to bring the discussion down the <a href=\"https://eatingenglish.community.uaf.edu/the-ladder-of-abstraction/\">ladder of abstraction</a>:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*o-WEHxZxuH6Xcoar.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:70%\"></figure></span><p>If Steve says, “Information should be free!” and I'm trying to understand what he means, here's what I'd say:</p><blockquote><strong>Liron: </strong>Ok, why do you think I shouldn’t have had to pay Amazon for my paperback copy of <em>To Kill A Mockingbird?</em></blockquote><p>This way, I'm nosediving all the way down to the bottom rung of the ladder of abstraction. Down here, the conversation becomes grounded in the concrete language of everyday experience, with substantive statements like “Amazon charged my credit card $6.99 and kicked back $1.15 to Harper Lee’s estate.”</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wjCg_dOLleoHzqu6rhikRw.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:86%\"></figure>And how about that free shipping, Steve?</span><p>Having this kind of grounded discussion is usually more productive than having a flingfest of the higher level ballpit-words “information”, “freedom”, “socialism”, and “libertarianism”.</p><p>As Steve and I are hanging out on the bottom rung of the ladder of abstraction, talking through specific examples of information getting exchanged freely vs. non-freely, we’ll be able to notice if certain features seem to remain constant across our chosen examples. For instance, we might discuss various hypothetical authors who yearn to write books for a living, and observe that all such authors can still have some plausible mechanism to earn money (running ads on their blogs?), even without directly charging for the privilege of reading their books.</p><p>After loading our brains with specific examples, we can then abstract over these examples, climb our way back up the ladder of abstraction, and put forth a generalized claim about whether “information should be free”. Since we've been careful to think about specific example scenarios that our claim applies to, we'll be putting forth a coherent and meaningful proposition - a claim that others can study under the magnifying lens of specificity, not an empty claim that gets <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FfrWGCEhZJbkeFgww/the-power-to-demolish-arguments\">demolished</a>.</p><p>So when someone makes an abstract assertion like \"information should be free\", the best thing you can do is hold their hand and guide them down the ladder of abstraction. I know it’s tempting to skip that process and just attack or admire their original abstract claim. But show me two people discussing a topic in purely abstract terms, and I'll show you two people who are talking past each other.</p><h1>How To Slide Downward</h1><p>How do you take a concept and slide it down the ladder of abstraction to obtain a more specific concept? What mental operation must your brain perform?</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GKfPL6LQFgB49FEnv/replace-the-symbol-with-the-substance\">Replace the Symbol with the Substance</a>, Eliezer explains how to do it with baseball terms:</p><blockquote>You have to visualize. You have to make your mind’s eye see the details, as though looking for the first time.</blockquote><blockquote>Is that a “bat”? No, it’s a long, round, tapering, wooden rod, narrowing at one end so that a human can grasp and swing it.</blockquote><blockquote>Is that a “ball”? No, it’s a leather-covered spheroid with a symmetrical stitching pattern, hard but not metal-hard, which someone can grasp and throw, or strike with the wooden rod, or catch.</blockquote><blockquote>Are those “bases”? No, they’re fixed positions on a game field, that players try to run to as quickly as possible because of their safety within the game’s artificial rules.</blockquote><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Rq_Lf-L58V50Az9MYnrUJA.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:89%\"></figure></span><p>Or let's say we're discussing our country's education system. Eliezer would slide it down the ladder of abstraction like this:</p><blockquote>Why are you going to “school”? To get an “education” ending in a “degree”. Blank out the forbidden words and all their obvious synonyms, visualize the actual details, and you’re much more likely to notice that “school” currently seems to consist of sitting next to bored teenagers listening to material you already know, that a “degree” is a piece of paper with some writing on it, and that “education” is forgetting the material as soon as you’re tested on it.</blockquote><p>Let’s try it ourselves with the concept of a school “lecture”. What do we get when we slide it down the ladder of abstraction?</p><p><strong>\"A stage presentation of publicly-available educational material, hand-produced and performed by a professor who works at your educational institution, which you watch by locating yourself in a set building at a set meeting time, and which proceeds in a fixed order and at a fixed rate like broadcast television pre-YouTube.\"</strong></p><p>Wow. When you hear it that way, it raises a lot of questions:</p><ul><li>How about using the best educational materials from the internet as a course’s official materials? Those are surely better than what any professor in your school has ever performed.</li><li>How about making it a standard expectation for students to consume lectures at their own pace, including taking advantage of the pause and speed up / slow down features?</li><li>How about not forcing students to show up to a lecture hall at a specific time?</li></ul><p>If people had never heard the word “lecture”, if people were always forced to talk about lectures via a specific description of what a lecture is… well, then they would have killed off lectures by now.</p><p>I believe the college lecture is only alive today because the word “lecture” is a protective abstraction-bubble.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3upaXoodrOGn3q4-TMQkvA.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:70%\"></figure>I grabbed this out of Steve’s ball&nbsp;pit</span><p>If you crack open the protective shell of “lecture” and press your nose close enough, you breathe in the stinky innards: “a stage presentation of publicly-available educational material”.</p><p>If everyone involved with the university system — administrators, professors, parents, students — were themselves cracking open the shell and taking a whiff of “lecture”, they would have noticed when the expiration date passed (the day YouTube went mainstream) and taken out the trash.</p><p>Instead, we’ve landed in a weird place where the concept of a “stage presentation of publicly-available educational material” is ridiculous on its face, while our ears still tell us that the concept of a school “lecture” sounds pretty good.</p><h1>Ground Your&nbsp;Terms</h1><p>You probably know that to have a clear discussion (or just a clear thought), you need to define your terms. How do you define a term?</p><p>S. I. Hayakawa illustrates an attempt to define the term “red” by connecting it to concepts <em>higher up</em> the ladder of abstraction (h/t <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific\">Eliezer</a>):</p><blockquote>“What is meant by the word red?”<br>“It’s a color.”<br>“What’s a color?”<br>“Why, it’s a quality things have.”<br>“What’s a quality?”</blockquote><p>This approach of defining something by sliding it up the ladder of abstraction doesn’t feel productive. It might <em>help</em> define “red”, but it’s neither necessary nor sufficient to define “red”.</p><p>Similarly, when I asked Steve to define what “exploiting workers” means in regard to Acme, and he put forth “to use selfishly for one’s own ends”, we found ourselves no closer to understanding what the heck his point was supposed to be.</p><p>So how can we nail down “red”? How can we slide it <em>down</em> the ladder of abstraction? Hayakawa illustrates:</p><blockquote>“What is meant by the word red?”<br>“Well, the next time you see some cars stopped at an intersection, look at the traffic light facing them. Also, you might go to the fire department and see how their trucks are painted.”</blockquote><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*CDiDvwt3VD4i3Hwx.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:80%\"></figure></span><p>Now we’re getting somewhere. This is a good enough definition to satisfy someone who previously didn’t know what “red” means. Whenever we define a concept in this manner, by sliding it down the ladder of abstraction, we can call it <strong>grounding</strong> the concept.</p><p>Grounding is easy enough to do. Just follow Eliezer’s instructions from the previous section:</p><blockquote>You have to visualize. You have to make your mind’s eye see the details, as though looking for the first time.</blockquote><p>For example: What is fire?</p><p>If you know chemistry, you might <em>define</em> it as “rapid oxidation accompanied by heat and, usually, light”. But if you don’t know chemistry, what would you say? Most people would give up.</p><p>Don’t worry, just follow the instructions to ground it. Close your eyes and describe what you see:</p><p><strong>\"The bright orange heat and light that appears when I strike a match, and can sometimes be transferred to other things it touches, and keeps appearing as long as there is wood and air around it.\"</strong></p><p>Concepts have many definitions, and not all of them are groundings. But in daily life, grounding a term is usually as good as precisely defining it, if not better. So when a term is confusing, just slide that sucker down the ladder of abstraction.</p><h1>Effort and Risk Asymmetry</h1><p>If you observe your own stream of consciousness in a discussion, you might feel it being gently buoyed up the ladder of abstraction. You might start a discussion with a few specific statements about firetrucks, but before you know it you're talking about redness and colors in general.</p><p>Why is that? If the most productive kind of discussion is grounded and concrete, then why do so many people seem to relish the experience of pontificating and arguing abstractly?</p><p>Eliezer says in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JcpzFpPBSmzuksmWM/the-5-second-level\">The 5-Second Level</a>:</p><blockquote>Over-abstraction happens because it’s <em>easy </em>to be abstract. It’s <em>easier </em>to say “red is a color” than to pause your thoughts for long enough to come up with the example of a stop sign. Abstraction is a path of least resistance, a form of mental laziness.</blockquote><p>It seems our brain stores each concept with an easily-navigable pointer upward to its category (like red→color), but doesn’t store easily-navigable pointers downward to specific examples (like red→firetruck). I’m not sure what larger aspect of the brain's architecture accounts for this, but here's one observation about why the two operations are asymmetrical:</p><p>When you slide a concept up, you remove information. When you slide it down, you add information, and that requires you to make an arbitrary choice with more degrees of freedom. I think there's a sense in which going up the ladder of abstraction is <em>safer</em>, while going down is <em>riskier</em>: your underconstrained choice of specifics may leak information about you that your <a href=\"http://elephantinthebrain.com/\">elephant in the brain</a> is keen to monitor and filter.</p><p>Eliezer's description of how he intentionally sticks his neck out in arguments has always stayed with me (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/srge9MCLHSiwzaX6r/logical-rudeness\">source</a>),  and I suspect it's related to why we find abstraction appealing:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*XbsM-4nZTITp1MsC.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:84%\"></figure></span><blockquote>I stick my neck out so that it can be chopped off if I'm wrong, and when I stick my neck out it stays stuck out, and if I have to withdraw it I'll do so as a visible concession.&nbsp; I may parry[...] but I at least endeavor not to dodge.&nbsp;Where I plant my standard, I have sent an invitation to capture that banner; and I'll stand by that invitation.</blockquote><p>When you say something abstract, like \"information should be free\", the space of possible things you can mean is vast. You're not sticking your neck out, you're not affixing your neck to a precise location in claim-space, so you never have to fear that an opponent's sword might slash there.</p><p>Plus, as a bonus, vague statements make you sound smarter. You're signaling more intelligence and sophistication talking about \"digital libertarianism\" than about \"buying a paperback on Amazon\". That's why abstraction is appealing.</p><p>The upshot is that you'll have to make a sustained conscious effort to acquire the skill and habit of activating your specificity powers. But it'll be worth it.</p><p><strong>Next post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iMQmfgieRKY62MC3z/the-power-to-judge-startup-ideas\">The Power to Judge Startup Ideas</a></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>One and a half years ago, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/alkjash\">alkjash </a>published his <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qRxTKm7DAftSuTGvj\">Hammertime </a>sequence. Admittedly a bit late to the party I recently went through the 30 days together with a few other aspiring rationalists, who too may post their \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qRxTKm7DAftSuTGvj/p/Q7MsMshzbzhEs729s\">final exams</a>\" in the coming weeks.</p><p>The task was the following:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>Design a instrumental rationality technique.</li><li>Introduce a rationality principle or framework.</li><li>Describe a cognitive defect, bias, or blindspot.</li></ol><p>For each of these, we're supposed to spend 5 minutes brainstorming plus 5 minutes writing the text. This worked out for the brainstorming in my case, but the writing took somewhat longer, especially turning the whole thing into a semi-readable post (I couldn't figure out how to properly format stuff in here; took me 15 minutes to create proper headlines as they were never limited to my selection but turned my whole text into a headline, plus creating these fancy separators always removed big chunks of text; so, sorry about that).</p><br><h1><strong>Technique: Quantum Walk</strong></h1><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qRxTKm7DAftSuTGvj/p/N47M3JiHveHfwdbFg\">Murphyjitsu </a>is a CFAR technique that helps you bulletproof plans that might feel secure but in reality probably aren't. It makes you focus on all these things that <em>could</em> go wrong which you haven't taken into account yet.   </p><p>I propose a similar yet inverse method: picking goals that you're hesitant to set because they seem unreachable for whatever reason. Given you have such a goal, imagine that x months from now you will have reached it, and now think what course of actions may have brought you from where you are now to that point.<br>So here we are not looking for unforeseen failure modes, but instead for a hidden path to success, one that may make the difference between shying away from that goal, and making tangible progress toward it.<br><br>The reason I'm calling it \"quantum walk\" is twofold: Firstly, I couldn't think of any better name, as \"anti murphyjitsu\" sounds suboptimal. Secondly, I recently read Life on the Edge and am now primed to see quantum mechanics everywhere. One thing the book explained was how photosynthesis contains a step that only works due to quantum mechanics: some particle has to find a certain very specific spot to settle in. If that particle behaved in a classical way, finding that spot would be incredibly unlikely and the whole process of photosynthesis wouldn't actually work. Yet utilizing quantum laws the particle finds its way to its destination.<br>The technique's approach is similar in the way that you're not searching a way to the goal from where you are now. Instead you simply accept that the goal is reached in some hypothetical future situation, and backtrack from there. The analogy is weak, but at least the name has a certain ring to it.<br><br>For those interested, I suggest the following challenge: Pick any goal you'd like to have but are afraid to actually accept as a goal. In case you can't think of any, use the technique of picking any existing goal and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qRxTKm7DAftSuTGvj/p/7LmmZaqhL4TWsQdPN\">doubling its scale until it seems utterly ridiculous</a>. Now try to answer the question \"assuming x months from now I've reached that goal, what course of actions has led me there?\" and feel very free to share whether or not this has led you to any new insights.<br><br>(Disclaimer: my explanation of that photosynthesis phenomenon may be somewhat (or very) off, but as it's not really the point of the text I take that risk)<br></p><h1>Framework: Ask the Oracle</h1><p>There are times when we're trying to learn or understand something but aren't really getting anywhere. Whether it's learning some esoteric concept in physics class, assembling a piece of furniture, setting up a computer or debugging a piece of code. Sometimes these cases seem really obscure and highly confusing - we don't even know where to start, let alone how to solve the issue. As aspiring rationalists we're aware that this confusion stems not from the territory itself but from the map we're using, yet we feel unable to adjust our map accordingly: it's so distant from the territory that banging our head against the wall may seem just as promising a step as any other we could possibly think of.<br><br>There is one thing we have control about however: becoming an expert on our own confusion. Only after whe know exactly what we don't understand and why can we take the necessary steps to fill in the gaps and slowly get to a higher vantage point. One way to approach this is to ask oneself which question, if answered by a hypothetical oracle that truthfully answers yes or no to any question that has a clear answer, would reduce one's confusion the most.</p><p>Tutoring often works in a way that the student struggles to understand a certain concept and thus the teacher tries to explain it to the student. Hence the teacher is more active and the student, in a comparably passive role, takes the consumed information and tries to add it to their mental model wherever it sticks. This framework turns things around and puts the student in the active role and any progress emerges from them instead of the teacher. The hypothetical teacher in this case - the oracle - is completely reactive and does nothing other than passively answering the student's enquiries.<br><br>In reality of course there is no oracle. At best there's another person with an understanding that exceeds yours. At worst there's still the internet and text books.</p><p>I personally often find myself in the situation that I struggle with something, say some API I want to use in a web application but it doesn't behave as expected, and I get frustrated and blame outside sources such as the developer of that API or the bad documentation. This framework forces me to take full responsibility and focus on what actually matters, which is <em>what exactly is currently limiting my understanding and what I could do to change that</em>. Once I have a set of questions the answers to which would allow me to progress, the process of finding answers to these questions is often easier than expected. I tend to focus so much on wanting to find <em>answers </em>that I forget to realize the crucial part is to come up with the right <em>questions</em>. And the latter doesn't depend on the territory to which I'm lacking access, but entirely on my personal map.</p><br><h1>Bias: Sunk Meaning</h1><p>We all know the concept of \"sunk cost\", usually in the context of money, time, effort or some other limited resource. I'd like to discuss a related idea which could be called \"sunk meaning\".<br><br>Imagine a cow is slaughtered because somebody wants to eat its meat. For whatever reason, that meat turns out to be unusable and cannot be consumed. The only thing that remains which could be utilized in any way is the cow's skin.</p><p>You are now invited as the expert on whether to skin the cow in order to produce some leather or not, and you know with certainty that doing so would cost exactly X resources (including time, money, material etc.). You also know there's a new innovative method to synthetize perfect leather indistinguishable from animal leather but without using an animal, which <em>also</em> costs exactly X resources. You also happen to own a waste dematerializer, so getting rid of the cow's remains is not an issue whichever action you choose.<br>You have these two options, each exactly equally expensive and with exactly the same outcome. Which option would you prefer, if any?<br><br>I'd assume more than half of all people would feel like using the cow is the reasonable option here, for some reason similar to \"otherwise the cow would have died for nothing\". I recently experienced a member of the rationalist community use that exact line of reasoning.</p><p>To this I counter the following: <em>causality never moves back in time</em>.</p><p>A present action can have no causal effect on something that happened in the past. Using pieces of the cow today does not affect the death of the cow in any real way. Saying \"otherwise the cow would have died for nothing\" <em>says nothing about the cow</em> or its death, only about <em>our personal current interpretation</em>. The thing that may or may not improve by us using the cow instead of the synthetic method has nothing to do with what the argument states, instead it has everything to do with how we personally feel.<br><br>The thing I'm hinting at is that every time we feel like something <em>gives meaning to the past</em>, we should be aware that this is 100% imaginary. It may certainly affect how people feel and behave and as such has to be taken seriously, but the same is true for sunk cost, and we should at the very least be that honest when communicating that issue. Falling for sunk meaning is just as (ir)rational as falling for sunk cost.<br>We're not using the cow's skin because it gives meaning to the cow's death or because it makes it less of a waste. We're using the cow's skin to feel better.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><b>I.</b></p>\n<p>I recently reviewed <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/12/book-review-secular-cycles/\">Secular Cycles</a>, which presents a demographic-structural theory of the growth and decline of pre-industrial civilizations. When land is plentiful, population grows and the economy prospers. When land reaches its carrying capacity and income declines to subsistence, the area is at risk of famines, diseases, and wars – which kill enough people that land becomes plentiful again. During good times, elites prosper and act in unity; during bad times, elites turn on each other in an age of backstabbing and civil strife. It seemed pretty reasonable, and authors Peter Turchin and Sergey Nefedov had lots of data to support it.</p>\n<p><i>Ages of Discord</i> is Turchin’s attempt to apply the same theory to modern America. There are many reasons to think this shouldn’t work, and the book does a bad job addressing them. So I want to start by presenting Turchin’s data showing such cycles exist, so we can at least see why the hypothesis might be tempting. Once we’ve seen the data, we can decide how turned off we want to be by the theoretical problems.</p>\n<p>The first of Turchin’s two cyclic patterns is a long cycle of national growth and decline. In <i>Secular Cycles</i>‘ pre-industrial societies, this pattern lasted about 300 years; in <i>Ages of Discord</i>‘s picture of the modern US, it lasts about 150:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord1.png\" /></p>\n<p>This summary figure combines many more specific datasets. For example, archaeologists frequently assess the prosperity of a period by the heights of its skeletons. Well-nourished, happy children tend to grow taller; a layer with tall skeletons probably represents good times during the relevant archaeological period; one with stunted skeletons probably represents famine and stress. What if we applied this to the modern US?</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord2.png\" /><br />\n<i>Average US height and life expectancy over time. As far as I can tell, the height graph is raw data. The life expectancy graph is the raw data minus an assumed constant positive trend – that is, given that technological advance is increasing life expectancy at a linear rate, what are the other factors you see when you subtract that out? The exact statistical logic be buried in Turchin’s source (Historical Statistics of the United States, Carter et al 2004), which I don’t have and can’t judge.</i></p>\n<p>This next graph is the median wage divided by GDP, a crude measure of income equality:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord3.png\" /><br />\n<i>Lower values represent more inequality.</i></p>\n<p>This next graph is median female age at first marriage. Turchin draws on research suggesting this tracks social optimism. In good times, young people can easily become independent and start supporting a family; in bad times, they will want to wait to make sure their lives are stable before settling down:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord4.png\" /></p>\n<p>This next graph is Yale tuition as a multiple of average manufacturing worker income. To some degree this will track inequality in general, but Turchin thinks it also measures something like “difficulty of upward mobility”:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord5.png\" /></p>\n<p>This next graph shows DW-NOMINATE’s “Political Polarization Index”, a complicated metric occasionally used by historians of politics. It measures the difference in voting patterns between the average Democrat in Congress and the average Republican in Congress (or for periods before the Democrats and Republicans, whichever two major parties there were). During times of low partisanship, congressional votes will be dominated by local or individual factors; during times of high partisanship, it will be dominated by party identification:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord6.png\" /></p>\n<p>I’ve included only those graphs which cover the entire 1780 – present period; the book includes many others that only cover shorter intervals (mostly the more recent periods when we have better data). All of them, including the shorter ones not included here, reflect the same general pattern. You can see it most easily if you standardize all the indicators to the same scale, match the signs so that up always means good and down always means bad, and put them all together:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord7.png\" /><br />\nNote that these aren’t exactly the same indicators I featured above; we’ll discuss immigration later.</p>\n<p>The “average” line on this graph is the one that went into making the summary graphic above. Turchin believes that after the American Revolution, there was a period of instability lasting a few decades (eg Shays’ Rebellion, Whiskey Rebellion) but that America reached a maximum of unity, prosperity, and equality around 1820. Things gradually got worse from there, culminating in a peak of inequality, misery, and division around 1900. The reforms of the Progressive Era gradually made things better, with another unity/prosperity/equality maximum around 1960. Since then, an increasing confluence of negative factors (named here as the Reagan Era trend reversal, but Turchin admits it began before Reagan) has been making things worse again.</p>\n<p><b>II.</b></p>\n<p>Along with this “grand cycle” of 150 years, Turchin adds a shorter instability cycle of 40-60 years. This is the same 40-60 year instability cycle that appeared in <i>Secular Cycles</i>, where Turchin called it “the bigenerational cycle”, or the “fathers and sons cycle”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord8.png\" /><br />\n<i>Timing and intensity of internal war in medieval and early modern England, from Turchin and Nefedov 2009.</i></p>\n<p>The derivation of this cycle, explained on pages 45 – 58 of <i>Ages of Discord</i>, is one of the highlights of the book. Turchin draws on the kind of models epidemiologists use to track pandemics, thinking of violence as an infection and radicals as plague-bearers. You start with an unexposed vulnerable population. Some radical – patient zero – starts calling for violence. His ideas spread to a certain percent of people he interacts with, gradually “infecting” more and more people with the “radical ideas” virus. But after enough time radicalized, some people “recover” – they become exhausted with or disillusioned by conflict, and become pro-cooperation “active moderates” who are impossible to reinfect (in the epidemic model, they are “inoculated”, but they also have an ability without a clear epidemiological equivalent to dampen radicalism in people around them). As the rates of radicals, active moderates, and unexposed dynamically vary, you get a cyclic pattern. First everyone is unexposed. Then radicalism gradually spreads. Then active moderation gradually spreads, until it reaches a tipping point where it triumphs and radicalism is suppressed to a few isolated reservoirs in the population. Then the active moderates gradually die off, new unexposed people are gradually born, and the cycle starts again. Fiddling with all these various parameters, Turchin is able to get the system to produce 40-60 year waves of instability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord9.png\" /></p>\n<p>To check this empirically, Turchin tries to measure the number of “instability events” in the US over various periods. He very correctly tries to use lists made by others (since they are harder to bias), but when people haven’t catalogued exactly the kind of instability he’s interested in over the entire 1780 – present period, he sometimes adds his own interpretation. He ends up summing riots, lynchings, terrorism (including assassinations), and mass shootings – you can see his definition for each of these starting on page 114; the short version is that all the definitions seem reasonable but inevitably include a lot of degrees of freedom.</p>\n<p>When he adds all this together, here’s what happens:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord10.png\" /></p>\n<p>Political instability / violent events show three peaks, around 1870, 1920, and 1970.</p>\n<p>The 1870 peak includes the Civil War, various Civil War associated violence (eg draft riots), and the violence around Reconstruction (including the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and related violence to try to control newly emancipated blacks).</p>\n<p>The 1920 peak includes the height of the early US labor movement. Turchin discusses the Mine War, an “undeclared war” from 1920-1921 between bosses and laborers in Appalachian coal country:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although it started as a labor dispute, it eventually turned into the largest armed insurrection in US history, other than the Civil War. Between 10,000 and 15,000 miners armed with rifles fought thouasnds of strike-breakers and sheriff’s deputies, called the Logan Defenders. The insurrection was ended by the US Army. While such violent incidents were exceptional, they took place against a background of a general “class war” that had been intensifying since the violent teens. “In 1919 nearly four million workers (21% of the workforce) took disruptive action in the face of employer reluctance to recognize or bargain with unions” (Domhoff and Webber, 2011:74).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Along with labor violence, 1920 was also a peak in racial violence:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Race-motivated riots also peaked around 1920. The two most serious such outbreaks were the Red Summer of 1919 (McWhirter 2011) and the Tulsa (Oklahoma) Race Riot. The Red Summer involved riots in more than 20 cities across the United States and resulted in something like 1,000 fatalities. The Tulsa riot in 1921, which caused about 300 deaths, took on an aspect of civil war, in which thousands of whites and blacks, armed with firearms, fought in the streets, and most of the Greenwood District, a prosperous black neighborhood, was destroyed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And terrorism:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The bombing campaign by Italian anarchists (“Galleanists”) culminated in the 1920 explosion on Wall Street, which caused 38 fatalities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The same problems: labor unrest, racial violence, terrorism – repeated during the 1970s spike. Instead of quoting Turchin on this, I want to quote <a href=\"https://status451.com/2017/01/20/days-of-rage/\">this Status 451 review</a> of <i>Days of Rage</i>, because it blew my mind:</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>“People have completely forgotten that in 1972 we had over nineteen hundred domestic bombings in the United States.” — Max Noel, FBI (ret.)</i></p>\n<p>Recently, I had my head torn off by a book: Bryan Burrough’s Days of Rage, about the 1970s underground. It’s the most important book I’ve read in a year. So I did a series of running tweetstorms about it, and Clark asked me if he could collect them for posterity. I’ve edited them slightly for editorial coherence.</p>\n<p>Days of Rage is important, because this stuff is forgotten and it shouldn’t be. The 1970s underground wasn’t small. It was hundreds of people becoming urban guerrillas. Bombing buildings: the Pentagon, the Capitol, courthouses, restaurants, corporations. Robbing banks. Assassinating police. People really thought that revolution was imminent, and thought violence would bring it about.</p>\n<p>One thing that Burrough returns to in Days of Rage, over and over and over, is how forgotten so much of this stuff is. Puerto Rican separatists bombed NYC like 300 times, killed people, shot up Congress, tried to kill POTUS (Truman). Nobody remembers it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The passage speaks to me because – yeah, nobody remembers it. This is also how I feel about the 1920 spike in violence. I’d heard about the Tulsa race riot, but the Mine War and the bombing of Wall Street and all the other stuff was new to me. This matters because my intuitions before reading this book would not have been that there were three giant spikes in violence/instability in US history located fifty years apart. I think the lesson I learn is not to trust my intuitions, and to be a little more sympathetic to Turchin’s data.</p>\n<p>One more thing: the 1770 spike was obviously the American Revolution and all of the riots and communal violence associated with it (eg against Tories). Where was the 1820 spike? Turchin admits it didn’t happen. He says that because 1820 was the absolute best part of the 150 year grand cycle, everybody was so happy and well-off and patriotic that the scheduled instability peak just fizzled out. Although Turchin doesn’t mention it, you could make a similar argument that the 1870 spike was especially bad (see: the entire frickin’ Civil War) because it hit close to (though not exactly at) the worst part of the grand cycle. 1920 hit around the middle, and 1970 during a somewhat-good period, so they fell in between the nonissue of 1820 and the disaster of 1870.</p>\n<p><b>III.</b></p>\n<p>I haven’t forgotten the original question – what drives these 150 year cycles of rise and decline – but I want to stay with the data just a little longer. Again, these data are really interesting. Either some sort of really interesting theory has to be behind them – or they’re just low-quality data cherry-picked to make a point. Which are they? Here are a couple of <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/spot-checks\">spot-checks</a> to see if the data are any good.</p>\n<p>First spot check: can I confirm Turchin’s data from independent sources?</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/23/why-the-dutch-are-so-tall/\">Here</a> is a graph of average US height over time which seems broadly similar to Turchin’s.</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/american-growth-and-inequality-1700\">Here</a> is a different measure of US income inequality over time, which again seems broadly similar to Turchin’s. <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/24/book-review-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/\">Piketty</a> also presents very similar data, though his story places more emphasis on the World Wars and less on the labor movement.</p>\n<p>– The Columbia Law Review measures <a href=\"https://columbialawreview.org/content/congressional-polarization-terminal-constitutional-dysfunction-2/\">political polarization over time</a> and gets mostly the same numbers as Turchin.</p>\n<p>I’m going to consider this successfully checked; Turchin’s data all seem basically accurate.</p>\n<p>Second spot check: do other indicators Turchin didn’t include confirm the pattern he detects, or did he just cherry-pick the data series that worked? Spoiler: I wasn’t able to do this one. It was too hard to think of measures that should reflect general well-being and that we have 200+ years of unconfounded data for. But here are my various failures:</p>\n<p>– The <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-have-us-mortality-rates-changed-over-time-2018-01-04\">annual improvement in mortality rate</a> does not seem to follow the cyclic pattern. But isn’t this more driven by a few random factors like smoking rates and the logic of technological advance?</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://ourfiniteworld.com/2018/01/09/will-the-world-economy-continue-to-roll-along-in-2018/u-s-treasury-bond-interest-rate-history-1900-to-2010/\">Treasury bonds</a> maybe kind of follow the pattern until 1980, after which they go crazy.</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"http://www.allianceformarriage.org/causes-and-risks-for-divorce/\">Divorce rates</a> look kind of iffy, but isn’t that just a bunch of random factors?</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/06/long-term-trend-in-homicide-rates.html\">Homicide rates</a>, with the general downward trend removed, sort of follow the pattern, except for the recent decline?</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/articles/1325/the-200-year-pound-to-dollar-exchange-rate-history-from-5-in-1800s-to-todays.html\">USD/GBP exchange rates</a> don’t show the pattern at all, but that could be because of things going on in Britain?</p>\n<p>The thing is – really I have no reason to expect divorce rates, homicide rates, exchange rates etc to track national flourishing. For one thing, they may just be totally unrelated. For another, even if they were tenuously related, there are all sorts of other random factors that can affect them. The problem is, I would have said this was true for height, age at first marriage, and income inequality too, before Turchin gave me convincing-sounding stories for why it wasn’t. I think my lesson is that I have no idea which indicators should vs. shouldn’t follow a secular-cyclic pattern and so I can’t do this spot check against cherry-picking the way I hoped.</p>\n<p>Third spot check: common sense. Here are some things that stood out to me:</p>\n<p>– The Civil War is at a low-ish part of the cycle, but by no means the lowest.</p>\n<p>– The Great Depression happened at a medium part of the cycle, when things should have been quickly getting better.</p>\n<p>– Even though there was a lot of new optimism with Reagan, continuing through the Clinton years, the cycle does not reflect this at all.</p>\n<p>Maybe we can rescue the first and third problem by combining the 150 year cycle with the shorter 50 year cycle. The Civil War was determined by the 50-year cycle having its occasional burst of violence at the same time the 150-year cycle was at a low-ish point. People have good memories of Reagan because the chaos of the 1970 violence burst had ended.</p>\n<p>As for the second, Turchin is aware of the problem. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is a widely held belief among economists and other social scientists that the 1930s were the “defining moment” in the development of the American politico-economic system (Bordo et al 1998). When we look at the major structural-demographic variables, however, the decade of the 1930s does not seem to be a turning point. Structural-demographic trends that were established during the Progressive Era continues through the 1930s, although some of them accelerated.</p>\n<p>Most notably, all the well-being variables that went through trend reversals before the Great Depression – between 1900 and 1920. From roughly 1910 and to 1960 they all increased roughly monotonically, with only one or two minor fluctuations around the upward trend. The dynamics of real wages also do not exhibit a breaking point in the 1930s, although there was a minor acceleration after 1932.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By comparison, he plays up the conveniently-timed (and hitherto unknown to me) depression of the mid-1890s. Quoting Turchin quoting McCormick:</p>\n<blockquote><p>No depression had ever been as deep and tragic as the one that lasted from 1893 to 1897. Millions suffered unemployment, especially during the winters of 1893-4 and 1894-5, and thousands of ‘tramps’ wandered the countryside in search of food […]</p>\n<p>Despite real hardship resulting form massive unemployment, well-being indicators suggest that the human cost of the Great Depression of the 1930s did not match that of the “First Great Depression” of the 1890s (see also Grant 1983:3-11 for a general discussion of the severity of the 1890s depression. Furthermore, while the 1930s are remembered as a period of violent labor unrest, the intensity of class struggle was actually lower than during the 1890s depression. According to the US Political Violence Database (Turchin et al. 2012) there were 32 lethal labor disputes during the 1890s that collectively caused 140 deaths, compared with 20 such disputes in the 1930s with the total of 55 deaths. Furthermore, the last lethal strike in US labor history was in 1937…in other words, the 1930s was actually the last uptick of violent class struggle in the US, superimposed on an overall declining trend. </p>\n<p>The 1930s Depression is probably remembered (or rather misremembered) as the worst economic slump in US history, simply because it was the last of the great depressions of the post-Civil War era.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth spot check: Did I randomly notice any egregious errors while reading the book?</p>\n<p>On page 70, Turchin discusses “the great cholera epidemic of 1849, which carried away up to 10% of the American population”. This seemed unbelievably high to me. I checked the source he cited, Kohl’s “Encyclopedia Of Plague And Pestilence”, which did give that number. But every other source I checked agreed that the epidemic “only” killed between 0.3% – 1% of the US population (it did hit 10% in a few especially unlucky cities like St. Louis). I cannot fault Turchin’s scholarship in the sense of correctly repeating something written in an encyclopedia, but unless I’m missing something I do fault his common sense.</p>\n<p>Also, on page 234, Turchin interprets the percent of medical school graduates who get a residency as “the gap between the demand and supply of MD positions”, which he ties into a wider argument about elite overproduction. But I think this shows a limited understanding of how the medical system works. There is currently a severe <i>undersupply</i> of doctors – try getting an appointment with a specialist who takes insurance in a reasonable amount of time if you don’t believe me. Residencies aren’t limited by organic demand. They’re limited because the government places so many restrictions on them that hospitals don’t sponsor them without government funding, and the government is too stingy to fund more of them. None of this has anything to do with elite overproduction.</p>\n<p>These are just two small errors in a long book. But they’re two errors in medicine, the field I know something about. This makes me worry about <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/65213-briefly-stated-the-gell-mann-amnesia-effect-is-as-follows-you\">Gell-Mann Amnesia</a>: if I notice errors in my own field, how many errors must there be in other fields that I just didn’t catch?</p>\n<p>My overall conclusion from the spot-checks is that the data as presented are basically accurate, but that everything else is so dependent on litigating which things are vs. aren’t in accordance with the theory that I basically give up.</p>\n<p><b>IV.</b></p>\n<p>Okay. We’ve gone through the data supporting the grand cycle. We’ve gone through the data and theory for the 40-60 year instability cycle. We’ve gone through the reasons to trust vs. distrust the data. Time to go back to the question we started with: why should the grand cycle, originally derived from the Malthusian principles that govern pre-industrial societies, hold in the modern US? Food and land are no longer limiting resources; famines, disease, and wars no longer substantially decrease population. Almost every factor that drives the original secular cycle is missing; why even consider the possibility that it might still apply?</p>\n<p>I’ve put this off because, even though this is the obvious question <i>Ages of Discord</i> faces from page one, I found it hard to get a single clear answer.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Turchin talks about the supply vs. demand of labor. In times when the supply of labor outpaces demand, wages go down, inequality increases, elites fragment, and the country gets worse, mimicking the “land is at carrying capacity” stage of the Malthusian cycle. In times when demand for labor exceeds supply, wages go up, inequality decreases, elites unite, and the country gets better. The government is controlled by plutocrats, who always want wages to be low. So they implement policies that increase the supply of labor, especially loose immigration laws. But their actions cause inequality to increase and everyone to become miserable. Ordinary people organize resistance: populist movements, socialist cadres, labor unions. The system teeters on the edge of violence, revolution, and total disintegration. Since the elites don’t want those things, they take a step back, realize they’re killing the goose that lays the golden egg, and decide to loosen their grip on the neck of the populace. The government becomes moderately pro-labor and progressive for a while, and tightens immigration laws. The oversupply of labor decreases, wages go up, inequality goes down, and everyone is happy. After everyone has been happy for a while, the populists/socialists/unions lose relevance and drift apart. A new generation of elites who have never felt threatened come to power, and they think to themselves “What if we used our control of the government to squeeze labor harder?” Thus the cycle begins again.</p>\n<p>But at other times, Turchin talks more about “elite overproduction”. When there are relatively few elites, they can cooperate for their common good. Bipartisanship is high, everyone is unified behind a system perceived as wise and benevolent, and we get a historical period like the 1820s US golden age that historians call <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings\">The Era Of Good Feelings</a>. But as the number of elites outstrips the number of high-status positions, competition heats up. Elites realize they can get a leg up in an increasingly difficult rat race by backstabbing against each other and the country. Government and culture enter a defect-defect era of hyperpartisanship, where everyone burns the commons of productive norms and institutions in order to get ahead. Eventually…some process reverses this or something?…and then the cycle starts again.</p>\n<p>At still other times, Turchin seems to retreat to a sort of mathematical formalism. He constructs an extremely hokey-looking dynamic feedback model, based on ideas like “assume that the level of discontent among ordinary people equals the urbanization rate x the age structure x the inverse of their wages relative to the elite” or “let us define the fiscal distress index as debt ÷ GDP x the level of distrust in state institutions”. Then he puts these all together into a model that calculates how the the level of discontent affects and is affected by the level of state fiscal distress and a few dozen other variables. On the one hand, this is really cool, and watching it in action gives you the same kind of feeling Seldon must have had inventing psychohistory. On the other, it seems <i>really</i> made-up. Turchin admits that dynamic feedback systems are infamous for going completely haywire if they are even a tiny bit skew to reality, but assures us that he understands the cutting-edge of the field and how to make them not to do that. I don’t know enough to judge whether he’s right or wrong, but my priors are on “extremely, almost unfathomably wrong”. Still, at times he reminds us that the shifts of dynamic feedback systems can be attributed only to the system in its entirety, and that trying to tell stories about or point to specific factors involved in any particular shift is an approximation at best.</p>\n<p>All of these three stories run into problems almost immediately.</p>\n<p>First, the supply of labor story focuses pretty heavily on immigration. Turchin puts a lot of work into showing that immigration follows the secular cycle patterns; it is highest at the worst part of the cycle, and lowest at the best parts:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/discord_immigration.png\" /></p>\n<p>In this model, immigration is a tool of the plutocracy. High supply of labor (relative to demand) drives down wages, increases inequality, and lowers workers’ bargaining power. If the labor supply is poorly organized, comes from places that don’t understand the concept of “union”, don’t know their rights, and have racial and linguistic barriers preventing them from cooperating with the rest of the working class, well, even better. Thus, periods when the plutocracy is successfully squeezing the working class are marked by high immigration. Periods when the plutocracy fears the working class and feels compelled to be nice to them are marked by low immigration.</p>\n<p>This position makes some sense and is loosely supported by the long-term data above. But isn’t this one of the most-studied topics in the history of economics? Hasn’t it been proven almost beyond doubt that immigrants don’t steal jobs from American workers, and that since they consume products themselves (and thus increase the demand for labor) they don’t affect the supply/demand balance that sets wages? </p>\n<p>It appears I might just be totally miscalibrated on this topic. I checked the <a href=\"http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/low-skilled-immigrants\">IGM Economic Experts Panel</a>. Although most of the expert economists surveyed believed immigration was a net good for America, they did say (50% agree to only 9% disagree) that “unless they were compensated by others, many low-skilled American workers would be substantially worse off if a larger number of low-skilled foreign workers were legally allowed to enter the US each year”. I’m having trouble seeing the difference between this statement (which economists seem very convinced is true) and “you should worry about immigrants stealing your job” (which everyone seems very convinced is false). It might be something like – immigration generally makes “the economy better”, but there’s no guarantee that these gains are evently distributed, and so it can be bad for low-skilled workers in particular? I don’t know, this would still represent a pretty big update, but given that I was told all top economists think one thing, and now I have a survey of all top economists saying the other, I guess big updates are unavoidable. Interested in hearing from someone who knows more about this.</p>\n<p>Even if it’s true that immigration can hurt low-skilled workers, Turchin’s position – which is that increased immigration is responsible for a very large portion of <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/25/wage-stagnation-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/\">post-1973 wage stagnation</a> and the recent trend toward rising inequality – sounds shocking to current political sensibilities. But all Turchin has to say is:</p>\n<blockquote><p>An imbalance between labor supply and demand clearly played an important role in driving real wages down after 1978. As Harvard economist George J. Borjas recently wrote, “The best empirical research that tries to examine what has actually happened in the US labor market aligns well with economic theory: An increase in the number of workers leads to lower wages.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>My impression was that Borjas was an increasingly isolated contrarian voice, so once again, I just don’t know what to do here.</p>\n<p>Second, the plutocratic oppression story relies pretty heavily on the idea that inequality is a unique bad. This fits the zeitgeist pretty well, but it’s a little confusing. Why should commoners care about their wages relative to elites, as opposed to their absolute wages? Although median-wage-relative-to-GDP has gone down over the past few decades, absolute median wage has gone up – just a little, slowly enough that it’s rightly considered a problem – but it has gone up. Since modern wages are well above 1950s wages, in way sense should modern people feel like they are economically bad off in a way 1950s people didn’t? This isn’t a problem for Turchin’s theory so much as a general mystery, but it’s a general mystery I care about a lot. One answer is that the <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/\">cost disease</a> is fueled by a Baumol effect pegged to per capital income (see part 3 <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/17/followup-on-the-baumol-effect-thanks-o-baumol/\">here</a>), and this is a way that increasing elite wealth can absolutely (not relatively) immiserate the lower classes.</p>\n<p>Likewise, what about <a href=\"http://spiritleveldelusion.blogspot.com/\">The Spirit Level Delusion</a> and other resources showing that, across countries, inequality is not particularly correlated with social bads? Does this challenge Turchin’s America-centric findings that everything gets worse along with inequality levels?</p>\n<p>Third, the plutocratic oppression story meshes poorly with the elite overproduction story. In elite overproduction, united elites are a sign of good times to come; divided elites means dysfunctional government and potential violence. But as <a href=\"https://pseudoerasmus.com/2014/04/13/anonimo/#comment-42887\">Pseudoerasmus points out</a>, united elites are often united <i>against</i> the commoners, and we should expect inequality to be highest at times when the elites are able to work together to fight for a larger share of the pie. But I think this is the opposite of Turchin’s story, where elites unite only to make concessions, and elite unity equals popular prosperity.</p>\n<p>Fourth, everything about the elite overproduction story confuses me. Who are “elites”? This category made sense in <i>Secular Cycles</i>, which discussed agrarian societies with a distinct titled nobility. But Turchin wants to define US elites in terms of wealth, which follows a continuous distribution. And if you’re defining elites by wealth, it doesn’t make sense to talk about “not enough high-status positions for all elites”; if you’re elite (by virtue of your great wealth), by definition you already have what you need to maintain your elite status. Turchin seems aware of this issue, and sometimes talks about “elite aspirants” – some kind of upper class who expect to be wealthy, but might or might not get that aspiration fulfilled. But then understanding elite overproduction hinges on what makes one non-rich-person person a commoner vs. another non-rich-person an “elite aspirant”, and I don’t remember any clear discussion of this in the book. </p>\n<p>Fifth, what drives elite overproduction? Why do elites (as a percent of the population) increase during some periods and decrease during others? Why should this be a cycle rather than a random walk?</p>\n<p>My guess is that <i>Ages of Discord</i> contains answers to some of these questions and I just missed them. But I missed them after reading the book pretty closely to try to find them, and I didn’t feel like there were any similar holes in <i>Secular Cycles</i>. As a result, although the book had some fascinating data, I felt like it lacked a clear and lucid thesis about exactly what was going on.</p>\n<p><b>V.</b></p>\n<p>Accepting the data as basically right, do we have to try to wring some sense out of the theory?</p>\n<p>The data cover a cycle and a half. That means we only sort of barely get to see the cycle “repeat”. The conclusion that it is a cycle and not some disconnected trends is based only on the single coincidence that it was 70ish years from the first turning point (1820) to the second (1890), and also 70ish years from the second to the third (1960). </p>\n<p>A parsimonious explanation would be “for some reason things were going unusually well around 1820, unusually badly around 1890, and unusually well around 1960 again.” This is actually really interesting – I didn’t know it was true before reading this book, and it changes my conception of American history a lot. But it’s a lot less interesting than the discovery of a secular cycle.</p>\n<p>I think the parsimonious explanation is close to what Thomas Piketty argued in his <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/24/book-review-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/\"><i>Capital In The Twenty-First Century</i></a>. Inequality was rising until the World Wars, because that’s what inequality naturally does given reasonable assumptions about growth rates. Then the Depression and World Wars wiped out a lot of existing money and power structures and made things equal again for a little while. Then inequality started rising again, because that’s what inequality naturally does given reasonable assumptions about growth rates. Add in a pinch of <i>The Spirit Level</i> – inequality is a mysterious magic poison that somehow makes everything else worse – and there’s not much left to be explained.</p>\n<p>(some exceptions: why was inequality decreasing until 1820? Does inequality <i>really</i> drive political polarization? When immigration corresponds to periods of high inequality, is the immigration <i>causing</i> the inequality? And what about the 50 year cycle of violence? That’s another coincidence we didn’t include in the coincidence list!)</p>\n<p>So what can we get from <i>Ages of Discord</i> that we can’t get from Piketty?</p>\n<p>First, the concept of “elite overproduction” is one that worms its way into your head. It’s the sort of thing that was constantly in the background of <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/15/increasingly-competitive-college-admissions-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/\">Increasingly Competitive College Admissions: Much More Than You Wanted To Know</a>. It’s the sort of thing you think about when a million fresh-faced college graduates want to become Journalists and Shape The Conversation and Fight For Justice and realistically just end up getting ground up and spit out by clickbait websites. <i>Ages of Discord</i> didn’t do a great job breaking down its exact dynamics, but I’m grateful for its work bringing it from a sort of shared unconscious assumption into the light where we can talk about it.</p>\n<p>Second, the idea of a deep link between various indicators of goodness and badness – like wages and partisan polarization – is an important one. It forces me to reevaluate things I had considered settled, like that immigration doesn’t worsen inequality, or that inequality is not a magical curse that poisons everything.</p>\n<p>Third, historians have to choose what events to focus on. Normal historians usually focus on the same normal events. Unusual historians sometimes focus on neglected events that support their unusual theses, so reading someone like Turchin is a good way to learn parts of history you’d never encounter otherwise. Some of these I was able to mention above – like the Mine War of 1920 or the cholera epidemic of 1849; I might make another post for some of the others.</p>\n<p>Fourth, it tries to link events most people would consider separate – wage stagnation since 1973, the Great Stagnation in technology, the decline of Peter Thiel’s <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/31/book-review-zero-to-one/\">“definite optimism”</a>, the rise of partisan polarization. I’m not sure exactly <i>how</i> it links them or what it has to stay about the link, but link them it does.</p>\n<p>But the most important thing about this book is that Turchin claims to be able to predict the future. The book (written just before Trump was elected in 2016) ends by saying that “we live in times of intensifying structural-demographic pressures for instability”. The next bigenerational burst of violence is scheduled for about 2020 (realistically +/- a few years). It’s at a low point in the grand cycle, so it should be a doozy.</p>\n<p>What about beyond that? It’s unclear <i>exactly</i> where he thinks we are right now in the grand cycle. If the current cycle lasts exactly as long as the last one, we would expect it to bottom out in 2030, but Turchin never claims every cycle is exactly as long. A few of his graphs suggest a hint of curvature, suggesting we might currently be in the worst of it. The socialists seem to have gotten their act together and become an important political force, which the theory predicts is a necessary precursor to change.</p>\n<p>I think we can count the book as having made correct predictions if violence spikes in the very near future (are the current number of mass shootings enough to satisfy this requirement? I would have to see it graphed using the same measurements as past spikes), and if sometime in the next decade or so things start looking like there’s a ray of light at the end of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>I am pretty interested in finding other ways to test Turchin’s theories. I’m going to ask some of my math genius friends to see if the dynamic feedback models check out; if anyone wants to help, let me know how I can help you (if money is an issue, I can send you a copy of the book, and I will definitely publish anything you find on this blog). If anyone has any other ideas for to indicators that should be correlated with the secular cycle, and ideas about how to find them, I’m intereted in that too. And if anyone thinks they can explain the elite overproduction issue, please enlighten me.</p>\n<p>I ended my review of <i>Secular Cycles</i> by saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One thing that strikes me about [Turchin]’s cycles is the ideological component. They describe how, during a growth phase, everyone is optimistic and patriotic, secure in the knowledge that there is enough for everybody. During the stagflation phase, inequality increases, but concern about inequality increases even more, zero-sum thinking predominates, and social trust craters (both because people are actually defecting, and because it’s in lots of people’s interest to play up the degree to which people are defecting). By the crisis phase, partisanship is much stronger than patriotism and radicals are talking openly about how violence is ethically obligatory.</p>\n<p>And then, eventually, things get better. There is a new Augustan Age of virtue and the reestablishment of all good things. This is a really interesting claim. Western philosophy tends to think in terms of trends, not cycles. We see everything going on around us, and we think this is some endless trend towards more partisanship, more inequality, more hatred, and more state dysfunction. But Secular Cycles offers a narrative where endless trends can end, and things can get better after all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is still the hope, I guess. I don’t have a lot of faith in human effort to restore <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/\">niceness, community, and civilization</a>. All I can do is pray the Vast Formless Things accomplish it for us without asking us first.</p>",

I don't know how clear that was. I am sorry to disappoint anyone who was looking for that. It's a sensible thing to be concerned about. I hope I'll study it later.</em></p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>In 1998, David Brin published a vision of a potentially inevitable societal shift towards all-encompassing democratised surveillance. It could not be called a panopticon, because those who patrol the observation house would be as visible as anyone else.</p><p>We would be able to watch our watchers.</p><p>Privacy would disappear, but many kinds of evil would go along with it.</p><p>The book was okay. It's definitely worth reading the first few chapters and some of Brin's reflections on the development of the internet are really interseting, but I found the rest very meandering and a little bit unsatisfying. I'm going to summarise my own understanding of radical societal transparency and why I'm convinced that it would be <strong>extremely good, actually</strong> so that I don't have to keep recommending the entire book, which didn't capture my stance very well.</p><p>I'm also going to go over some of the potential problems a transparent society would have, and explain why I'm not yet deterred by them. Some of them <em>could</em> turn out to be lethal to the idea, but that seems unlikely to me so far. I'm eager to explore those doubts until we're sure.</p><br><h2>Advantages</h2><p>It should not surprise anyone that a radically open society would have many advantages. Information is useful. If we know more about each other, we can arrange more trades, and we can trust each other more easily.</p><p>In order of importance:</p><ul><li>It would likely prevent most \"easy nuke\" technological x-risks discussed in Bostrom's black ball paper (<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\">Vulnerable Universe</a>)</li><ul><li>That is to say, if a very harmful technology rapidly emerges, for instance, a method for manufacturing a species-ending virus requiring only very common lab equipment, the transparent society would be able to police against it without any special laws. Every government could fail utterly to recognise the threat, and we might <em>still</em> be able to survive it; In this example, biotech workers would simply be able to watch each others' behaviour, make a note of it if anyone reads about this apocalyptic method, keeps copies of the method around, seems to be especially moody, or whether they have, you know, physically gone to the lab at 3am and started to actuate the method. The probability of the species one day being wiped out by a few unbalanced individuals wielding humanity's inevitably growing powers decreases dramatically.</li><li>The easy nukes concern is most often dismissed with an argument that as technology gets stronger, we will also find new technologies to police its misuse. My answer to that is that, yes, that's what the transparent society is. What were you expecting. Some kind of anti-biotech that would cancel the dangerous biotech out? (I do not envy whoever has to think about securing the human body against its many attack vectors) This <em>is</em> the technology that will police against the misuse of other technologies, now help us to deploy it.</li><li>Bostrom discusses surveillance, but does not discuss this position that a surveillance state might be less inclined to tyranny and more liveable if we stopped torturing ourselves with this impossible project of privacy and just let data be free, as data seems to want.</li></ul><li> preventing crime</li><ul><li>Remember, crime includes rape and trafficking and murder. People do really really unambiguously bad things sometimes and the world would be dramatically improved if they couldn't get away with them any more. If a person does not find that possibility exciting, they might have an affect disorder.</li><li>No doubt, a lot of laws would become <em>too powerful</em> under transparency and would need to be thrown out, but as long as we don't make it a boiled frog thing, there's plenty of energy around right now to get those laws thrown out if legislators can be made to realise we've hit an inflection point and we need to react to it.. Still. Worthy of more discussion.</li></ul><li>Watching the watchers</li><ul><li>Politicians, police, and anyone else in a sensitive public position would be under a lot of pressure to be as open as possible about their dealings. This opens the way to having genuinely trustworthy politicians and police, which is a big deal.</li></ul><li>Positive changes to the legal system as a result of detection becoming easier?</li><ul><li>Parole could be a lot more effective. It would be possible, for the first time, to enforce a sentence/treatment \"do not speak with or listen to bad influences through any channel\"</li></ul><li>Promoting social pressures to donate a lot more</li><ul><li>Humans have always gone to great expense to signal strength and moral purity. We should hope that this energy could be harnessed for useful ends, as in <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/11/raikoth-symbolic-beads/\">Raikoth's symbolic beads</a></li><li>If both individuals and organisations had to be more open about their income and expenses it's a lot easier to imagine these pressures coming to bear. If the information about peoples' personal donations were exposed unconditionally, our taboo against discussing them might not be able to hold together. We would not be able to hide our friends' shame about not buying enough <a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/malaria/\">bednets</a>.</li><li>That said, I'm confused as to why there is so little social pressure to donate to things, as it is. I wonder how much of it is value-dysphoria, knowing that the values we espouse don't quite align with our hearts, everyone knowing it, softening when our friends confide in us that they aren't living up to those values, \"It's okay, I understand that it's just not what you sincerely wanted to do.\" I hope that radical openness will allow us to, first, admit that what is agreed to be good is not always what we as individuals desire to see (to admit that we are not, at heart, altruists, as is plain from the records of our choices), second, that it would allow us to get closer to figuring out what our real values are, so that we can develop truly humane systems of accountability to pursue those instead.</li></ul><li>Free, complete, and accurate statistics about every facet of human life. <strong>Please think of all the science we could do</strong>.</li><li>Forcing people to accept and contend with the weirdness of other people, and their own weirdness.</li><ul><li>We would no longer be able to hide from it. This is one thing that makes me hopeful that transparency wouldn't result in the emergence of some new totalitarian normative orthodoxy. There would be heretics everywhere and we'd all be able to hear them (when we choose to) and any crusade short of complete totalitarianism would never be able to completely silence them.</li></ul><li>Enabling trade.</li><ul><li>Automated systems for maintaining information about who owns what, how much they seem to use it, and then using that to arrange mutually beneficial trades (or if you're of the position transparency might obviate the need for money, think of it as; it would be easier for us to notice opportunities to make peoples' lives better by sharing things with them).</li></ul><li>Worrying less about surveillance capitalism/states.</li><ul><li>With less of an imbalance in hoarded data, The People would have just as much surveillance capacity as Google. Though. If the megacorps can analyse the data better than The People can, maybe they still have to worry. More has been written about this, which others could probably recall more easily than I could. <em>Homo Deus</em> anticipated large, transformative effects of Big Data Analysis, but I don't remember being moved by any specific claims, maybe Harari cites someone else, in those sections? I don't have a copy on hand to check.</li></ul></ul><br><br><h2>Potential Disadvantages</h2><ul><li>Even in the most open tribes, humans seem to have an instinct for shyness. I'm not sure we know what happens to humans when they're deprived of the opportunity to do things in private. Maybe it's mostly about sex. I dunno. What are the evolutionary teloses underlying humans' coyness about sex? </li><ul><li>There's infidelity, of course. But it seems to be mostly agreed upon that it's not good that we have the ability to commit infidelity.</li><li>I could imagine there being a thing about obscuring paternity leading to greater tribal cohesion... but I don't think anything like that exists in any developed country to be protected. Also doesn't seem terribly hard to accommodate under standard transparency technologies.</li><li>I guess I'm not very worried about this. In most tribes, people do most things in the company of others. It is strange to us to share so much, but there's nothing unnatural about it, no reason to think humans would thrive less under it.</li></ul><li>The emergence of new, hyper-strong universal orthodoxies.</li><ul><li>Transparency makes it possible to enforce against even the tiniest transgression against a dominant power, which may make the dominant power incontestable.</li><li>(counterargument: see 'forcing people to accept and contend with the weirdness of other people')</li></ul><li>A weakness that a transparent state's non-transparent enemies could easily exploit to destroy them (assuming the future will contain any major wars, which, since the creation of the atomic bomb, it's not clear that we <em>can</em> have major wars any more, still, worth considering).</li><ul><li>Information imbalance in war</li><ul><li>Imagine that you're playing a game of chess, and the enemy can see all of your pieces, but you can't see any of theirs. You'd be fucked. But that isn't a legitimate analogy, it would be more like a game of chess where the enemy can see all of your pieces and you can only see a subset of theirs.<br>The question for me is whether the internal cohesion of a transparent society will make it strong enough that it could win such a war uphill, to extend the analogy; you can't see all of their pieces all of the time, but if your high trust society with its perfect economy of complete information is able to build more pieces than them, maybe you win anyway. You're at a disadvantage, but you also have this other advantage ready to go. Which one weighs more, the advantage or the disadvantage? I don't know. We'll need to experiment. I'm very eager to do that.</li><ul><li>So, we could come up with some kind of asymmetric information wargame. Unfortunately, despite being a game designer, I don't personally have much strategic acumen for the logistics of war, and I've never played a realistic wargame. Lots of people do though! I imagine they'd tend to be interested in a question like this!</li></ul></ul><li>We must wonder why anyone would attack a transparent society when it could demonstrate thoroughly that it is institutionally incapable of being the first one to break the treaty. A transparent state could be far more able to prove nonaggression. When they say they aren't plotting anything, an intelligence agency can see directly that they aren't plotting anything.</li><li>I guess, on reflection, the problems a transparent society has with protecting registered intellectual property are no different that the problems of a closed society. It wouldn't be IP if it wasn't circulating in the open. The whole idea of IP is much more closely aligned with radical openness than closedness; a surreal releasing-yet-protecting of private information that enables conversations, inspiration and trade that would otherwise be impossible.</li></ul></ul><br><h1>Advice</h1><p>So here's what we should try to do in light of all of that:</p><ul><li>Investigate the problem areas described above and try to resolve the difficult remaining questions in the ways suggested. In summary,</li><ul><li>Figure out whether there are potentials for lastingly destructive social consensus monoculture.</li><li>Figure out whether a radically open society with a wealth advantage of about one order of magnitude can survive aggression (war or sabotage) from a closed one.</li><li>Figure out what a good legal system would look like in a transparent society. It is likely to be harder, considering that every law would be consistently enforced.</li></ul></ul><p>If the answer to those questions is \"It'll be fine, go ahead\",</p><ul><li>Develop the relevant technologies. Transparent computing (trusted computing, smart contracts, that kind of thing), cheap recording devices, better wireless networks.</li><li>Promote the culture of radical openness. Pursue the dream of a society where honesty is rewarded, that votes in politicians on the basis of who they really are rather than how good they are at acting. Promote socially positive radically open celebrities. Ensure that the support exists.</li></ul><p>If the answer turns out to be \"no, this would be bad actually\"...</p><p>You must still try to deploy the constrained forms of global surveillance and policing proposed in Bostrom's black ball paper. It is well documented that we failed to handle nukes, and only an idiot would bet that nukes are the blackest ball that's gonna come out of the urn.</p><p>Disarmament still hasn't happened.</p><p>As long as the bomb can be hidden, there will remain an indomitable incentive to have the bomb.</p><p>Is there a good reason to think we're going to be able to defuse it with anything short of a total abolition of secrecy?</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>What makes a neural network interpretable?</p><p>One response is that a neural network is interpretable if it is <em>human simulatable</em>. That is, it is interpretable if and only if a human could step through the procedure that the neural network went through when given an input, and arrive at the same decision (in a reasonable amount of time). This is one definition of interpretable provided by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03490.pdf\">Zachary Lipton</a>.</p><p>This definition is not ideal, however. It misses a core element of what alignment researchers consider important in understanding machine learning models. In particular, in order for a model to be simulatable, it must also be at a human-level or lower. Otherwise, a human would not be able to go step by step through the decision procedure. </p><p>Under this definition, a powerful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search\">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a> would not be interpretable since that would imply that a human could beat an MCTS algorithm by simply simulating its decision procedure. So this definition appears to exclude things that we humans would consider to be interpretable, and labels them uninterpretable.</p><p>A slight modification of this definition yields something more useful for AI alignment. We could distinguish <em>decision simulatability</em> with <em>theory simulatability</em>. In decision simulatability, a human could step through the procedure of what an algorithm is doing, and arrive at the same output for any input. </p><p>In theory simulatability, the human would not necessarily be able to simulate the algorithm perfectly in their head, but they would still say that they algorithm is simulatable in their head, \"given enough empty scratch paper and time.\" Therefore, MCTS is interpretable because a human could in theory sit down and work through an entire example on a piece of paper. It may take ages, but the human would eventually get it done; at least, that's the idea. However, we would not say that some black box ANN is interpretable, because even if the human had several hours to stare at the weight matrices, once they were no longer acquainted with the exact parameters of the model, they would have no clue as to why the ANN was making decisions.</p><p>I define theory simulatability as something like, the ability for a human to operate the algorithm given a pen and a blank sheet of paper after being allowed to study the algorithm for a few hours ahead of time. After the initial few hours, the human would be \"taken off\" the source of information about the algorithm, which means that they couldn't simply memorize some large set of weight matrices: they'd have to figure out exactly how the thing actually makes decisions.</p><p>Given a notion of theory simulatability, we could make our models more interpretable via a variety of approaches.</p><p>In the most basic approach, we limit ourselves to only using algorithms which have a well-understood meaning, like MCTS. The downside of this approach is that it limits our capabilities. In other words, we are restricted to using algorithms that are not very powerful in order to obtain the benefit of theory simulatability. </p><p>By contrast, we could try to alleviate this issue by creating small interpretable models which attempt to approximate the performance of large uninterpretable models. This method falls under the banner of <em>model compression</em>.</p><p>In a more complex ad-hoc approach, we could instead design a way to extract a theory simulatable algorithm that our model is implementing. In other words, given a neural network, we run some type of meta-algorithm that analyzes the neural network and spits out psuedocode which describes what the neural network uses to make decisions. As I understand, this is roughly what Daniel Filan writes about in <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3kwR2dufdJyJamHQq/mechanistic-transparency-for-machine-learning\">Mechanistic Transparency for Machine Learning</a>. Unfortunately, I predict that the downside of this approach is that it is really hard to do in general. </p><p>One way we can overcome the limitations of either approach is by analyzing transparency using the tools of regularization. Typically, regularization schemes have the intended purpose of allowing models to generalize better. Another way of thinking about regularization is that it is simply our way of telling the learning procedure that we have a preference for models in some region of model-space.

Whether this has the effect of allowing greater generalization is secondary to the regularization procedure; we can pose additional goals.</p><p>We can therefore ask, is there some way to put a preference on models that are interpretable, so that the learning procedure will find them? Now we have a concrete problem, namely, the problem of defining which parts of our model-space yield interpretable models. </p><p>Rather than thinking about model space in the abstract, I find it helpful to imagine that we first take a known interpretable algorithm and then plot how well that known algorithm can approximate the given neural network. If the neural network is not well approximated by any known interpretable algorithm, then we give it a high penalty in the training procedure. </p><p>This approach is essentially the approach that Mike Wu et al. have taken in their paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06178.pdf\">Beyond Sparsity: Tree Regularization of Deep Models for Interpretability</a>. Their known algorithm is that of a <em>decision tree</em>. Decision trees are very simple algorithms -- they simply ask a series of yes-no questions about the data and return an answer in some finite amount of time. The full decision tree is the plot of all possible yes-no questions and the resulting leaves of decisions. The paper defines the complexity of any particular decision tree as the <em>average path length</em>, or the expected number of yes-no questions needed to obtain an answer, across input space. The more complex a decision tree needs to be in order to approximate the model, the less interpretable the model is.

In order to define the penalty on general neural networks, Wu et al. introduce an independent surrogate neural network which estimates the above algorithm, while being differentiable. Therefore, the penalty for the neural network is defined by yet another neural network. </p><p>This surrogate neural network can be trained simultaneously with the base neural network trained to predict labels, with restarts after the model parameters have drifted sufficiently far in some direction. The advantage of simultanuous training and restarting is that it allows the surrogate penalty network to be well suited for estimating penalties for base networks near the one that it is penalizing. </p><p>According to the paper, this method produces neural networks that are competitive with state of the art approaches and therefore trade off little in terms of capacity. Perhaps surprisingly, these neural networks perform much better than simple decision trees trained on the same task, providing evidence that this approach is viable for creating interpretable models. Unfortunately, this approach has a rather crucial flaw: it is expensive to train; the paper claims that it nearly doubles the training time for a neural network.</p><p>One question remains: are these models simulatable? Strictly speaking, no. A human given the decision tree would still be able to get a rough idea of why the neural network was performing a particular decision. However, without the model weights, a human would still be forced to make an approximate inference rather than follow the decision procedure exactly. That's because after the training procedure, we can only extract a decision tree that approximates the neural network decisions, not extract a tree that perfectly simulates it. But this is by design: if we wanted perfect interpretability then we would be doing either model compression or mechanistic transparency anyway.</p><p>In my own opinion, the cognitive separation of <em>decision</em> and <em>theory</em> simulatability provides a potentially rich agenda for machine learning transparency research. Currently, most research that focuses on creating simulatable models, such as tree regularization, focus exclusively on decision simulatability. This is useful for present-day researchers because they just want a powerful method of extracting the reasoning behind ML decisions. However, it's not as useful for safety, because in the long term we don't really care that much about why specific systems made decisions, just as long as we know they aren't running any bad cognitive policies.</p><p>To be useful for alignment, we need something more powerful, and more general than tree regularization. Still, the basic insight of regularizing neural networks to be interpretable might be useful for striking a middle ground between building a model from the ground up, and analyzing it post-hoc. Is there a way to apply this insight to create more transparent models?</p>",

Despite that fact, although I have been exposed to the some of the ideas before(which probably made it significantly easier for me), I've never really scratched the surface of Galois theory.\nBut during the first lecture, as the professor started sketching out the direction of the course, how we would [do Galois theory] and use this to show the impossibility of solving the general quintic, it occurred to me that I could pretty much see how the argument would go. After the lecture, I wrote it down.\nAnd then I thought back to the posts above, one of which I had recently read for the first time, and I thought: this may actually be an opportunity for someone else to practice.</p>\n<p>(It was an opportunity for me to practice, but not as much as it would be for someone who hadn't just been told what input was necessary, as I had been)</p>\n<p>From here, anything I consider a spoiler goes in rot13</p>\n<h2>Requirements/Hints</h2>\n<p>In the most general sense, this question is solvable with nothing more than very simple 19th-century mathematics - we know, because it <em>was solved</em> by those methods. Nevertheless, if you want to solve this without being as good as Galois and Abel, perhaps some sort of checklist is nice, so you can know if you have a \"fair shot\" at this.\nI think anyone with an undergraduate degree in math probably has the necessary basics, but I am not certain about that.\nI will give the fields of math necessary, in <em>very</em> broad terms, but be warned that one of them may be non-obvious, and so constitute a mild spoiler:\n\"Onfvp nofgenpg nytroen, v.r tebhc gurbel, evat gurbel, svryqf, cbylabzvny evatf.\".</p>\n<p>More specifically, there are some background concepts that may be hard to invent <em>de novo</em>. But again, these may contain more information than desired, in that it's not obvious that they apply to the problem at all. Nevertheless, they are\n\"Gur abgvba bs \"fbyinoyr tebhc\". Gur vqrn bs nffbpvngvat n Tnybvf tebhc gb n svryq rkgrafvba, naq gur Tnybvf pbeerfcbaqrapr..\"</p>\n<p>I am very uncertain about the difficulty of this problem. It depends a lot on your mathematical background. But I don't <em>think</em> it's easy.</p>\n<p>Update: After writing out my solution in more details, thinking through some of the things one would have to invent to tackle this, I am now fairly certain that this is a very hard problem.</p>\n",

One of the things that I found surprising is that I think I can tell a reasonably decent story about how this is a result of a scientific problem rather than the mismanagement of our future. Do you believe that if we assume that there was this early 1970s structural change in the economy, that it was largely a sort of manmade problem? Which is what we seemingly implicitly always assume. Or, might it be a scientific one?</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And let me give you the one iconic example that really kind of drives it home for me. I think quarks were discovered in 1968. And to find out that the proton and neutron are comprised of up and down quarks is an incredible change in our picture of the world. Yet it has no seeming implications for industry. And I started thinking about this question: Are we somehow fenced out of whatever technologies are to come - that we sort of exhausted one orchard of low hanging fruit and haven't gotten to the next?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I think one way to parse this question of scientific, technological stagnation is sort of nature versus culture. Did the ideas in nature run out? Or, at least the useful ideas. Maybe we make some more discoveries, but they're not useful.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Or the easily useful.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Easily useful. So it's a problem with nature. And then the cultural problem is that there was actually a lot to be discovered or a lot that could be made useful, but somehow the culture had gotten deranged. And I sort of go back and forth on those two explanations. I think it's very complicated. Yeah, I think in physics you'd say ... I mean, probably even the fundamental discoveries stopped after the mid 1970s, but certainly the translation didn't happen. Quarks don't matter for chemistry, and chemistry's what matters on a human level.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I would say there was a lot that happened in biochemistry. You know, not chemistry down, but sort of chemistry up; the interface between chemistry and biology. And that's where I would be inclined to say there's a lot more that could happen and has not quite happened, because maybe the problems are hard. But maybe also the cultural institutions for researching them are restrictive. It's too heavily regulated in certain ways and it's been just somewhat slower than one would have expected in the 1970s.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So maybe it's really just a constant dialogue between nature and culture.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes, obviously. Because obviously, if nature has stopped, then the culture is going to derange. So there's a way in which culture is linked to nature. And then if the culture deranges, it also will look like nature stops. There are probably elements of both.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But I am always optimistic in the sense that I think we could have done better. I think we could do better. It's not necessarily the case that we can advance on all fronts in every direction, but I think there's more space on the frontier than just in this world of bits. So I think there are various dimensions on atoms where we could be advancing and we just have chosen not to.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Why do you think it's so hard to convince people that ... Because both of us have had this experience where we sit down, let's say to an interview, and somebody talks about the dizzying pace of change. And both you and I see almost ... I mean, it's almost objectively true. I have this test, which is: go into a room and subtract off all of the screens.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>How do you know you're not in 1973 but for issues of design? There aren't that many clues.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah, there are all sorts of things one can point to. I mean I always point to the productivity data in economics, which aren't great. And then you get into debates on how accurately are those being measured. You have the sort of intergenerational thing where our generation, Gen X, has had a tougher time than the Boomers. The Millennials seem to be having a much tougher time than either us or the Boomers had. So there seems to be this generational thing. So there are some of these sort of macroeconomic variables that seem pretty off.</p><h2>Hyper-specialisation</h2><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The direct scientific questions, I think, are very hard to get a handle on. And the reason for this is that in late modernity, which we are living in, there's simply too much knowledge for any individual human to understand all of it. And so in this world of extreme hyper specialization, where it's narrower and narrower subsets of experts policing themselves and talking about how great they are, the string theorists talking about how great string theory is, the cancer researchers talking about how they're just about to cure cancer, the quantum computer researchers are just about to build a quantum computer, there'll be a massive breakthrough. And then if you were to say that all these fields, not much is happening, people just don't have the authority for this. And this is somehow a very different feel for science or knowledge than you would've had in 1800 or even in 1900. In 1800, Goethe could still understand just about everything.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>1900, Hilbert could still understand just about all of mathematics and so this sort of specialization, I think, has made it a much harder question to get a handle on. The political cut I have on the specialization is always that if you analyze the politics of science, the specializations should make you suspicious, because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate, and then one should be a little bit suspicious. And that's sort of my starting bias.</p><h2>Sanity of Institutions</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And mine as well. And I think perhaps sort of the craziest idea to come out of all of this - and again you met your version of this in a law firm, which is predicated upon the idea that a partner would hire associates and the associates would hope to become partners who could then hire associates. And so that has that pyramidal structure. And in the university system, every professor is trying to train graduate students to become research professors to train graduate students. And I think that the universities were probably the most aggressive of these things I've called embedded growth obligations. But the implication of this idea that we structured almost everything on an expectation of growth, and then this growth that was expected ran out - it wasn't as high and stable and as technologically-led as before - has a pretty surprising implication. Which is, I mean ... Well let's not dance around it. It feels like almost universally, all of our institutions are now pathological.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Or sociopathic, or whatever you want to call them. Yes. Yes, I suppose there's sort of two ways one could imagine going, if you had these expectations of great growth - Great Expectations was the Charles Dickens novel from the 19th century.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>We had Great Expectations. And then you can try to be honest and say the expectations are dialed down, or you can continue to say everything's great and it just happens not to be working out for you, but it's working out for people in general. And somehow it's been very hard to have the sort of honest reset. And the incentives have been for the institutions to derange and to lie. There's probably a way the universities could function if they did not grow. You’d be honest, most people in PhD programs don't become professors. Maybe you'd make the PhD programs much shorter. Maybe you'd be much more selective; you'd let fewer people in. There would be some way you could sort of adjust it, and the institutions could still be much healthier than they are today.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But that's not the path that seemingly was taken. And something like this could have been done in a law firm context. Maybe you still let the same percentage of people become partner, but the partners don't make quite as much money as before, or something like that. So that there would have been ways when one could've gone, but those are generally not the choices that were made.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Yeah. I wonder if that's even possible. Because if you had a law firm that was honest or university that was fairly honest and you had one that was dishonest, it seems to me that the dishonest one could attempt to use its prestige to out compete the honest one. And so that would become a self-extinguishing strategy, unless you somehow have a truth-in-advertising program.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yeah, I don't know. I do think the truth, when it breaks through, you're better off having told it than not not having. And so it's always ... As long as everybody was dishonest, it could work.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Look, it's mysterious to me how long it worked. We had these crazy bubble economies in the ... You know, we had the tech bubble in the 90s, the housing bubble in the 2000s, what I think is a government debt bubble this last decade. And so if you've had this sort of up-down bubble, that's sort of harder to see than if things were just flat. So if the growth in 1970, things had just flat-lined, and you had 40 years of no growth, that would have been problematic. And you might have noticed that very quickly.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But in a sense, simplifying a lot, you could say the 70s were down, the 80s were up, the 90s were up, the 2000s were down. So two down, two up, net flat, but it didn't feel that way internally.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>With lots of excitement.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>There was a lot of excitement, a lot of stuff happened. And California was like a even more extreme version of this. You know, the last know the last three recessions in California were much more severe than in the country, as a whole. The recoveries were steeper, and so California has felt incredibly volatile. The volatility gets interpreted as dynamism. And then before you know it, 30 or 40 years have passed.</p><h2>Individual and Collective Incentives</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>One thing that I'm very curious about is how this discipline seems to have arisen, where almost everyone representing the institutions tell some version of this universal story. Which, I'll be honest. To my way of thinking, can be instantly invalidated by anyone who chooses to do so. It's just that the cost of invalidating it is quite high. You know, Paul Krugman wrote this column called A Protectionist Moment, where he said, \"Let's be honest. The financial elite's case, for ever free-er trade, has always been something of a scam.\".</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And so you had people who were participating in this who seem to have known all along that there's no way of justifying this on paper, but yet were willing and able to participate with seemingly very few consequences to their careers. It didn't give opportunities to people who were heterodox and saying, \"Hey, aside from a few bright spots, more or less, we've actually entered a period of relative stagnation.\" How did this happen?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I think the individual incentives were very different from the collective incentive. The collective incentives, in which we have an honest conversation and level set things and get back to a better place. I think the individual incentives were often, you pretend that it's working great for you. The 20,000 people a year who move to Los Angeles to become movie stars, about 20 of them make it. And so you could say, \"Well, it's been really hard. Nobody wants to hire me. This is a terrible city.\" Or you could say, \"You know, this has been wonderful, and that all the doors are being opened to me.\" And the second one is more fictional. But that's sort of the thing you're supposed to say if you're succeeding. And I think there's a way this is how we've been talking about globalization, a weird sort of a glib globalization. It's working great for me, and I'd like to have more people, more talented people come to the US. I'm not scared of competing with them. And on and on.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Or academia. If you're a professor in academia, so the tenure system is great. It's just picking the most talented people. I don't think it's that hard at all. It's completely meritocratic. And if you don't say those things, well we know you're not the person to get tenure.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So I think there is sort of like this individual incentive where you're if you pretend the system is working, you're simultaneously signaling that you're one of the few people who should succeed in it.</p><h2>Official and Unofficial Narratives</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I used the word kayfabe for the system of nonsense that undergirds professional wrestling, and you've taken to using LARPing, live action role playing. It strikes me that we have two separate parallel systems. Now, this podcasting experiment that you and I are now part of provides for a very unscripted, out of control narrative. And then there's this parallel institutional narrative that seems to exist in a gated form where the institutions keep talking to each other and ignore this thing that's happening that has reached more and more people, so that you effectively have multiple narratives. (One of which, I think almost no one needs to believe. It's just that the institutions need to trade lies and deceptions back and forth amongst themselves.) How is it that these two things can be kept separate? It's like a real wrestling league and a professional wrestling league, side by side, where somehow they just don't come into contact with each other.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I think if they came into contact, then they wouldn't both be able to exist. So I think that's not surprising that they can't come to contact.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I don't think it's ultimately stable. So I think ultimately our account is going to prevail. The institutional account is so incorrect that it will ultimately fail. I've probably been more hopeful about how quickly truth prevails than than it has.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>It's taken forever.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But I would still be very hopeful that our account is really going to break through in the next few years. I've been talking about this, the tech stagnation problem for the better part of a decade. And I think when I was talking about this in 2008, 2009, 2010 this was still a fringy view. It was very fringy within Silicon Valley. And I think even within Silicon Valley, there's sort of a lot of people who've come around to it, who've partially come around to it. There's a sense that tech has a bad conscience. It feels like it's not delivering the promises. Google had this propaganda about the future and it's now seen as .... The self-driving cars are further away than people expected. And so I think there is sort of a sense that things have shifted a lot over the last decade.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>But even five years ago. I moved out to work with you in 2013, and I had never seen a boom before. I mean, this was one of the things that was really important to me, is that being an academic ... The academy had been in a depression since this change around 1972, '73. And seeing a boom and seeing people with flowers and dollar signs in their eyes, talking about a world of abundance and how everything was going to be great, it seemed like everybody was the CEO or CTO of some tiny company.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And then very, very quickly, it all started to change, and I felt like a lot of people moved back into the behemoths from their little startup having failed. A lot of the ideology felt poisonous, like, \"Don't be evil,\" was not even something you could utter without somebody snickering behind your back. There's a self-hating component, where the engineers have been recruited ideologically and are not actually there to do business.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Sure.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>How did this happen so quickly?</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Am I wrong about that?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>No, it's striking how fast it's happened. It's striking how much it's happened in the context of a bull market. So if you describe this in terms of psychology, you'd think that people to be as angry in Silicon Valley as they are today, the stock market must be down 40% or 50%. It's like people in New York city were angry. In 2009, they were angry at the banks. They hated themselves. But the stock market was down 50%, 60%, the banks had gotten obliterated. And that sort of makes sense psychologically. And the strange thing is that in terms of sort of the macro economic indicators, the stock markets, the valuations of the larger companies, it's way beyond the .com peaks of 2000, in all in all sorts of ways. But the mood is not like late '99, early 2000. It has this very different mood.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And the way I would explain this is that, for the people involved, it is sort of a look ahead function. Yes, this is where things are, but are they going to be worth a lot more in five years, 10 years? And that's gotten a lot harder to tell.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And so there's been growth, but people are unhappy and frustrated because they don't see that much growth going forward, even within tech. Even within this world of bits, which had been very, very decoupled for such a long time.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Now, one of the things that's interesting to me is, is that when we talk like this, a lot of people are gonna say, \"Wow, that's a lot of gloom and doom. So much is changing so much is better.\" And yet, what I sense is that both you and I have an idea that we've lived our entire life in some sort of intellectual Truman Show, where everything is kind of fake, and something super exciting is about to happen. Do you share ... Is that a fair telling?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I think there's been the potential to get back to the future for a long time. And there have been breaks in this Truman Show at various points. There was a big break with 9/11. There was a big break with the 2008 crash. You could say some sort of break with Brexit and Trump.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And the last few years, it's still a little bit undecided what that all means. But I think there were a lot of reasons to question this and reassess this for some time. The reassessments never quite happened, but I would say I think we're now at the point where this is really gonna happen in the next two years to five years to decade. I don't think the Truman Show can keep going that much longer.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And again, I've been wrong about this, so-</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Me, too.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I've been very wrong.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>I've been wrong. I've called it earlier.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>We had an offsite when I was running PayPal in spring of 2001. The NASDAQ had gone from 2,000 to 5,000 back to 2,000, the .com bubble was over. And I was explaining, we were just battening down the hatches. At least one little company has survived, and we're going to survive. But the sort of insanity that we saw in the .com years will never come back in the lifetimes of the people here, because psychologically, you can't go that crazy again while you're still alive.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The 1920s didn't come back until maybe the 1980s, or something.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>The lessons of the depression were long lived.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So it was generationally over. And yet, already in 2001, we had the incipient housing bubble, and somehow some other shows kept going for 20 years, 25 years.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>With a crazy narrative. The whole narrative behind the Great Moderation. I mean, I remember just clutching my head, \"How can you tell a story that we've banished volatility?\".</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Yes. I always think of the 1990s narrative was the new economy, and you lied about growth. And then the 2000s narrative was the Great Moderation, and you lied about volatility. And maybe the 2010s one is secular stagnation, where you lie about the real interest rates, because the other two don't work anymore. In sort of a complicated way, these things connect.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But yes, new economy sounded very bullish in the '90s. Great Moderation was still a reasonably long stocks, but sounds less bullish. And then secular stagnation - in the Larry Summers forms, to be specific to what we're talking about - means again, that you should be long the stock market. The stock market's going to keep going up because things are so stagnant. The real rates will stay low forever.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>So they are equally bullish narratives, although they sound less bullish over time.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So that effectively we need ... What happened with the Roaring '20s followed by the depression was that there was a general skepticism, and here the skepticism seems to be specific to something different in each incarnation. You keep having bubbles with some lie you have yet to tell.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And of course, I think the crazy cut on the '20s and '30s was that we didn't need to have as big of a crash. You could've probably done all sorts of interventions. Because the 1930s was still a period that was very healthy in terms of background scientific, technological innovation. If we just rattle off what was discovered in the 1930s that had real world practical things, it was: the aviation industry got off the ground, the talkies, the movies got going. You had the plastics industry, you had secondary oil recovery, household appliances got developed. And as you know, by 1939 there were three times as many people who had cars in the US as in 1929. There was this crazy tailwind of scientific and technological progress that then somehow got badly mismanaged, financially, by whoever you blame the crash on.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And so, I think that's what actually happened in the '30s, and then we tried to manage all these financial indicators much more precisely in recent decades, even though the tailwind wasn't there at all.</p><h2>Physics, Biology, and Polymaths</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, let me focus you on two subjects that are important for trying to figure out the economy going forward. I'm very fond of perhaps over-claiming, but making a strong claim for physics. That physics gave us atomic devices and nuclear power, and it ended World War II definitively. It gave us the semiconductor, the worldwide web, theoretical physicists invented molecular biology, the communications revolution. All of these things came out of physics, and you could make the argument that physics has been really underrated as powering the world economy.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>On the other hand, it's very strange to me that we had the three-dimensional structure of DNA in '53, we had the genetic code 10 years later, and we've had very little in the way of, let's say, gene therapy to show for all of our newfound knowledge. Now, I have no doubt that we are learning all sorts of new things - to your point about specialization - in biology, but the translation hasn't been anything like what I would have imagined for physics.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>So, it feels like somehow we're in a new orchard, and we're spending a lot of time exploring it, but we haven't found the low hanging fruit in biology, and we've kind of exhausted the physics orchard, because what we've found is so exotic that, you know, whether it's two black holes colliding, or a third generation of matter, or quark substructure, we haven't been able to use these things. Are we somehow between revolutions?</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I'd be pessimistic on physics generally, so that sort of be my bias on that one.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Me as well.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Biology, I continue to think we could be doing a lot more, we could be making a lot more progress. And you know, the pessimistic version is that no, biology is just, is much harder than physics, and therefore it's been slower going.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The more optimistic one is that the culture is just broken. We've had very talented people go into physics. You go into biology if you're less talented. You can sort of think of it in Darwinian terms. You can think of biology as a selection for people with bad math genes. You know, if you're good at math, go to math, or physics, or at least chemistry, and biology we sort of selected for all of these people who are somewhat less talented. So, that might be a cultural explanation for why it's been been slower progress.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>But, I mean, we had people from physics, we had, like, Teller, and, Feynman, and Crick. There's no shortage of, to my earlier point, molecular biology, anyway, was really founded by physicists more than any other thing, I think. Why is it that in an era where physics is stagnating, we don't see these kinds of minds? Like, I'm a little skeptical of that theory.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Well, I'm not so sure. Like, if you're a string theory person, or even sort of an applied experimental physicist, I don't think you can that easily reboot into biology. I mean, these disciplines have gotten sort of more rigid. It's pretty hard to transfer from one area to another.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You know, when I was an undergraduate, you still had some older professors who were polymaths, who knew a lot about a lot of different things. This is, I think, the way one should really think of, you know, Watson and Crick, or Feynman, or Teller. They were certainly world-class in their field, but also like incredible in a lot of different fields.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>They were highly transgressive.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And, you know, the cultural, or institutional, rule, is no polymaths allowed.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Wow.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You know, you can be narrowly specialized, and if you're interested in other things you better keep it to yourself and not tell people, because if you say that you're interested in computer science and also music, or studying the Hebrew Bible, wow, that's just, that must mean you're just not very serious about computer science.</p><h2>Polymaths in Universities</h2><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, so I totally want to riff on on this point, because I think you've hit the nail on the head. To my way of thinking, the key problem is, if you go back to our original contention, which is, is that there is something universally pathological about the stories that every institution predicated on growth has to tell about itself when things are not growing.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>The biggest danger is that somebody smart inside of the institution will start questioning things and speaking openly.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>The polymaths would be the people who could connect the dots and say, you know, there's not that much going on in my department, and there's not much going on this department over here, and not that much going on in this department over there, and those people are very, very dangerous.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You know, one of my friends studied physics at Stanford in the late '90s. His advisor was this professor at Stanford, Bob Laughlin, who, you know, brilliant physics guy, late '90s he gets a Nobel prize in physics, and he suffers from the supreme delusion that now that he has a Nobel prize he has total academic freedom and he can do anything he wants to. And he decided to direct it at, you know, I mean, there are all these areas you probably shouldn't go into, you probably shouldn't question, climate science, there are all these things when one should be careful about, but he went into an area of far more dangerous than all of those.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>He was convinced that there were all these people in the university who were doing fake science, who were wasting government money on fake research that was not really going anywhere, and he started by investigating other departments, started with the biology department at Stanford university. And you can imagine this ended catastrophically for Professor Laughlin, you know, his graduate students couldn't get PhDs. He no longer got funding, Nobel prize in physics, no protection whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Julian Schwinger fell out of favor with the physics community despite being held in its highest regard and having a Nobel prize, and he used the epigram in a book where he wanted to redo quantum field theory around something he called source theory, he said, \"If you can't join them, beat them.\" And I think it comes as a shock to all of these people that there is no level you can rise to in the field that allows you to question the assumptions of that field.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Right. It's like, you know, you're sort of proving yourself, you're getting your PhD, you're getting your tenured position, and then at some point you think, you would think that you've proven yourself and you can talk about the whole and not just the parts, but you're never allowed to talk about more than the parts.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>You know, like the person in the university context, or the class of people who are supposed to talk about the whole, I would say, are university presidents, because they are presiding over the whole of the university and they should be able to speak to what the nature of the whole is, what sort of progress the whole is making. What is the health of the progress of the whole? And, you know, we certainly do not pick university presidents who think critically about these questions at all.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, I remember discussing, with a president of a very highly regarded university, he came to me, he said, \"Can you explain how your friend Peter Thiel thinks? Because I just had a conversation with him, and I could not convince him that the universities were doing fantastically, and this university in particular, like how does he come to his conclusion?\".</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>And I said, \"Well look, Peter doesn't come, you know, with a PhD, but let me speak to you in your own language,\" and I started going department by department talking about the problems of stagnation. It was very clear that there was no previous experience with any kind of informed person making such an argument. I mean this was a zero day exploit.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But it's all, yeah, but in some sense, if you're a president of a university, you probably don't want to talk to people that dangerous. You want to avoid them, and you don't want to have such disruptive thoughts because you have to convince the government, or alumni, or whoever, to keep donating money, that everything's wonderful and great.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And I think one has to go back quite a long time to even identify any university presidents in the United States who said things that were distinctive, or interesting, or powerful. You know, there was Larry Summers at Harvard a decade and a half ago, and tried to do like the most minuscule critiques imaginable, and got crucified. But, you know, I don't think of Summers as a particularly revolutionary thinker.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Well, he was possessed of an idea that the intellectual elite, in which he undoubtedly saw himself a part of, had the right to transgress boundaries. And I think what's stunning about this is the extent to which this breed of outspoken, disruptive intellectual has no place left inside of this system from which to speak.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>But it's not that surprising. In a healthy system you could have wild dissent and it's not threatening because everyone knows the system is healthy. In an unhealthy system, the dissent becomes much more dangerous.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>I think that's not that surprising. There's always one riff I have on this is always, if you think of a left wing person as someone who's critical of the structures of our society, there's a sense in which we have almost no left wing professors left.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>That's right. Like Noam Chomsky is still there as sort of a last remnant of some clade that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>Left-wing in the sense of, let's say, just being critical of the institutions they're a part of.</p><p><strong>Eric Weinstein: </strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Peter Thiel: </strong>And there may be some that are much older, so if you're maybe in your eighties we can pretend to ignore you, or you know, this is just what happens to people in their eighties. But I don't see younger professors in their, let's say, forties, who are deeply critical of the university structure. I think it's just not, you know, you can't have that.</p>",

in this view, what matters is the difference between a utility's optimal policy, and a random policy. So, in a sense, each utility function has a equal shot of moving the outcome away from an expected random policy, and towards themselves.</p>\n<p>The intuition still seems good to me, but the \"random policy\" is a bit of a problem. First of all, it's not all that well defined - are we talking about a policy that just spits out random outputs, or one that picks randomly among outcomes? Suppose there are three options, option A (if A is output), option B' (if B' is output), or do nothing (any other output), should we really say that A happens twice as often as B' (since typing out A randomly is twice as likely that typing out B'?).</p>\n<p>Relatedly, if we add another option C, which is completely equivalent to A for all possible utilities, then this redefines the random policy. There's also a problem with branching - what if option A now leads to twenty choices later, while B leads to no further choices, are we talking about twenty-one equivalent choices, or twenty equivalent choices and one other one as likely as all of them put together? Also, the concept has some problem with infinite option sets.</p>\n<p>A more fundamental problem is that the random policy includes options that neither <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"U_1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.084em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

That's what unlocking the power of specificity feels like: a new dimension you suddenly perceive all concepts to have. By learning to navigate the specificity dimension, you'll be training a unique mental superpower. With it, you'll be able to jump outside the ordinary course of arguments and fly through the conceptual landscape. Fly, I say!</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*9yyVUWd_MaAZkWOz.jpg\"></figure><h1>\"Acme exploits its workers!\"</h1><p>Want to see what a 3D argument looks like? Consider a conversation I had the other day when my friend “Steve” put forward a claim that seemed counter to my own worldview:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> Acme exploits its workers by paying them too little!</p></blockquote><p>We were only one sentence into the conversation and my understanding of Steve’s point was high-level, devoid of specific detail. But I assumed that whatever his exact point was, I could refute it using my understanding of basic economics. So I shot back with a counterpoint:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Liron:</strong> No, job creation is a force for good at any wage. Acme increases the demand for labor, which drives wages up in the economy as a whole.</p></blockquote><p>I injected principles of Econ 101 into the discussion because I figured they could help me expose that Steve misunderstood Acme's impact on its workers.</p><p>My smart-sounding response might let me pass for an intelligent conversationalist in non-rationalist circles. But my rationalist friends wouldn't have been impressed at my 2D tactics, parrying Steve's point with my own counterpoint. They'd have sensed that I'm not progressing toward clarity and mutual understanding, that I'm ignorant of the way of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/double-crux\">Double Crux</a>.</p><p>If I were playing 3D chess, my opening move wouldn't be to slide a defensive piece (the Econ 101 Rook) across the board. It would be to... shove my face at the board and stare at the pieces from an inch away.</p><p>Here's what an attempt to do this might look like:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> Acme exploits its workers by paying them too little!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron:</strong> What do you mean by “exploits its workers”?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> Come on, you know what “exploit” means… Dictionary.com says it means “to use selfishly for one’s own ends”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron:</strong> You’re saying you have a beef with any company that acts “selfish”? Doesn’t every company under capitalism aim to maximize returns for its shareholders?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> Capitalism can be good sometimes, but Acme has gone beyond the pale with their exploitation of workers. They’re basically ruining capitalism.</p></blockquote><p>No, this is still not the enlightening conversation we were hoping for.</p><p>But where did I go wrong? Wasn't I making a respectable attempt to lead the conversation toward clear and precise definitions? Wasn't I navigating the first waypoint on the road to Double Crux?</p><p>Can you figure out where I went wrong?</p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>It was a mistake for me to ask Steve for a mere <i>definition</i> of the term “exploit”. I should have asked for a <i>specific example</i> of what he imagines “exploit” to mean in this context. What specifically does it mean—actually, forget \"mean\"—what specifically does it <i>look like </i>for Acme to \"exploit its workers by paying them too little\"?</p><p>When Steve explained that \"exploit\" means \"to use selfishly\", he fulfilled my request for a definition, but the whole back-and-forth didn't yield any insight for either of us. In retrospect, it was a wasted motion for me to ask, \"What do you mean by 'exploits its workers'\".</p><p>Then I, instead of making another attempt to shove my face to stare at the board up close, couldn't help myself: I went back to sliding my pieces around. I set out to rebut the claim that \"Acme uses its workers selfishly\" by tossing the big abstract concept of “capitalism” into the discussion.</p><p>At this point, imagine that Steve were a malicious actor whose only goal was to score rhetorical points on me. He'd be thrilled to hear me say the word “capitalism”. \"Capitalism\" is a nice high-level concept for him to build an infinite variety of smart-sounding defenses out of, together with other high-level concepts like “exploitation” and “selfishness”.</p><p>A malicious Steve can be rhetorically effective against me even without possessing a structured understanding of the subject he’s making a claim about. His mental model of the subject could just be a ball pit of loosely-associated concepts. He can hold up his end of the conversation surprisingly well by just snatching a nearby ball and flinging it at me. And what have I done by mentioning “capitalism”? I’ve gone and tossed in another ball.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*oZG3f-lRhdmPTkLC.jpg\"></figure><p>I'd like to think that Steve isn't malicious, that he isn't trying to score rhetorical points on me, and that the point he's trying to make has some structure and depth to it. But there's only one way to be sure: By using the power of specificity to get a closer look! Here's how it's done:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> Acme exploits its workers by paying them too little!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron:</strong> Can you help me paint a specific mental picture of a worker being exploited by Acme?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> Ok… A single dad who works at Acme and never gets to spend time with his kids because he works so much. He's living paycheck to paycheck and he doesn't get any paid vacation days. The next time his car breaks down, he won’t even be able to fix it because he barely makes minimum wage. You should try living on minimum wage so you can see how hard it is!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron: </strong>You’re saying Acme should be blamed for this specific person’s unpleasant life circumstances, right?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve: </strong>Yes, because they have thousands of workers in these kinds of circumstances, and meanwhile their stock is worth $80 billion.</p></blockquote><p>Steve doesn’t realize this yet, but by coaxing out a specific example of his claim, I've suddenly made it impossible for him to use a ball pit of loosely-associated concepts to score rhetorical points on me. From this point on, the only way he can win the argument with me is by clarifying and supporting his claim in a way that helps me update my mental model of the subject. This isn’t your average 2D argument anymore. We’re now flying like Superman.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7KXvs-J3WQ-HBCU_\"></figure><blockquote><p><strong>Liron: </strong>Ok, sticking with this one specific worker's hypothetical story — what would they be doing if Acme didn’t exist?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve: </strong>Getting a different job</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron: </strong>Ok, what specific job?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve: </strong>I don’t know, depends what their skills are</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron:</strong> This is your specific story Steve, you get to pick any specific plausible details you want in order to support any point you want!</p></blockquote><p>I have to stop and point out how crazy this is.</p><p>You’d think the way smart people argue is by supporting their claims with evidence, right? But here I’m giving Steve a handicap where he gets to <i>make up fake evidence</i> (telling me any hypothetical specific story) just to establish that his argument is <i>coherent</i> by checking whether empirical support for it ever <i>could</i> <i>meaningfully exist</i>. I'm asking Steve to step over a really low bar here.</p><p>Surprisingly, in real-world arguments, this lowly bar often stops people in their tracks. The conversation often goes like this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> I guess he could instead be a cashier at McDonald’s. Because then he’d at least get three weeks per year of paid vacation time.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron: </strong>In a world where Acme exists, couldn’t this specific guy still go get a job as a cashier at McDonald’s? Plus, wouldn’t he have less competition for that McDonald's cashier job because some of the other would-be applicants got recruited to be Acme workers instead? Can we conclude that the specific person who you chose to illustrate your point is actually being *helped* by the existence of Acme?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve: </strong>No because he’s an Acme worker, not a McDonald’s cashier</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron: </strong>So doesn’t that mean Acme offered him a better deal than McDonald’s, thereby improving his life?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve: </strong>No, Acme just tricked him into thinking that it’s a better deal because they run ads saying how flexible their job is, and how you can set your own hours. But it’s actually a worse deal for the worker.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron: </strong>So like, McDonald’s offered him $13/hr plus three weeks per year of paid vacation, while Acme offered $13/hr with no paid vacation time, but more flexibility to set his own hours?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> Um, ya, something like that.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron: </strong>So if Acme did a better job of educating prospective workers that they don't offer the same paid vacation time that some other companies do, then would you stop saying that Acme is “exploiting its workers by paying them too little”?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> No, because Acme preys on uneducated workers who need quick access to cash, and they also intend to automate away the workers’ jobs as soon as they can.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron:</strong> It looks like you’re now making new claims that weren’t represented in the specific story you chose, right?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> Yes, but I can tell other stories</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron:</strong> But for the specific story you chose to tell that was supposed to best illustrate your claim, the “exploitation” you’re referring to only deprived the worker of the value of a McDonald’s cashier’s paid vacation time, which might be like a 5% difference in total compensation value? And since his work schedule is much more flexible as an Acme worker, couldn’t that easily be worth the 5% to him, so that he wasn’t “tricked” into joining Acme but rather made a decision in rational self-interest?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve: </strong>Yeah maybe, but anyway that’s just one story.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Liron:</strong> No worries, we can start over and talk about a specific story that you think <i>would</i> illustrate your main claim. Who knows, I might even end up agreeing with your claim once I understand it. It's just hard to understand what you're saying about Acme without having at least one example in mind, even if it's a hypothetical one.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Steve thinks for a little while...</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Steve:</strong> I don't know all the exploitative shit Acme does ok? I just think Acme is a greedy company.</p></blockquote><p>When someone makes a claim you (think you) disagree with, don't immediately start gaming out which 2D moves you'll counterargue with. Instead, start by drilling down in the specificity dimension: think through one or more specific scenarios to which their claim applies.</p><p>If you can't think of <i>any</i> specific scenarios to which their claim applies, maybe it's because there are none. Maybe the thinking behind their original claim is incoherent.</p><p>In complex topics such as politics and economics, the sad reality is that people who think they’re <i>arguing</i> for a claim are often not even <i>making</i> a claim. In the above conversation, I never got to a point where I was trying to <i>refute Steve’s argument</i>, I was just trying to get specific clarity on <i>what Steve’s claim is</i>, and I never could. We weren't able to discuss an example of what specific world-state constitutes, in his judgment, a referent of the statement “Acme exploits its workers by paying them too little”.</p><h1>Zooming Into the&nbsp;Claim</h1><p>Imagine Steve shows you this map and says, “Oregon’s coastline is too straight. I wish all coastlines were less straight so that they could all have a bay!”</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*C2h6ApS2xoQ08MWwQGnc1Q.png\"></figure><p>Resist the temptation to argue back, “You’re wrong, bays are stupid!” Hopefully, you’ve built up the habit of nailing down a claim’s specific meaning before trying to argue against it.</p><p>Steve is making a claim about “Oregon’s coastline”, which is a pretty abstract concept. In order to unpack the claim’s specific meaning, we have to zoom into the concept of a “coastline” and see it in more detail as this specific configuration of land and water:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Z1hb423fp-_M_aA5VDDP7A.png\"></figure><p>From this perspective, a good first reply would be, “Well, Steve, what about Coos Bay over here? Are you happy with Oregon’s coastline as long as Coos Bay is part of it, or do you still think it’s too straight even though it has this bay?”</p><p>Notice that we can’t predict how Steve will answer our specific clarifying question. So we never knew what Steve’s words meant in the first place, did we? Now you can see why it wasn’t yet productive for us to start arguing against him.</p><p>When you hear a claim that sounds meaningful, but isn’t 100% concrete and specific, the first thing you want to do is zoom into its specifics. In many cases, you’ll then find yourself disambiguating between multiple valid specific interpretations, like for Steve’s claim that “Oregon’s coastline is too straight”.</p><p>In other cases, you’ll discover that there was <i>no </i>specific meaning in the mind of the speaker, like in the case of Steve’s claim that “Acme exploits its workers by paying them too little” — a staggering thing to discover.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Om1VbPya5DI6QmFX.gif\"></figure><p>TFW a statement unexpectedly turns out to have no specific&nbsp;meaning</p><h1>“Startups should have more&nbsp;impact!”</h1><p>Consider this excerpt from a recent series of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwseibel/status/1142534180594573312?s=20\">tweets</a> by Michael Seibel, CEO of the <a href=\"https://ycombinator.com/\">Y Combinator</a> startup accelerator program:</p><blockquote><p>Successful tech founders would have far better lives and legacies if they competed for happiness and impact instead of wealth and users/revenue.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We need to change [the] model from build a big company, get rich, and then starting a foundation...</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To build a big company, get rich, and use the company's reach and power to make the world a better place.</p></blockquote><p>When I first read these tweets, my impression was that Michael was providing useful suggestions that any founder could act on to make their startup more of a force for good. But then I activated my specificity powers…</p><p>Before elaborating on what I think is the failure of specificity on Michael’s part, I want to say that I really appreciate Michael and Y Combinator engaging with this topic in the first place. It would be easy for them to keep their head down and stick to their original wheelhouse of funding successful startups and making huge financial returns, but instead, YC repeatedly pushes the envelope into new areas such as founding <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a> and creating their <a href=\"http://carbon.ycombinator.com/\">Request for Carbon Removal Technologies</a>. The Y Combinator community is an amazing group of smart and morally good people, and I’m proud to call myself a YC founder (my company <a href=\"https://relationshiphero.com/\">Relationship Hero</a> was in the YC Summer 2017 batch). Michael’s heart is in the right place to suggest that startup founders may have certain underused mechanisms by which to make the world a better place.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://www.vccafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Y_Combinator_logo_text_wordmark.png\"></figure><p>That said… is there any coherent takeaway from this series of tweets, or not?</p><p>The key phrases seem to be that startup founders should <strong>“compete for happiness and impact”</strong> and <strong>“use the company’s reach and power to make the world a better place”</strong>.</p><p>It sounds meaningful, doesn’t it? But notice that it’s generically-worded and lacks any specific examples. This is a red flag.</p><p>Remember when you first heard Steve’s claim that “Acme exploits its workers by paying them too little”? At first, it sounded like a meaningful claim. But as we tried to nail down what it meant, it collapsed into nothing. Will the same thing happen here?</p><p>Specificity powers, activate! Form of: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/liron/status/1142621223924486144\">Tweet reply</a></p><blockquote><p>What's a specific example, real or hypothetical, of a $1B+ founder trading off less revenue for more impact?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Cuz at the $1B+ level, competing for impact may look indistinguishable from competing for revenue.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>E.g. Elon Musk companies have huge impact and huge valuations.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s consider a specific example of a startup founder who is highly successful: Elon Musk and his company SpaceX, currently valued at $33B. The company’s mission statement is proudly displayed at the top of their <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/about\">about</a> page:</p><blockquote><p>SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other&nbsp;planets.</p></blockquote><p>What I love about SpaceX is that everything they do follows from Elon Musk’s original goal of making human life multiplanetary. Check out this incredible <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\">post</a> by Tim Urban to understand Elon’s plan in detail. Elon’s 20-year playbook is breathtaking:</p><ol><li><strong>Identify a major problem in the world</strong><br>A single catastrophic event on Earth can permanently wipe out the human species</li><li><strong>Propose a method of fixing it</strong><br>Colonize other planets, starting with Mars</li><li><strong>Design a self-sustaining company or organization to get it done</strong><br>Invent reusable rockets to drop the price per launch, then dominate the $27B/yr market for space launches</li></ol><p>I would enthusiastically advise any founder to follow Elon’s playbook, as long as they have the stomach to commit to it for 20+ years.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sGh6ZQXfYO1WmZxXel9PiQ.png\"></figure><p>So how does this relate to Michael’s tweets? I believe my advice to “follow Elon’s playbook” constitutes a specific example of Michael’s suggestion to “use the company’s reach and power to make the world a better place”.</p><p>But here’s the thing: Elon’s playbook is something you have to do before you found the company. First you have to identify a major problem in the world, then you come up with a plan to start a certain type of company. How do you apply Michael’s advice once you’ve already got a company?</p><p>To see what I mean, let’s pick another specific example of a successful founder: Drew Houston and Dropbox ($11B market cap). We know that Michael wants Drew to “compete for happiness and impact” and to “use the company’s reach and power to make the world a better place”. But what does that mean here? What specific advice would Michael have for Drew?</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*ZvEnDc-QtVqNOggz.png\"></figure><p>Let’s brainstorm some possible ideas for specific actions that Michael might want Drew to take:</p><ul><li>Change Dropbox’s mission to something that has more impact on happiness</li><li>Donate 10% of Dropbox’s profits to efforts to reduce world hunger</li><li>Give all Dropbox employees two months of paid vacation each year</li></ul><p>I know, these are just stabs in the dark, because we need to talk about specifics somehow. Did Michael really mean any of these? The ones about charity and employee benefits seem too obvious. Let’s explore the possibility that Michael might be recommending that Dropbox change its mission.</p><p>Here’s Dropbox’s current mission from their <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/about\">about</a> page:</p><blockquote><p>We’re here to unleash the world’s creative energy by designing a more enlightened way of&nbsp;working.</p></blockquote><p>Seems like a nice mission that helps the world, right? I use Dropbox myself and can confirm that the product makes my life a little better. So would Michael say that Dropbox is an example of “competing for happiness and impact”?</p><p>If so, then it would have been really helpful if Michael had written in one of his tweets, “I mean like how Dropbox is unleashing the world’s creative energy”. Mentioning Dropbox, or any other specific example, would have really clarified what Michael is talking about.</p><p>And if Dropbox’s current mission <i>isn’t</i> what Michael is calling for, then how would Dropbox need to change it in order to better “compete for happiness and impact”? For instance, would it help if they tack on “and we guarantee that anyone can have access to cloud storage regardless of their ability to pay for it”, or not?</p><p>Notice how this parallels my conversation with Steve about Acme. We begin with what sounds like a meaningful exhortation: <i>Companies should compete for happiness and impact instead of wealth and users/revenue! Acme shouldn’t exploit its workers! </i>But when we reach for specifics, we suddenly find ourselves grasping at straws. I showed three specific guesses of what Michael’s advice <i>could</i> mean for Drew, but we have no idea what it <i>does</i> mean, if anything.</p><p>Imagine that the CEO of Acme wanted to take Steve’s advice about how not to exploit workers. He’d be in the same situation as Drew from Dropbox: confused about the specifics of what his company was supposedly doing wrong, to begin with.</p><p>Once you’ve mastered the power of specificity, you’ll see this kind of thing everywhere: a statement that at first sounds full of substance, but then turns out to actually be empty. And the clearest warning sign is the absence of specific examples.</p><p><strong>Next post:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pFvZXFWbtvKvGiACJ/how-specificity-works\">How Specificity Works</a></p>",

I can vouch that my personal experience as a workshop attendee fits this description:</p><blockquote>Attendees picked [specificity] up from all the instructors having to repeatedly ask the attendees to be more specific, and then having to ask them again, while being specific themselves, until the attendees picked up the rhythm by example and feedback.</blockquote><p>I hope you&apos;re curious to unpack my list of claims about what specificity lets you do, because I&#x2019;m <em>dead serious</em> about all of it!

    "htmlBody": "<p> &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t get much done last week because it was so hot.&#x201D; </p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time a client said this to me, and I was curious. &#x201C;Have you considered getting an air conditioner if it&#x2019;s that bad?&#x201D; </p><p>&#x201C;No&#x201D; He replied (let&#x2019;s call him Philip), &#x201C;An open window is usually enough. It&#x2019;s just that the heatwave this week was particularly bad.&#x201D; When we discussed it a bit more, Philip said it didn&#x2019;t seem worth the hassle since the AC only really felt necessary for a few weeks during the summer. </p><p>So, was Philip right? Is it worth buying an AC as a productivity hack?</p><h1><strong>How much is your time worth?</strong> </h1><p>Most people don&#x2019;t think about air conditioners when evaluating their productivity, because it&#x2019;s not within the normal scope of time management. But if you frame productivity as the careful use of your resources - including time, effort, and money - to accomplish your goals, then an AC is fair game as a productivity hack. The question becomes &#x201C;is the cost of buying the AC a good deal for the productive time it saves you?&#x201D; </p><p>If you don&#x2019;t already have an estimate of how much you will spend to save an hour, try estimating it with the tools below. A dollar value is a handy tool when deciding which time savers are a bargain. </p><p>This <a href=\"https://programs.clearerthinking.org/what_is_your_time_really_worth_to_you.html#.XVr11ujYqUk\">Clearer Thinking tool</a> is convenient for calculating the value of a marginal hour of your time. (A normal work hour may be worth more or less to you, depending on whether you care more about output from focused work hours or work/life balance. The marginal output of an additional hour worked decreases, probably starting somewhere after three to six hours per day. On the other hand, the marginal value of an hour of free time to <em>you</em> starts increasing the more you&#x2019;ve worked.) </p><p>Another way to calculate the value of a marginal hour of work time is to look at what you could earn in a marginal hour as a baseline for how much your time is worth, e.g. tutoring on Wyzant. These estimate how much you would be willing to pay for an hour of your time. If your income is particularly unstable or you have less than 6 months runway, you may want to be more cautious about spending money. </p><p>You could also try directly estimating the value you produce in an hour. Since this seems difficult to do for most people, a plausible proxy is how much existing metrics value the impact of your time. 80,000 Hours&#x2019; <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2018/10/2018-talent-gaps-survey/#ea-leaders-are-willing-to-sacrifice-a-lot-of-extra-donations-to-hold-on-to-their-most-recent-hires\">survey found EA org leaders</a> valued their most recent junior hire for 3 years at $1,050,000 (average) and $450,000 (median). Assuming 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, that values an hour of junior hire time at $175 and $75, respectively. For a senior hire, they gave $7,400,000 (average) and $3,000,000 (median), which works out to $1,233 and $500 an hour respectively. While these numbers may be <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2019/05/why-do-organisations-say-recent-hires-are-worth-so-much/\">overestimating</a> the value, an <em>order of magnitude</em> less would still be $17.5 per hour for a junior person and $120 per hour for a senior person. </p><h1><strong>What does an AC cost?</strong> </h1><p>Now that you have an estimate of your time, let&#x2019;s compare the value of an AC to other ways you can buy productive time with money. For these calculations, I&#x2019;m going to estimate an hour is worth $30 (50 cents a minute). Your personal value for time may be much higher (or lower if you&#x2019;re cash constrained right now). </p><p>Research on the impact of heat on productivity suggests productivity starts decreasing at as low as 22&#xB0;C (72&#xB0;F) and decreases by about 2% for every degree Celsius above 24&#xB0;C (75&#xB0;F) (Footnote 1). This would imply that at 29&#xB0;C, it would take about 4 extra hours per week on average to get the same amount done (a 10% reduction in productivity). While exactly where your productivity starts decreasing depends on your <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0216362&amp;fbclid=IwAR2-G05IZZoh-G8hAkXj0J90nHHZWxy3ej59tfvf3iwSCA38yuhwJI66SNc\">gender</a>, it seems almost certain you&#x2019;re not doing your top work if it&#x2019;s blazing hot in your office.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s do some quick back of the envelope calculations. Assuming that your productivity is reduced by 20% per week when the temperature is above 35&#xB0;C (losing 8 hours per week) and you value your time at $30 an hour, that heat caused you to lose $240 worth in one week. </p><p>A window or portable AC unit costs around $300 on Amazon (plus up to $20 per week in electricity) and can completely solve the problem (Footnote 2). That buys time at about 35 cents per minute in two weeks of a heatwave. If you have four weeks of heatwaves, your cost per minute saved goes down to 20 cents. After that, the cost of running the AC for an entire week is more than paid for by saving 1 hour. </p><p>If you really don&#x2019;t want to buy an AC, find a place that does have AC and work there during heat waves. You could also try working in the morning and evening, and taking a break during the warmest parts of the day. These ideas accomplish the same productivity benefit for hassle instead of money.</p><p>20 cents per minute seems like a pretty good deal on time, given we started out willing to pay 50 cents. Let&#x2019;s see how it compares to other ways you can buy time. </p><h1><strong>How much does it cost to buy time other ways?</strong> </h1><h2><strong>Paying for a laundry service </strong></h2><p>A laundry service that picks up your clothes costs $30-$40 a week based on a quick look at two sites, and I&#x2019;m ballparking that it would save about 30 minutes per week (it&#x2019;s hard to tell, since it&#x2019;s in 5-10 minute chunks here and there). So using the laundry service buys time at around $1.17 a minute. Pretty expensive compared to our baseline of 50 cents. </p><h2><strong>Buying Soylent</strong></h2><p>Replacing breakfast power smoothies with Soylent. Soylent is $3.25 per bottle ($2.53 if you buy in bulk with Amazon subscribe and save). It takes about 5-10 min and $2 to make a <a href=\"https://powersmoothie.org/\">power smoothie</a> with a similar number of calories. So Soylent buys time at about 10-20 cents a minute. So basically, you&#x2019;re getting an awesome deal on your time by drinking Soylent occasionally. It&#x2019;s like the Black Friday sale on time. </p><h2><strong>Eating takeout </strong></h2><p>I&#x2019;m estimating $15 to buy a meal and assuming leftovers to be about another meal&#x2019;s worth for myself. So $7.50 per meal for compared to $2 per meal and 10 minutes (based on 60min spent preparing 6 meals in bulk). So at about $5.50 to save 10min, eating takeout buys time at about 55 cents per minute, almost breaking even. (Note: There are other health considerations that may easily trump the productivity gain, plus taste and variety.)</p><h2><strong>Hiring a house cleaner</strong></h2><p>Our house cleaner is $25 an hour, and I estimate she cleans as quickly as I could. So this buys time at about 42 cents per minute, which does a bit better than breaking even. (Avoiding particularly unpleasant hours may be worth more to you than a normal hour, however.) </p><h2><strong>Taking an Uber </strong></h2><p>The value of an Uber can vary a lot between rides, but basically it&#x2019;s worthwhile when you can save two minutes for each extra dollar you spend above what you would have paid for public transit. A recent 30-minute Uber with 3 people cost us $28 ($16 more than the $12 the Bart would have cost), and saved 15 min. Split across 3 people, that works out to 36 cents per minute. </p><h1><strong>How do those compare?</strong> </h1><p>If you have 4 weeks of heatwave over the lifetime of the AC, the AC is a better deal than anything except Soylent. If you only have two weeks of heatwave, it&#x2019;s still better than laundry service, takeout, or a housecleaner. </p><p>Of course, the math may work out differently for you. It&#x2019;s likely that there&#x2019;s significant individual variation in the value for an hour, the details for the above estimates, and how much heat affects you.  Your calculations may look significantly different, so feel free to make a copy of my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HYhHP9F4-02A6jUcVeBpyWUDNjcZZr-OB453nMPQhSM/edit?usp=sharing\">calculations here</a> and adjust for your own inputs. </p><p>I expect a lot of the benefit of an AC to come at extreme temperatures, which is where most people report a clearly noticeable difference in productivity. This particularly true if you live in Europe, which is currently experiencing its third heatwave this summer. July&#x2019;s heatwave broke at least <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/25/8930325/europe-heat-wave-france-uk-paris-germany-record\">four countries&#x2019; heat records</a> with temperatures up to 108 &#xB0;F. </p><p>If you live in a city where the temperature is above 35&#xB0;C (95&#xB0;F) for more than two weeks per year and you don&#x2019;t work in an air-conditioned space, you should probably go buy an AC right now. For more moderate high temperatures, say 26&#xB0;C (80&#xB0;F), it seems more likely you&#x2019;ll be able to cool off with an open window or a fan. </p><p>But even if you live in Alaska, you now know what your time is worth. Try looking for other opportunities to buy some time at a bargain. </p><p>______________________________________________________________________</p><p>Footnote 1:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519618302377\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519618302377</a></p><p>Pg. 527</p><p>Workers&apos; health and productivity under occupational heat strain: a systematic review and meta-analysis</p><p>&#x201C;heat stress (defined as wet-bulb globe temperature beyond 22.0 or 24.8&#xB0;C depending on work intensity&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;11 studies with 8076 workers were included in meta-analysis three.

In short: probabilities directly represent information. This interpretation makes sense even in the absence of “agents” with “beliefs”, or “independent experiments” repeated infinitely many times. It directly talks about maps matching territories, and the role probability plays, without invoking any of the machinery of frequentist or subjectivist interpretations. That means we can potentially apply it in a broader variety of situations - we can talk about simple mechanical processes which produce “maps” of the world, and the probabilistic calculations embedded in those processes.</p><p>Second, this is a natural first step in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3uyjYp5Wi3hqWrjFk/the-missing-math-of-map-making\"><u>characterizing</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/t5DFpygMqpnFsmJ3b/cartographic-processes\"><u>map-making processes</u></a>. The data processing inequality also suggests a natural next step: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_statistic\"><u>sufficient statistics</u></a>, which serve as minimal “lossless” maps when our data are independent samples from a distribution, and our queries can ask anything at all about the parameters of the distribution. From there, we could further generalize to approximate sufficient statistics - maps which throw out a small amount of information relevant to the queries, in cases where there is no “lossless” map smaller than&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"X\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;\">X</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p><p>That said, this still only talks about half of the full map-making process: the data-processing half.

And of course, when map-making processes are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction\"><u>embedded in the real world</u></a>, there might not be a clean separation between data-collection and data-processing, so we need to deal with that somehow.</p><p>Third, the interpretation of probabilities as a minimal map - or a representation of information - suggests possible avenues to relax traditional probability to deal with things which are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FvcyMMaJKhYibtFDD/bayesian-probability-is-for-things-that-are-space-like\"><u>time-like separated from us</u></a>, e.g. for handling self-reference and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/zcPLNNw4wgBX5k8kQ\"><u>advanced decision-theoretic problems</u></a>. In particular, it suggests strategically throwing away information to deal with self-referential tomfoolery - but continuing to use probabilities to represent the reduced information remaining.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Happy new school year to my fellow students! With my first year of grad school under my belt, and my sword and shield out for Round 2, I wanted to share a tool that’s helped me on my journey.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, my go-to system for organizing my research and writing “citations in 3 different programs” + “pile everything into a haphazard series of google docs and hope for the best”. I figured this wasn’t great. After doing some reading and trying several alternatives, I discovered Tiddlywiki.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/\">Tiddlywiki</a> is an ancient open-source wiki application in the form of an html file. It has all the tools you need to make a wiki in the form of “tiddlers”, self-contained chunks of info that you can tag and link to each other. When you save the wiki, the program and your text all get wrapped up together into the same .html file – it both stores your info and is the program for running the wiki. It works on any web browser, as well as special programs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eukaryotewritesblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/selection_038.png?w=624\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"A screenshot from a tiddlywiki file, including several links and notes\"></p>\n<p>I stuck with it and here’s why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wiki format:</strong> Wikis seem really compatible with the way my brain works. If I take notes on a book or article, that source gets its own tiddler on the wiki. They can then get interwoven, crosslinked, expanded upon, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Elegant:</strong> Does most things I want it to. Easy to link to tiddlers and drag them or other files in from other wikis/folders. The structure is transparent and customizable.</li>\n<li><strong>Robust:</strong> Tiddlywikis from a decade ago are still perfectly functional today. The entire program and dataset lives in one small html file that runs on anything with a web browser.</li>\n<li><strong>Meta-aesthetics:</strong> Feeding all my data to Google is a little worrying. Tiddlywiki, meanwhile, is open-source and runs from your computer. The fact that the program is a quine is really neat.</li>\n<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Tiddlywikis have an encryption function baked in. I don’t know if it’s very good. Consider using <a href=\"https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html\">Veracrypt</a> for better security. But if you don’t want to do that, here you go.  This also means you can upload your wikis and backups to cloud services while keeping them encrypted. (Go to “Tools” in the sidebar, then click on the “set password” button. After you set a password, you can look at the .html file text to be sure that, yes, everything is encrypted into nonsense characters.)</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable:</strong> Easily change the color scheme, any text or formatting, the layout, etc. It’s extremely adaptable. You can also install a variety of plugins, though I haven’t felt the need to myself as of yet.</li>\n<li><strong>Transportable:</strong> My wikis live on a flashdrive and can work on any computer. I took all my research with me to and from work every day this summer for an internship.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Things I like less</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saving</strong> is not obvious. This simplest version is “edit a copy of a blank tiddlywiki in a web browser, save locally to your computer or a flash drive, repeat every time you edit it”, which is kind of a pain.\n** I work on various computers, so my Tiddlywikis are saved on a flash drive. I edit them in web browsers, and save them back to the flash drive when I’m done. I back them up every week.\n** On my Ubuntu laptop, I edit them with the program <a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/static/TiddlyDesktop.html\">TiddlyDesktop</a>, which makes saving easier.</li>\n<li>You can use <strong>images</strong>, but they get saved as raw code into the html file itself (so every image makes the file that much larger), and there aren’t tools for manipulating them. (There is a cute, tiny, and almost useless drawing program baked in.) I tend to save a few images, like graphs or figures from papers, but wouldn’t personally use Tiddlywiki for image-heavy work.</li>\n<li>Some features (e.g. spellcheck, in-text search with highlighting) <strong>depend on the browser</strong> or other program you’re using to edit the wikis.</li>\n<li>Kind of old-looking, <strong>not maximally aesthetic</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number of wikis you have is up to you. I started with one wiki for a specific writing project and one wiki for work, notes and research. My active Tiddlywikis now include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grad school material</li>\n<li>Internship research material</li>\n<li>General writing, notes, and personal research</li>\n<li>Writing and worldbuilding/characterization/plot details for a novel</li>\n<li>Recipe storage</li>\n<li>Quotes and poetry I like</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your mileage may vary.</p>\n<h1>How do I try it?</h1>\n<p>First, check out some tiddlywikis that have been converted into websites. <a href=\"http://tesis.tiddlyspot.com/\">Here’s a nice one to explore as an example</a>, a thesis website in Spanish. <a href=\"http://reasoningwell.tiddlyspot.com/\">Here’s one on philosophy.</a> (Note that you can’t actually edit the versions that appear on the website. You can locally save the whole wiki and changes you make to it, though.)</p>\n<p>If you like it, here are some resources to get you started. <a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/\">This is the official website</a>, which has lots of helpful documentation. (Note that it’s also a tiddlywiki!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzZCajspPU_UjFn0uy-J9URz0LP4zhxRK\">Here are some youtube videos</a> I also found helpful.</p>\n<p>After making a few tiddlywikis, I found that I kept making the same tweaks to them to get them set up in a way useful for me. In that light, I made a new “blank” or “empty” tiddlywiki that had those changes baked in already.</p>\n<p>Here it is: <a href=\"http://eukaryotewritesblog.tiddlyspot.com/\">the Eukaryote Writes Blog empty tiddlywiki</a>. You may find it better than the default empty wiki. It comes with a couple new color schemes, a table of contents, and some layout tweaks, among other small changes.</p>\n<h1>Other research tools</h1>\n<p>All hail the <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Exobrain\">exobrain</a>!</p>\n<p>I keep track of research citations formally with <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/\">Zotero</a>, or the tool my work prefers. For informal reading, I’ll also just note the authors and title and/or URL of the source (in my tiddlywiki!) so I can find it later.</p>\n<p>For keeping track of time spent working, I’ve gotten some utility out of <a href=\"https://kanbanflow.com/\">KanbanFlow</a>. I like <a href=\"https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique\">the Pomodoro Technique</a>, and KanbanFlow has both pomodoro timers and a nice task-sorting and task-prioritization system built in. I currently don’t worry about tracking time, and use Google Calendar, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelwmiller/how-to-start-a-bullet-journal\">a bullet journal</a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2019/08/wall-board-to-get-an-overview-of-plan-projects-and-tasks/\">bastardized Kanban Board variant</a> to keep my brain in order.</p>\n<p>Previously, I used the website <a href=\"https://www.marinaratimer.com/\">MarinaraTimer</a> to time pomodoros. I love it for exactly two reasons: the ability to pause pomodoros, and the sound effect “Ominous Woosh”.</p>\n",

    "htmlBody": "<p> <em>CW: Analogies</em></p><p>You and a friend are arguing over a physics question: \"You're on a train speeding seventy miles per hour east, while you run 5 miles per hour west. How fast are you moving?\"</p><p><em>That's obvious</em>, you think to yourself. <em>The question says I'm running 5 miles per hour west</em>, <em>so I must be moving 5 miles per hour west. The extra stuff about the train is just there to confuse me.</em></p><p>Your friend is just as convinced: <em>If the train's moving 70 miles per hour east, and I'm running 5 miles per hour west, then my speed must be 65 miles per hour east</em>, he reasons. <em>I guess this guy must just be one of the slower kids at school. </em>The next five minutes are spent in argument because you're telepathic and can hear your friend's mocking thoughts.</p><p>Then, because this was actually one of those dreams where you're back in high school and don't know any of the answers on the test, Galileo materializes in front of you.</p><p>\"Forsake these notions of absolute velocity!\" he booms. \"Woe unto you, who have so quickly forgotten my doctrine of Galilean relativity! You are traveling 5 miles per hour west relative to the train, and 65 miles per hour east relative to the train tracks. You’re also going like a bajillion miles per hour around the sun.\"</p><p>You are both deeply embarrassed, and have learned your lesson. You will never again forget that a measurement devoid of context is meaningless. What matters is the <em>relationship</em> between measurements. To talk about velocities, you need a <em>reference point</em> to compare to.</p><p>Galileo smiles at you both as he fades away into the abstract concept of experimentation.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>It’s temptingly easy to argue absolute velocities.</p><p>Take Scott’s SSC <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/24/how-bad-are-things/\">post</a>, \"How Bad Are Things?\"</p><blockquote><em>This is also why I am wary whenever people start boasting about how much better we’re doing than back in the bad old days. That precise statement seems to in fact be true. [… But] I don’t think we have any idea how many people do or don’t have it pretty good.</em></blockquote><p>Now, this is, strictly speaking, true. Just because the world's improved, that doesn't mean the average person's life is good right now, because the question is wrong. Good or bad <em>by what standard? </em>How many people have it \"Pretty good\" depends almost entirely on what bar you pick, and not at all on how good people's lives actually are.</p><p>Even if you think the right bar is obvious, it isn't. You could put the bar for \"a life worth living\" at bare subsistence. After all, most people would rather be alive than dead, so it's reasonable to assume their lives have <em>some</em> positive value. You could also set the bar at the average person’s quality of life. You could pick some \"Acceptable\" quality of living based on what you think constitutes a bare minimum. You could stop making me list examples since I'm running out. There's infinitely many lines you could pick here, all at least somewhat arbitrary. </p><p>Or maybe you’re arguing about whether the world is fundamentally a good place or not. So imagine we find a moralometer, way out past Alpha Centauri, which can perfectly measure the amount of good in the universe. Having discovered this moralometer, you can now read off its precise output: The amount of good in the world is <em>exactly </em>equal to 1,276,642.</p><p>You might be a bit disappointed to hear that this number has changed exactly zero opinions on anything, because without having anything to compare it to, <em>this number is meaningless</em>.</p><p>This sounds pretty familiar, doesn’t it? We have two free variables, two questions we are trying to answer at the same time, but the answer to each depends on the other. \"Is this possible world good\" fails to be meaningful. Even if we agree on every ethical question and have zero disagreements about the state of the world, we haven’t set a reference point for what’s “Good.”</p><p>So the question of whether a possible world is good might be a meaningless one parsed literally. But nobody parses the question literally. Nobody tries to calculate the total amount of good before comparing it to a predetermined standard to see if it's above or below it. </p><p>No, the truth is much worse. As soon as you’re discussing whether something is “Good” or “Bad” instead of “Better” or “Worse,” you’ve already failed. As soon as you start to argue about whether a policy, a choice, or anything else would be “Good,” you’ve left a free variable in the equations, and that way lies confusion.</p><p>Your subconscious is far better at tricking you than you give it credit for. Give it a single opening, leave a single definition unspecified, and it will immediately grasp for any <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/M3TJ2fTCzoQq66NBJ/p/Kow8xRzpfkoY7pa69\">positive affect</a> that it can attach to help you win your argument; your brain is interested in winning arguments, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/04/ethnic-tension-and-meaningless-arguments/\">even if they’re meaningless</a>, not in being right. Without even noticing, your brain will seize on a reference point that lets you call your position “Good,” and anyone who dislikes your position will just as easily find a reference point to deny you this victory. After all, what could be more good than “Good” itself?</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Just since I started writing this post, I’ve noticed at least half a dozen conversations falling into this failure mode. The most recent was a discussion on the US healthcare system where about thirty minutes in I realized with extreme embarrassment that the other person wasn’t actually disagreeing with me on whether some candidate’s particular healthcare plan was an improvement over the current US healthcare system-- they just thought that this plan was worse than some other candidate’s healthcare plan.</p><p>There’s a couple suggestions I can make to help avoid this mistake. </p><p>The first is, beware of any words that convey , like “Good” or “Bad.” As soon as you hear these words come up in a discussion, start worrying. You will notice that the CBO score on bills does not include a section saying “this law contains an essence of goodness.”</p><p>Usually, the words you're looking for are “Better” and “Worse.” “Democratic candidate# 247’s healthcare policy is better than #233’s” is far less likely to fall prey to this problem than “Democratic candidate #247’s healthcare policy is good.” None of this is to say that you can <em>never</em> use the words good/bad (everyone knows what you mean when you say “Killing is bad”), but the situations where you're disagreeing are rarely the same situations where you can afford even an ounce of vagueness.</p><p>At some point in the healthcare discussion laid out above, someone mentioned something along the lines of “Yeah, but better than the American healthcare system is a low bar to clear.” This is the smoking gun. As soon as you hear this, you know the conversation has gone off track. </p><p><em>There. Are. No. Objective. Bars.</em> To figure out if a bar is high or low, you need another bar, and if you ask the first bar, it’s the other one that’s wrong. A bar can be bad at conveying information, i.e. “Passing this law would be better than starting a genocide,” <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/\">but it can't be <em>wrong</em></a>. </p><p>Even if you think the reference point you’re using is <em>probably </em>obvious, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK/p/sSqoEw9eRP2kPKLCz\">it is not</a>. People will pick terrible reference points even when there's a perfectly good reference point that the rest of the world uses; see Americans' insistence that water must freeze at exactly 32 degrees. In my healthcare discussion, I thought that the reference point “The way things are right now” was obvious.  It was not.</p><p>You'd better be damn sure that the reference point is obvious before you use it. Anything less clear than “Murder is bad” (reference point clearly intended to be <em>not </em>murdering people) should probably be avoided. Most importantly, if someone disagrees with a claim you've made along the lines “X is good/bad,” proceed to set an explicit reference point. </p><p>After all, arguing absolute velocities is pretty bad.</p>",

The Solstice is an annual gathering where we come together to celebrate humanity and the things that matter to us.</p><p>We&#x27;re now soliciting volunteers from the Rationalist and Effective Altruist communities for the various volunteering roles that the Solstice will require! Consider giving a speech, leading a singalong, or joining the Bay Area Bayesian Choir for its autumn rehearsals. We&#x27;re also looking for intrepid volunteers who might like to be in charge of A/V, food, programs, and other aspects of event logistics.</p><p><strong>Apply here: <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/wintersolstice2019contributors?fbclid=IwAR0rW-GdYVLU5qQa2myR6QPFAsry8PwHNwkeYTFXRhO5tQcOEY_6OsPb17o\">https://tinyurl.com/wintersolstice2019contributors</a></strong></p><p>New this year, we will also be having an unconference the Saturday immediately before Solstice, in the style and flavor of New York&#x27;s Megameetup. Tickets will be sold separately. Stay tuned for details.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Nat, Claire, &amp; Chelsea</p>",

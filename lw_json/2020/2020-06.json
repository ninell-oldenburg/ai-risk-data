Key quote:</p>\n<p>\"Our key insight is that agents can assist humans without inferring their goals or limiting their autonomy by instead increasing the human’s controllability of their environment – in other words, their ability to affect the environment through actions. We capture this via empowerment, an information-theoretic quantity that is a measure of the controllability of a state through calculating the logarithm of the number of possible distinguishable future states that are reachable from the initial state [41]. In our method, Assistance via Empowerment (AvE), we formalize the learning of assistive agents as an augmentation of reinforcement learning with a measure of human empowerment. The intuition behind our method is that by prioritizing agent actions that increase the human’s empowerment, we are enabling the human to more easily reach whichever goal they want. Thus, we are assisting the human without information about their goal[...]<strong>Without any information or prior assumptions about the human’s goals or intentions, our agents can still learn to assist humans.</strong>\"[Emphasis and omissions are mine]</p>\n<p>From the abstract: One difficulty in using artificial agents for human-assistive applications lies in the challenge of accurately assisting with a person's goal(s). Existing methods tend to rely on inferring the human's goal, which is challenging when there are many potential goals or when the set of candidate goals is difficult to identify. We propose a new paradigm for assistance by instead increasing the human's ability to control their environment, and formalize this approach by augmenting reinforcement learning with human empowerment. This task-agnostic objective preserves the person's autonomy and ability to achieve any eventual state. We test our approach against assistance based on goal inference, highlighting scenarios where our method overcomes failure modes stemming from goal ambiguity or misspecification. As existing methods for estimating empowerment in continuous domains are computationally hard, precluding its use in real time learned assistance, we also propose an efficient empowerment-inspired proxy metric. Using this, we are able to successfully demonstrate our method in a shared autonomy user study for a challenging simulated teleoperation task with human-in-the-loop training.</p>\n<p>How does this fit in with <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eXNy48LxxfgETdtYB/comparing-ai-alignment-approaches-to-minimize-false-positive\">other control problem approaches</a>?

    "htmlBody": "<p>This post is about applying rationality to my dating life. It is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kLR5H4pbaBjzZxLv6/polyhacking\">gooey and rich in self-disclosure</a>. But it was a great triumph over motivated reasoning.</p><p><strong>I notice my confusion</strong></p><p>When I was 22 I that my romances began mainly when I was busy. They began most often, paradoxically, when I was unable to pay attention to my interest in early courtship. The observation was interesting but did not then replace my preferred explanation for romantic successes and failures.</p><p>At the time I subscribed to, what I call, the &#x201C;mental health&#x201D; hypothesis<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/newPost#_ftn1\">[1]</a>. When I was healthy and confident women could sense it and chose to date me. Sometimes I became &#x201C;unhealthy&#x201D; and women became disinterested. Partners sensed &#x201C;unhealth&#x201D; by uncontrollable micro-cues. Thinking about dating will only make you more self-conscious and worsen your chances. This explanation agreed with the results of my favorite epistemology: asking my female friends what they think happened (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100228075410/http:/www.feministcritics.org/blog/2008/04/26/do-women-know-what-they-want/\">critique of this method</a>). At the time I had not learned Bayes theorem, Occamian reasoning or any social influence literature, so the &#x201C;mental health&#x201D; hypothesis seemed plausible. Besides, I liked my earlier beliefs. I just need to be &#x201C;better&#x201D; then women will like me. It was a simple, appealing narrative. If Iost that explanation, the alternatives might be &#x201C;you must be a jerk&#x201D; or &#x201C;you are unattractive&#x201D;, which scared me. Besides, Me_2016 did not know the benefits of<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5bZZZJ5psXrrD5BGb/p/wCqfCLs8z5Qw4GbKS\"> saying &#x201C;oops&#x201D;.</a></p><p>By 2019, the &#x201C;mental health&#x201D; explanation was under increasing strain. The conventional advice was to make your life full by exercising, working on your mental health, improving your career, and the partners will come&#x201D;. The problem was that it did not work, despite soundind wise. In the Summer of 2019 I was healthy,4; I had a good job, strong friendship networks, passionate hobbies, and plenty of exercise. It was the ideal time to seek a partner and I put great energy into the search. Despite my apparent health, I had the worst results in years. When I pointed this out, my poor friends could only shake their heads and think &#x201C;there he goes, trying to solve the unsolvable.&#x201D;</p><p>The nail in the coffin of the &#x201C;mental health&#x201D; hypothesis came that winter. I lost my job, was briefly jailed in a foreign country, and emerged into a revolution and a currency crisis to look for work. That same month I broke my back and worked myself into an emotional collapse. <em>And women loved it</em>. I got more positive response that one month than 5 months in nest-building mode. Something else was going on. I finally <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK\">noticed my confusion</a>.</p><p>This summer I reinvestigated with Bayesian reasoning. First, I had to choose between believing two unlikely statements. Either this pattern of relationships was a strange coincidence, or my female friends had no idea what made them choose who to date. The first conclusion seemed unlikely, as from the 15 or so courtships I remembered the three successes occurred during strenuous efforts to hide my interest. That pattern is unlikely if relationships occur randomly. The second conclusion had seemed wildly implausible at first. But after reading about a mountain of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/jnZbHi873v9vcpGpZ\">cognitive bias</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality\">the difficulty of rationality</a>, the unknowability of our preferences made sense. I began talking to my friends about how they selected partners. I mostly found their responses to be nonsensical, either drawing on overcomplicated psychological constructs or qualities that did not seem special at all.</p><p>Furthermore, the &#x201C;mental health&#x201D; hypothesis relies on partners &#x201C;seeing through me&#x201D;, through just a few social cues, postures, and inflections, to a deep, hidden but somehow well-defined part of my psyche where &#x201C;health&#x201D; information is stored. Such a complicated theory should have a low prior. A low prior with no evidential support&#x2026;</p><p><strong>Availability is the problem</strong></p><p>And a challenger appeared. In the summer of 2019, I accidentally invited three young women on the same hike<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/newPost#_ftn2\">[2]</a>. I was so worried about offending them that I called my mother for advice. She suggested hitting on none of them during the hike, so as to be fair. My mom was an unintentional genius. I started seeing one of the women from the hike the next week. That partner later stated that she was honestly unsure if I was interested until we first made out, with particular reference to the hike. I suspect that forcing myself to now lavish attention on my interest made me a much more appealing partner<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/newPost#_ftn3\">[3]</a>.</p><p>The simple solution I call the availability hypothesis. Potential partners respond to how <em>available</em> I appear, when deciding about a first date. If I signal that they can have me easily, partners do not want me (as much/usually). I have two aligned explanations for the phenomenon. Firstly, partners enjoy the uncertainty of not knowing if I am interested or not. I become a challenge to be achieved. If I just tell someone they are great, then they have achieved that status and only get the pleasure once. I can also give subtle but incomplete signals of interest, each of which provides a separate rush of pleasure. So the person who knows I like them is <em>less</em> likely to come to my party, respond to my messages, notice my cool hobbies and passions, and generally fall in love with me. </p><p>Secondly, there is status competition. If I signal that dating me is easy, they perceive my <em>cost </em>as low. Amateur jewelry shoppers assume expensive jewels are valuable, because assessing the value of each piece independently would be tiring and difficult<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/newPost#_ftn4\">[4]</a>. Likewise, how available I am is a simple value heuristic for prospective. This explanation may be an unflattering, but people do seem to care a lot about social status.</p><p>Note, they are not responding to <em>neediness</em>. Healthy, confident <em>availability</em> is right out as well. Partners are responding to the &#x201C;price tag&#x201D; I present. If I say in the first meeting that I like a person, the chance of a relationship drops, whether I say it confidently or needily. Words like &#x201C;desperate&#x201D; misleadingly imply that there is a healthy, flirtatious way to express <em>unambiguous</em> interest. The correct strategy is to be <em>ambiguous<strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/newPost#_ftn5\">[5]</a></strong></em>. In the words of one ex, you should have &#x201C;General Aloofness&#x201D;.</p><p>I suspect the optimal amount of interest is just enough. Slightly less than your prospective partner is ideal, but slightly more interest may be necessary as women rarely initiate. I must learn to imply interest without ever making it explicit. In other words, I was coming on to strong the whole time.</p><p><strong>An agenda for further experimentation</strong></p><p>There are many more tips to learn. Good posture improves attraction. Eye contact. A good fashion sense goes a long way. A few gestures at traditional masculinity. Teasing seems highly rewarded, so I can learn that. After all, 12-year-olds master the art.</p><p>My next step is to keep experimenting and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Relationship-Initiation-Susan-Sprecher/dp/0805861599/\"> reading</a>.

We can do this at various levels of granularity and for various levels of specificity of proposed alignment methods. What I mean by that is we can consider AI alignment as a whole or various sub-problems within it, like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc\">value learning</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J/the-inner-alignment-problem\">inner alignment</a>, and we can consider high-level approaches to alignment or more specific proposals with more of the details worked out. For this initial post in what may become a series, I'll compare high-level approaches on addressing alignment as a whole.</p><p>Some ground rules:</p><ul><li>By \"alignment\" I mean \"caring about the same things\".<ul><li>If you like I attempted to be more formal about this in \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7dvDgqvqqziSKweRs/formally-stating-the-ai-alignment-problem-1\">Formally Stating the AI Alignment Problem</a>\", but here I'm going to prefer the less formal statement to avoid getting tripped up by being overly specific in just one part of the analysis since we're not being very specific about the alignment methods.</li><li>I say \"cares about the same things\" rather than \"aligned with human interests\" to both <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words\">taboo</a> \"align\" in the definition of \"alignment\" and reflect my philosophical leaning that \"<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/#Car\">caring</a>\" is the fundamental human activity we are interested in when we express a desire to build aligned AI.<ul><li>I definitely have some unpublished idea about what \"caring\" means in terms of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cfvBm2kBtFTgxBB7s/predictive-coding-rl-sl-bayes-mpc\">predictive coding</a> in terms of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ALvnz3DrjHwmLG29F/values-valence-and-alignment\">valence</a>. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvXFBaThWrMsSjicD/craving-suffering-and-predictive-processing-three\">This is a good recent approximation of them</a> written by someone more understandable than me, and accords with <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k8F8TBzuZtLheJt47/deconfusing-human-values-research-agenda-v1\">some things I've previously written</a>. Hopefully not relevant beyond disclosing my background assumptions.</li><li>Care synonyms for the scrupulous: interest, purpose, telos, concern, value, and preference as long as we use it in the everyday sense of the word to point at a broad category of human activity and not as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference\">jargon</a> about choice (even though this broad category does influence how we choose).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>By \"high-level approaches\" I don't mean specific mechanisms or methods for building aligned AI, but general directions or ways in which specific methods are intended to work.<ul><li>For example, I consider <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HqLxuZ4LhaFhmAHWk/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-1\">iterated distillation and amplification</a> an approach, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fRsjBseRuvRhMPPE5/an-overview-of-11-proposals-for-building-safe-advanced-ai\">various ways of using IDA to build aligned AI</a> specific methods.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy\">Abstractions</a> are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ipCAL4tx7jcJsFasY/abstraction-causality-and-embedded-maps-here-be-monsters\">complicated</a>, and there's no explicit principle by which I'm making the \"high-level\" cut off other than some heuristic about the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy/p/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H\">level of abstraction</a> that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ix3KdfJxjo9GQFkCo/web-of-connotations-bleggs-rubes-thermostats-and-beliefs\">lets me lump</a> all of the methods that seem more similar to each other than different under the same approach.</li></ul></li><li>If you don't want to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JYdGCrD55FhS4iHvY/robustness-to-fundamental-uncertainty-in-agi-alignment-1\">dive into the details of the method</a> I'm using here, the tl;dr on it is that we have more to lose from failure than gain from success when developing technologies that create existential risks, and so we should prefer risk mitigation interventions with lower risks of false positives, all else equal, thus I look for arguments that let us at least give an ordinal ranking of interventions in terms of false positive risk.<ul><li>I talk of \"false positive risk\" here because I mean the risk that we think an intervention will work, we try it, and it fails in a way that results in an outcome as bad as or worse than the outcome if we had tried no intervention or not developed the technology because it was deemed too risky.<ul><li>By comparison a false negative here is failing to try an intervention that would have worked but we incorrectly ruled it out because we thought it wouldn't work, seemed too risky, or made some other error in judging it.</li></ul></li><li>To find that ordinal ranking I primarily look for arguments that allow one intervention to dominate another in terms of false positive risks (see the section on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JYdGCrD55FhS4iHvY/robustness-to-fundamental-uncertainty-in-agi-alignment-1#Meta_ethical_uncertainty\">meta-ethical uncertainty in the original paper</a> for an example of this kind of reasoning) or show that all else is not equal and the safest choice is not necessarily the one with the lowest false positive risk (see the section on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JYdGCrD55FhS4iHvY/robustness-to-fundamental-uncertainty-in-agi-alignment-1#Uncertainty_about_mental_phenomena\">mental phenomena in the original paper</a> for an example).</li><li>To get there I'll consider the false positive risks associated with each approach, then look for arguments and evidence that will allow us to compare these risks.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I'll be comparing three high-level approaches to AI alignment that I term Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA), Ambitious Value Learning (AVL), and Normative Embedded Agency (NEA). By each of these, for the purposes of this post, I'll mean the following, which I believe captures the essence of these approaches but obviously leaves out lots of specifics about various ways they may be implemented.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HqLxuZ4LhaFhmAHWk/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-1\">Iterated Distillation and Amplification</a> (IDA)<ul><li>Build an AI, have it interact with humans to form a more aligned (and generally more capable) AI-human system, then build a new AI with the same capabilities as the AI-human system. Repeat.</li><li>This is a family of methods based on Paul Chritiano's ideas about IDA and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cYduioQNeHALQAMre/what-are-the-differences-between-all-the-iterative-recursive\">includes debate, HCH, and others</a>.</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN/what-is-ambitious-value-learning\">Ambitious Value Learning</a> (AVL)<ul><li>Build AI that learns what humans want and gives it to them.</li><li>Today we have Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) systems that are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/vX7KirQwHsBaSEdfK\">narrow</a> or non-ambitious value learners. Work like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\">CIRL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into-1\">Stuart Armstrong's reach agenda</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k8F8TBzuZtLheJt47/deconfusing-human-values-research-agenda-v1\">my own work on deconfusing human values</a> suggest ways we might move towards ambitious value learners.</li></ul></li><li>Normative <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i3BTagvt3HbPMx6PN/embedded-agency-full-text-version\">Embedded Agency</a> (NEA)<ul><li>Build AI that follows norms about how it makes decisions that makes those decisions aligned with humanity's interests.</li><li>The closest we have to specific proposals within this approach are <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf\">MIRI's ideas</a> about Highly Reliable Agent Designs (HRAD) and Error Tolerant Agent Designs (HTAD), perhaps combined with something like <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf\">Coherent Extrapolated Volition</a> (CEV).</li><li>Otherwise NEA seems like a natural extension of the kind of work MIRI is doing, viz. it might be possible to bake a decision algorithm into an AI such that it achieves alignment by both computing long enough over enough detail and being programmed, via embodying a particular decision theory, to effectively care about the same things humans do.</li><li>The reality is that NEA as described here is a bit of a straw category that no one is likely to try, as in isolation it's like the GOFAI approach to alignment, and more realistic approaches would combine insights from this cluster with other methods. Nonetheless, I'll let it stand for illustrative purposes, since I care more in the post about demonstrating the method than providing immediately actionable advice.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I do not think these are an exhaustive categorization of all possible alignment schemes; rather they are three that I have enough familiarity with to reason about and consider to be the most promising approaches people are investigating. There is at least a fourth approach I'm not considering here because I haven't thought about it enough—building AI that is aligned because it emulates how human brains function—and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H9sxfAZGGAsx5BdYD/what-are-the-high-level-approaches-to-ai-alignment\">probably others</a> different enough that they warrant their own category.</p><h1>Sources of False Positive Risk</h1><p>For each of the three approaches we must consider their false positive risks. Once we have done that, we can consider the risks of each approach relative to the others. Remember, here I'll be basing my analysis on my summary of these approaches given above, not on any specific alignment proposal.</p><p>I'll give some high level thoughts on why each may fail and then make a specific statement summing each one up. I won't go into a ton of detail both because in some cases others already have (and I'll link when that's the case) or because these seem like fairly obvious observations that most readers of the Alignment Forum will readily agree with. If that's not the case please bring it up in the comments and we can go into more detail.</p><ul><li><strong>IDA</strong><ul><li>Humans may fail to apply sufficient pressure on the combined system to produce a more aligned system after distillation.</li><li>Humans may fail to be able to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375393/hch-as-a-measure-of-manipulation\">exert enough control</a> over the combined system to produce a more aligned system during amplification.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S7csET9CgBtpi7sCh/challenges-to-christiano-s-capability-amplification-proposal\">Competing pressures and incentives</a> during amplification may swamp alignment such that humans themselves choose to prefer less aligned AI.</li><li><strong>More specifically</strong>, IDA may fail because humans are unable to express themselves through their actions in ways that constrain the behavior of an AI during amplification such that the distilled AI for the next iteration is unable to ever adequately incorporate what humans care about, resulting in unaligned AI that may fail in various standard ways (treacherous turn, etc.).</li></ul></li><li><strong>AVL</strong><ul><li>There may be no value learning norm that allows an AI to learn and align itself to arbitrary humans.<ul><li>Recall that a value learning norm <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LRYwpq8i9ym7Wuyoc/other-versions-of-no-free-lunch-in-value-learning\">is needed</a> due to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cnjWN4mzmWzggRnCJ/practical-consequences-of-impossibility-of-value-learning\">the no free lunch theorem of value learning</a>.</li></ul></li><li>There may be insufficient information available to an AI to discover what humanity actually cares about, i.e. not enough detail in observed behavior, brain scans, reports from humans, etc..</li><li>AVL approaches may be prone to overfitting the observed data such that they can't generalize to care about the same things humans would care about in novel situations.</li><li><strong>More specifically</strong>, AVL may fail because the AI is unable, for various reasons, to adequately learn/discover what humans care about to become aligned.</li></ul></li><li><strong>NEA</strong><ul><li>We may fail to discover a decision theory that makes an arbitrary agent share human concerns, or no such decision theory exists.</li><li>We may think we discover a decision theory that can produce aligned AI and are wrong about it.</li><li>We may not be able to incrementally verify progress towards alignment via NEA because it's trying to hit a small target many steps down the line by setting the right initial conditions.</li><li><strong>More specifically</strong>, NEA may fail because the decision theory used does not sufficiently constrain or incentivize the agent to become or stay aligned and we may not adequately be able to predict if it will fail or succeed sufficiently far in advance to act.</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Comparisons</h1><p>Given the risks of false positives identified above, we can now look to see if we can rank the approaches in terms of false positive risk by assessing if any of those risks dominate the others, i.e. the false positive risks associated with one approach necessarily pose greater risks and thus higher chance of failure than those associated with another. I believe we can, and I make the following arguments.</p><ul><li>risk(AVL) &lt; risk(IDA)<ul><li>IDA suffers from the same false positive risks as AVL, in that for IDA to work an AI must infer what humans care about from observing them, but adds the additional risk of not only optimizing for what humans care about but also optimizing for other things while the AI increases in capabilities via iteration. Thus IDA is strictly riskier than AVL in terms of false positives.</li></ul></li><li>risk(IDA) &lt; risk(NEA)<ul><li>IDA depends on humans and AIs iteratively via small steps moving towards alignment with regularly opportunities to stop and check before the AI becomes too powerful to control, whereas NEA does not necessarily afford such opportunities. Thus NEA has higher false positive risk because it must get things right by predicting a longer chain of outcomes in advance rather than incrementally making smaller predictions with opportunities to stop if the AI becomes less aligned.</li></ul></li><li>risk(AVL) &lt; risk(NEA)<ul><li>This is to double check that we are correct that our risk assessments are transitive, since if this fails we end up with a circular \"ordering\" and have an error in our reasoning somewhere.</li><li>AVL requires that we determine a value learning norm, but otherwise expects to achieve alignment via observing humans, whereas NEA requires determining norms not just for value learning (which I believe would be implied by having a decision theory that could produce an aligned AI) but for all decision processes, thus it requires \"writing a larger program\" or \"defining a more complex algorithm\" which is more likely to fail all else equal since it has more \"surface area\" where failure may arise.</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Conclusions</h1><p>Based on the above analysis, I'd argue that Ambitious Value Learning is safer than Iterated Distillation and Amplification is safer than Normative Embedded Agency as approaches to building aligned AI in terms of false positive risk, all else equal. <strong>In short, risk(AVL) &lt; risk(IDA) &lt; risk(NEA), or if you like AVL is safer than IDA is safer than NEA, based on false positive risk.</strong></p><p>I think there's a lot that could be better about the above analysis. In particular, it's not very specific, and you might argue that I stood up straw versions of each approach that I then knocked down in ways that are not indicative of how specific proposals would work. I didn't get more specific because I'm more confident I can reason about high level approaches than details about specific proposals, and it's unclear which specific proposals are worth learning in enough detail to perform this evaluation, so as a start this seemed like the best option.</p><p>Also we have the problem that NEA is not as real an approach as IDA or AVL, with the research I cited as the basis for the NEA approach more likely to augment the IDA or AVL approaches rather than offer an alternative to them. Still, I find including the NEA \"approach\" interesting if for no other reason that it points to a class of solutions researchers of the past would have proposed if they were trying to build aligned GOFAI, for example.</p><p>Finally, as I said above, my main goal here is to demonstrate the method, not to strongly make the case that AVL is safer than IDA (even though on reflection I personally believe this). My hope is that this inspires others to do more detailed analyses of this type on specific methods to recommend the safest seeming alignment mechanisms, or that it generates enough interest that I'm encourage to do that work myself. That said, feel free to fight out AVL vs. IDA at the object level in the comments if you like, but if you do at least try to do so within the framework presented here.</p></body></html>",

A few weeks later\nthe state of Massachusetts required them \"\n\n<a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/news/wear-a-mask-in-public\">in public\nplaces where social distancing is not possible</a>\".  A week ago\nSomerville \n\n<a href=\"https://www.somervillema.gov/summer2020\">reduced\nits requirements</a> in light of the heat: \"during the summer months,\nwhen you are outside and able to social distance at least six feet\nfrom others, you may temporarily remove your face covering but must\nput it back on when others are nearby.\"\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\nI was curious what people were actually doing, so while Anna was\nplaying in the \"woods\" along the edge of the bike path, I gathered\nsome statistics.  As each person passed along the path, I tracked mode\nof transportation (walk, run, bike, scooter/skateboard), apparent\ngender (female, male, child, unclear), and face covering status\n(covered, mouth only, removed, absent).  Raw data is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W-YcRCB12t5FikfjRZ2o3dcwc5ln50NZCVQdQEJDp9M/edit\">here</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn forty minutes on June 28th, from 9:41am to 10:21am I saw 179 people\npass.  Of these, 73% (131) were masked, 5% (9) had their nose exposed,\n15% (27) had masks on their chin or otherwise removed, and 7% (12) had\nno mask at all:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/overall-masking-status-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/overall-masking-status.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/overall-masking-status.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/overall-masking-status-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWith a person passing every 13 seconds, the path was a pretty crowded\nplace.  I only very rarely saw people putting on their masks, however,\nwhen coming close to others.  For the analysis below I want to talk\nabout people as being masked or not, and people with masks removed\nwouldn't qualify.  Masks worn mouth-only are less clear, but since a\nlarge fraction of transmission seems to be via talking and coughing, I\ndecided to count someone as masked if their mouth was covered, even if\ntheir nose was sticking out.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhen looking at people by transportation, walkers (74%, 62/84) were a bit less\nlikely to be masked than others (82%, 78/95), but not by much:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-masking-status-by-transport-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-masking-status-by-transport.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-masking-status-by-transport.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-masking-status-by-transport-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nLooking by gender/age, women were less likely to be masked (72%,\n56/78) than men (85%, 74/87). [1] Children were in between (77%,\n10/13), though I didn't count children in bicycle trailers or\nstrollers:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-masking-status-by-gender-age-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-masking-status-by-gender-age.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-masking-status-by-gender-age.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/somerville-masking-status-by-gender-age-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI'm curious what numbers look like in other areas. Talking impressions\nwith friends, it sounds like this is a higher fraction of people\nwearing masks than in most places?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n[1] I categorized people by apparent gender, and one person didn't\nread immediately as male or female.\n\n  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In general, people seem to treat slow takeoff as the safer option as compared to classic FOOMish takeoff (see e.g. <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/takeaways-from-safety-by-default-interviews/\">these interviews</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/strategic-considerations-about-different-speeds-of-ai-takeoff/\">this report</a>, etc). Below, I outline some features of slow takeoff and what they might mean for future outcomes. They do not seem to point to an unambiguously safer scenario, though slow takeoff does seem on the whole likelier to lead to good outcomes.</p>\n<h2>Social and institutional effect of precursor AI</h2>\n<p>If there’s a slow takeoff, AI is a significant feature of the world far before we get to superhuman AI.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-1\" id=\"fnref-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-1\">[1]</a></sup> One way to frame this is that everything is already really weird <em>before</em> there’s any real danger of x-risks. Unless AI is somehow not used in any practical applications, the pre-superhuman but still very capable AI will lead to massive economical, technological, and probably social changes.</p>\n<p>If we expect significant changes to the state of the world during takeoff, it makes it harder to predict what kinds of landscape the AI researchers of that time will be facing. If the world changes a lot between now and superhuman AI, any work on institutional change or public policy might be irrelevant by the time it matters. Also, the biggest effects may be in the AI community, which would be closest to the rapidly changing technological landscape.</p>\n<p>The kinds of work needed if everything is changing rapidly also seem different. Specific organizations or direct changes might not survive in their original, useful form. The people who have thought about how to deal with the sort of problems we might be facing then might be well positioned to suggest solutions, though. This implies that more foundational work might be more valuable in this situation.</p>\n<p>While I expect this to be very difficult to predict from our vantage point, one possible change is mass technological unemployment well before superhuman AI. Of course, historically people have predicted technological unemployment from many new inventions, but the ability to replace large fractions of intellectual work may be qualitatively different. If AI approaches human-level at most tasks and is price-competitive, the need for humans reduces down to areas where being biological is a bonus and the few tasks it hasn’t mastered.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-2\" id=\"fnref-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The effects of such unemployment could be very different depending on the country and political situation, but historically mass unemployment has often led to unrest. (The Arab Spring, for instance, is <a href=\"https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/youth-unemployment-and-arab-spring\">sometimes linked to youth unemployment rates</a>.) This makes any attempts at long-term influence that do not seem capable of adapting to this a much worse bet. Some sort of UBI-like redistribution scheme might make the transition easier, though even without a significant increase in income inequality some forms of political or social instability seem likely to me.</p>\n<p>From a safety perspective, normalized AI seems like it could go in several directions. On one hand, I can imagine it turning out something like nuclear power plants, where it is common knowledge that they require extensive safety measures. This could happen either after some large-scale but not global disaster (something like Chernobyl), or as a side-effect of giving the AI more control over essential resources (the electrical grid has, I should hope, better safety features than <a href=\"https://talktotransformer.com/\">a text generator</a>).</p>\n<p>The other, and to me more plausible scenario, is that the gradual adoption of AI makes everyone dismiss concerns as alarmist. This does not seem entirely unreasonable: the more evidence people have that AI becoming more capable doesn’t cause catastrophe, the less likely it is that the tipping point hasn’t been passed yet.</p>\n<h2>Historical reaction to dangerous technologies</h2>\n<p>A society increasingly dependent on AI is unlikely to be willing to halt or scale back AI use or research. Historically, I can think of some cases where we’ve voluntarily stopped the use of a technology, but they mostly seem connected to visible ongoing issues or did not result in giving up any significant advantage or opportunity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pesticides such as DDT caused the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT\">near-extinction of several bird species</a> (rather dramatically including the bald eagle).</li>\n<li>Chemical warfare is <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/02/chemical-weapons-dangerous-but-ineffective-in-combat/\">largely ineffective as a weapon against a prepared army</a>.</li>\n<li>Serious nuclear powers have never reduced their stock of nuclear weapons to the point of significantly reducing their ability to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent. Several countries (South Africa, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine) have <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/analysis/reports/nuclear-disarmament/\">gotten rid of their entire nuclear arsenals</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship\">Airships</a> are not competitive with advanced planes and were already declining in use before the Hidenberg disaster and other high-profile accidents.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_recall\">Drug recalls</a> are quite common and seem to respond easily to newly available evidence. It isn’t clear to me how many of them represent a significant change in the medical care available to consumers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can think of two cases in which there was a nontrivial fear of global catastrophic risk from a new invention (<a href=\"http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph241/chung1/\">nuclear weapons</a> igniting the atmosphere, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_high-energy_particle_collision_experiments\">CERN</a>). Arguably, <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/TheAsilomarConference.pdf\">concerns about recombinant DNA</a> also count. In both cases, the fears were taken seriously, found “<a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00329010.pdf\">no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started</a>” and “<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080907004852/http://doc.cern.ch/yellowrep/2003/2003-001/p1.pdf\">no basis for any conceivable threat</a>” respectively, and the invention moved on.</p>\n<p>This is a somewhat encouraging track record of not just dismissing such concerns as impossible, but it is not obvious to me whether the projects would have halted had the conclusions been less definitive. There’s also the rather unpleasant ambiguity of “likely” and some evidence of uncertainty in the nuclear project, expanded on <a href=\"http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2018/06/29/cleansing-thermonuclear-fire/\">here</a>. Of course, the atmosphere remained unignited, but since we unfortunately don’t have any reports from the universe where it did this doesn’t serve as particularly convincing evidence.</p>\n<p>Unlike the technologies listed two paragraphs up, CERN and the nuclear project seem like closer analogies to fast takeoff. There is a sudden danger with a clear threshold to step over (starting the particle collider, setting off the bomb), unlike the risks from climate change or other technological dangers which are often cumulative or hit-based. My guess, based on these very limited examples, is that if it is clear which project poses a fast-takeoff style risk it will be halted if the risk can be shown to have legible arguments behind it and is not easily shown to be highly unlikely. A slow-takeoff style risk, in which capabilities slowly mount, seems more likely to have researchers take each small step without carefully evaluating the risks every time.</p>\n<h2>Relevance of advanced precursor AIs to safety of superhuman AI</h2>\n<p>An argument in favor of slow takeoff scenarios being generally safer is that we will get to see and experiment with the precursor AIs before they become capable of causing x-risks.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-3\" id=\"fnref-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-3\">[3]</a></sup> My confidence in this depends on how likely it is that the dangers of a superhuman AI are analogous to the dangers of, say, an AI with 2X human capabilities. Traditional x-risk arguments around fast takeoff are in part predicated on the assumption that we cannot extrapolate all of the behavior and risks of a precursor AI to its superhuman descendant.</p>\n<p>Intuitively, the smaller the change in capabilities from an AI we know is safe to an untested variant, the less likely it is to suddenly be catastrophically dangerous. “Less likely”, however, does not mean it could not happen, and a series of small steps each with a small risk are not necessarily inherently less dangerous than traversing the same space in one giant leap. Tight feedback loops mean rapid material changes to the AI, and significant change to the precursor AI runs the risk of itself being dangerous, so there is a need for caution at every step, including possibly after it seems obvious to everyone that they’ve “won”.</p>\n<p>Despite this, I think that engineers who can move in small steps seem more likely to catch anything dangerous before it can turn into a catastrophe. At the very least, if something is not fundamentally different than what they’ve seen before, it would be easier to reason about it.</p>\n<h2>Reactions to precursor AIs</h2>\n<p>Even if the behavior of this precursor AI is predictive of the superhuman AI’s, our ability to use this testing ground depends on the reaction to the potential dangers of the precursor AI. Personally, I would expect a shift in mindset as AI becomes obviously more capable than humans in many domains. However, whether this shift in mindset is being more careful or instead abdicating decisions to the AI entirely seems unclear to me.</p>\n<p>The way I play chess with a much stronger opponent is very different from how I play with a weaker or equally matched one. With the stronger opponent I am far more likely to expect obvious-looking blunders to actually be a set-up, for instance, and spend more time trying to figure out what advantage they might gain from it. On the other hand, I never bother to check my calculator’s math by hand, because the odds that it’s wrong is far lower than the chance that I will mess up somewhere in my arithmetic. If someone came up with an AI-calculator that gave occasional subtly wrong answers, I certainly wouldn’t notice.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of the benefits of a slow takeoff also requires the ability to have institutions capable of noticing and preventing problems. In a fast takeoff scenario, it is much easier for a single, relatively small project to unilaterally take off. This is, essentially, a gamble on that particular team’s ability to prevent disaster.</p>\n<p>In a slow takeoff, I think it is more likely to be obvious that some project(s) seem to be trending in that direction, which increases the chance that if the project seems unsafe there will be time to impose external control on it. How much of an advantage this is depends on how much you trust whichever institutions will be needed to impose those controls.</p>\n<p>Some historical precedents for cooperation (or lack thereof) in controlling dangerous technologies and their side-effects include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nuclear proliferation treaties reduce the cost of a zero-sum arms race, but it isn’t clear to me if they significantly reduced the risk of nuclear war.</li>\n<li>Pollution regulations have had very mixed results, with some major successes (eg <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-019-01244-4\">acid rain</a>) but on the whole failing to avert massive global change.</li>\n<li>Somewhat closer to home, <a href=\"https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/2020/05/31/possible-takeaways-from-the-coronavirus-pandemic-for-slow-ai-takeoff/\">the response to Covid-19 hasn’t been particularly encouraging</a>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/TheAsilomarConference.pdf\">Asilomar Conference</a>, which seems to me the most successful of these, involved a relatively small scientific field voluntarily adhering to some limits on potentially dangerous research until more information could be gathered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Humanity’s track record in this respect seems to me to be decidedly mixed. It is unclear which way the response to AI will go, and it seems likely that it will be dependent on highly local factors.</p>\n<h2>What is the win condition?</h2>\n<p>A common assumption I’ve seen is that once there is aligned superhuman AI, the superhuman AI will prevent any unaligned AIs. This argument seems to hinge on the definition of “aligned”, which I’m not interested in arguing here. The relevant assumption is that an AI aligned in the sense of not causing catastrophe and contributing significantly to economic growth is not necessarily aligned in the sense that it will prevent unaligned AIs from occurring, whether its own “descendants” or out of some other project.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-4\" id=\"fnref-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p>I can perfectly well imagine an AI built to (for instance) respect human values like independence and scientific curiosity that, while benevolent in a very real sense, would not prevent the creation of unaligned AIs. A slow takeoff scenario seems to me more likely to contain multiple (many?) such AIs. In this scenario, any new project runs the risk of being the one that will mess something up and end up unaligned.</p>\n<p>An additional source of risk is modification of existing AIs rather than the creation of new ones. I would be surprised if we could resist the temptation to tinker with the existing benevolent AI’s goals, motives, and so on. If the AI were programmed to allow such a thing, it would be possible (though I suspect unlikely without gross incompetence, if we knew enough to create the original AI safely in the first place) to change a benevolent AI into an unaligned one.</p>\n<p>However, despite the existence of a benevolent AI not necessarily solving alignment forever, I expect us to be better off than in the case of unaligned AI emerging first. At the very least, the first AIs may be able to bargain with or defend us against the unaligned AI.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>My current impression is that, while slow takeoff seems on-the-whole safer (and likely implies a less thorny technical alignment problem), it should not be mostly neglected in favor of work on fast takeoff scenarios as implied e.g. <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/strategic-considerations-about-different-speeds-of-ai-takeoff/\">here</a>. Significant institutional and cultural competence (and/or luck) seems to be required to reap some of the benefits involved in slow-takeoff. However, there are many considerations that I haven’t addressed and more that I haven’t thought of. Most of the use I expect this to be is as a list of considerations, not as the lead-up to any kind of bottom line.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Buck Shlegeris, Daniel Filan, Richard Ngo, and Jack Ryan for thoughts on an earlier draft of this post.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p> I use this everywhere to mean AI far surpassing humans on all significant axes <a href=\"#fnref-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p> See e.g. Robin Hanson’s <a href=\"https://www.datascienceassn.org/sites/default/files/Economic%20Growth%20Given%20Machine%20Intelligence%202009%20Paper_0.pdf\">Economic Growth Given Machine Intelligence</a> <a href=\"#fnref-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-e3Dpdhj6EwfTGrfac-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p> An additional point is that the technical landscape at the start of takeoff is likely to be very different from the technical landscape near the end.

But AI Benefits work has some secondary goals, too. Some of these include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Equality</strong>: Benefits are distributed fairly and broadly.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-HQJT3MMzcxgjkrDrY-2\" id=\"fnref-HQJT3MMzcxgjkrDrY-2\">[2]</a></sup></li>\n<li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: AI Benefits respect and enhance end-beneficiaries’ autonomy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-HQJT3MMzcxgjkrDrY-3\" id=\"fnref-HQJT3MMzcxgjkrDrY-3\">[3]</a></sup></li>\n<li><strong>Democratization</strong>: Where possible, AI Benefits decisionmakers should create, consult with, or defer to democratic governance mechanisms.</li>\n<li><strong>Modesty</strong>: AI benefactors should be epistemically modest, meaning that they should be very careful when predicting how plans will change or interact with complex systems (e.g., the world economy).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These secondary goals are largely inherited from the <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/\">stated goals</a> of many individuals and organizations working to produce AI Benefits.</p>\n<p>Additionally, since the rate of improvements to wellbeing <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272708000248\">probably decreases with income</a>, the focus on maximizing wellbeing implies a focus on the <strong>distributional</strong> aspects of Benefits.</p>\n<h2>How AI Benefits differs from AI Alignment</h2>\n<p>Another important clarification is that AI Benefits differ from AI Alignment.</p>\n<p>Both alignment and beneficiality are ethically relevant concepts. Alignment can refer to several different things. Iason Gabriel of DeepMind <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09768.pdf\">provides</a> a useful taxonomy of existing conceptions of alignment. According to Gabriel, “AI alignment” can refer to alignment with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“<strong>Instructions</strong>: the agent does what I instruct it to do.”</li>\n<li>“<strong>Expressed intentions</strong>: the agent does what I intend it to do.”</li>\n<li>“<strong>Revealed preferences</strong>: the agent does what my behaviour reveals I prefer.”</li>\n<li>“<strong>Informed preferences or desires</strong>: the agent does what I would want it to do if I were rational and informed.”</li>\n<li>“<strong>Interest or well-being</strong>: the agent does what is in my interest, or what is best for me, objectively speaking.”</li>\n<li>“<strong>Values</strong>: the agent does what it morally ought to do . . . .”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A system can be aligned in most of these senses without being beneficial. Being beneficial is distinct from being aligned in senses 1–4 because those deal only with the desires of a particular human principal, which may or may not be beneficial. Being beneficial is distinct from conception 5 because beneficial AI aims to benefit many or all moral patients. Only AI that is aligned in the sixth sense would be beneficial by definition. Conversely, AI need not be well-aligned to be beneficial (though it might help).</p>\n<h2>How AI Benefits differs from AI for Good</h2>\n<p>A huge number of projects exist under the banner of “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.01818.pdf\">AI for Good</a>.” These projects are generally beneficial. However, AI Benefits work is different from simply finding and pursuing an AI for Good project.</p>\n<p>AI Benefits work aims at helping AI labs craft a <strong>long-term Benefits strategy</strong>. Unlike AI for Good, which is tied to specific techniques/capabilities (e.g., NLP) in certain domains (e.g., AI in education), AI Benefits is capability- and domain-agnostic.  Accordingly, the pace of AI capabilities development should not dramatically alter AI Benefits plans at the highest level (though it may of course change how they are implemented). Most of my work therefore focuses not on concrete beneficial AI applications themselves, but rather on the process of choosing between and improving possible beneficial applications. This meta-level focus is particularly useful at OpenAI, where the primary mission is to benefit the world by building AGI—a technology with difficult-to-foresee capabilities.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-HQJT3MMzcxgjkrDrY-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Multi-objective optimization is a very hard problem.

At around midnight, I&apos;m more prone to entering a state of relaxed focus, my mind making more lateral connections when reading or coming up with ideas that will likely have great positive impact on my personal life and work. </p><p>This happens after a hard workout too, or after having a stimulating discussion with a trusted, unbiased, and driven friend.</p><p>The conflict comes every day I wake up in the morning, and it&apos;s as if the open tabs of useful thoughts in my mind have closed, refreshed, but with no Command+Shift+Tab to reopen them exactly the way they were. I feel different in the morning; without the vision and subjective &quot;charged&quot; state I felt the night before, my mind doesn&apos;t give me a clear path to execute on the useful thoughts from yesterday. I don&apos;t have full access to that action-taking state.</p><p>It&apos;s logical that the subjective impact of thought and motivation changes from day-to-day. I wouldn&apos;t want to remember and feel the embarrassment from a social faux pas I made last week, every day. I just want to be able to capture and <em>feel</em> more of the good stuff from the day or week before. To feel the same emotional impact as when I first came across <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html\">particular</a> insights, so that I&apos;ll follow through on that with fervor and persistence.</p><p>Is there a way of hacking the brain to get the upside, without incurring the downside? </p><p>It&apos;s almost as if I existed in two states: one which thinks that it has done enough and deserves surface pleasures and rest - akrasia, and its opposite, non-akrasia - buzzing with quiet energy, working towards fulfillment, constantly alert to ideas that I can implement. </p><p>I know that being in a state of non-akrasia for sustained periods of time is possible. There are the Elon Musks of the world, those who work 80 hour work weeks towards their very specific cause of choice. I choose to believe that they were not so much genetically predisposed to do so, as they had something to protect as well as systems that ruthlessly reduced friction and distraction and ritualized the state of Flow. </p><p>The importance of <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\">colonizing mars</a> and <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\">reversing climate change</a> are likely kept as open tabs at the forefront of Musk&apos;s mind, thoughts with deep significance to him, that has guided every business or engineering decision he has made. </p><p>Given the limitations of working memory, how do I keep my useful thoughts as open tabs after a night&apos;s sleep, or at least be able to access the full &quot;History&quot; and restore them? I&apos;d imagine that if I was able to hack my brain to access the long-term-thinking, fulfilment-driven mode of non-akrasian thoughts, there will be exponential gains in the areas of my life that matter - no more instinctive checking, mindless scrolling of social media as distraction to fulfilling work, no more <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html\">superstimuli</a> foods to damage physical and mental health. </p><p>The cost of giving into temptation will be greater than the short-term benefits precisely because the open tabs show me that I&apos;m forgoing a much greater physique or career impact if I take the easy path.</p><p>More importantly, it will give me the confidence to follow through on all of those thoughts <em>in the exact way I intended to.</em> Being able to remember the full rationale and potential impact of these thoughts, I will be able to execute them without second-guessing myself. Finding a system or trigger to access these thoughts from my subconscious, in order to act with conviction and consistency with my long-term goals - that is my priority at this point of time.</p>",

Markman's <a href=\"http://www.derekmpowell.com/publication/lay-theories-cogsci\">\"Articulating Lay Theories Through Graphical Models: A Study of Beliefs Surrounding Vaccination Decisions\"</a> (a conference paper from <a href=\"https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/past-conferences/\">CogSci 2018</a>) represents an exciting advance in marketing research, showing how to use <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hzuSDMx7pd2uxFc5w/causal-diagrams-and-causal-models\">causal graphical models</a> to study why ordinary people have the beliefs they do, and how to intervene to make them be <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop\">less wrong</a>.</p>\n<p>The specific case our authors examine is that of childhood vaccination decisions: some parents don't give their babies the recommended vaccines, because they're afraid that vaccines cause autism. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_and_autism\">(Not true.)</a> This is pretty bad—not only are those unvaccinated kids more likely to get sick themselves, but declining vaccination rates undermine the population's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity\">herd immunity</a>, leading to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles_resurgence_in_the_United_States\">new outbreaks of highly-contagious diseases like the measles in regions where they were once eradicated</a>.</p>\n<p>What's wrong with these parents, huh?! But that doesn't have to just be a rhetorical question—Powell <em>et al.</em> show how we can use statistics to make the rhetorical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypophora\">hypophorical</a> and model <em>specifically</em> what's wrong with these people! Realistically, people aren't going to just have a raw, \"atomic\" dislike of vaccination <em>for no reason</em>: parents who refuse to vaccinate their children do so <em>because</em> they're (irrationally) afraid of giving their kids autism, and not afraid enough of letting their kids get infectious diseases. Nor are beliefs about vaccine effectiveness or side-effects <em>uncaused</em>, but instead depend on other beliefs.</p>\n<p>To unravel the structure of the web of beliefs, our authors got <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk\">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> participants to take surveys about vaccination-related beliefs, rating statements like \"Natural things are always better than synthetic alternatives\" or \"Parents should trust a doctor's advice even if it goes against their intuitions\" on a 7-point <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale\">Likert-like scale</a> from \"Strongly Agree\" to \"Strongly Disagree\".</p>\n<p>Throwing some <a href=\"https://www.bnlearn.com/\">off-the-shelf Bayes-net structure-learning software</a> at a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets\">training set</a> from the survey data, plus some ancillary assumptions (more-general \"theory\" beliefs like \"skepticism of medical authorities\" can cause more-specific \"claim\" beliefs like \"vaccines have harmful additives\", but not <em>vice versa</em>) produces a range of probabilistic models that can be depicted with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)\">graphs</a> where nodes representing the different beliefs are connected by arrows that show which beliefs \"cause\" others: an arrow from a <em>naturalism</em> node (in this context, denoting a worldview that prefers natural over synthetic things) to a <em>parental expertise</em> node means that people think parents know best <em>because</em> they think that nature is good, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>Learning <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jnjjzkH8Fdzg4D6EK/causality-a-chapter-by-chapter-review\">these kinds of models</a> is feasible because not all possible causal relationships are consistent with the data: if <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"B\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)\">statistically independent</a> of each other, but each dependent with <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"C\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;\">C</span></span></span></span></span></span> (and are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence\"><em>conditionally</em></a> dependent given the value of <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"C\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;\">C</span></span></span></span></span></span>), it's kind of hard to make sense of this except to posit that <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"B\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> are causes with the common effect <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"C\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;\">C</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p>Simpler models with fewer arrows might sacrifice a little bit of predictive accuracy for the benefit of being more intelligible to humans. Powell <em>et al.</em> ended up choosing a model that can predict responses from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)\">test set</a> at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient\"><em>r</em></a> = .825, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explained_variation\">explaining</a> 68.1% of the variance. Not bad?!—check out the full 14-node graph in Figure 2 on page 4 of <a href=\"https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2018/papers/0183/0183.pdf\">the PDF</a>.</p>\n<p>Causal graphs are useful as a guide for planning interventions: the graph encodes predictions about what would happen if you <em>changed</em> some of the variables. Our authors point out that since <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/10321\">previous work</a> showed that people's beliefs about vaccine dangers were difficult to influence, that suggests trying to intervene on the <em>other</em> parents of the intent-to-vaccinate node in the model: if the <em>hoi polloi</em> won't listen to you when you tell them the costs are minimal (vaccines are safe), instead tell them about the benefits (diseases are really bad and vaccines prevent disease).</p>\n<p>To make sure I really understand this, I want to adapt it into a simpler example with made-up numbers where I can do the arithmetic myself.

Abstractions frequently lose information &#x2013; the map does not capture every detail of the territory &#x2013; but are still generally useful. There is a sense in which some things cannot be abstracted without loss &#x2013; purely random data cannot be compressed by definition. There is another sense in which everything can be abstracted without loss, since even purely random data can be represented as the bit-string of itself. Pure randomness is in this sense somehow analogous to primeness &#x2013; there is only one satisfactory function, and it is the identity.</p><p>A separate idea, heading in the same direction: Data cannot, in itself, be inconsistent &#x2013; it can only be inconsistent <em>with</em> (or <em>within</em>) a given interpretation. Data alone is a string of bits with no interpretation whatsoever. The bitstring <code>01000001</code><br> is commonly interpreted both as the number 65, and as the character &#x2018;A&#x2019;, but that interpretation is not inherent to the bits; I could just as easily interpret it as the number 190, or as anything else. Sense data that I interpret as &#x201C;my total life so far, and then an apple falling upwards&#x201D;, is inconsistent with the laws of gravity. But the apple falling up is not inconsistent with my total life so far &#x2013; it&#x2019;s only inconsistent with gravity, as my interpretation of that data.</p><p>There is a sense in which some data cannot be consistently interpreted &#x2013; purely random data cannot be consistently mapped onto anything useful. There is another sense in which everything can be consistently interpreted, since even purely random data can be consistently mapped onto itself: the territory is the territory. Primeness as an analogue, again.</p><p>Abstraction and interpretation are both functions, mapping data onto other data. There is a sense in which they are the same function. There is another sense in which they are inverses. Both senses are true.</p><h5>ii. Errplanations</h5><p>Assuming no errors, then one piece of inconsistent data is enough to invalidate an entire interpretation. In practice, errors abound. We don&#x2019;t throw out all of physics every time a grad student does too much LSD.</p><p>Sometimes locating the error is easy. The apple falling up is a hallucination, because you did LSD.</p><p>Sometimes locating the error is harder. I feel repulsion at the naive utilitarian idea of killing one healthy patient to save five. Is that an error in my feelings, and I should bite the bullet? Is that a true inconsistency, and I should throw out utilitarianism? Or is that an error in the framing of the question, and No True Utilitarian endorses that action?</p><p>Locating the error is meaningless without explaining the error. You hallucinated the apple <em>because</em> LSD does things to your brain. Your model of the world now includes the error. The error is predictable.</p><p>Locating the error without explaining it is attributing the error to phlogiston, or epicycles. There may be an error in my feelings about the transplant case, but it is not yet predictable. I cannot distinguish between a missing errplanation and a true inconsistency.</p><h5>iii. Intuitions</h5><p>If ethical frameworks are abterpretations of our moral intuitions, then there is a sense in which no ethical framework can be generally true &#x2013; our moral intuitions do not always satisfy the axioms of preference, and cannot be consistently interpreted.</p><p>There is another sense in which there is a generally true ethical framework for any possible set of moral intuitions: there is always one satisfactory function, and it is the identity.</p><p>Primeness as an analogue.</p>",

A fun exploration, hopefully requiring only a medium level of technical familiarity.&nbsp;</i></p><h2>\"Not with a bang but a whimper\"</h2><p>It's 1930 and Kurt Gödel has just delivered a talk at Königsberg that carpet bombed <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/\">Hilbert's Program</a>.</p><p>...and no one noticed.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Godel's announcement, delivered during the summarizing session on the third and last day of the conference, was so understated and casual—so thoroughly undramatic—that it hardly qualified as an announcement, and no one present, with one exception, paid it any mind at all.<br><i>(</i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Incompleteness-Proof-Paradox-G%C3%B6del-Discoveries/dp/0393327604\"><i>source</i></a><i>)</i></p></blockquote><p>Well, almost no one. John von Neumann came up to Gödel after the talk, presumably to double check if he was going crazy or if Gödel had in fact just proved the existence of unprovable mathematical truths.</p><p>To understand what Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem says, it helps to see the meta-mathematical opinions of some of his peers. Wittgenstein opens his big famous book (not that I've actually read it) with:</p><blockquote><p>One could put the whole sense of the book perhaps in these words: What can be said at all, can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.</p></blockquote><p>This was a bold move in its own way. Contrast it with the following take, \"<strong>Everything</strong> can be spoken of, you just need to get smarter\" which is a deeply held ideal of Strawman STEM-Lord. Interestingly, both Wittgenstein and STEM-Lord agree on something, the exact something that Gödel smashed up in Königsberg. It's a very technical claim, best communicated with the following GIF:&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FalseFirsthandBlackrussianterrier-small.gif\"></figure><p>Witt and STEM-Lord disagree on what bleeds, but they are in fervent agreement that what bleeds can be killed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Unraveling Self-reference</h2><p>Take the classic liar's paradox:&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/230745a4e976583a0763db61b7c67dbf7ebfef6002121fcd.png\" srcset=\"https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/230745a4e976583a0763db61b7c67dbf7ebfef6002121fcd.png/w_145 145w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/230745a4e976583a0763db61b7c67dbf7ebfef6002121fcd.png/w_225 225w\"></figure><p>Oh shit, it's true and false, or neither, paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaradox! The Wittgenstein-esque approach might be to claim the liar's sentence doesn't <i>actually mean anything</i>. There is no reality to it to speak of, so you can't speak of it. You are just getting yourself tied into a linguistic knot, tricking yourself into thinking that just because you can write this sentence it must mean something. Natural language is not a formal system and this sentence need not have a coherent \"logical\" \"truth value\". BOOM, checkmate hypothetical opponent!&nbsp;</p><p>Hidden in the explanation \"Language isn't meant to avoid paradox and self-reference\" is the claim \"but formal math does avoid them!\" The first part is true, the second isn't.</p><p>What Gödel did was to make a logical sentence in the syntax of Peano Arithmetic which had the meaning, \"<i>This statement is unprovable in Peano Arithmetic</i>\". The two tricky components of this were finding a way to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering#:~:text=A%20G%C3%B6del%20numbering%20can%20be,represent%20a%20sequence%20of%20symbols.\">mathematically encode self-reference</a> (\"<i><strong>This</strong> statement\"</i>) and to talk <i>about</i> the system from <i>within</i> the system (\"<i>is <strong>unprovable</strong> in <strong>Peano Arithmetic</strong></i>\"). Both are quite a challenge. If you mess around with the liar's paradox, you'll quickly get into infinite recursion when trying to unravel the self-reference.</p><figure><img src=\"https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png\" srcset=\"https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_180 180w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_360 360w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_540 540w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_720 720w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_900 900w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_1080 1080w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_1260 1260w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_1440 1440w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_1620 1620w, https://71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/e86f5d7760b2a7ffac0f1aace4a8442af3a2f0ae04d3d419.png/w_1749 1749w\"><figcaption>(<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/enksodsoon/liars-paradox/9\">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;People have known forever that self-reference can often lead to paradox. This is part of why it's easy to have the intuition that full natural language expressions need not have truth values. So you make your mathematical systems more precise, and more limited than full natural language, then you can avoid self-reference, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the sneakiness of Gödel's theorem is that it shows how self-reference sneaks in whether you want it or not. Just like a computer system is not safe merely because you didn't explicitly create a \"HaCk ThIs SoFtWaRe\" button, a formal mathematical system is not free of self-reference merely because it's not explicitly part of the design. Self-reference isn't just a part of Peano Arithmetic, it's an inevitable feature of any system that has a basic amount of complexity.</p><p>If you're having trouble wrapping your head around how something as simple as arithmetic could embed self-reference and the concept of provability, it's helpful to look at programming languages. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck\">Brainfuck</a> can express anything that python can express, because both of them reach a \"sufficient level of complexity\" called being Turing Complete. Gwern maintains a <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Turing-complete\">fun list</a> of surprisingly Turing Complete systems (Pokemon Yellow and CSS are my favorite).&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of programming, this segues nicely into the next topic :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Turing and the Undecidable</h2><p>Before there were computers, there were algorithms. Unambiguous, mechanistic, finite procedures which when carried out consistently lead to certain results. Algorithms go <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication\">way back</a>, but our understanding of how to clearly demarcate them is recent. The phrase \"effective procedure\" has been used to tag the intuitive and fuzzy grouping that set apart the accessible from the inaccessible. There's clearly a difference, so what's the difference?</p><p>A storm of research in the first half of the 1900's built a conclusive answer. They created the abstract mathematical backing of not only computers, but of the idea of algorithms in general. Turing made Turing Machines, Church made lambda calculus, and Kleene made recursion theory. Though very different in taste and texture, all of these systems turned out to capture the exact same thing; you could use any one to fully represent and simulate the other. These systems form the bar that I mentioned early; Turing Completeness is being able to do everything a Turing Machine can do.</p><p>Just like how when a formal system get's complex enough, self-reference and incompleteness sneak in, when a computational system reaches Turing Completeness, a whole class of \"<i>uncomputable/undecidable\" </i>problems emerge. These are well formed and clearly defined computational problems which no algorithm can always answer correctly.</p><p>The most famous on is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macM_MtS_w4\">Halting Problem</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Given the source code to a program and its input, determine if the program will ever terminate, or if it will get caught in a loop forever.</p></blockquote><p>Turns out, there's no <strong>algorithm</strong> which answers this question <strong>correctly</strong> for <strong>all possible</strong> source code-input pairs. Each bold word is key to understanding what it means for a problem to be undecidable.</p><p>Sometimes people get confused by the halting problem. How can it be undecidable if I can clearly determine that:</p><pre><code>def code(x):\n\treturn x</code></pre><p>halts for all inputs. Have I defeated computers? The answer is in the difference between a <i>specific instance of a problem</i>, and the <i>problem class as a whole</i>. \"Solve the problem with this specific input\" is <i><strong>incredibly different</strong></i> from \"Solve the problem in full generality for all possible inputs.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Compare this with Gödel's theorems. It's not that <i>all</i> statements are unprovable. It's that there exists a statement that's meaningful and can't be proven. This is not a surface level similarity. Secretly, the halting problem and Gödel's incompleteness theorems are the same thing. It's outside the already wildly expanding scope of this post, but the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence\">Curry-Howard Isomorphism</a> is a crazy bridge that connects mathematical proofs to the execution of programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Suffice to say, incompleteness and undecidability are two sides of the same coin, and I will casually flip flop between them as much as I please. They are the formal refutation to \"If it bleeds, we can kill it\". They are pieces of mathematics that have been thoroughly and rigorously formalized, and yet provably defy being resolved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>But Wait, there's more!</h2><p>Turing and Gödel show us that there are monsters out there that bleed and can't be killed, a shocking fact to certain <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/\">philosophical frames</a>. But mayhaps there's only a few of such creatures. Unfortunately, <i>most</i> things that bleed can't be killed.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem\">Rice's theorem</a> proves that almost all properties that you might want to prove about program behavior are undecidable. Not only are there undecidable problems, but there's an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_degree\">infinite hierarchy of increasingly difficult computational problems </a>which can't even be solved if you had a magical oracle to solve problems one rung down.&nbsp;</p><p>These sorts of results are not contained just to decidability. With regards to Kolmogorov complexity most <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity#Compression\">strings are in-compressible</a>. Most <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_complexity\">boolean circuits</a> have exponential complexity. The <a href=\"https://mlu.red/muse/52449366310.html\">No-Free-Lunch theorem</a> tells us there is no universal learning algorithm that outperforms all others on all learning tasks. Weierstrass summoned <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/11/light/maths-beautiful-monsters\">monsters</a> that still roam.</p><p>Result after result in this vein can leave one feeling... small.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://lacedricw.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/storm-boat.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Gödel's Impact</h1><p>It took some time before Gödel's proof really took hold in the mathematical world. Gödel himself was the sort of guy that the words reticent and reclusive were created to describe, and didn't push for recognition. Luckily, John von Neumann took it upon himself to spread the good word.&nbsp;</p><p>Within a few decades, after fully internalizing that their quest of submitting all of math to being provable was doomed, most mathematicians had moved onto other fields. Math departments began to thin. In 1963 UC Berkley was the last University in the world to offer a mathematics major, which itself was discontinued in 19—</p><p>Ha, just kidding, math go brrrrrrrrrr</p><p>Despite destroying the contemporary understanding of what math <i>is</i>, we still sent people to space, created the internet, and made things like <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3\">GPT-3</a>. Why does the fact that most problems in mathematics are unsolvable not seem to matter in the slightest? How is that not a huge roadblock to the development of human knowledge?&nbsp;</p><p>Hilbert's Program was part of a large scale drive to create a \"secure and unassailable\" foundation for mathematics. This intent was in the water-supply ever since Euclid's <i>The Elements</i>, the poster-boy for mathematical rigor, had been tarnished with the discovery of non-euclidean geometry. Mathematicians felt burned by this betrayal, and so began the purging of intuition from math in favor of formal rigor.</p><p>But... why the intense fuss if it turns out \"a secure and unassailable foundation\" is not needed to actually do math? It feels like Gödel pulled a magic trick, yanking the foundations of math out from under itself, yet failing to disturb anything. It makes one a bit suspicious about what a foundation is supposed to be doing if it's not supporting the house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How to \"solve\" the halting problem</h2><p>In tHe ReAl WoRlD few people care about decidability. People \"solve\" the halting problem all day everyday; wait a few seconds, if the program hasn't returned conclude it never will. Even your grandma \"solves\" the halting problem when she eventually decides to reboot the computer after staring at a frozen internet explorer for a few minutes.</p><p>The boundaries that engineers <strong>do</strong> care about are complexity bounds. \"This problem is not undecidable!\" is still useless for application if it turns out the most efficient algorithm won't finish before the heat death of the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>So maybe that's it. Fear not the specter of incompleteness, instead cower at the sight of the complex. Wail and gnash your teeth upon finding out the problem you want to solve is NP-Hard.</p><p>Once upon a time, I was sitting in office hours asking a professor about how <a href=\"https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny\">code verification worked</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Me: How this work?</p><p>Prof: We've worked out how to represent the code as an SMT and just pass it all to an SMT solver</p><p>Me: How do SMT solvers work?</p><p>Prof: Often they reduce it to a boolean satisfaction problem and then just use a garden variety SAT solver.</p><p>Me: ......wut? SAT is supposed to be NP-hard?!</p><p>Prof: <strong>laughs </strong>oh yeah, it is. But in practice we can handle all sorts of NP-hard problems totally fine.</p><p>Me: <i>mind melts out of ears</i></p></blockquote><p>This <strong>completely blew my mind</strong>. Suddenly I lived in a new magical world.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/basicproblems002/files/2015/03/BioShock_No_gods_or_kings.jpg\"></figure><p>How exactly does this work? <a href=\"https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/1477/dealing-with-intractability-np-complete-problems\">Stackexchange</a> has a nice answer. I want to home in on <strong>restricting the problem</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JcpwEKbmNHdwhpq5n/problem-relaxation-as-a-tactic\">Problem relaxation</a> is a tried and true tactic for solving all kinds of challenges. If X is too hard, solve an easier problem. Sometimes this helps you solve the original problem, but sometimes you realize you <i>didn't actually need</i> to solve the harder problem, and your algorithm for the relaxed problem works just fine on all the problem instances you care about.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a sneaky difficulty to knowing what you actually want. Maybe you're a food delivery company and you think you need to solve the traveling salesman problem (NP-Hard), but upon further thought you realize this is Manhattan and everything is on a grid! Now you only care about a <i>specific subset</i> of traveling salesman problems, one's that have a very specific structure. Rejoice! This subset is actually tractable! It may even be efficient!</p><p>But for a lot of real world scenarios, there is no formalized sub problem. You get that you're not dealing with the fully general version, but you don't understand your use cases enough to formalize them as a subset. Clearly, there is rich structure to the irl instances of the problems that you're solving, otherwise you wouldn't be making any progress. But until you can figure out exactly what that structure is and re-formalize a relaxation, you're in the position of trying to solve a formally \"intractable\" by trying something that very smart people think is a decent idea, and having it work out most of the time.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not to say that things are easy. There are plenty of problems that we can't currently efficiently solve or prove, ones which would be a HUGE boon to human capabilities if resolved. And <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/10481/when-is-a-classification-problem-wild\">Harvey Friedman</a> seems to have devoted his whole life to showing how <a href=\"https://u.osu.edu/friedman.8/foundational-adventures/boolean-relation-theory-book/\">incompleteness sneaks into otherwise natural and normal mathematical domains</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Vast Mathematical Wilderness</h2><p>I've been sharing a lot of technical details, but what I really hope is to communicate an aesthetic sense. From <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CvKnhXTu9BPcdKE4W/an-untrollable-mathematician-illustrated\">Ambram Demski</a> in a post on something else:</p><blockquote><p>To explain Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, Douglas Hofstadter likened truth and falsehood to white and black trees which never touch, but which interlace so finely that you can't possible draw a border between them.

We live in a strange and structured bubble near the trunk of Gödel's tree. Remember earlier how I was describing that <i>most</i> formalizable problems are undecidable, and <i>most</i> decidable problems are mired in intractable complexity? And despite that our algorithms work on a freaky amount of the problems we actually interact with? It's because those pessimistic results aren't facts about our little bubble; they're facts about the jagged wastelands that lay beyond our bubble, out in the fractal folds of the wild.</p><p>This is both surprising and expected. Borges' <a href=\"https://libraryofbabel.info/\">Library of Babble</a> is a sprawling haunt that contains every work of literature ever produced, and it's still endless enough to be mostly nonsensical gibberish.

No, to see where U&amp;I comes into play, we need to go deeper.</p><p>Imagine amending the sumo bot rules: before each bout, both sumo bots were given the other's source code. What changes? This level of apparent determinancy might tempt you into thinking that there could be some way to always win; after all it's just totally predictable code, right? Nope, still undecidable.</p><p>There are other games that don't have the multi-polar quality of sumo bots and rock paper scissors, with every move having a perfect counter. Take computer security. This field feels much more like a rising tide than balanced wheel. Eventually a new offense will be made that renders a lot of previous defense obsolete. Then a new defense will be made that renders a lot of old offense obsolete. Heuristic piles on top of heuristic and the tides rise.</p><p>Will this be a never ending game off spy vs spy as well? Some aspects of security, like cryptography, seem to be clear victory for defense. On the offense, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code\">polymorphic viruses exist that alter their own code while retaining logical identity to avoid detection</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110604155118/http://www.research.ibm.com/antivirus/SciPapers/VB2000DC.htm\">virus detection in full generality is impossible</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/jrnl/2002-ieeetit-npvirus/html/npvirus.html\">reliable detection of bounded length viruses is NP-complete</a>.</p><p>Recall, with the bulk of engineering we don't fret when our problem is undecidable or NP-hard. We simply do our best and a silly amount of the time we are rewarded. We approximate, apply heuristics, and do what feels right. But that's what we see happen when we tackle stationary or moving targets. Computer security is engineering that's trying to hit a moving target that fights back.</p><p>Virus detection being undecidable is <i>exactly what ensure</i> that detection and evasion will be a never ending progressions of increasingly sophisticated heuristics. The fractal tendrils of incompleteness are what provide the inexhaustible landscape for intelligent systems battle.</p><p>When it comes down to it, all games are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_game_theory\">open games</a>. The rules, boundaries, and scoring all shift with time and intent. Games with rigid boundaries are only possible through the mutual agreement of all players. Soccer only works because everyone has agreed to abide by the rules. The more adversarial the context, the more the boundaries dissolve. Gödel's legacy is to show us that there is no limit to how far the boundaries can dissolve. He guarantees the inexhaustibly of the dark wilderness, a wilderness that becomes the new playing field for life as adversarial actors butt heads.</p><p>In this world, there are no fully general answers.

I’m keeping it posted as-is for historical interest only.</em></p>\n<h1>Background / context</h1>\n<p>I wrote about cortical uniformity last year in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NkSpukDkm9pjRdMdB/human-instincts-symbol-grounding-and-the-blank-slate\">Human Instincts, Symbol Grounding, and the Blank Slate Neocortex</a>. (Other lesswrong discussion includes <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WFopenhCXyHX3ukw3/how-uniform-is-the-neocortex\">Alex Zhu recently</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Yc7Pp7szcjPgPsjf/the-brain-as-a-universal-learning-machine\">Jacob Cannell in 2015</a>.) Here was my description (lightly edited, and omitting several footnotes that were in the original):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Instead of saying that the human brain has a vision processing algorithm, motor control algorithm, language algorithm, planning algorithm, and so on, in \"Common Cortical Algorithm\" (CCA) theory we say that (to a first approximation) we have a massive amount of \"general-purpose neocortical tissue\", and if you dump visual information into that tissue, it does visual processing, and if you connect that tissue to motor control pathways, it does motor control, etc.</p>\n<p>CCA theory, as I'm using the term, is a simplified model. There are almost definitely a couple caveats to it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>There are sorta \"hyperparameters\" on the generic learning algorithm which seem to be set differently in different parts of the neocortex. For example, some areas of the cortex have higher or lower density of particular neuron types. There are other examples too. I don't think this significantly undermines the usefulness or correctness of CCA theory, as long as these changes <em>really are</em> akin to hyperparameters, as opposed to specifying fundamentally different algorithms. So my reading of the evidence is that if you put, say, motor nerves coming out of visual cortex tissue, the tissue could do motor control, but it wouldn't do it quite as well as the motor cortex does.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is almost definitely a gross wiring diagram hardcoded in the genome—i.e., set of connections between different neocortical regions and each other, and other parts of the brain. These connections later get refined and edited during learning. Again, we can ask how much the existence of this innate gross wiring diagram undermines CCA theory. How complicated is the wiring diagram? Is it millions of connections among thousands of tiny regions, or just tens of connections among a few regions? Would the brain work at all if you started with a random wiring diagram? I don't know for sure, but for various reasons, my current belief is that this initial gross wiring diagram is not carrying much of the weight of human intelligence, and thus that this point is not a significant problem for the usefulness of CCA theory. (This is a loose statement; of course it depends on what questions you're asking.) I think of it more like: if it's biologically important to learn a concept space that's built out of associations between information sources X, Y, and Z, well, you just dump those three information streams into the same part of the cortex, and then the CCA will take it from there, and it will reliably build this concept space. So once you have the CCA nailed down, it kinda feels to me like you're <em>most</em> of the way there....</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Marcus et al.'s challenge</h1>\n<p>Now, when I was researching that post last year, I had read one book chapter opposed to cortical uniformity and another book chapter in favor of cortical uniformity, which were a good start, but I've been keeping my eye out for more on the topic. And I just found one! In 2014 Gary Marcus, Adam Marblestone, and Thomas Dean wrote a little commentary in Science Magazine called <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/amarbles/www/docs/MarcusMarblestoneDean2014_Science.pdf\">The Atoms of Neural Computation</a>, with a case against cortical uniformity.</p>\n<p>Out of the various things they wrote, one stands out as the most substantive and serious criticism: They <strong>throw down a gauntlet in their <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8826\">FAQ</a>, with a table of 10 fundamentally different calculations that they think the neocortex does. Can one common cortical algorithm really subsume or replace all those different things?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I accept the challenge!!</p>\n<p>But first, I better say something about what there common cortical algorithm is and does, with the caveat that nobody knows all the details, and certainly not me. (The following paragraph is mostly influenced by reading a bunch of stuff by Dileep George &amp; Jeff Hawkins, along with miscellaneous other books and papers that I've happened across in my totally random and incomplete neuroscience and AI self-education.)</p>\n<p>The common cortical algorithm (according to me, and leaving out lots of aspects that aren't essential for this post) is an algorithm that builds a bunch of generative models, each of which consists of predictions that other generative models are on or off, and/or predictions that input channels (coming from outside the neocortex—vision, hunger, etc.) are on or off. (\"It's symbols all the way down.\") All the predictions are attached to confidence values, and both the predictions and confidence values are, in general, functions of time (or of other parameters ... again, I'm glossing over details here). The generative models are compositional, because if two of them make disjoint and/or consistent predictions, you can create a new model that simply predicts that both of those two component models are active simultaneously. For example, we can snap together a \"purple\" generative model and a \"jar\" generative model to get a \"purple jar\" generative model. Anyway, we explore the space of generative models, performing a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cfvBm2kBtFTgxBB7s/predictive-coding-rl-sl-bayes-mpc\">search with a figure-of-merit that kinda mixes self-supervised learning, model predictive control, and Bayesian(ish) priors</a>. Among other things, this search process involves something at least vaguely analogous to message-passing in a probabilistic graphical model.</p>\n<p>OK, now let's dive into the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8826\">Marcus et al. FAQ list</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 1: \"Rapid perceptual classification\", potentially involving \"Receptive fields, pooling and local contrast normalization\" in the \"Visual system\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think that \"rapid perceptual classification\" naturally comes out of the cortical algorithm, not only in the visual system but also everywhere else.</p>\n<p>In terms of \"rapid\", it's worth noting that (1) many of the \"rapid\" responses that humans do are not done by the neocortex, (2) The cortical message-passing algorithm supposedly involves both faster, less-accurate neural pathways (which prime the most promising generative models), as well as slower, more-accurate pathways (which, for example, properly do the \"explaining away\" calculation).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 2: \"Complex spatiotemporal pattern recognition\", potentially involving \"Bayesian belief propagation\" in \"Sensory hierarchies\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The message-passing algorithm I mentioned above is either Bayesian belief propagation or something approximating it. <em>Contra</em> Marcus et al., Bayesian belief propagation is not just for spatiotemporal pattern recognition in the traditional sense; for example, to figure out what we're looking at, the Bayesian analysis incorporates not only the spatiotemporal pattern of visual input data, but also semantic priors from our other senses and world-model. Thus if we see a word with a smudged letter in the middle, we \"see\" the smudge as the correct letter, even when the same smudge by itself would be ambiguous.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 3: \"Learning efficient coding of inputs\", potentially involving \"Sparse coding\" in \"Sensory and other systems\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think that not just sensory inputs but <em>every</em> feedforward connection in the neocortex (most of which are neocortex-to-neocortex) has to be re-encoded into the data format that the neocortex knows what to do with, i.e. different possible forward inputs correspond to stimulation of different sparse subsets out of a pool of receiving neurons, wherein the sparsity is relatively uniform, where all the receiving neurons in the pool are stimulated a similar fraction of the time (for efficient use of computational resources), where the different subsets have low overlap, etc. So, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2017.00111/full\">Jeff Hawkins has a nice algorithm for this re-encoding process</a> and again, I would put this (or something like it) as an interfacing ingredient on every feedforward connection in the neocortex.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 4: \"Working memory\", potentially involving \"Continuous or discrete attractor states in networks\" in \"Prefrontal cortex\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me, the obvious explanation is that active generative models fade away gradually when they stop being used, rather than turning off abruptly. Maybe that's wrong, or there's more to it than that; I haven't really looked into it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 5: \"Decision making\", potentially involving \"Reinforcement learning of action-selection policies in PFC/BG system\" and \"winner-take-all networks\" in \"prefrontal cortex\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I didn't talk about neural implementations in my <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cfvBm2kBtFTgxBB7s/predictive-coding-rl-sl-bayes-mpc\">post on how generative models are selected</a>, but I think reinforcement learning (process (e) in that post) is implemented in the basal ganglia. As far as I understand, the basal ganglia just kinda listens broadly across the whole frontal lobe of the neocortex (the home of planning and motor control), and memorizes associations between arbitrary neocortical patterns and associated rewards, and then it can give a confidence-boost to whatever active neocortical pattern is anticipated to give the highest reward.</p>\n<p>Winner-take-all is a combination of that basal ganglia mechanism, and the fact that generative models suppress each other when they make contradictory predictions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 6: \"Routing of information flow\", potentially involving \"Context-dependent tuning of activity in recurrent network dynamics, shifter circuits, oscillatory coupling, modulating excitation / inhibition balance during signal propagation\", \"common across many cortical areas\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Routing of information flow is a core part of the algorithm: whatever generative models are active, they know where to send their predictions (their message-passing massages).</p>\n<p>I think it's more complicated than that in practice thanks to a biological limitation: I think the parts of the brain that work together need to be time-synchronized for some of the algorithms to work properly, but time-synchronization is impossible across the whole brain at once because the signals are so slow. So there might be some complicated neural machinery to dynamically synchronize different subregions of the cortex when appropriate for the current information-routing needs. I'm not sure. But anyway, that's really an implementation detail, from a high-level-algorithm perspective.</p>\n<p>As usual, it's possible that there's more to \"routing of information flow\" that I don't know about.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 7: \"Gain control\", potentially involving \"Divisive normalization\", \"common across many cortical areas\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I assume that divisive normalization is part of the common cortical algorithm; I hear it's been observed all over the neocortex and even hippocampus, although I haven't really looked into it. Maybe it's even implicit in that Jeff Hawkins feedforward-connection-interface algorithm I mentioned above, but I haven't checked.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 8: \"Sequencing of events over time\", potentially involving \"Feed-forward cascades\" in \"language and motor areas\" and \"serial working memory\" in \"prefrontal cortex\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think that every part of the cortex can learn sequences; as I mentioned, that's part of the data structure for each of the countless generative models built by the cortical algorithm.</p>\n<p>Despite what Marcus implies, I think the time dimension is very important even for vision, despite the impression we might get from ImageNet-solving CNNs. There are a couple reasons to think that, but maybe the simplest is the fact that humans can learn the \"appearance\" of an inherently dynamic thing (e.g. a splash) just as easily as we can learn the appearance of a static image. I don't think it's a separate mechanism.</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, I started to do a deep dive into vision, to see whether it <em>really</em> needs any specific processing different than the common cortical algorithm as I understand it. In particular, the <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/eaag2612/tab-figures-data\">Dileep George neocortex-inspired vision model</a> has a lot of vision-specific stuff, but (1) some of it is stuff that <em>could</em> have been learned from scratch, but they put it in manually for their convenience (this claim is in the paper, actually), and (2) some of it is stuff that fits into the category I'm calling \"innate gross wiring diagram\" in that block-quote at the top, and (3) some of it is just them doing a couple things a little bit different from how the brain does it, I think. So I wound up feeling like everything seems to fit together pretty well within the CCA framework, but I dunno, I'm still hazy on a number of details, and it's easy to go wrong speculating about complicated algorithms that I'm not actually coding up and testing.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 9: \"Representation and transformation of variables\", potentially involving \"population coding\" or a variant in \"motor cortex and higher cortical areas\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Population coding fits right in as a core part of the common cortical algorithm as I understand it, and as such, I think it is used throughout the cortex.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marcus et al.'s computation 10: \"Variable binding\", potentially involving \"Indirection\" in \"PFC / BG loops\" or \"Dynamically partitionable autoassociative networks\" or \"Holographic reduced representations\" in \"higher cortical areas\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They clarify later that by \"variable binding\" they mean \"the transitory or permanent tying together of two bits of information: a variable (such as an X or Y in algebra, or a placeholder like subject or verb in a sentence) and an arbitrary instantiation of that variable (say, a single number, symbol, vector, or word).\"</p>\n<p>I say, no problem! Let's go with a language example.</p>\n<p>I'm not a linguist (as will be obvious), but let's take the sentence \"You jump\". There is a \"you\" generative model which (among other things) makes a strong prediction that the \"noun\" generative model is also active. There is a \"jump\" generative model which (among other things) makes a strong prediction that the \"verb\" generative model is also active. Yet another generative model predicts that there will be a sentence in which a noun will be followed by a verb, with the noun being the subject. So you can snap all of these ingredients together into a larger generative model, \"You jump\". There you have it!</p>\n<p>Again, I haven't thought about it in any depth. At the very least, there are about a zillion other generative models involved in this process that I'm leaving out. But the question is, are there aspects of language that can't be learned by this kind of algorithm?</p>\n<p>Well, some weak, indirect evidence that this kind of algorithm <em>can</em> learn language is the startup <a href=\"https://gamalon.com/\">Gamalon</a>, which tries to do natural language processing using probabilistic programming with some kind of compositional generative model, and it works great. (Or so they say!) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yeDB2SQxCEs\">Here's their CEO Ben Vigoda describing the technology on youtube</a>, and don't miss their fun probabilistic-programming drawing demo starting at 29:00. It's weak evidence because I very much doubt that Gamelon uses exactly the same data structures and search algorithms as the neocortex, only vaguely similar, I think. (But I feel strongly that it's <em>way</em> more similar to the neocortex than a Transformer or RNN is, at least in the ways that matter.)</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>So, having read the Marcus et al. paper and a few of its references, it really didn't move me at all away from my previous opinion: I still think the Common Cortical Algorithm / Cortical Uniformity hypothesis is basically right, modulo the caveats I mentioned at the top. (That said, I wasn't 100% confident about that hypothesis before, and I'm still not.) If anyone finds the Marcus et al. paper more convincing than I did, I'd love to talk about it!</p>\n",

    "htmlBody": "<blockquote>“I just solved the trolley problem.... See, the trolley problem forces you to choose between two versions of letting other people die, but the actual solution is very simple. You sacrifice yourself.”</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">- The Good Place</p>\n\n<h2>High school: Naive morality</h2>\n\n<p>When I was a teenager, I had a very simple, naive view of morality. I thought that the <i>right</i> thing to do was to make others happy. I also had a naive view of how this was accomplished - I spent my time digging through trash cans to sort out the recyclables, picking up litter on the streets, reading the Communist Manifesto, going to protests, you know, high school kind of stuff. I also poured my heart into my dance group which was almost entirely comprised of disadvantaged students - mainly poor, developmentally disabled, or severely depressed, though we had all sorts. They were good people, for the most part, and I liked many of them simply as friends, but I probably also had some sort of intelligentsia savior complex going on with the amount of effort I put into that group.</p>\n\n<p>The moment of reckoning for my naive morality came when I started dating a depressed, traumatized, and unbelievably pedantic boy with a superiority complex even bigger than his voice was loud. I didn’t like him. I think there was a time when I thought I loved him, but I always knew I didn’t like him. He was deeply unkind, and it was like there was nothing real inside of him. But my naive morality told me that dating him was the <i>right</i> thing to do, because he liked me, and because maybe if I gave enough of myself I could fix him, and then he would be kind to others like he was to me. Needless to say this did not work. I am much worse off for the choices I made at that time, with one effect being that I have trouble distinguishing between giving too much of myself and just giving basic human decency.</p>\n\n<p>And even if it were true that pouring all of my love and goodness out for a broken person could make them whole again, what good would it be? There are millions of sad people in the world, and with that method I would only be able to save a few at most (or in reality, one, because of how badly pouring kindness into a black hole burns you out). If you really want to make people’s lives better, that is, if you really care about human flourishing, you can’t give your whole self to save one person. You only have one self to give.</p>\n\n<h2>Effective altruism, my early days</h2>\n\n<p>When I first moved to the Bay, right after college, I lived with five other people in what could perhaps practically but certainly not legally be called a four-bedroom apartment. Four of the others were my age, and three of us (including me) were vegan. The previous tenants had left behind a large box of oatmeal and a gallon of cinnamon, so that was most of what I ate, though I sometimes bought a jar of peanut butter to spice things up or mooched food off of our one adult housemate. I was pretty young and pretty new to EA and I didn’t think it was morally permissible to spend money, and many of my housemates seemed to think likewise. Crazy-burnout-guy work was basically the only thing we did - variously for CEA, CHAI, GiveWell, LessWrong, and an EA startup. My roommate would be gone when I woke up and not back from work yet when I fell asleep, and there was work happening at basically all hours. One time my roommate and I asked Habryka if he wanted to read <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood\">Luke’s report on consciousness</a> with us on Friday night and he told us he would be busy; when we asked with what he said he’d be working.</p>\n\n<p>One day I met some Australian guys who had been there in the <i>really</i> early days of EA, who told us about eating out of the garbage (really!) and sleeping seven to a hallway or something ridiculous like that, so that they could donate fully 100% of their earnings to global poverty. And then I felt bad about myself, because even though I was vegan, living in a tenement, half-starving myself, and working for an EA org, I <i>could</i> have been doing more.</p>\n\n<p>It was a long and complex process to get from there to where I am now, but suffice it to say I now realize that being miserable and half-starving is not an ideal way to set oneself up for any kind of productive work, world-saving or otherwise.</p> \n\n<h2>You can’t make a policy out of self-sacrifice</h2>\n\n<p>I want to circle back to the quote at the beginning of this post. (Don’t worry, there won’t be any spoilers for The Good Place). It’s supposed to be a touching moment, and in some ways it is, but it’s also frustrating. Whether or not self-sacrifice was correct in that situation misses the point; the problem is that <i>self-sacrifice cannot be the answer to the trolley problem.</i></p>\n\n<p>Let’s say, for simplicity’s sake, that me jumping in front of the trolley will stop it. So I do that, and boom, six lives saved. But if the trolley problem is a metaphor for any real-world problem, there are millions of trolleys hurtling down millions of tracks, and whether you jump in front of one of those trolleys yourself or not, millions of people are still going to die. You still need to come up with a policy-level answer for the problem, and the fact remains that the policy that will result in the fewest deaths is switching tracks to kill one person instead of five. You can’t jump in front of a million trolleys.</p>\n\n<p>There may be times when self-sacrifice is the best of several bad options. Like, if you’re in a crashing airplane with Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott Alexander (or substitute your morally important figures of choice) and there are only two parachutes, then sure, there’s probably a good argument to be made for letting them have the parachutes. But the point I want to make is, <b>you can’t make a policy out of self-sacrifice</b>. Because there’s only one of you, and there’s only so much of you that can be given, and it’s not nearly commensurate with the amount of ill in the world. </p>\n\n<h2>Clarification</h2>\n\n<p>I am not attempting to argue that, in doing your best to do the right thing, you will never have to make decisions that are painful for you. I know many a person working on AI safety who, if the world were different, would have loved nothing more than to be a physicist. I’m glad for my work in the Bay, but I also regret not living nearer to my parents as they grow older. We all make sacrifices at the altar of opportunity cost, but that’s true for everyone, whether they’re trying to do the right thing or not.</p>\n\n<p>The key thing is that those AI safety researchers are not making themselves miserable with their choices, and neither am I. We enjoy our work and our lives, even if there are other things we might have enjoyed that we’ve had to give up for various reasons. Choosing the path of least regret doesn’t mean you’ll have no regrets on the path you go down.</p>\n\n<p>The difference, as I see it, is that the “self-sacrifices” I talked about earlier in the post made my life <i>strictly</i> worse. I would have been strictly better off if I hadn’t poured kindness into someone I hated, or if I hadn’t lived in a dark converted cafe with a nightmare shower and tried to subsist off of stale oatmeal with no salt. </p>\n\n<p>You’ll most likely have to make sacrifices if you’re aiming at anything worthwhile, but be careful not to follow policies that deplete the core of yourself. You won’t be very good at achieving your goals if you’re burnt out, traumatized, or dead. Self-sacrifice is generally thought of as virtuous, in the colloquial sense of the word, but moralities that advocate it are unlikely to lead you where you want to go.</p>\n\n<p>Self-sacrifice is a scarce resource.</p>",

Philosophers want to receive and know how to handle reasoned arguments; politicians want to receive and know how to handle votes. Present a politician with a philosophical argument, and they might think it&apos;s very nice, but they won&apos;t consider it as relevant to their duties as a politican as polling data. &quot;The voters aren&apos;t choosing me to think,&quot; they might say; &quot;they&apos;re choosing me to represent their will.&quot;</p><p>This isn&apos;t to single out politicians as &apos;non-philosophers&apos;; businesspeople have their own interface, where they want to receive and know how to handle money, and athletes have their own interface, and musicians, and so on and so on. This is part of the society-wide specialization of labor, and is overall a good thing.</p><p>Callard argues that philosophers shouldn&apos;t sign petitions, <em>as philosophers</em>--in my framing, that it corrupts the interface of &apos;philosophers&apos; for them to both emit reasoned arguments and petitions, which are little more than counts of bodies and clout. If they want to sign petitions, or vote, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein#Military_service\">fight in wars</a> on their own time, that&apos;s fine; but those political behaviors are not the business of philosophy, and they should do them as people instead of as philosophers.</p><p>Overall, this argument seems right to me, except I think it also makes sense for individuals, even those personally committed to public reason, to honor the other disciplines by engaging with them the way they want to be engaged with, so long as it is consistent with one&apos;s conscience. If you want, say, a politician to take seriously <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1407506?seq=1\">Aliens and Citizens</a>, you need to assemble a voting bloc that is in favor of open borders, rather than simply sending them copies of the paper. If you want a businessperson to produce anti-malaria nets for people in need, the thing to do is assemble a pile of money to trade them for the nets.</p><p>And so the question becomes: when an editor at the New York Times makes a decision that seems wrong-headed and cruel, what interface do they present to the world, and how should we make use of it?</p><p>In this particular case, the editor in question is not a philosopher, and to the best of my knowledge hasn&apos;t elected the interface of philosophy. [Scott was simply informed of the editor&apos;s decision, not her reasons for the decision, which we can only imagine. If it hinges on a reasoned defense of pseudonyms, I am happy to provide one; it if hinges on proof that pseudonyms are important to our culture, the petition seems like the best way to provide that.]</p><p>Callard, in the replies, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/AgnesCallard/status/1276203940825219073\">tweets</a>:</p><blockquote>Good thought. I think if there were some way for the document (which wouldn&apos;t then be a petition) to convey: &quot;this is what we think but if, after careful deliberation, you sill believe that you are doing the right thing, we will support your decision&quot;-I might feel differently. </blockquote><p>I have employed this strategy in the past, when I felt someone else owned a decision or I overall trusted their judgment. But it feels like this is a tool with a narrow use, rather than one that applies broadly. I wouldn&apos;t say to Putin, &quot;I personally think it is wrong to murder journalists, but if after careful deliberation, you still believe that you are doing the right thing, I will support your decision.&quot; His belief that he is doing the right thing (if he even casts the decision in those terms) is not a crux for me, and would not change my views.</p><p>Similarly, I don&apos;t see a reason yet to trust that the editor thinking Scott&apos;s birth name should be published, instead of referring to him with his pseudonym as the NYT has done many times before for others in similar situations, should update any of my beliefs on the value of pseudonymity, instead of simply reflecting on their callousness.</p>",

They make better life decisions, they calm their emotions in the moment. But they still look just as stressed as ever. They stamp out every internal conflict they can see, but it seems like there are more of them beyond the horizon of their self-awareness.</p><p>(I may have experienced this myself.)</p><p>One reason for this is that there's a danger with learning how to consciously notice and interact with one's subconscious thoughts/feelings/desires/fears: the conscious mind may not like what it sees, and try to edit the subconscious mind into one that pleases it.</p><p>The conscious mind might <i>try</i>, that is, but the subconscious is stronger.

But at that price, American shale wells are extremely profitable, and they grew rapidly - the dots in the map below are each an oil/gas well in the Eagle Ford basin in Southern Texas, and the graph above shows American oil production in red. This situation was not sustainable; prices eventually dropped to around $50/barrel, which is roughly the marginal cost of American shale. Since then, prices rose above $50/barrel again around 2018, and American shale once again grew rapidly in response.</figcaption></figure><figure style=\"width:55.24%;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MJy791q9l1LEMg4AsK0M4CnhGqQ3391kPTVyvgr9BR6A8iDKvWMus0xipbqptWlPw_ohL4CdY1xxzZrRtYsLfNgBFQiGhILKA-1yA8ndjjQCIPDPK9181KPFUBSEQQK5jVS4TTsc\"></figure><p>In this case, there is a useful sense in which production capacity causes prices, <i>not</i> the other way around - at least if we omit OPEC agreements.</p><p>Oil is a fairly liquid commodity. When there’s a shock in supply (e.g. OPEC agreeing to restrict output) or demand (e.g. lockdowns), the markets respond and prices rapidly adjust. Production <i>capacity</i>, on the other hand, adjusts slowly: drilling new wells and building new pipelines takes time, and once a well is built it rarely makes sense to shut it down before it runs dry. So (ignoring OPEC) prices <i>right now</i> are caused by production capacity right now, but production capacity right now is <i>not</i> caused by prices right now - it’s the result of prices over the past several years, when the wells were drilled.</p><p>Or, to put it differently: production capacity mediates the effects of historical prices on current prices. It’s a “mediator of history” - a variable which changes slowly enough that it carries information about the past. Other variables equilibrate more quickly, so they depend on far-past values only via the mediators of history.</p><p>(Incorporating OPEC into this view is an exercise for the reader.)</p><p>Another example: each of our cells’ DNA is damaged <a href=\"https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?s=n&amp;v=6&amp;id=112979\"><u>hundreds or thousands of times per day</u></a> - things like strand breaks or random molecules stuck on the side. Usually this is rapidly repaired, but occasionally it’s misrepaired and a mutation results - a change in the DNA sequence. On the other side, some mutations can increase DNA damage, either by <a href=\"https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1577-z\"><u>increasing</u></a> the rate at which it occurs, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_syndrome\"><u>reducing</u></a> the rate at which it’s repaired. So damage causes mutations, and mutations can cause damage.</p><figure style=\"width:62.89%;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SMiWOelBv4AeP4UGc2uELRBbwtNVtg95UFUEo024Uenozjk8qCA0DnZg2bHdntXftoR4MsEcyP6h2zkXJQhwb32TeBfQ8Fo181E2peQ6owk0jDC8ecbIQygOjHjRALZ8Z_3SYCZ-\"><figcaption>Visualizations of some kinds of DNA damage, and keywords to google if you want to know more about them.</figcaption></figure><p>Here again, there is a useful sense in which mutations cause damage, <i>not</i> the other way around: the damage <i>right now</i> is caused by the mutations right now, but the mutations right now were caused by damage long ago. The mutations are a mediator of history.</p><p>This has important implications for treating disease: we can use antioxidants to suppress (some types of) DNA damage, but that won’t remove the underlying mutations. As soon as we stop administering antioxidants, the damage will bounce right back up. Worse, we probably won’t prevent all damage, so mutations will still accumulate (albeit at a slower rate), and eventually the antioxidants won’t be enough. On the other hand, if we can fix the problematic mutations (e.g. by detecting and removing cells with such mutations), then that “resets” the cells - it’s like the earlier damage never happened at all.</p><p>Change the mediators of history, and it’s like history never happened.</p><p>A third example: a robot takes actions and updates its world model in response to incoming data. It uses the world model explicitly to decide which actions to take, but the actions chosen will also indirectly influence the world model - e.g. the robot will see different things and update the model differently depending on where it goes. However, the action being taken <i>right now</i> does not influence the world model right now; the world model depends on actions taken previously. So, the world model mediates history.</p><p>Here, it’s even more obvious that changing the mediator of history makes it like history never happened: if we reset the robot’s world model to its original state (and return it to wherever it started in the world), then all the influence of previous actions is erased.</p><p>In general, looking for mediators of history is a useful tool for making sense of systems containing feedback loops. In chemistry, it’s the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics\"><u>fast equilibrium approximation</u></a>, in which the overall kinetics of a reaction are dominated by a rate-limiting step. In physics more generally, it’s timescale separation, useful for separating e.g. wave propagation from material flows in fluid systems.</p><figure style=\"width:72.38%;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d11xrqAt1MCdwmIAgnxNXYJm8hvR836hYSvY0JkZ1gsArpYS9o7RvDEbluIT2ZjOhdsbvR_-aCtfS3Df24nv1cx9Sw5TgVHa38FP6c_WX-j2pkVBlXwENqvXMOWF1iTn1H8Jm7Bx\"><figcaption>In plasmas, charged particles follow a wheel-like motion - they orbit around magnetic field lines with drift superposed. When the orbital motion is on a fast timescale relative to the drift, we can average it out - see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrokinetics\"><u>gyrokinetics</u></a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The most common application of the idea in chemistry and physics is to simplify equations when we’re mainly interested in long-term behavior. We can just assume that the fast-equilibrating variables are always in equilibrium, and calculate the rate-of-change of the mediators of history under that assumption. In many systems, only a small fraction of the variables are mediators of history, so this approximation lets us simulate differential equations in far fewer dimensions.</p><p>From a modelling perspective, the mediators of history are the “state variables” of the system on long timescales. This is especially important in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Recursive-Macroeconomic-Theory-MIT-Press/dp/0262018748\"><u>economic models</u></a>, since the state variables are what agents in the models need to forecast - e.g. stock traders mainly need to know how mediators of history will behave in the future. If they know that, then the rest is just noise plus an equilibrium calculation.</p><p>Finally, in terms of engineering, mediators of history are key targets for control. For instance, if we want to cure aging, then identifying and intervening on the mediators of history <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3hfjaztptwEt2cCve/p/d4DvqS88Q29ZaJAj3\"><u>is the key problem</u></a> - they are both a necessary and a sufficient set of intervention targets. That actually simplifies the problem a lot, since the vast majority of biological entities - from molecules to cells - turn over on a very fast timescale, compared to the timescale of aging. So there are probably relatively few mediators of history, relative to the complexity of the whole human body - we just need to look for things which turn over on a timescale of decades or slower (including things which don’t equilibrate at all).</p></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>This piece is <a href=\"https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2020/6/26/five-ways-to-prioritize-better\">cross-posted on my blog here</a>.</p><p>I&#x2019;m going to let you in on a secret of productivity.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>Those people you admire, the ones who make you wonder how on earth they accomplish so much?&#xA0;Those people <em>might </em>work more hours than you or be more talented or more passionate. Or they might <em>not</em>.&#xA0;</p><p>But they <em>probably </em>work on better things, in better ways.&#xA0;</p><p>Now, before you protest that that&#x2019;s the same thing as being talented or smart or hardworking, let me unpack that claim. Working on better things means they carefully choose what&#x2019;s worth caring about, and what they won&#x2019;t give a fuck about. Working in better ways means they carefully choose to do the most important actions to accomplish those goals.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>In short, working on better things, in better ways is &#x2026; prioritization. Prioritizing well is the common thread behind successful people.&#xA0;</p><p>Because prioritizing well is so freaking important. Cumulative good choices can multiply your impact <em>tens or hundreds</em> of times. You can&#x2019;t work tens or hundreds as many hours in a day. You <em>can</em> choose what to do and how to do it most effectively.&#xA0;</p><p>But prioritization isn&#x2019;t just following through on the actions you already know you should do -- though that&#x2019;s important too. Knowing what you should do is actually hard. There&#x2019;s a long gap between wanting to make the world brighter and knowing how to do it. I want to acknowledge that.&#xA0;</p><p>So, bear with me a bit. This post is longer than usual because I&#x2019;m trying to give you a bunch of examples to really get a taste of what prioritizing feels like. I think every one of the examples will help you understand better, but, if you have a hard time focusing for 14 pages, maybe read one tool now and come back another time for others?</p><p>I&#x2019;ve organized the examples around five specific concepts that you can use to help apply the mindset more effectively: Theory of Change, Lean Tests, Bottlenecks, Ballpark Estimates, and the 80/20 Rule. I&#x2019;ll start each section with some concrete stories before summarizing the concept and how it helps you prioritize.&#xA0;</p><p><em>Note: The following vignettes, apart from the ones about me and the interview with Tara, are fictional. However, they are inspired by multiple real conversations I&apos;ve had. If you find yourself thinking &quot;this could never happen&quot;, rest assured that, though these examples are fictional, they are based on real conversations.&#xA0;&#xA0;</em></p><h1>I. Theory of Change</h1><h2>1. Career planning</h2><p>Phil is telling his friend Erica about his plans to switch into AI safety.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> &#x201C;So, I was thinking I&#x2019;d stay at my job for another six months. I have a bonus coming then, so it&#x2019;s a better time to make a career switch. &#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Erica:</strong> &#x201C;Huh, I&#x2019;m surprised that your current job is the best plan for your goals. I thought you said the most important goal was building your machine learning skills?&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, but I&#x2019;m picking up some machine learning on the job, so it&#x2019;s also skill building!&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Erica:</strong> &#x201C;But you&#x2019;re only spending a bit of your time on ML, and it&#x2019;s not like all of that learning will transfer to the jobs you&#x2019;re applying for anyway. Wouldn&#x2019;t you learn a lot more by independently studying some directly relevant ML?&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> &#x201C;Hmm...you&#x2019;ve got a point. I could learn a lot more if I took a month off to just study. But that feels riskier, and I might have a hard time staying motivated.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Erica:</strong> &#x201C;But also consider, you told me that you thought that working on AI safety was several times as impactful as your current role, at least in expectation. That means that spending six more months before switching is like wasting a whole year or more of impact.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> &#x201C;Man, you&#x2019;re right. I could start applying now so I&#x2019;m ready to switch right after I get my bonus. But, I don&#x2019;t actually know if I&#x2019;m ready! I don&#x2019;t know if I have the skills I would need to get hired.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Erica:</strong> &#x201C;Then it sounds like you need to find out.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> &#x201C;I know a couple of people I could ask, and I can look at the job posts to see what skills they&#x2019;re looking for. That should help. And if I&#x2019;m not ready, I&#x2019;ll probably get a better idea exactly what I should study. Then I can make a timeline so I&#x2019;m ready to switch as soon as I can.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Erica:</strong> &#x201C;How do you feel about that plan?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Phil:</strong> &#x201C;Pretty good. I think leaving my job feels really risky given how uncertain I am, and it was making me avoid thinking about switching. Investigating more without feeling like I need to commit to leaving helps.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>When Phil worked backwards from his end goal, he realized his original plan was actually a pretty bad plan (at least for him), because it wasn&#x2019;t going <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/moving-towards-the-goal/\">directly for the goal</a>. Despite a lot of uncertainty, Phil&#x2019;s best guess is that applying sooner is much better. Waiting would probably mean he&#x2019;d lose a few months that could have been spent on much more valuable work. But at worst, he might never make a plan that will actually have an impact unless he stops and thinks harder -- it&#x2019;s really easy to default to the status quo, even when that&#x2019;s a bad decision.&#xA0;</p><h2>2. Publishing an op-ed</h2><p>Elle wants to publish an op-ed. But she doesn&#x2019;t really know how op-eds get published. So, she asks her friend Peter - who has published op-eds before - about the process.</p><p><strong>Elle:</strong> &#x201C;So, I was thinking I&#x2019;d write an article, send it to a bunch of newspapers, and cross my fingers. What do you think?&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Peter:</strong> &#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s probably not going to work out. You don&#x2019;t just write an op-ed and send it to places; you need to really tailor the piece to the magazine you want to publish it in.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Elle:</strong> &#x201C;Huh, how would I do that?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Peter:</strong> &#x201C;First, you should check out other pieces on the platform you&#x2019;re interested in. If a venue has already published several pieces on similar topics, then it&#x2019;s likely that an editor there likes that topic and is more likely to accept a new perspective on the issue. Second&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Elle lacked an accurate model of how her actions would lead to her goal because she didn&#x2019;t understand the world well enough. Creating an accurate theory of change required learning what actions would generally suffice to accomplish her goal. If she hadn&#x2019;t learned how the process actually worked, she might have wasted a lot of effort without ever getting the piece published. But she had no way of knowing that until she asked.&#xA0;</p><h2>3. Studying for the GRE</h2><p>Like many students before me, I didn&#x2019;t really care if I remembered the content after the test. I just wanted to spend as little time as possible to get a GRE score I was happy with. But how to do that?&#xA0;</p><p>According to test prep websites, I should have worked through a GRE prep book (preferably theirs). After all, those are explicitly designed to prepare you for the GRE. They include everything I needed to know; concept review, vocabulary quizzes, and practice tests.&#xA0;</p><p><em>But</em> I knew they would actually waste time.&#xA0;</p><p>See, I knew that spreading my time evenly over the material was an inefficient way to learn. I&#x2019;ll learn a lot more studying stuff I don&#x2019;t know yet, rather than reviewing stuff I already knew. Neither the study guide nor the vocab would have focused me on just my weakest areas, so I would have spent hours rereading familiar material.&#xA0;</p><p>Instead, I optimized my study for rapidly improving my weaknesses: take practice quant section tests (my weakest section), study the questions I missed, summarize the concepts behind the questions, repeat. Those three steps saved me dozens of hours.</p><h2>Theory of Change</h2><p>In each of these examples, the person wanted to accomplish a particular goal.&#xA0; They worked backwards from that goal to find the steps that would make them likely to succeed at the goal.&#xA0;</p><p>Elle figured out how the publishing world worked so that she knew what actions were likely to succeed. Phil found that a different path would allow him to have an impact sooner and reduce his chances of failing. I worked backwards to cut out unnecessary work and save time.&#xA0;</p><p>Each person needed to know their goal, figure out what steps would reliably lead to that goal, and then focus only on those steps. That&#x2019;s the theory of change -- this model of the causal chain of actions that lead to successfully accomplishing the end goal. You might need to investigate how the world works or go learn something if you don&#x2019;t have enough information, in order to accurately pick what will have an impact.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>So, if you want to apply this tool, ask yourself -- what steps will <em>actually</em> make you likely to achieve your goals?</p><p>(If you want more, here&#x2019;s<a href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theoryofchange\"> a great post</a> on theory of change.)</p><p>Working out your goals and your theory of change is a prerequisite step to other prioritization techniques. For example, it&#x2019;s going to be hard to use the next concept (lean tests) without having a least a starting point for what you want to optimize.&#xA0;</p><h1>II. Lean Tests</h1><h2>1. Starting a business</h2><p>The summer after my freshman year of college, I was hired to start a company making personal biographies.</p><p>I immediately started finding contractors to create the books, getting prototypes made, and building a website. This seemed reasonable to me then &#x2013; after all, that was my job description. And I did a good job. At the end of the summer, I had a full production plan ready for when the first customer purchased.</p><p>Except, no one ever purchased a single book.</p><p>If I had started by talking with potential customers, I could have known in a month that the idea was doomed from the start. The target audience had no interest in the elaborate $10,000 product my employer envisioned. But I didn&#x2019;t know that, because I created a product before I confirmed people were ready to buy it. I could have saved an entire summer of work if I had just tried talking to potential customers first.</p><h2>2. Conducting research</h2><p>Max is asking his friend Ellen for advice about his research project.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Max:</strong> &#x201C;Aw man, I&#x2019;m super bummed -- I spent <em>six months</em> researching this policy area. Then when I sent my write-up draft for feedback, someone sent me an unpublished document where they&#x2019;d already done part of the research! Plus, now I need to do <em>more</em> research to answer their questions. I feel like I wasted so much time already, and I&#x2019;m not even done. What could I have done?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> &#x201C;That sucks. Hmm, there&#x2019;s a post called <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/ResearchasaStochasticDecisionProcess.html\">Research as a Stochastic Decision Process</a> that might help avoid similar situations in the future. Want to hear about it?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Max:</strong> &#x201C;Yeah!&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> &#x201C;The really simple version is to first do the parts of the task that are most likely to fail or change what other steps you will do, rather than doing the easiest parts first. This way, you reduce uncertainty about which tasks are necessary as quickly as possible. For example, if your task has three steps and one is most likely to fail, you save time in expectation by doing that one first, because you might not need to do the other steps at all.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Max:</strong> &#x201C;Yeah... I did the easy tasks first here. Like, doing all the research was a lot of work, but it was easy to just keep reading. Asking for feedback didn&#x2019;t take much time, but it was <em>hard</em>. I got really anxious whenever I thought about sending the emails, and just kept doing more research, and then more research. But having that feedback earlier would have totally changed what things I choose to research. It could have saved me hundreds of hours.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><h2>3. Learning a new subject</h2><p>Alex wanted to do some independent study to see if he would be a good fit for working on AI safety. Based on 80,000 Hours recommendations, he found a few promising math courses that he could work through on the weekends over a few months.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>Before he got started, he asked a few acquaintances who worked on AI safety whether his plan made sense. They mostly thought it did, but agreed that several of the math topics he had planned to study weren&#x2019;t immediately valuable. He could safely skip those for now.</p><p>Spending an hour sending those emails cut his months of study in half.</p><h2>Lean Tests</h2><p>In each of these examples, the person wanted to efficiently accomplish their goal. In the first two examples, the person failed to test quickly, and wasted time or failed entirely. In the third, by quickly testing their idea, the person exposed flaws early so that they could rapidly correct them or move on - increasing the proportion of their effort that actually made them succeed.</p><p>I spent an entire summer on a project that failed entirely because I didn&#x2019;t test it early enough to change it into something that could succeed. Max could have saved hundreds of hours by asking for feedback upfront. Alex <em>did</em> save hundreds of hours by checking his plan before he implemented it.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>Each person could have broken their tasks into chunks to iterate on, getting feedback each step of the way, rather than risk wasting time by investing a lot of effort without feedback.&#xA0;</p><p>Lean methodology is about continuously doing small tests to check that you&#x2019;re on the right track. This allows you to iteratively making lots of corrections that move you towards your goal, even when you&#x2019;re not sure what is required (or when you are sure but are wrong.)&#xA0;</p><p>By finding the flaws early, you can change course early, minimize wasted time, and reduce the risk of ultimate failure. Better to know a project will fail before you put in months of effort that could have been spent on a project more likely to succeed. You could get feedback from more experienced people, your target audience, or the thing itself.</p><p>So, what is the first quick test you could create to get feedback and iterate?&#xA0;</p><h1>III. Bottlenecks</h1><h2>1. Anxiety</h2><p>Anna is early in her journalism career. She&#x2019;s talking to her partner Dan, a fellow writer, about her draft of a piece on factory farming.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> &#x201C;Hey, did you pitch your idea to your supervisor today like you planned?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> &#x201C;No&#x2026; I just got too nervous and couldn&#x2019;t make the words come out. I think I want to keep working on it before I talk to her.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> &#x201C;Anna, your piece is great! You&#x2019;ve been working on it for a <em>year </em>already. It&#x2019;s not going to get better without feedback. All of your hard work won&#x2019;t matter until someone sees it.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> &#x201C;Yeah, you&#x2019;re right. But I just feel so scared when I try. My chest gets tight and it feels hard to breathe.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> &#x201C;Anna, maybe it&#x2019;s time to consider talking to someone about this. What do you think?&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve actually been thinking about it for a while now, and I think you&#x2019;re right.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><h2>2. Procrastination</h2><p>Mary had meant to get started on her final presentation for her internship two weeks ago. But she felt a wave of dread whenever she started to think about it, so her thoughts slid away to something less awful each time. Now the presentation is in a week, and the feeling has risen to panic mode. Yet she still can&#x2019;t make herself even look at her research.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t a new feeling for Mary. She&#x2019;s six months overdue on a write-up from her former research position. But whenever her former adviser sends an email asking for the report, a pit opens in Mary&#x2019;s stomach.</p><p>Mary started coaching to tackle her persistent procrastination. Over the next year, Mary and I worked together to build up her ability to make better plans, set up habits to reduce distractions, learn to ask for help early and often, and find commitment mechanisms that work for her.&#xA0;</p><p>After a year of working on this big bottleneck, she feels confident in doing her work by her deadlines. That work was an investment in herself that will pay off over the rest of her career.</p><h2>3. Fatigue</h2><p>Sometimes one issue will dominate everything else in regard to productivity, often a physical or mental health issue. In my case, it was fatigue. When you need to take three naps a day, you get less work done regardless of what other productivity tools you use.</p><p>So, it was worthwhile investing a bunch of time and effort to improve this. I tried a parade of experiments and tracked all the factors that I thought might influence my energy levels &#x2013; including sleep times, sleep duration, hydration, exercise, medications, melatonin, doing a sleep study, temperature, naps, and nutrition. I tracked my energy levels and a changing subset of variables for 3-6 months, then compared the odds ratios for each variable.</p><p>Here, a bunch of small things cumulatively broke the bottleneck, primarily sleep duration (which was fixed by a consistent sleep schedule), exercise, hydration, and finally an antidepressant.&#xA0;</p><p>While I still have issues with fatigue, it&#x2019;s no longer the key thing holding me back.</p><h2>Bottlenecks</h2><p>In each of these examples, the person needed to get past one bottleneck that was holding them back from succeeding. Each bottleneck eclipsed other tasks, even valuable tasks, until the problem was addressed.&#xA0;</p><p>Anna needed to work on her social anxiety before her hard work would ever see the light of day. Mary found she could accomplish several times as much once she got her procrastination under control. I had the energy to start a blog after I reduced my fatigue.&#xA0;</p><p>Originally, bottlenecks referred to the &#x201C;rate-limiting factors&#x201D; that slow down the entire production line. In our examples, the bottlenecks are the tasks, beliefs, or problems that slow down or stop you from accomplishing other tasks. Each person made progress by identifying what was holding up other steps. Once they took care of the high-leverage factor, everything else went much faster.&#xA0;</p><p>So, what are the one or two things you could change about yourself or your environment to accomplish twice as much?</p><h1>IV. Ballpark Estimates&#xA0;</h1><h2>1. Choosing projects&#xA0;</h2><p>Will is talking with his PhD supervisor, Kate, about feeling overwhelmed by too many projects.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> &#x201C;I think I just need to choose one or two to focus on, and put the rest on hold for now. But I <em>want</em> to work on all seven.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Kate:</strong> &#x201C;Well, to start with, which ones are most important to work on?&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the problem; they all seem important! Papers 1 and 2 have a good chance of being published in a good journal, which is important if I want to continue in academia. Paper 3 has a good collaborator, and I don&#x2019;t want to let them down. And papers 4 and 5 are exciting. I think those ideas could really be impactful. Arrg...I just feel overwhelmed when I think about it, like I need to do them all.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Kate:</strong> &#x201C;Okay, let&#x2019;s try a thought experiment. How much would you pay to have each of these projects magically completed? If it&#x2019;s hard to think about paying with your own money, how much do you think Open Phil would pay to have the project completed?&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> &#x201C;Argh, thats hard.&#x201D; *15 minutes of brainstorming later* &#x201C;Okay, paper 4 could be really big if it goes well, and 2 and 3 are <em>maybe </em>most important for my career. So I think I&#x2019;d pay like $1000 each for papers 1 and 5, $1500 for papers 2 and 3, and $5000 for paper 4. But these are super crude, I&#x2019;m really just guessing here.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Kate:</strong> &#x201C;Crude numbers are fine. You&#x2019;re really just trying to get a better sense of how you intuitively value each of these. Those numbers help clarify the ranking and rough magnitude of difference between the projects. Sounds like paper 4 is the best, and then 2 and 3 are a bit better than 1 and 5, all else equal. Now, which projects do you expect to take the least time?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> &#x201C;Paper 3 for sure. My collaborator is doing a bunch of the work, so it&#x2019;s probably half as big as the other papers. Between the others...really hard to say. Um, so maybe I&#x2019;d sort them 3, 1, 4, 5, 2 from least to most time, but I&#x2019;m really guessing here.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Kate:</strong> &#x201C;Based on value and time required, it sounds like you should spend most of your time on paper 4, plus some on paper 3.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> &#x201C;But all of these are estimations! I&#x2019;m not confident, and I could be really wrong.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Kate:</strong> &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not going to be confident. Things are uncertain and will be uncertain no matter how long you think about it. So you <em>have </em>to make your best choice despite your uncertainty. Estimates are a way to try to make that choice as well as you can. And you should absolutely spend more than 5 minutes thinking about them. So, take a few days to think about your estimates in more depth. Maybe ask a couple of advisors. But, when you&#x2019;re done, go with the highest expected value and stop worrying about it. You can change your plan if you get new information. For now, you&#x2019;re doing the best you can, and that&#x2019;s good enough.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> &#x201C;I...think...I can do that. Thanks, Kate.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><h2>2. Learning a new skill</h2><p>Lyra is talking with her coworker Mike about her plans for independent study to improve her coding skills.</p><p><strong>Lyra: </strong>&#x201C;So, I&#x2019;m debating between spending a bigger chunk of time to really understand computer architecture or doing several small learning projects around things that came up in my job. I&#x2019;m having a hard time making progress on either idea because I keep flipping back and forth about which seems most important.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> &#x201C;Can you try calculating the time required for the learning, and the time saved afterward, to calculate which is better?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Lyra: </strong>&#x201C;So I tried doing that earlier. I estimated the architecture learning would take me fifty to a hundred hours to do, and save maybe twenty or thirty hours a year. On the other hand, one of the smaller projects would only take five or ten hours, and it would save me a few minutes a day, which adds up to ten or fifteen hours a year.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> &#x201C;That sounds like the smaller project is clearly a better deal - it would pay for itself within one year, while the bigger project would need more like three years to break even.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Lyra: </strong>&#x201C;I know, but the bigger project feels important anyway. I think... the bigger project isn&apos;t just about saving time. I care about it because it also opens up the option to do new things that I can&#x2019;t do right now. But I&#x2019;m not sure if that benefit is big enough to make it worth doing.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> &#x201C;Could you run an experiment for five hours or so to see if it seems like you&#x2019;re able to do new things?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Lyra: </strong>&#x201C;Yeah, that sounds good. If it looks like I&#x2019;m not, then I can go ahead with the smaller project since that&#x2019;s better for saving time.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Even though Lyra didn&#x2019;t follow her numbers exactly, they were helpful for clarifying the decision.&#xA0;</p><h2>3. Job hunting</h2><p>Mark has just graduated from university, and he wants to complete an ML masters to be an engineer at an AI safety org or earn to give if that doesn&#x2019;t work out.&#xA0;</p><p>However, the programs cost between $15,000 and $24,000, and Mark isn&#x2019;t comfortable going into debt. So his plan is to get a job now, apply for the masters&#x2019; programs in the fall, and save up money until he starts the following year.&#xA0;</p><p>Mark&#x2019;s previous summer job has offered him a full-time role for $15 an hour. However, his undergrad thesis supervisor encourages him to look into software engineering jobs, which the supervisor thinks he&#x2019;s qualified for. Unfortunately, he doesn&#x2019;t have enough time to take the summer job while also applying.&#xA0;</p><p>Mark isn&#x2019;t sure about it, but his supervisor convinces him to look into some job postings for local positions. So Mark puts together the following estimates.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ad8da815ffd20813824d475/t/5ef6281def93dd08a234c1d2/1593190435262/Job+Hunting+table.png?format=500w\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>Based on those numbers, he decides it&#x2019;s worth delaying starting at his previous job to spend a couple of months applying to engineering roles. If it works out, he&#x2019;ll earn a lot more. If the job hunt doesn&#x2019;t seem promising after a few months, he can go back to the other role.</p><h2>Ballpark Estimates</h2><p>In each of these examples, putting numbers on the uncertainty helped the person prioritize. Estimating didn&#x2019;t cleanly decide their priorities, but it reduced uncertainty. It revealed blind spots, such as missing important considerations or thinking two things were comparable when one was actually way more important. By quantifying, ranking, or crunching numbers, they were able to make a better guess at what should be prioritized.&#xA0;</p><p>Quantifying his expected value and time required helped Will increase his expected value per hour of work 2x compared to working on one of the papers at random. Quantifying return on investment for her time learning helped Lyra identify what factors she was overlooking, so now she can evaluate whether the project is worthwhile. Mark decided to apply to more ambitious jobs based on his numbers, and got a role making &gt;50% more after three months of applying.&#xA0;</p><p>Classically, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PsEppdvgRisz5xAHG/fermi-estimates\">Fermi estimates</a> are back-of-the-envelope calculations intended to quickly approximate the correct answer, usually when the real answer is difficult to get. Here, people estimated values and costs of different options, so they could approximate the return on their investment and compare opportunity costs.&#xA0;</p><p>Since we&#x2019;re frequently prioritizing amid uncertainty, even moderately reducing that uncertainty improves decisions. Often you have some data easily available even when you feel uncertain. Sometimes this is just making your intuition concrete. Sometimes it is actually gathering data and crunching numbers. You should take care not to be overconfident in your estimates, but even totally made up numbers can sometimes be useful, such as when you want to make a decision between competing intuitions.&#xA0;</p><p>So, what returns do you get on the time and effort invested? How does this compare with your other options?</p><h1>V. 80/20 Rule</h1><h2>1. Working hours experiment</h2><p>Bill was frustrated by a consistent dip in energy each afternoon. He felt less motivated during this time, and sluggish and slow even when he forced himself to work.&#xA0;</p><p>Working out in the afternoon helped him feel more energetic afterward, but taking a forty-five-minute break made him feel like he needed to work late.&#xA0;</p><p>He knew that subjective experience doesn&apos;t always match actual output, so he tried quickly recording how many words per hour he wrote for a week. Bill also noted how he subjectively felt during that time. At the end, the data suggested that his output dropped by nearly half during that period, and only gradually picked back up over the later afternoon.&#xA0;</p><p>He kept recording the data while he took some workout breaks. Although the data was noisy, he found that he got about as much done on days when he worked out and days when he didn&#x2019;t.&#xA0;</p><p>Given that, he decided to work out each afternoon without feeling obligated to work late.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><h2>2. Optimizing school</h2><p>Sarah is a college freshman asking Alice, a senior who works in the same lab, for tips on how to succeed in college.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Sarah:</strong> &#x201C;So, what are the most important things you do to get good grades?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> &#x201C;Umm, I plan each day the night before so I know exactly what I need to do, and then I set aside a couple of hours when I turn off my phone and study without any distractions. That&#x2019;s big. I usually do the most important task first so that I don&#x2019;t risk running out of time. Oh, and I have a question in mind while I&#x2019;m doing research, so that I don&#x2019;t lose too much time going down rabbit holes.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Sarah:</strong> &#x201C;Is there something else that helps you reliably manage your workload?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> &#x201C;So, I start my planning by looking at which projects are worth a lot of a grade or that I care a lot about learning, and I choose which projects deserve the most time and which to just do the bare minimum. For example, going from an okay paper to a great one takes a lot more work, so I&#x2019;ll only do that if I really care about the paper. Otherwise, I&#x2019;ll wait to start the paper until the day before it&#x2019;s due, and then race like crazy. It forces me to get the paper done without spending too much time on it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Sarah:</strong> &#x201C;Thanks, Alice. That sounds helpful. I&#x2019;ve been feeling really overwhelmed by taking three really hard classes, and I really want to get As in all of them. I&#x2019;m a bit of a perfectionist, I know.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> &#x201C;It&#x2019;s great that you&#x2019;re asking for advice, Sarah, that will probably help you figure college out way faster than I did. But I want to ask, why do you care about getting good grades?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Sarah:</strong> &#x201C;Wha-what?&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> &#x201C;Why are As the thing you&#x2019;re aiming for right now?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Sarah:</strong> &#x201C;That doesn&#x2019;t even make sense. Grades are just what we&#x2019;re supposed to do here. Wait, I&#x2019;ll try to work out the reason&#x2026; Because in school, grades are how we know we&#x2019;re doing well or where we need to improve. And how future employers or grad schools know that we&#x2019;re good.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> &#x201C;That&#x2019;s fair, but it&#x2019;s only a small part of what people will care about in the future. You&#x2019;re only a freshman, but you&#x2019;re already working in this lab and your research seems really promising. You obviously love doing it. But you&#x2019;re only doing five hours a week here because you say you don&#x2019;t have enough time to do this and study. If you instead spent a lot more time on research and did really cool things there, I bet both grad schools and future employers would care about that more than a 4 point GPA.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Sarah:</strong> &#x201C;Hmm.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> &#x201C;I mentioned earlier how important it is to decide which parts of a project deserve more time, and which to just put in the minimum. Well, it&#x2019;s even more important to carefully choose what projects or classes are worth a lot of time, and when it would be better to do the minimum you can in some classes, so that you can invest heavily in others.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Sarah:</strong> &#x201C;I need to think about this. What you&#x2019;re saying kind of makes sense, but I&#x2019;m worried that if I&#x2019;m doing the bare minimum, my grades will drop too much.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> &#x201C;Good things to consider. I&#x2019;m applying to med school, so my grades matter. But I chose to take easy classes for my gen eds and electives, so that I can put in a lot of time here at the lab without damaging my GPA. That&#x2019;s the right decision for me. I&#x2019;ll bet it&#x2019;s worthwhile for you to spend some time thinking about what you want to be perfectionist about.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><h2>3. High-value rest time</h2><p>In my interview with <a href=\"https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2020/4/4/tara-mac-aulay-on-happiness-and-work-self-experimentation-and-prioritization\">Tara Mac Auley</a>, she advised trying a bunch of leisure activities to decide which are most valuable for you.&#xA0;</p><blockquote>&#x201C;If you take time to rest and you come back, and it doesn&apos;t feel better then probably the ways that you&apos;ve chosen to rest aren&apos;t in fact the most restorative things you could be doing. And so I would suggest trying a lot of different things: a lot of different types of social activities, or physical activities, or intellectually engaging activities.&#xA0;<br>I did this a lot when I was in my early 20s. I picked a random event from meetup.com every day for about two months, and I just had to go to whichever thing came up. And then I would write down beforehand whether I thought I would enjoy it and feel drained or refreshed from that activity. And then I would compare afterward what I actually felt and, I don&#x2019;t know, that was really informative and good for me.&#x201D;</blockquote><p>She used this type of process to identify the activities that best leave her rejuvenated and rested.</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Being near water and swimming, but not in a swimming pool, it has to be natural water. Being in nature. Reading a book, especially reading a book in a park or by a lake or something like that. Spending quality time with close friends or family just having a conversation for an hour with no particular goals, I find really rejuvenating. And eating a really nice meal; one where I can kind of savor all of the different tastes and textures&#x2026;.I go out dancing a lot on my own, to go and see music artists that I enjoy, and I just dance like a crazy person until I&apos;m really tired and then I go home, and that&apos;s amazing.&#x201D;</blockquote><h2>80/20 Rule</h2><p>In each of these examples, the person wanted to prioritize the most valuable subset of possible actions. By identifying the higher-value actions, they could get more done for their effort.&#xA0;</p><p>Bill did an experiment to find out which hours of work provided the most value, so he could make better decisions about when to work. Sarah prioritized the highest value work to get good grades, and started thinking about how much more valuable that effort would be if she prioritized the highest value goals to begin with. Tara experimented to find out which activities were the highest value fun for her, which she can now exploit 80/20 style.&#xA0;</p><p>Based on the idea that 80% of an output comes from 20% of the input, the 80/20 rule suggests that the value per unit of effort varies a lot across different actions. Because outputs vary so much, explore more can unearth dramatically better options. So, similar to Tara, you need to try many actions first in order to effectively identify the top-performing subset. Once you&#x2019;ve identified which actions are most valuable, you can narrow your focus to just that subset. Then your output will increase significantly for the same effort.&#xA0;</p><p>So, what gives you the most value for the least effort? What can you cut with minimum loss so that you have extra resources to put toward what&#x2019;s most valuable?</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>All of these stories are of how people tried to identify the most valuable actions they could take to accomplish their goals. They reduced uncertainty, said no to other actions, and made choices based on their best guesses.&#xA0;</p><p>You might be tempted to say these examples don&#x2019;t feel important. That choosing which skill to learn or overcoming anxiety can&#x2019;t change the world. And maybe you&#x2019;re right, if you only look at that one step.&#xA0;</p><p>If you put all of these together, you have a mindset that searches for the most valuable goals, builds models to effectively accomplish them, iteratively tests assumptions against the world, logically weighs the opportunity cost, and judiciously spends time and effort to get the most impact possible. That mindset touches all your decisions.&#xA0;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s prioritization.&#xA0;</p><p>Because prioritization isn&#x2019;t something you do once a month. It&#x2019;s not a magical ability that lets you do everything - quite the opposite, in fact. It&#x2019;s the gut-deep sense that your time and effort are limited and you need to choose what to do, because you can&#x2019;t do everything.&#xA0;</p><p>But when you do that? When you put all of your reason and tools to the task of choosing the most valuable goals?&#xA0;</p><p>Then we have a chance. Choose important goals, and you could save lives from dying of malaria or build a future where pandemics don&#x2019;t wipe out hundreds of thousands. Accomplish those goals, and <em>the world becomes better</em>. If you need to take care of your own mental health or build skills first, then do it. You&#x2019;re still nudging the world in the right direction.&#xA0;</p><p>And if you don&#x2019;t? ...Then we&#x2019;re still right where we are now. We&#x2019;ve lost out on some of the goodness and wonder the world could have had. There&#x2019;s the sense of being so close and just missing what could have been.&#xA0;</p><p>That&#x2019;s why I want to convey the mindset of what it feels like to prioritize.&#xA0;</p><p>So, here are five questions to take with you. Use them to make the world better.</p><ol><li>What steps will <em>actually</em> make you likely to achieve your goals?</li><li>What is the first quick test you could create to get feedback and iterate?&#xA0;</li><li>What are the one or two things you could change about yourself or your environment to accomplish twice as much?</li><li>What returns do you get on the time and effort invested? How does this compare with your other options?</li><li>What gives you the most value for the least effort? What can you cut with minimum loss so that you have extra resources to put toward what&#x2019;s most valuable?</li></ol><p><em>Enjoyed the piece? <u><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/gnWbln\">Subscribe to EA Coaching&#x2019;s newsletter</a></u> to get more posts delivered to you.</em> </p>",

I have made this mistake many, many times because my personality is extremized in three big ways.</p>\n<h2>Natural Amphetamines</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I once heard a friend, upon his first use of modafinil, wonder aloud if the way they felt on that stimulant was the way Elon Musk felt all the time. That tied a lot of things together for me, gave me an intuitive understanding of what it might “feel like from the inside” to be Elon Musk. And it gave me a good tool to discuss biological variation with. Most of us agree that people on stimulants can perform in ways it’s difficult for people off stimulants to match. Most of us agree that there’s nothing magical about stimulants, just changes to the levels of dopamine, histamine, norepinephrine et cetera in the brain. And most of us agree there’s a lot of natural variation in these chemicals anyway. So “me on stimulants is that guy’s normal” seems like a good way of cutting through some of the philosophical difficulties around this issue.</p>\n<p>― <em>The Parable of the Talents</em> by Scott Alexander</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://drugabuse.com/amphetamine/effects-use/\">drugabuse.com</a>, amphetamines have the following short-term effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quicker reaction times.</li>\n<li>Feelings of energy/wakefulness.</li>\n<li>Excitement.</li>\n<li>Increased attentiveness and concentration.</li>\n<li>Feelings of euphoria.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These characteristics describe my baseline state. I feel like I am on stimulants<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-MoBsf5zmFkpKfexsW-1\" id=\"fnref-MoBsf5zmFkpKfexsW-1\">[1]</a></sup> all the time. Natural amphetamines have advantages. I am energetic. I concentrate well. I get lots of work done.</p>\n<p>They have disadvantages too. Amphetamines are associated with headaches, appetite suppression, severe anxiety and obsessive behavior all of which <em>also</em> describe me. The headaches are ignorable because I cannot remember ever <em>not</em> having a headache. The appetite suppression is survivable because I live in a civilization full of convenient calories. The obsessive behavior is a double-edge sword. On the one hand it makes me bad at small talk. On the other hand it helps me finish things.</p>\n<p>The anxiety in particular causes me to overprepare for disaster. When your are anxious, it is natural to search for a threat. When I feel merely moderate anxiety I ought always to consider that there may be nothing to fear but the fear itself.</p>\n<p>I should assume a prior expectation that other people have the following characteristics relative to myself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slower reaction times</li>\n<li>Lethargy</li>\n<li>Boredom</li>\n<li>Inattentive and distractable</li>\n<li>Depressed</li>\n<li>Relaxed</li>\n<li>Normal, adjusted, balanced, sane, stable<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-MoBsf5zmFkpKfexsW-2\" id=\"fnref-MoBsf5zmFkpKfexsW-2\">[2]</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>High Curiosity</h2>\n<p>Among the Big Five personality traits, curiosity (openness to experience) is my most extremized<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-MoBsf5zmFkpKfexsW-3\" id=\"fnref-MoBsf5zmFkpKfexsW-3\">[3]</a></sup> one.</p>\n<p>Other people are comparatively closed to experience.

I find it a useful model for understanding a difference between myself and others. I am heavily on the systematizing end of this spectrum.</p>\n<p>There is less research on this topic than the others so instead of listing the traits of systematizers I will list the traits of autistic people and flip them around. Compared to me, other people are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tolerant of disruptions to their schedule, do not need to be notified in advance</li>\n<li>Tolerant of noise and other background sensory stimuli</li>\n<li>High empathy, almost telepathic</li>\n<li>Fewer, less intense special interests</li>\n<li>Think vaguely, imprecisely</li>\n<li>Good communicators</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Conclusions</h1>\n<p>Comparatively-speaking, I am a heretical savant high on cocaine. That <em>would</em> explain why strangers tend to remember having met me. <strong>I can improve my interactions with others by adopting the prior that they are passive parochial team players.</strong></p>\n<p>High openness is associated with a preference for frequently-changing schedules. Systematizing is associated with schedule inflexibility. How can I exhibit both traits? I am inflexible toward others when it comes to my whimsical schedule.</p>\n<p>By a similar paradox, I feel comfortable in the traditional oppressive culture of Japan. My systematizing proclivities enjoy the quiet perfectionism. Meanwhile, as a foreigner, I am not myself expected to conform.</p>\n<p>My extremized characteristics all contribute to my advanced technical skills; I am pathalogically good at writing software. Ironically, the same traits simultaneously make it harder to find a job and fit into a corporation. I can only work somewhere where my technical skills are sufficiently valued for the company to tolerate my eccentricity.

The good outcome is that you could understand map errors more deeply; the dangerous outcome is that you could wind up stuck somewhere awful, with no easy way out.</p><p>The first version, where you notice that the map is wrong, comes when the map is undeniably <i>locally</i> wrong. The map says the path continues here, but instead there's a cliff. (Your beliefs strongly predict something, and the opposite happens.)</p><p>The ordinary result is that you scratch out and redraw that part of the map – or discard it and pick up an entirely different map – and continue along the new path that looks best. (You decide you were wrong on that one point without questioning any related beliefs, or you convert to a completely different belief system which was correct on that point.)</p><p>The really valuable possibility is that you realize that there are probably <i>other</i> errors besides the one you've seen, and probably unseen errors on the other available maps as well; you start to become more careful about trusting your maps so completely, and you pay a bit more attention to the territory around you.</p><p>This is a really important formative experience for many rationalists:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Take ideas seriously enough to notice and care if they fail</li><li>Get smacked in the face with an Obvious But False Belief: your past self couldn't have imagined you were wrong about this, and yet here we are.</li><li>Deeply internalize that one's sense of obviousness <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/fxynfGCSHpY4FmBZy/p/wustx45CPL5rZenuo\"><i>cannot be trusted</i></a>, and that one has to find ways of being way more reliable where it matters.</li></ul><p>(For me the Obvious But False Belief was about religion; for others it was politics, or an academic field, or even their own identity.)</p><hr><p>Now, the dangerous outcome – getting trapped in a dismal swamp, with escape very difficult – comes when you've not seen an undeniable local map failure, so that you never notice (or never have to admit) that the map isn't matching up very well with the territory, until it's too late.</p><p>(I'm thinking of making major life decisions badly, where you don't notice or admit the problem until you're trapped in a situation where every option is a disaster of some sort.)</p><p>Sometimes you really do need to make bold plans based on your beliefs; how can you do so without taking a big risk of ending up in a swamp?</p><p>I suggest that you should ensure things look at least decent, according to a more \"normal\" map, while trying to do very well on yours. That is, make sure that your bold plan fails gracefully if the more normal worldview around you is correct. (Set up your can't-miss startup such that you're back to the grind if it fails, not in debt to the Mob if it fails.)</p><p>And get advice. Always get advice from people you trust and respect, before doing something very uncommon. I could try and fit this into the map framework, but it's just common sense, and way too many good people fail to do it regardless.</p><p>Best of luck adventuring out there!</p>",

If you notice that there are differences between your private intuitions, and what you can publicly acknowledge, this is a system fast versus system slow thing-</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> This is a question of negotiating with yourself. I'm going to present a model and talk about some consequences, but I’ll start with a question: why do people in our sphere tend to burn out or go nuts?</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> This is a pretty important question. I’ll use an analogy many of us have heard before — the elephant and the rider. The conscious mind is the rider and the elephant is the unconscious mind. The rider wants to get somewhere, but the elephant has its own preferences about what happens.</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> Some features of this analogy I think are true and useful for minds, for humans, is that the elephant has these immediate preferences and some longer term needs, just like we have subconscious desires and subconscious needs. The rider has their own preferences and some carrots and sticks, but the real advantage is having a map. The elephant can just completely ignore the rider if its preferences are strong enough. So how this connects to being human is that our subconscious has these desires and needs and fears, and our consciousness may have a little bit of willpower but what it really has is strategy and planning, the ability to pick out a path so that the elephant won't want to deviate from it too much. If you go right by a river, the elephant is going to want to drink. So, if you don't want to stop for that, don't go by the river right now.</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> Finally, the subconscious, the elephant, can just overwhelm you in two ways: one of which is it controls your motivation, so it can burn you out or get you depressed if you're trying to defy it too much. And the second is, it can induce bias.</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> This is the subject of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain\"><i>The Elephant in the Brain</i></a> by Robin Hanson and Kevin Simler, claiming that a lot of motivated reasoning comes when the elephant wants something, the rider doesn't, and the elephant changes the rider's cognition to make the rider feel like it wants that thing (for noble reasons, of course).</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> This would be very bad. Depression is its own thing, but it doesn't change your way of thinking about the world. It doesn't make you go crazy. Going crazy is really bad. Citation — don't need it in this community.</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> What can you do about this? There are a couple of things. First: you can keep the elephant happy. You can choose a path along the map so that the elephant will be reasonably well fed, have enough to drink, not get tired going up and down mountains, etc. And you can still get to a place you'd like to go. Maybe not the place that's absolute best, but good enough.</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> This is analogous to a lot of things in Effective Altruism where I'm telling people, “give yourself permission to be happy”. Don't take a job that's going to make you miserable just because you think it is the best thing to do. Find something that meets you in the middle. I don't recommend living on minimum wage and giving away everything else to charity because you're going to burn out from that, or you're going to come up with some crazy reason why doing something else is better. So just let yourself be happy. 80/20 things.</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> The second thing is about positive versus negative reinforcement. I mentioned carrots versus sticks earlier, and this is really good for also keeping the elephant happy and keeping the elephant liking the rider. There's a wonderful book called <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31052.Don_t_Shoot_the_Dog_\">Don't Shoot the Dog</a>, which is primarily about animal training, but also about interacting with people — and even about interacting with yourself. It talks about achieve things in animal training by rewarding the animal or by punishing the animal. Rewarding the animal, you can get them to do great things. Punishing, you can get them to do some things... but they'll also just want to avoid the trainer. You don't want your subconscious mind to want to avoid your thoughts. It'll make it even harder to find out what's going on with your desires.</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> Finally, real quick, treat the elephant with respect, even if you disagree with it. It's really important for you to be able to say, not \"Your desires are wrong\", but \"I understand why you want that, I want this other thing, let's find common ground.\" And I think those are some of the really important lessons about the elephant and the rider.</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> Thank you.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Cool. Thank you very much, orthonormal.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> I like the emphasis you made on having a respectful dialog with the elephant. You spoke about making the elephant happy. I understand the point you're making. But often my relationship with my elephant, when I try to have an internal dialog, is more about asking what it wants and making a commitment to getting it that thing. And those things are not necessarily happiness. They're sometimes respect, or status, or just commitments to find time for the elephant to do the things it wants, whilst also making agreements to work what the rider wants. Some of those motives are not directly about immediately pleasurable experiences. So I always make that distinction.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Abram has a question.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> Yeah, sometimes I've heard this advice that you should identify with the elephant instead of the rider. It's also a diversity question, you're speaking to people who identify with the rider rather than the elephant but some people identify more with the elephant — or so I've heard. One part of it is normative. Like, maybe we should identify with the elephant instead of the rider? So the question is: what do you have against that, if anything?</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> It would be nice to be unified, but one thing I think is true is that the rider is good at language and the elephant is not. So the part of you that just asked me that question is the rider.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> I guess I have this drug experience where I was high and I completely separated my consciousness and my audio loop. So, my inner dialog did not feel conscious and instead, I felt like I was the consciousness that the inner dialog is talking about. Which doesn't change my day-to-day thinking that much but makes me able to take that framework where it's like words are coming out of my mouth from this thing that's looking at my actual conscious experience. But my conscious experience is not this thing. I don't have conscious access to... Compare how people know grammar without having explicit knowledge of grammar<i> [Editor’s note: </i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptability_judgment_task\"><i><u>source</u></i></a><i>].</i> So it's like there's this grammar thing here that somehow knows grammar and it's looking at my conscious experience and producing words that try to describe my conscious experience but that doesn't mean that my conscious experience is the thing that's... You're sort of not talking to my words, my words are like a special case module. You're interacting with my conscious experience indirectly through my words, but my words are kind of dumb.</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> This is just a hard thing to talk about. I very much believe your experiences and I very much believe that there is something to, through meditation or drugs or whatever, getting more in touch with the non-verbal part of you and having more compassion and connection to that. It's just very complicated to describe in words what that looks and feels like, for obvious reasons.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Thanks, Abram, I appreciate that way of thinking about yourself. I think I will probably meditate on that some more afterwards.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Kamil, do you want to ask a question?</p><p><strong>Kamil: </strong>Yeah I think that this concept looks like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Z9cbwuevS9cqaR96h/cfar-participant-handbook-now-available-to-all\"><u>internal double-crux</u></a>, and if so, my question is, maybe there would be some more sub-personalities, more than just elephant and rider — maybe, some other decision makers in our mind?</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> Absolutely. The elephant/rider is an extremely simplified version of things. Personally I like the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model\"><u>internal family systems</u></a> approach to understanding myself. Again, all of these are metaphor, but metaphors can be very useful. The internal family systems metaphors treat different desires and feelings as different agents, more or less, that can talk to each other. So, whatever metaphor works well for people, I encourage them to use that while being aware that it's a metaphor, and also to experiment with other ways of thinking about themselves.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Cool. Thanks, Kamil, does that sound good to you or do you want to follow up?</p><p><strong>Kamil:</strong> Yeah, thanks. If so, what are the constraints of this model? Of the model of the elephant and the rider?</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> Right. The fundamental constraint for my metaphor, at first, is that the conscious part of the mind, which for me includes the verbal part of the mind, is just less strong than everything else that happens, whether that everything else is unified or an aggregate of other parts.</p><p><strong>Kamil:</strong> Thanks.</p>",

The one disanalogy is that we only run the debate for so many steps—though if we always run to convergence of <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"p_t\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">p</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, in the limit that should imply that any future single manipulation won't change the probability much from that point (since otherwise <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{Adv}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">Adv</span></span></span></span></span></span> should have selected that manipulation instead).</p>\n<h1>Relation to buying truth from a liar</h1>\n<p>In working on this proposal, I discovered that my approach here is actually quite similar to an old proposal by Katja Grace called “<a href=\"https://meteuphoric.com/2014/07/21/how-to-buy-a-truth-from-a-liar/\">How to buy a truth from a liar</a>” for incentivizing a liar to give you true information by rewarding them whenever their information causes you to change your mind. Paul Christiano previously <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/extracting-information-97cd956f2c17\">wrote about what he thought about Katja's proposal</a>, however he eventually concluded that it was untenable due to a non-myopic liar being incentivized to split their information into arbitrarily small chunks to get the most money.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, however, the fact that you need a myopic trader to make something like this work is actually more of a feature than a bug. First, note that the importance of myopia is not unique to this approach. For example, <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fRsjBseRuvRhMPPE5/an-overview-of-11-proposals-for-building-safe-advanced-ai\">imitative amplification</a> also requires myopia lest the model learn to act in such a way that the human consulting it becomes easier to predict. In fact, even RL likely requires per-episode myopia to avoid <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks/deceptive-alignment\">deceptive alignment</a> lest the agent learn to act deceptively in some episodes to ensure deployment and thus get greater reward in others. Thus, it seems to that almost regardless of what approach is taken, at least some form of myopia will be required. Furthermore, the fact that this approach requires per-step myopia rather than per-episode myopia is in my opinion actually a big plus, since I suspect per-step myopia to be an easier condition to enforce than per-episode myopia, as I discuss in more detail below in the “Analysis” section.</p>\n<h1>Handling non-binary questions</h1>\n<p>Previously, I restricted <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"Q\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">Q</span></span></span></span></span></span> to be only a yes-or-no question, which is a pretty big limitation on the above proposal.

Both proposals are trying to estimate a very similar equilibrium in the limit—with the exception that the debate equilibrium only includes the best arguments for the two most convincing positions rather than all potentially convincing arguments. Thus, the equilibrium reached by AI safety via market making should be closer to an actual human reflective equilibrium, as it has to be an equilibrium relative to all possible arguments that <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{Adv}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">Adv</span></span></span></span></span></span> can present, not just the two it thinks will be most persuasive. That being said, AI safety via market making still inherits many of the potential outer alignment issues of debate, including the possibility of deceptive equilibria wherein the human is more convinced by false arguments than true arguments. Hopefully, however, the use of techniques such as cross-examination should help alleviate such issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Inner alignment.</strong> AI safety via market making gets to make use of both the cross-examination with transparency tools approach—which is otherwise unique to debate—as well as the more general relaxed adversarial training approach. Thus, hopefully at least, it should be able to get the inner alignment benefits of both approaches. That being said, AI safety via market making also has to contend with ensuring that two different models—both <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{Adv}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">Adv</span></span></span></span></span></span>—are inner aligned, rather than just a single model as in something like debate or amplification.</p>\n<p>First, let's consider the inner alignment of <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

Compared to debate, we still get to do cross-examination with transparency tools, but now we also get to do per-step myopia verification with <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{Amp}(M)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">Amp</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span> as an overseer.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-KzqHi97ndNqAG6XsE-3\" id=\"fnref-KzqHi97ndNqAG6XsE-3\">[3]</a></sup> Thus, there are two major differences here between AI safety via market making and AI safety via debate: first, we get an overseer—<span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{Amp}(M)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">Amp</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>—and second, we get to do per-step myopia verification rather than per-episode myopia verification. The fact that we have an independent overseer—rather than just relying on the debaters to oversee themselves via cross-examination—is very nice, though it of course also comes with the downside of having to safely train an additional model. Furthermore, it is quite possible to just add an additional overseer on top of the standard debate framework. Thus, in my opinion, the fact that we get to do per-step myopia verification is the largest and most significant inner alignment difference.</p>\n<p>Before I talk about the importance of per-step myopia, it's worth noting that debate is fully compatible with per-episode myopia—in fact, it basically requires it. If a debater is not per-episode myopic, then it will try to maximize its reward across all debates, not just the single debate—the single episode—it's currently in. Such per-episode non-myopic agents can then become <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks/deceptive-alignment\">deceptively aligned</a>, as they might choose to act deceptively during training in order to defect during deployment. Per-episode myopia, however, rules this out. Unfortunately, in my opinion, per-episode myopia seems like a very difficult condition to enforce—once your agents are running multi-step optimization algorithms, how do you tell whether that optimization passes through the episode boundary or not? Enforcing per-step myopia, on the other hand, just requires detecting the <em>existence</em> of multi-step optimization, rather than its extent, which seems considerably easier. Thus, since AI safety via market making is fully compatible with per-step myopia verification, it could be significantly easier to prevent the development of deceptive alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Training competitiveness.</strong> It seems quite likely to me that both <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{Adv}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">Adv</span></span></span></span></span></span> can be trained competitively via language model fine-tuning, however exactly how effective such training would be is currently unclear. Ideally, training via this procedure should produce an <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span></span></span></span> which is relatively better than the original language model at predicting what a human will think after seeing relevant arguments and is thus more helpful than the original language model. Testing this hypothesis by actually performing experiments seem likely to be highly valuable in shedding light on the training competitiveness properties of AI safety via market making.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance competitiveness.</strong> Performance competitiveness here seems likely to depend on exactly how useful getting access to human reflective equilibria actually is. Similarly to AI safety via debate or amplification, AI safety via market making produces a question-answering system rather than a fully general agent. That being said, if the primary use cases for advanced AI are all highly cognitive language and decision-making tasks—e.g. helping CEOs or AI researchers—rather than, for example, fine motor control, then a question-answering system should be entirely sufficient. Furthermore, compared to AI safety via debate, AI safety via market making seems likely to be at least as performance competitive for the same reason as it seems likely to be at least as outer aligned—the equilibria found by AI safety via market making should include all potentially convincing arguments, including those that would be made in a two-player debate as well as those that wouldn't.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-KzqHi97ndNqAG6XsE-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This is actually the second debate-based proposal I've drafted up recently—the previous of which was in “<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dJSD5RK6Qoidb3QY5/synthesizing-amplification-and-debate\">Synthesizing amplification and debate</a>.” A potentially interesting future research direction could be to figure out how to properly combine the two. <a href=\"#fnref-KzqHi97ndNqAG6XsE-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-KzqHi97ndNqAG6XsE-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Note that pure prediction is not inherently myopic—since the truth of <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s predictions can depend on its own output—but can be myopic while still producing good predictions if <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.081em;\">M</span></span></span></span></span></span> behaves like a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yAiqLmLFxvyANSfs2/counterfactual-oracles-online-supervised-learning-with\">counterfactual oracle</a> rather than a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/SwcyMEgLyd4C3Dern/the-parable-of-predict-o-matic\">Predict-O-Matic</a>.

Vaniver is responsible for the talk, jacobjacob is responsible for the transcription)</em></p><p><br><strong>Ben Pace: </strong>Thank you everyone very much for coming. All 41 of us. This is a LessWrong event. So it is less wrong than your normal events. Jacob and I wanted to try out some online events, see what was fun. We pinged a bunch of the curated authors who write great stuff and said, &quot;Do you also want to give a short talk?&quot; And a bunch of them were like, &quot;Oh that sounds nice, to actually see the people who read my stuff, rather than just imagining them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> So, we&apos;re going to have five minute talks. I&apos;ll keep time. And then we&apos;ll have some Q&amp;A afterwards, maximum 10 minutes but shorter. And there&apos;s going to be five talks. Vaniver, if you&apos;d like to begin?<br> </p><h2>Talk</h2><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Cool! Hi, I&apos;m Vaniver. The thing I&apos;m going to be talking about is <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zbf2L4ZJf4ykZqmPA/public-positions-and-private-guts\">Public Positions and Private Guts</a></u>, a blog post that I wrote a while ago that got curated. It&apos;s originally due to a series of talks given by Anna Salamon at some workshops.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> So, what is this about? Why do we care?</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Well, there&apos;s some things that happen sometimes, like start-up founders who have an idea that they strongly anticipate will work, but they can&apos;t explain it to other people, they can&apos;t prove that the thing will work. If they could prove it, it wouldn&apos;t be a start-up anymore, it would already be some mature business somewhere.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Similarly, you will run across people who are PhD students who have this logical, airtight argument that they should get their PhD, and yet they&apos;re mysteriously uninterested in doing any work on their dissertation. And so there&apos;s this question of, what&apos;s up with that? Why isn&apos;t there this one map of the world that goes both ways?</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> So there are these two clusters of knowledge. I&apos;m going to talk first about a sort of communication, that I think defines these clusters. For that I&apos;m going to talk a bit about formal communication. Basically, in philosophy, there&apos;s this model of how people talk to each other; you have a shared context where both the speaker and the audience know all the things in the shared context. The speaker will add additional facts, one at a time (like maybe I&apos;ve observed a thing that people don&apos;t know about yet). And, also, logical facts count; if there&apos;s, A in the context and also &quot;if A, then B&quot;, asserting B is a thing that might not have been in the context yet because the audience isn&apos;t logically omniscient.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> And so, one of the facts about this process is, if each of these observations doesn&apos;t contradict the things that&apos;s already in the shared context, and is trivially checkable in this one step, you can end up believing the things that come out at the end, much like a math proof and that sort of thing, at least as much as you trust the context that you started off with.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> And so an interesting fact about the sort of things you can fit into this communication style is they all have to be easily justifiable. If I have a point that I want to get across that requires five different complicated arguments to support it, unless I can go through each one of these complicated arguments in a serial fashion, you&apos;re not going to be able to build this thing using this formal communication style.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> And so, Public Positions are these sorts of beliefs that have been optimized for justifiability or presentation. The PhD student that has this logical argument that they have worked through with other people on why they should get their PhD, they have this public position, they have this formal communication to back it up.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Private Guts, in contrast to this, they&apos;re not mutually exclusive to Public Positions, but they&apos;re defined in a different way for a different purpose. They&apos;re trying to actually anticipate things about the future. And they come from the actual historical causes of the belief. So, for example, this PhD student might historically want the PhD because their family always respected education, and when they think about quitting the PhD, they can&apos;t do it because that would mean they&apos;re a &#x201C;quitter&#x201D;.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> When you think about training a neural network to recognize pictures of dogs and cats, it will use lots of little pieces of information to come to its conclusion, in a way that&apos;s opaque and difficult to understand because it&apos;s not optimizing at all for understandability, it&apos;s just optimizing for the success metric of, did it correctly anticipate the thing or not?</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> And so, the startup founder&apos;s complicated reason for believing that their startup will work comes from this sort of thing. There&apos;s lots of little pieces that all fit together in their mind, but they can&apos;t easily explain it or else this would be a widespread belief that the startup would work.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> So, anyway, a lot of CFAR related things relate to how to build bridges between these two sorts of things so that people who are convinced of something through a logical argument also end up feeling it in their guts. And also, people who feel a thing in their guts, that they don&apos;t have this formal position for, are able to figure out how to draw out these many small pieces of data and construct something that&apos;s reasonable and articulable.<br> </p><h2>Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> All right, that&apos;s five minutes. It sounded like actually you maybe just naturally stopped?</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Just under the wire.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Cool, cool. Thanks. So the PhD guy has a bunch of formal arguments but not private guts for why he should do the thing, and he&apos;s having a hard time translating between those, and trying to have the formal argument inform his private guts. And similarly, the startup guy is having a hard time naturally turning the private guts into a formalized argument. That was what you said? That was accurate?</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Yeah, I think that&apos;s my take on those examples. I tried to come up with examples that were a little different from the original historical cause of this talk; which is something like, <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/byewoxJiAfwE6zpep/reality-revealing-and-reality-masking-puzzles\">many people who would take AI safety seriously with their speech but not with their actual actions</a></u>. And there&apos;s this question of, well why is that? And it&apos;s like, oh it&apos;s because they don&apos;t feel it coming for real, in the same way they might feel climate change is coming for real, or something.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Yeah. Patrick, would you like to ask a question?</p><p><strong>Patrick LaVictoire:</strong> Building on this, I have something to say about how to model the internal experience of this happening and what you can do about it. But I think, instead of a comment, I&apos;m going to talk for five minutes about it and mention that your point is relevant to mine.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Cool!</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Sounds good. How does it tend to look when people successfully turn their private guts into formal arguments?</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Yeah, so I think part of this is coming up with communication styles that aren&apos;t so much formal communication. One thing that has grown more popular over the last few years is this idea of doing <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement\">double-crux</a></u>, where you and another person will both try and look at your actual belief system and say &#x201C;this is the thing that would change my mind about this subject that we disagree on&#x201D;, and you jointly explore this together.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> It&apos;s interesting because when you watch a public debate, often you&apos;ll find the things that are said are designed to convince you, the audience, or be broadly applicable. But when you watch a double-crux, this is the opposite of what they&apos;re doing. They&apos;re trying to focus, laser-like, on what do I, Vaniver, care about in this issue? Even if only two percent of the audience cares about this particular part of the issue, it&apos;s the bit that&apos;s crux-y for me.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> So I think there&apos;s a way in which formal communication does actually limit the sort of things you can believe. In the same way that being relentlessly empirical about the world, instead of theoretical, means that you can only believe things that you&apos;ve already seen happen in the past instead of also believing in things that you predict will happen in the future.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Yeah, that makes sense. I&apos;m just curious, have you also seen examples of people turning the explicit formal arguments into their private guts, and what that&apos;s felt like?</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Yeah. I think I&apos;ve seen some examples of that. The first thing that comes to mind is actually Robin Hanson&apos;s construal level theory and the whole near/far distinction. I think just having that in my mental vocabulary, at least, it&apos;s been much easier to see what sort of beliefs do I have that are just the color of my banners, or something, versus what beliefs do I have that are actually about anticipating the future.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> When I&apos;ve come across something that matters to a lot of different facts of my life, like where I live, and I&apos;m like, oh wait there&apos;s this sort of home-town bias thing going on here where living in this place is great because it&apos;s the place I live in. Seeing that sort of thing can help me switch to near mode and do much more of the &#x201C;what are the actual factors that should matter here? Are my guts linked up with the thing they should be linked up with?&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Oh, a comment from Dennis, which I think is a solid question about how this relates to Kahneman&#x2019;s System 1 / System 2. I think people often think of System 1 as the implicit one that has all the gears that are not easily accessible to my conscious brain; my System 2 is this sensible, explicit reasoner who justifies his thoughts or something.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Yeah, so I think they&apos;re related... I&apos;m always a little hesitant to say if something is System 1 or is System 2 because it&apos;s this technical concept from psychology that I&apos;m wary about getting wrong. But I do think there&apos;s a way in which both System 1 and System 2 would be part of the private guts, where many of your System 2 things, they&apos;re deliberative, they&apos;re slow, but they&apos;re not necessarily optimized for justification.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Similarly, when you look at public positions, I think the mode of it which I talked about, which is very much formal communication-esque, is very much this System 2 things of, here&apos;s my deliberative reasons for the position. But I think there&apos;s an aspect to public positions which is understanding the lay of the land, knowing what the shared context is, knowing what things will and won&apos;t get you attacked or you will or won&apos;t have to justify. And that one feels like it&apos;s often very immediate and reactive and intuitive, and the various other things that people say about System 1.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> I think there&apos;s a big overlap, but there&apos;s also some bits on the diagonals.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> That makes sense, yeah. Thanks very much, Vaniver. We&apos;ll move onto the next one for now.</p>",

Abram Demski is responsible for the talk, Ben Pace is responsible for the transcription)</i></p><h2>Talk</h2><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> I want to talk about this idea that, for me, is an update from the logical induction result that came out of MIRI a while ago. I feel like it's an update that I wish the entire LessWrong community had gotten from logical induction but it wasn't communicated that well, or it's a subtle point or something.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski: </strong>But hopefully, this talk isn't going to require any knowledge of logical induction from you guys. I'm actually going to talk about it in terms of philosophers who had a very similar update starting around, I think, the '80s.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> There's this philosophy called 'radical probabilism' which is more or less the same insight that you can get from thinking about logical induction. Radical probabilism is spearheaded by this guy Richard Jeffrey who I also like separately for the Jeffrey-Bolker axioms which I've written about on LessWrong.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski: </strong>But, after the Jeffrey-Bolker axioms he was like, well, we need to revise Bayesianism even more radically than that. Specifically he zeroed in on the consequences of Dutch book arguments. So, the Dutch book arguments which are for the Kolmogorov axioms, or alternatively the Jeffrey-Bolker axioms, are pretty solid. However, you may not immediately realize that this does not imply that Bayes' rule should be an update rule.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> You have Bayes' rule as a fact about your static probabilities, that's fine. As a fact about conditional probabilities, Bayes' rule is just as solid as all the other probability rules. But for some reason, Bayesians take it that you start with these probabilities, you make an observation, and then you have now these probabilities. These probabilities should be updated by Bayes' rule. And the argument for that is not super solid.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> There are two important flaws with the argument which I want to highlight. There is a Dutch book argument for using Bayes' rule to update your probabilities, but it makes two critical assumptions which Jeffrey wants to relax. Assumption one is that updates are always and precisely accounted for by propositions which you learn, and everything that you learn and moves your probabilities is accounted for in this proposition. These are usually thought of as sensory data. Jeffrey said, wait a minute, my sensory data isn't so certain. When I see something, we don't have perfect introspective access to even just our visual field. It's not like we get a pixel array and know exactly how everything is. So, I want to treat the things that I'm updating on as, themselves, uncertain.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> Difficulty two with the Dutch book argument for Bayes' rule as an update rule, is that it assumes you know already how you would update, hypothetically, given different propositions you might observe. Then, given that assumption, you can get this argument that you need to use Bayes' rule. Because I can Dutch-book you based on my knowledge of how you're going to update. But if I don't know how you're updating, if your update has some random element, subjectively random, if I can't predict it, then we get this radical treatment of how you're updating. We get this picture where you believe things one day and then you can just believe different things the next day. And there's no Dutch book I can make to say you’re irrational for doing that. “I've thought about it more and I've changed my mind.”</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> This is very important for logical uncertainty (which Jeffrey didn't realize because he wasn't thinking about logical uncertainty). That's why we came up with this philosophy, thinking about logical uncertainty. But Jeffrey came up with it just by thinking about the foundations and what we can argue a rational agent must be.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> So, that's the update I want to convey. I want to convey that Bayes' rule is not the only way that a rational agent can update. You have this great freedom of how you update.</p><h2>Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Thank you very much, Abram. You timed yourself excellently.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> As I understand it, you need to have inexploitability in your belief updates and so on, such that people cannot reliably Dutch book you?</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> Yeah. I say radical freedom meaning, if you have belief X one day and you have beliefs Y the next day, any pair of X and Y are justifiable, or potentially rational (as long as you don't take something that has probability zero and now give it positive probability or something like that).</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> There are rationality constraints. It's not that you can do anything at all. The most concrete example of this is that you can't change your mind back and forth forever on any one proposition, because then I can money-pump you. Because I know, eventually, your beliefs are going to drift up, which means I can buy low and eventually your beliefs will drift up and then I can sell the bet back to you because now you're like, \"That's a bad bet,\" and then I've made money off of you.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> If I can predict anything about how your beliefs are going to drift, then you're in trouble. I can make money off of you by buying low and selling high. In particular that means you can't oscillate forever, you have to eventually converge. And there's lots of other implications.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> But I can't summarize this in any nice rule is the thing. There's just a bunch of rationality constraints that come from non-Dutch-book-ability. But there’s no nice summary of it. There's just a bunch of constraints.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> I'm somewhat surprised and shocked. So, I shouldn't be able to be exploited in any obvious way, but this doesn't constrain me to the level of Bayes' rule. It doesn't constrain me to clearly knowing how my updates will be affected by future evidence.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> Right. If you do know your updates, then you're constrained. He calls that the rigidity condition. And even that doesn't imply Bayes' rule, because of the first problem that I mentioned. So, if you do know how you're going to update, then you don't want to change your conditional probabilities as a result of observing something, but you can still have these uncertain observations where you move a probability but only partially. And this is called a Jeffrey update.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Phil Hazelden has a question. Phil, do you want to ask your question?</p><p><strong>Phil Hazelden:</strong> Yeah. So, you said if you don't know how you'd update on an observation, then you get pure constraints on your belief update. I'm wondering, if someone else knows how you'd update on an observation but you don't, does that for example, give them the power to extract money from you?</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> Yeah, so if somebody else knows, then they can extract money if you're not at least doing a Jeffrey update. In general, if a bookie knows something that you don't, then a bookie can extract money from you by making bets. So this is not a proper Dutch book argument, because what we mean by a Dutch book argument is that a totally ignorant bookie can extract money.</p><p><strong>Phil Hazelden:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> I would have expected that if I was constrained to not be exploitable then this would have resulted in Bayes' rule, but you're saying all it actually means is there are some very basic arguments about how you shouldn't be exploited but otherwise you can move very freely between. You can update upwards on Monday, down on Tuesday, down again on Wednesday, up on Thursday and then stay there and as long as I can’t predict it in advance, you get to do whatever the hell you like with your beliefs.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> Yep, and that's rational in the sense that I think rational should mean.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> I do sometimes use Bayes' rule in arguments. In fact, I've done it not-irregularly. Do you expect, if I fully propagate this argument I will stop using Bayes' rule in arguments? I feel it's very helpful for me to be able to say, all right, I was believing X on Monday and not-X on Wednesday, and let me show you the shape of my update that I made using certain probabilistic updates.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> Yeah, so I think that if you propagate this update you'll notice cases where your shift simply cannot be accounted for as Bayes' rule. But, this rigidity condition, the condition of “I already know how I would update hypothetically on various pieces of information”, the way Jeffrey talks about this (or at least the way some Jeffrey-interpreters talk about this), it's like: if you have considered this question ahead of time, of how you would update on this particular piece of information, then your update had better be either a Bayes' update or at least a Jeffrey update. In the cases where you think about it, it has this narrowing effect where you do indeed have to be looking more like Bayes.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> As an example of something that's non-Bayesian that you might become more comfortable with if you fully propagate this: you can notice that something is amiss with your model because the evidence is less probable than you would have expected, without having an alternative that you're updating towards. You update down your model without updating it down because of normalization constraints of updating something else up. \"I'm less confident in this model now.\" And somebody asks what Bayesian update did you do, and I'm like \"No, it's not a Bayesian update, it's just that this model seems shakier.\".</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> It’s like the thing where I have four possible hypotheses here, X, Y, Z, and “I do not have a good hypothesis here yet”. And sometimes I just move probability into “the hypothesis is not yet in my space of considerations”.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> But it's like, how do you do that if “I don't have a good hypothesis” doesn't make any predictions?</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Interesting. Thanks, Abram.</p></body></html>",

Like all good rationality techniques, this one is going to start off with a Sherlock Holmes anecdote.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> So, Holmes and Watson are hired by some rich guy, because he has this barn where he keeps all his animals, his horse and his dogs and his sheep, and he knows that someone's been sneaking in there at night and messing with his prized race horse. So there's two entrances where the guy can get in. And Holmes and Watson think they've gotten the entrance the intruder is using, so they stay up all night. They don't hear anything, but when they check the next morning, someone has gotten in and messed with the horse.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> So they know two things. One: the intruder must be using the other entrance. Two: Holmes says to Watson, \"I think there's something else we should be considering here, which is the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.\" And Watson says, \"Holmes, what are you talking about? The dog did nothing in the nighttime.\" And Holmes says, \"Yes, that was the curious incident.\" Because he's put together that the dogs in the stable would have barked if the stranger had come in and just messed with them. So the intruder must have been someone the dogs knew. And that is the deduction he can make from that.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> So, this is what I'm calling the 'Missing Dog' — when you can learn something interesting from the fact that something isn't there. You might call it&nbsp;'a conspicuous absence'.</p><figure><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_120 120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_240 240w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_360 360w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_480 480w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_720 720w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_840 840w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_960 960w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_1080 1080w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/3aec6bb524a6454725a9c89f5209b2309066fe6a7ab42ee1.png/w_1187 1187w\"><figcaption><i>Missing dog, drawn by eukaryote</i></figcaption></figure><p><strong>eukaryote: </strong>That’s the image I spent several minutes drawing last night, so I'm going to make you look at it.</p><figure><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FMVL_eJTMdHWEk1XaBxyUGPnfr6ubKDi1YGSdiVv4HIWASSkyPoc0A0-quWeI0JFPXHaWnjBInkxwNCSKcJ2POz5yTbBbNNek5H_rgkx2O99678p-Edu524zALpLyoUH8SYcLEBZ\"></figure><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> Here are a couple of other examples. <a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf\"><u>The Fermi paradox</u></a> is a really big one. Taking a few basic axioms: we think life forms on its own, we know there are billions of stars out there... where is everyone? We don't know but that's a really interesting question, the kind of question that defines a species, in my opinion.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> And then there's some other instances where... for example, people who are blind at birth. We've never found a person who was blind at birth who also has schizophrenia, which is statistically very improbable that this would have never happened. So we learn some interesting things about how we think schizophrenia might develop in the brain.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> Or how whales, despite having millions of times the number of individual cells that mice have, don't seem to get cancer much more often than mice. Which is weird. That tells us something interesting about cells and how cancer works.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> This has shown up in a couple of research projects which I'll talk more about, if someone wants. But I think the point is that this is a pretty useful tool to keep in mind. So, okay, if you're trying to use this, something to note, I think this usually generates questions, not answers. So it's a way of exploring models more than directly getting to something.</p><figure><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ew827kYbZLYMHUL3E15EPeM9Mf2Qkjx15NCAmpGp_9UerRhcbraHTFGTuZoe2esfk_XMpVKoNcGqvOTGwTaOa-MN2n8LeRKfNL_wbMV-BLkPL3j8jqHhKGBldGQDGA7-nSYDIknv\"></figure><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> And then, if you were trying to think about where these show up in relation to a topic, well the problem is that they're kind of hard to notice. You might try assuming that there is something you're missing like that, and just asking yourself from basic principles what that might be. I'm not really certain... I have run into cases where people have asserted that we just don't know or, the fact that these examples are missing tells us something interesting, doesn't it? And then I looked and there actually were examples of it, the people just didn't know what they were talking about.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> So, if you think you find a missing dog, first check that the dog is actually not there – it may just be very quiet. Once you've done that, I can't really give you that much of a road map, but I think the next thing to do is to try to pin down why you think it's unexpected. Often when I've done this, I've found that my guess about what was going on, or the model of the situation was actually extremely simple. But don't stop there because I've also found that this is sort of an unusual mode of thinking and even if your really simple model shows up with a big problem, or shows up with this strange question in it, often that is just still not accounted for, even if it seems like I may not know anything about this if I don't understand what's going on here. You might not and then you will know something interesting about the situation from finding that out. Or you might just be onto a new unanswered question. That can happen too.</p><h2>Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Thank you very much. You were successfully under the five minute limit.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Jacob, you had a question?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jacob Lagerros:</strong> Yeah, I'm pretty curious about the slide with all the examples you didn’t cover. Something about insects and why aren’t we dead.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> Oh, got you. These are blog posts I've written which I will just run over in the two sentence version and how they relate to this.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> Yeah, so insect extinctions, there's a fact that is going around that recent studies have found, in really wild locations, that insect biomass has dropped by 98 percent over the last, let's say 50 years. There have been a few different studies, all of which show pretty similar results. People are like, oh no we're destroying the environment, we're going to die. And like, maybe. I was thinking, I feel like if you told me that as a teenager that in 10 years there will be 90 percent of the insects will be gone, then I would be like, oh my god, we are dead, this is the end of civilization, I should just start drinking and not go to college right now because clearly we're not getting anywhere. And yet, society seems to be going along pretty fine. Just based on what I knew about insects, that seemed completely impossible to me.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> So I still don't know why that is, but I found out some interesting stuff about it, and I don't think anyone else has a good answer to that question also.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> The Germy paradox is... so I spent the two years doing a masters in biodefense and learning about bioweapons and oh no, it's so easy, anyone can go to a lab and just create smallpox or it's real easy to get anthrax or whatever. And I think, okay, there have been a small number of attempted instances of bio-terrorism. There have been these huge weapons programs, and yet no one has actually used a bio weapon as a tool of war against another country since the 1940s approximately,. Whatever — the point is, it's super rare. So if these really are so cheap and deadly, and easy to make, where are they? That's the Germy paradox. And I wrote a many-page sequence about it that you can read if you want.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> Now I feel like I understand why we have not seen those things. So that's the summary there.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Interesting. Thank you very much. Anna, do you want to ask a question?</p><p><strong>Anna T: </strong>Yeah! Hi, I was curious, eukaryote, you mentioned that sometimes you might think that you're seeing a missing dog situation but it is, as you said, a very quiet dog. Do you have any examples of that kind of thing?</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> So, I really enjoy thinking about cheery and uplifting topics in my free time, another thing I've heard passed about, biological-esque risk, is that a disease can't kill off a species. We just don't have examples of that. Species don't die from that. So, we don't need to worry about this as a species, and these diseases will never evolve naturally, blah blah blah, we're fine. And I'm like, wait, hang on... and I checked and there are actually dozens of examples of diseases killing off a species. Not on the scale that we should necessarily worry about it. It's a whole thing. Whatever. But in that case, those people just hadn't done the research. That was their quiet dog.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Cool, cool. orthonormal, do you want to ask a question?</p><p><strong>orthonormal:</strong> So, have you thought about adversarial reasoning as a way to bring these out? I've heard, and you're the biologist here, that the one useful bi-product of creationism has been coming up with a few missing dogs for biologists to look at.</p><p><strong>eukaryote:</strong> Oh, I love it! Yeah that seems super fruitful and I’ve not thought in depth about how to do it. I gave some examples about ways of doing this with yourself, but if you can find a willing partner or just someone who disagrees with what you say and you can fight them about it, that seems pretty good. I haven't thought too much about it. But, yeah, seems fruitful.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> All right, thanks a lot, eukaryote.</p>",

Even if you study the leading edge of contemporary morality and do everything right according to that philosophy, you are not doing enough. The future is coming, and it will judge you for your failures. We must do better.</p><p>This may sound extreme, but it is self-evidently true in hindsight. Pick any historical figure you want. No matter their moral stature during their lifetime, today we find something to judge. George Washington <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_and_slavery\">owned slaves</a>. Abraham Lincoln, despite abolishing slavery in the United States, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-lincoln-racism-equality-oppose/\">opposed black suffrage and inter-racial marriage</a>.

It&#x2019;s almost natural that somebody who lived long ago would violate our present day ethical standards. But from the moral perspective, this is an explanation, not an excuse; these people are still responsible for the harm their actions caused. They are not to be counted as &#x201C;good people&#x201D;.</p><p>It&#x2019;s tempting to believe that today is different; that if you are sufficiently ethical, sufficiently good, sufficiently &#x201C;woke&#x201D; by today&#x2019;s standards, that you have reached some kind of moral acceptability. But there is no reason to believe this is true. The trend of moral progress has been accelerating, and shows no signs of slowing down. It took hundreds of years after his death before Washington became persona non grata. MLK took about fifty. JK Rowling isn&#x2019;t even dead yet, and <a href=\"https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/\">beliefs</a> that would have put her at the liberal edge of the feminist movement thirty years ago are now earning <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2020/06/23/harry-potter-stars--fan-community-reject-jk-rowlings-statement-on-trans-activism-and-gender-identity/#7c818f7d295d\">widespread condemnation</a>. Moral progress doesn&#x2019;t just stop because it&#x2019;s 2020. This trend will keep accelerating.</p><p>All of this means that looking at the bleeding edge of today&#x2019;s moral thought and saying &#x201C;I&#x2019;m living my life this way, I must be doing OK&#x201D; is <em>not enough</em>. Anybody who does this will be left behind; in a few decades, your actions today will be recognized as unethical. The fact that you lived according to today&#x2019;s ethical views will explain your failings, but not excuse them. Thus, in order to be truly good people, we must take an active role, predict the future of moral progress, and <em>live by tomorrow&#x2019;s rules, today.</em></p><p>Anything else is not enough.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Book review: Black Death at the Golden Gate: The Race to Save America\nfrom the Bubonic Plague, by David K. Randall.</p>\n<p>Imagine a story about an epidemic that reached San Francisco, after\ndevastating parts of China. A few cases are detected, there's\nuncertainty about how long it's been spreading undetected, and a small\nnumber of worried public health officials try to mobilize the city to\nstop an imminent explosion of disease. Nobody knows how fast it's\nspreading, and experts only have weak guesses about the mechanism of\ntransmission. News media and politicians react by trying to suppress\nthose nasty rumors which threaten the city's economy.</p>\n<p>Sounds too familiar?</p>\n<p>The story is about a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_plague_of_1900%E2%80%931904\">bubonic plague\noutbreak</a>\nthat started in 1900. It happens shortly after the dawn of the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218224/\">Great\nSanitary Awakening</a>, when\nthe germ theory of disease is fairly controversial. A few experts in the\nnew-fangled field of bacteriology have advanced the radical new claim\nthat rats have some sort of connection to the spread of the plague, and\none has proposed that the connection involves fleas transmitting the\ninfection through bites. But the evidence isn't yet strong enough to\nwidely displace the standard hypothesis that the disease is caused by\nfilth.</p>\n<p>There was a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldemar_Haffkine#Anti-plague_vaccine\">vaccine</a>\nfor the bubonic plague, which maybe helped a bit. It was only 50%\neffective, the benefits lasted about 6 months, and the side effects\nsound like cruel and unusual punishment. It was controversial and often\nresisted, much like the compulsory smallpox vaccinations of the time.</p>\n<p>Yet the plague didn't seem to know that it was supposed to grow at\nexponential rates. That left an eerie sense of mystery about how the\nplague could linger for years, with people continuing to disagree about\nwhether it existed.</p>\n<h3>1.</h3>\n<p>I'm unsure whether to classify the book as history or as historical\nfiction.</p>\n<p>If I had been led to expect that this was a work of fiction, I would\nonly have noticed a few hints that it's based on actual events. The most\nobvious hint is that the person who initially looks like the story's\nhero gives up and drops out of sight about 40% of the way in, and is\nreplaced by a totally new character. Yet in spite of the fiction-like\nstyle, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_plague_of_1900%E2%80%931904\">Wikipedia\nconfirms</a>\nmany key claims, and doesn't appear to contradict any of it.</p>\n<p>The story is simultaneously depressing and encouraging, because it\ndemonstrates that a society which is manifestly less competent than the\nSan Francisco (or New York, or Tulsa) of today can grow into an arguably\ngreat society in a generation or so. Maybe even Brazil can recover from\nbeing a disaster area.</p>\n<p>Randall convinced me that Donald Trump is much less of an outlier than I\nhad previously thought (I'm talking mostly about Trump's personality,\nand his management style, or lack thereof). However, I wonder if some of\nRandall's portrayal of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage\">Governor\nGage</a> is slanted so as to\nemphasize the similarities between Trump and the thoroughly discredited\nGage.</p>\n<h3>2.</h3>\n<p>One large difference from today is that there was almost no controversy\nabout racism. There was a near-consensus in support of racism. The\nexperts who didn't hesitate to impose race-based quarantines seem more\nsensible and less racist than their main opponents, who believed that\nthe white race is sufficiently superior that they needn't worry about\ncontracting the disease. Note that the quarantines weren't always as\npolite as a Wuhan-style lockdown.</p>\n<p>The book argues that the lone non-racist (or at least not blatantly\nracist) person with any power saved many lives by treating the Chinese\nwith respect. There's likely some truth to that, but the situation was\nmessy enough to leave a fair amount of doubt - mostly, it took threats\nof quarantines in order to accomplish much.</p>\n<p>Randall neglects to mention a downside of the campaign for improved\nsanitation. Many wood buildings were replaced with more rat-resistant\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreinforced_masonry_building\">brick\nbuildings</a>,\njust in time to wreak havoc in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake\">1906\nearthquake</a>\n(bricks fall more often, and farther from buildings, than wood, and\nfalling bricks kill).</p>\n<p>The earthquake triggered conditions under which the plague thrived in\nareas outside of Chinatown, while Chinatown retained some of the\nbenefits of the sanitation-oriented reconstruction. I presume it's just\na coincidence that officials became substantially more eager to combat\nthe plague when it hit wealthy neighborhoods, just as it's a coincidence\ninterest in COVID-19 declined when it faded from wealthier areas.</p>\n<h3>3.</h3>\n<p>Conspiracy theorists will be glad to point out the example of a massive\nconspiracy of influential people that succeeded in mostly covering up\nthe epidemic for something like a year. However, it appears to have been\nmuch less organized or centrally directed than conspiracy theorists want\nto imagine.</p>\n<p>Could such a conspiracy succeed today? It would be much harder. The\npress in 1900 was mostly a cartel that was in the pocket of other\nbusinesses. Today, the internet has succeeded in making the news media\nmuch more democratic, so that there's much fiercer competition between\nvarious ideological biases about which ideas to suppress. But it does\nsound like there was a pretty widespread consensus among Californians\nthat any reports of the plague should be denied. So even if today's\npress had existed in 1900, it seems somewhat plausible that most readers\nwould still have been unaware of the plague.</p>\n<p>I can sort of imagine that we're currently experiencing situations where\nboth the left and the right unite enough to mostly hide something\nimportant.</p>\n<p>Could there currently be under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths in hopes of\nreopening the country? In 1900, doctors had plenty of discretion about\nhow they listed causes of death, and were reportedly scared to list\nplague as a cause, due to pressure from people who feared quarantines.</p>\n<p>Could the same thing be happening this month? I don't see any evidence\nthat it has happened yet, but there are signs that plenty of people\nwould like it to happen. Before reading Black Death, I would have felt\nconfident that there were still enough people who cared about their\npersonal risk of getting the virus to prevent such a conspiracy. It\nstill seems far-fetched, but I'm now wondering how hard it would be to\ndetect by looking at excess death numbers.</p>\n<h3>4.</h3>\n<p>How does this book influence my forecast for the current pandemic?</p>\n<p>I've updated slightly in the direction of society's response being\ncontrolled by elites. I've updated more strongly in the direction of\nresponses depending on pressure from other states / countries.</p>\n<p>There's a moderate chance that overflowing hospitals in July will cause\ninfluential people in the sunbelt to react strongly, so that hospitals\nwill be safe for them to visit. That's a difference from 1900, since\nback then influential people wouldn't stoop to being treated in a\nhospital.</p>\n<p>There will be a medium amount of pressure for more restrictions when the\nelites notice that tourists from China, Mongolia, Senegal, etc., can\nvacation in the EU, Thailand, and New Zealand, but US tourists are\nunwelcome. I'm unclear whether that pressure will be sufficient to have\nmuch effect.</p>\n<p>Quarantines of US goods will also have some effect, but the shortage of\nevidence implicating transmission via surfaces will keep those\nquarantines fairly sporadic, so they probably won't be very effective.</p>\n<p>Travel restrictions between US states might put pressure on the worst\nstates, but I'm unclear whether those will be enforced.</p>\n<p>All of these factors will cause a moderate increase in elites scaring\nvoters into supporting more restrictions of some sort, plus better\ntesting and tracing, sometime during the next few months.</p>\n<p>I'm unclear on whether further nursing home tragedies will cause much\noutrage, even though I expect some more avoidable deaths there.</p>\n<p>Trump will likely lose the election and be considered somewhat\ndisgraced, but it will likely be less of a landslide than pundits will\npredict, and more quickly forgotten.</p>\n<p>The world will continue to under-prepare for pandemics, in spite of the\ngeneral tendency to fight the last war. Invisible mindless enemies seem\nnot to generate much of a warlike response.</p>\n<p>The pandemic won't prevent the world from prospering. As to how many it\nwill kill, that will be influenced more than I previously expected by\nluck.</p>\n<p>There will also be a good deal of luck involved in whether public health\nofficials get rewarded when they do things right.</p>\n<p>Don't forget that the bubonic plague hasn't been fully eradicated in the\nUS. Have a nice day.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Consider this toy model:</p><p>An institution, such as a firm, an association or a state, is formed.</p><p>It works well in the beginning. It encounters different problems and solves them the best it can.</p><p>At some point though a small problem arises that happens to be a suboptimal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium\">Nash equilibrium</a>: None of the stakeholders can do better by trying to solve it on their own. Such problems are, almost by definition, unsolvable.</p><p>Thus the problem persists. It's an annoyance, but it's not a big deal. The institution is still working well and you definitely don't want to get rid of it just because it's not perfect.</p><p>As the time goes on, such problems accumulate. They also tend to have unpleasant consequences: If such a problem makes particular medical treatment unavailable, it incentivizes the patients to bribe the doctors and the doctors to break the law and administer the treatment anyway. Now, in addition to malfunctioning medical system, you have a problem with corruption.</p><p>After on time the institution accumulates so many suboptimal Nash equilibria that it barely works at all.</p><p>The traditional solution to this problem is internal strife, civil war or revolution. It eventually destroys the institution and, if everything goes well, replaces it with a different one where at least the most blatant problems are fixed.</p><p>War or revoulution is not a desirable outcome though: In addition to the human suffering, it also tends to replace the people in power. But the people in power don't like to be replaced and so they will try to prevent it.</p><p>One manoevre they can use is to introduce planned institutional death: Every now and then the institution would be dismantled and created anew, without having to resort to a war or revolution.</p><p>Here's an example: The credit system tends to be one big suboptimal Nash equilibrium in itself. Compound interest grows the size of the debt like crazy and unless there's a way to limit the harm it'll destroy people and business and eventually the entire economy. Even lenders would be hurt, but none of them has a reason to mitigate the problem. They could, in theory, forgive the debt for the sake of keeping the economy afloat, but that would put them in disadvantage to other lenders.</p><p>And so the king or the religious authority decides to have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_(biblical)\">jubilee years</a>. Every fifty years, all debts are forgiven. The institution of money lending dies and is rises anew from the ashes. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years\">David Graeber</a> asserts that the practice was, in fact, not specific to Israel, but common at the time among the ancient societies in the Middle East.)</p><p>One can also think of the democratic system of regular elections as a kind of planned institutional death. Every four years, the government, with all the accumulated dysfunction, is thrown out and a new one is instituted. But the government example also makes the problem with planned death obvious. Government is replaced, but the people on non-political positions, various administrators and small-scale decision makers, remain. At least some inadequate Nash equilibria can therefore survive the change of the government. And those would accumulate over the time and eventually lead to the system collapse. We are between a rock and a hard place here: We want to destroy the institution to break the equilibria, but at the same time we want to preserve the institutional knowledge. We don't want to get all the way back to the trees after all. We don't want to get back to the middle ages either.</p><p>Last example that comes to mind is <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/about/who/\">IETF</a>, the institution that standardizes how Internet works. The real work, the development of standards, is done in <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/how/wgs/\">working groups</a>, which have a clear charter that defines what they are supposed to achieve and more importantly, how long would it take. The working group exists for, say, four months, and then dies. Sure, there are IETF <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/\">institutions</a> other than the working groups and those can survive for longer. But these are mostly doing the support jobs. Organizing meetings, publishing the new standards and so on. The real stuff happens in the working groups.</p><p>All in all, I am not at all sure that planned institutional death is a solution to all suboptimal equilibria problems, but the fact that evolution uses it, that it fights dysfunctions, such as cancer, by discarding the bulk of the cells every now and then and preserving only the germline, makes it at least worth of consideration.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>In a <a href=\"https://smaslennikov.com/posts/innovation-and-dependence/\">previous post</a> I mentioned the Industrial Revolution as a good early example of exploitation of workers for the benefit of industry owners. Naturally, this wasn't the first or only time this happened<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-1\" id=\"fnref-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-1\">[1]</a></sup>. The Industrial Revolution, however, is specifically an example of technologies driving out the workers, while their marketing suggested otherwise. The hope was that technological improvements were supposed to make life easier, to decrease manufacturing costs, therefore increasing resources for the people. Of course, that never happened: the income flowed to the owners and founders, then due to competition and product pricing adjustments - into the ether, though we can speculate that theoretically the better price point did help the people in the end.</p>\n<p>Currently, in the tech industry there's a lot of motion towards useless churning: while in a classic industrial complex workers are to produce more product in a given time frame, in today's tech industry engineers are to put out more features, more product complexity, scale the product and its dependencies according to suggested needs. Sometimes it seems like the purpose is just to keep people busy, justify the paycheck. There's no question that some of this work is necessary, however what I advocate is a notion of a <em>finalized product</em>.</p>\n<p>For several years now I had the perfect organization style in mind that stems from the above concepts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As usual, the first step is to generate a minimal product, prove its value in the market, ensure that it'll have positive cash flow, etcetera<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-2\" id=\"fnref-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-2\">[2]</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>Once the product is proven and further work is greenlit, it's a good time to scope out the specific staff needs</li>\n<li>Once a team is built, a complete feature list must be decided and planned. The key here is to keep it minimal but relatively final: the product shouldn't need mindless features. While the product itself is likely groundbreaking and innovative (otherwise did it <em>really</em> pass step 1?), its features should not be: they should be stable and using proven technologies.</li>\n<li>Finally, when the product is built and deployed, robust monitoring, alerting and autoscaling should be put in place.</li>\n<li>Once all of the above is complete, there's no reason for engineers to sit on their hands at work - send them home with a paycheck keeping them on an on-call rotation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From outer space, this plan can be seen as such: when the product is released, it starts generating income (due to a successful step 1). This income would usually flow in an uneven way to the founders and employees: don't allow for this to happen; instead, have equal salaries across the entire company. In order for the company to save some cash for a rainy day, salaries are lower than the entire income, the rest is saved and dispersed equally to all employees regularly through bonus programs and such. After the initial stride of excruciatingly hard work, largely all features in step 3 must be completed - there's nothing else to be done. Using proper automation and modern technologies ensures stability of the product and reduces dependencies on technologies that eventually become outdated and vulnerable: operating systems, system libraries<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-3\" id=\"fnref-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-3\">[3]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Naturally, changes to codebases will have to be made, vulnerabilities patched. Few feature additions per year may be acceptable. Overall, however, if the product, its implementation, automation and the team are truly excellent, provide the latter the paycheck and let them go home after 5-10 hours of work per week when needed.</p>\n<p>There's another good reason to do this: in economics there's a notion that the delta of net income decreases with expansion<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-4\" id=\"fnref-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-4\">[4]</a></sup>. Building a complete product and stopping there allows your team to reap the benefits and potentially continue onto the next similar venture. This may remind the reader of Google's products: when was the last time there was an update to Gmail, GSuite? Bugfixes and feature additions for GCP are similarly limited.</p>\n<p>Overall, this does what the industrial revolution failed to do: give time and resources to the people to allow them to focus on other problems. Following this technique, several advantages spring up: there's no room for bloat and useless features<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-5\" id=\"fnref-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-5\">[5]</a></sup>, engineers have an end goal they're motivated to achieve: finish work and automate the job away.</p>\n<p>Some may say that this strategy has already been at least partially implemented through the use of unlimited PTO, but when an employer provides such an option it's never analogous with going home and getting paid until there's a call for a bugfix. This may also sound similar to founding teams: once a product is largely built, sold or successfully IPOs, the founders get a cut of the final benefits, while newer team members are the ones continuing the work. It seems many of these notions are partially implemented in some organizations, but not at full scale.</p>\n<p>Naturally, this strategy only really fits a small niche of products that <em>can</em> be finalized and left making money. Without a really innovative, fitting idea this is all nonsense. The biggest issue that comes to mind is capitalist competition: another organization can replicate the product and potentially offer features the initial one does not, or even offering a better price point. This is a dangerous enemy that unfortunately collapses the entire scheme.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Just one example is society in the Russian Empire, which was basically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire#Society\">split into two classes</a>: landowners and peasants.

This was taught in my high school economics class. The overall explanation is: once a shop opens and generates income, the obvious next step is to open more shops to duplicate the income. However, due to rising operational overhead (staffing, management) the income doesn't simply double with another shop: it increases less with each new shop. The same notion can be seen with software development: supporting new features requires more infrastructure, engineering time, staffing, the same operational overhead as before. <a href=\"#fnref-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Have you ever tried travelling in a city by foot without taxis? Effective transit systems do exist, but often they're overly complex and badly documented (largely in the States). Google Maps put in a lot of effort to congregate all this information in one place, but their accuracy has recently fallen - partly due to exceptions such as COVID-19, but also due to transit companies failing to update schedules and lines. Even Amtrak fails to display a large portion of its train system on Google Maps. Outside of Google Maps, on transit systems' own websites, the situation grows somehow worse, where heavy user interfaces are prioritised over easy access to information. <a href=\"#fnref-WMtqDWwEkcfuq8QdJ-5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n</body></html>",

We now have had the opportunity to run a natural experiment. Having been bitten not only internationally but also domestically, will people act any differently the next time around? The answer is no. They will not.</p>\n<p>Twitter is full of people trying to help who feel the need to repeatedly and forcefully say that this result is not due solely to a rise in testing. Who feel the need to keep insisting that things are getting worse, that the epidemic is not essentially over.</p>\n<p>It seems that only when the ICUs are full, which is happening about now throughout several southern states, do normal people take notice that something might be wrong. Only when the death rate itself rises do people think that there might be danger.</p>\n<p>Others think that so long as the situation is getting worse sufficiently slowly, things will turn out fine. That is not how this works. That is not how any of this works. When Cuomo put up the slide that said goal of R0 less than 1.1, the mind boggled. If your R0 is 1.05, everyone gets infected. This isn&#8217;t a hard thing to reason out. And yet.</p>\n<h3>Area Man Confesses To Heinous Crime</h3>\n<p>He also held a rally in Tulsa.</p>\n<p>At that rally, he said that more tests meant more positives, which looked bad. So I told my people, &#8220;slow the testing down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I will repeat that. <strong>The President of the United States ordered coronavirus testing <em>slowed down.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The defense was that he was kidding.</p>\n<p>He wasn&#8217;t kidding.</p>\n<p>When asked to deny the statement, he sidestepped it. When asked about whether he had been kidding, he responded, and I quote: <strong>&#8220;I never kid.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>I do not point this out to ask why it has yet to become an article of impeachment. I point it out for its logical implications. We need to understand what is actually happening.</p>\n<p>To what extent are our numbers manipulated or fraudulent? In predicting the path of the pandemic, to what extent will our government actively interfere with our attempts to save people&#8217;s lives and their livelihoods? We know that the federal government has at many points actively interfered with our ability to test for Covid-19, and has waged a war of banditry and piracy to seize medical supplies.</p>\n<p>I have seen numerous reports that Florida, along with other states, is manipulating data in order to justify reopening.</p>\n<p>This all helps us answer the next question, which is:</p>\n<h3>What Went Wrong?</h3>\n<p>There has been a dramatic worsening of the trend lines over this past week. Even here in New York, what looked like clear steady improvement now risks falling apart. What made things go so wrong so quickly?</p>\n<p>My current model says that it is a combination of factors.</p>\n<p>The central thing that I believe is going on is lockdown fatigue combined with a relative-to-others sense of responsibility, and no state capacity to do anything else.</p>\n<p>It has been several months. A lockdown can be a fun change of pace for a week. It can be not so bad for a few months. But after a while it takes its toll. One goes stir crazy. You miss your friends. You lose your job and your savings start to run out. You can&#8217;t take it anymore.</p>\n<p>Combine that with people adjusting to the behaviors and norms they notice around them. When most people judge who is being responsible, they are grading on a curve. If others are doing unsafe things, and you&#8217;re doing unsafe things but things that are less unsafe than others are, or that seem to you more justified, then that&#8217;s not being irresponsible. That&#8217;s doing what is necessary. That&#8217;s living one&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>The dam broke on that. The secondary effect of the protests was something between the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back and the unleashing of a tidal wave. People saw others breaking the rules to protest. Many did so mostly to blow off steam after such a long lockdown. The rhetoric shifted to things like &#8216;defund the police&#8217; and other unpopular far-left agenda items.</p>\n<p>People noticed. Then others noticed them noticing, and adjusted expectations. Then others noticed them in turn, and so on. With the perception that a large portion of people was doing whatever it wanted, when a lot of other people ran the program &#8216;be about as responsible as other people&#8217; that quickly spiraled in many places to very little in the way of precautions.</p>\n<p>That is then combined with the problem of air conditioning, especially central air, and it being too hot to want to be outdoors throughout the South.</p>\n<p>Mask wearing helps where it is present, but has turned into a political issue. And it turns out that in many places, most people will do an annoying thing for only a brief period before they stop doing it. What I saw in Westchester was an exception.</p>\n<p>Then state capacity comes in.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have any ability to reimpose restrictions at least until after the death rates skyrocket. It&#8217;s unclear we&#8217;d be able to do anything even then.</p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t contact trace, even in places like New York City where we hired the people to do it and have a manageable case load. A tracking app is dead in the water. Our blue cognoscenti has decided that anonymity for protesters overrides any motivations to trace. Our red cognoscenti was never on board with the idea.</p>\n<p>In Texas it&#8217;s like New York in March, ICU capacity is being maxed out and we can&#8217;t even get proper PPE to the hospital workers let alone take extra measures.</p>\n<p>The good news is we&#8217;re starting to finally see a consensus that masks are the only way forward without complete disaster. The mask message is increasing in intensity and more people are getting on board, including red voices.</p>\n<p>The bad news is we&#8217;re starting to finally see a consensus that masks are the only way forward without complete disaster. We&#8217;ve agreed that we don&#8217;t have the ability to do much else that is useful.</p>\n<p>My real answer to what went wrong is that our civilization is profoundly inadequate. We have lost our ability to do things. If you haven&#8217;t read the <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/\">Moral Mazes sequence</a>, it may help explain how we got to this point. So will understanding <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/06/15/simulacra-and-covid-19/\">simulacra levels</a>. That post was originally intended to be called &#8216;Simulacra Levels and Covid-19&#8217; and to connect it to the claims of <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/31/covid-19-my-current-model/\">Covid-19: My Current Model</a>, but that turned out to be too ambitious for one post. My work is not yet done to connect it back to our general situation, but essentially we have lost not only the ability to focus on the object level, but where decisions are made we have lost the ability to acknowledge the object level even is a thing. Our top people don&#8217;t believe in a physical world the way our grandparents did, and deny that anyone <em>ever</em> believed in one in that way. I&#8217;m working on explaining this further, and hope to get the next post out in a few weeks. Can&#8217;t rush this.</p>\n<h3>Baseball! Baseball! Baseball! Baseball! Baseball! Baseball! Baseball! Baseball! Baseball! (with apologies to Bill Simmons)</h3>\n<p>For many months I have yearned for the return of Major League Baseball. Nothing would be better suited to passing the summer days while maintaining social distance. The game carries minimal risk relative to many other activities. A few can entertain so many for so long. Yet things kept being postponed, as the owners and players were locked in a battle over money.</p>\n<p>That battle seems to have ended with the players getting most of what they wanted, through a willful (in my reading) misinterpretation of an agreement the parties reached in March. The owners of course also did not cover themselves in glory on this one. But in the end, they did agree to play ball. Whether or not circumstances let it happen is unclear. I really, really hope we find a way, even if things get bad again. Baseball will be a huge help in getting us all through this.</p>\n<p>Football will be even more important, and that much trickier. Football is dangerous under the best of circumstances. I&#8217;m not convinced introducing Covid-19 is that big an increase in danger in <em>percentage of risk </em>terms for the activity, but that is not how people will think about it. We can only hope the huge psychic cost of not having it is properly respected.</p>\n<p>I know my readers don&#8217;t get this. I do. Sports are important. Sports go sports. Athletics are number one. Participants are heroes. Go team, yeah. For real. Let me put it this way, not as a demand but as a warning and declaration of fact:</p>\n<p>No Football, No Peace.</p>\n<h3>What Happens Now? What Should We Do as Individuals?</h3>\n<p>If you are in the area seeing the explosion in cases, expect things to look like New York City looked in March and April.</p>\n<p>We can hope that our improved knowledge will help us better protect the most vulnerable. That is good. It does not make the world around <em>you </em>any less dangerous when deciding what activities to do.</p>\n<p>This actually could make things worse. It was criminal that we let our elderly down early in the pandemic, especially by letting the virus into nursing homes. But those very deaths drove home the need for measures that contained the virus. With the new lower death rates, by the time that statistic gets people&#8217;s attention, we will be much farther along in the infection rate. A younger person&#8217;s <em>real </em>risk will be several times higher relative to average risk, and thus they will take even less of the precautions they need to than they would have before. Then that greater rate means the elderly in turn can&#8217;t be protected.</p>\n<p>Florida focused early on protecting nursing homes. That is the right strategy <em>if and only if it still lets you contain infections in general. </em>Fail, and nothing you did will save you, unless you can protect them through full herd immunity. That&#8217;s a tall order.</p>\n<p>Herd immunity is where the South and West are headed. A few Western states might still escape, but something would have to change. Hawaii was down to <em>one </em>case in an entire week, but if you don&#8217;t handle things, they come back anyway, and now they&#8217;re back up to 91 and growing fast. I think New Mexico, Colorado and parts of Northern California are the only ones who might be all right. In the South, Kentucky and Virginia might muddle through, which not coincidentally are the most northern members of the region, while Florida and Texas are looking like the biggest disasters.</p>\n<p>The Midwest is starting to trend back in the wrong direction, and several Northeastern states looks vulnerable as well. If there&#8217;s been the same level of cultural shift here as there was down South, but delayed and/or starting from a better point, we are at severe risk of tipping back above the critical R0~1 level, and having things start to get worse again. Once that happens, unless something changes, things might go slower, but it&#8217;s only a matter of time.</p>\n<p>You can look at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fG6Egvt6-h9DwYBXwAVHGT_gIznoYrvpcWjOT_jZmrc/edit?usp=sharing\">my spreadsheet</a> for further numerical details under the tab Infections by State.</p>\n<p>If you are in the Northeast, Midwest or a relatively safe local region, enjoy your relative safety responsibly while it lasts. Wear a mask. Remember to keep things outdoors. Don&#8217;t sweat the small stuff. Get yourself psychologically prepared for things to potentially get worse again, perhaps soon. Keep an eye on local numbers.</p>\n<p>If you are in most of the West or South, this is when the real crisis likely starts for you. Due to exhaustion and adjustment, chances supply chains break down are relatively low, but not zero. Chances the medical system collapses are very high. Be prepared. If you need to see a doctor in the next three months, now is bad but next month is worse. Be ready to not go outside for several months, or to stay within your own region of space if you have one of those within your property, if it comes to that.</p>\n<h3>Resumed The Quarantine Wars Have</h3>\n<p>New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are now telling travelers who have been to any state with positive test rates above 10% that they must quarantine for fourteen days. It would not surprise me if the rest of our regional alliance followed. The rate overall of positive tests outside New York was over 8% yesterday, so it might not be long before this is the majority of the country.</p>\n<p>Last time this was tried, we in New York were the ones being told to quarantine and stay out. It definitely feels good to turn the tables. The question of how this could be enforced remains unclear. It is also unclear whether the rest of the country will tolerate it. What will the federal government do when a blue state says red citizens aren&#8217;t welcome? So far, it seems to have been quietly accepted. These days, it&#8217;s hard to predict what will or won&#8217;t get a reaction. Perhaps the reaction will come when enforcement is attempted.</p>\n<p>We live in interesting times.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

They do this for your first 100 pots.\n\nIn that spirit, this post's epistemic status is SMASH THIS POT.</code></pre><p>When I'm doing research, I often start with a vague question based on an unsettled emotion, such as excitement, confusion, frustration, or need. Lately, I've been investigating visual imagery. I start off with a question that's as hazy as \"should I try and train my visual imagination so that I can be a better scientist?\"</p><p>All too often, when I leap into searching Google Scholar with just a hazy question in mind, I get lost in a rabbit hole. My mind substitutes alternative metrics of success. How many papers have I read, and to what depth? What do they say, in general? How many papers can I find? How should I group them? <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/e2M7BNG2oGJbwvTPy/where-to-start-research\">Where to start research?</a> Elizabeth think's it's with a question, not a book. Letting my chance findings on Google Scholar define my research agenda seems wrong, an example of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sP2Hg6uPwpfp3jZJN/lost-purposes\">lost purposes.</a></p><p>After taking detailed in-the-moment notes on how I investigated this question, I extricated some structure for my agile research process.</p><p><strong>During this process, I'm glancing at titles, looking for perhaps 1-2 minutes at an abstract, or spending maybe 5 minutes looking at the text of an article.</strong></p><p>1) Note the hazy idea that sparks your curiosity. Eg. \"should I try and train my visual imagination?\"</p><p>2) Try to decompose that into some sub-questions, which might require a paragraph or so to specify. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>I know we have different visual faculties for processing surface details vs. spatial relationships. People may have more developed skills or stronger innate potential for one or the other. Do most people tend to be average in both, or is it common to be much stronger in one than the other? Does one or the other correspond to feeling like you have a more vivid imagination?</li><li>Can visual imagination be improved with practice? If so, how?</li><li>What's more helpful to a scientist/mathematician/engineer - a strong visual imagination, or skill in using visualization tools such as drawings, physical models, and software?</li><li>What's more helpful to a scientist - a strong internalized knowledge of various skills, or knowing how to navigate a wide range of reference texts? I imagine investigating this question by testing them to see how well they can remember the content of textbooks or papers they've consulted in the last year. How much of what a scientist is doing is actually internalizing the content of a paper, versus doing an epistemic check on whether to accept the paper's conclusions and just remembering a few sentence's worth of actual content?</li></ul><p>3) Search for a likely phrase on Google Scholar. Eg. \"visual imagination.\" Take away new questions from the titles that pop up. For example, \"Four measures of visual imagination\" made me ask how we'd even study and measure this phenomenon. Are the methods likely to produce useful evidence? Continue searching for related terms, building up the questions you're interested in.</p><p>4) As you go along, bring your intuition to bear. Consider how the questions you identify are related. Write down your motivations for doing this research. Think about whether the idea you have is plausible. For example, I considered whether it seemed reasonable that the ability to see and control a mental picture is a key skill for STEM scientists, in an era of widely available visualization tools.</p><p>5) Note when superficially related questions are not actually relevant to your inquiry. For example, when I started finding papers on people's ability to see creative visual patterns in a shadowy blob (sort of like a Rorschach), I realized that I needed to specify that I was interested in the ability to see and control a mental picture, not the ability to find creative associations in an image. Altering my search to \"visual imagery\" rather than \"visual imagination\" turned up more relevant papers. This process will help you define the domain of your inquiry.</p><p>6) Defining the domain of your research project should eventually allow you to prioritize research questions. In my project, I realized I was interested in two issues. First, is the ability to see and control a mental picture a broadly important skill for STEM scientists? If so, how does mental imagery work, and how can it be improved? Realizing that the latter question didn't matter much to me if the answer to the first question was \"no\" helped me set aside many of the papers that popped up.</p><p>7) Prioritizing your research questions may lead you to realize that there's preliminary research you should do before you even address the question you started with. In my case, I want to identify the most useful things I can do to build a career in science. Intuitively, is a big literature review to determine whether and how I should practice visualization a high priority, compared with things like studying for my classes, developing my research project, contacting grad programs, and so on? Maybe I should just keep practicing it intuitively and organically, rather than buttressing it with scientific research.</p><p><strong>The outcome is a domain of specific, related research questions that are strongly linked with your original motivation to do research, and clarity on whether this is the right question-domain to pursue given your needs.</strong></p><p>I think of this process as an example of \"pre-research.\"</p><p>Pre-research can take many forms. Sometimes, I create a spreadsheet to intuitively define large-scale possible directions of research before I do even a single search for literature. Other projects, like this one, involve much more back-and-forth between search and reflection.</p><p>The point is to prevent the books you're finding from defining your agenda. Use the books, don't let them use you. Only when your domain is defined should you move on to the next step of scholarship, which you should also figure out <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/37sHjeisS9uJufi4u/scholarship-how-to-do-it-efficiently\">how to do efficiently</a>.</p><p>One important outcome of pre-research is that if you commit to actually reading a paper or book, you know quite clearly why you're doing so. It's not for the purpose of open-ended exploration. It's to get answers to a set of specific questions that are high-priority within your research domain. This way, a literature is less like running around the field and falling down a rabbit hole, and more like walking around the field and considering whether, why, and where to build your ivory tower.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I think it&apos;s important to clearly and publicly admit when we were wrong. It&apos;s even better to diagnose why, and take steps to prevent doing so again. COVID-19 is far from over, but given my early stance on a number of questions regarding COVID-19, this is my attempt at a public personal review to see where I was wrong. </p><p>I have been pushing for better forecasting and preparation for pandemics for years, but I wasn&apos;t forecasting on the various specific questions about Pandemics on most platforms until at least mid-March, and I failed in several ways.</p><h1>Mea Culpa</h1><p>I was late to update about a number of things, and simply wrong in some cases even on the basis of known information. The failures include initially being slow to recognize the extent of the threat, starting out dismissive about masks, being more concerned about hospital-based transmission than ended up being justified, being overconfident in the response of the US government, and in early March, over-confidently getting a key fact wrong about transmission being at least largely via aerosol droplet versus physical contact. I have a number of excuses, of course. Most other experts agreed with my views, my grandfather passed away in January, followed by his wife in early March, I was under a lot of stress, I was very busy with my personal life, I was trying to do a number of other high-priority projects, I was not paying attention to the details, and so on. But predictive accuracy doesn&apos;t care about WHY you were wrong, especially since there are always such excuses. And the impact of my poor judgement was also likely misleading to others in the community.</p><p>At the same time, I feel the perhaps egotistical need to note where I was correct early, and what I got right - followed by a clearer description of my failures. I started saying there would be PPE shortages due to COVID-19 by January, and was writing about the supply chain issues well before COVID. I submitted <a href=\"https://www.joghr.org/article/12530-review-of-potential-high-leverage-and-inexpensive-mitigations-for-reducing-risk-in-epidemics-and-pandemics\">this paper</a> November last year with Dave Denkenberger, which was largely finished last summer, and it was accepted in February, which then took 3 months to get published. The delay was in part due to other demands on my time, but in retrospect, if it had been available 3 months earlier, it would have been far, far more impactful.</p><p>I also understood the failure mode we ended up seeing, and in <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/hs.2018.0039\">my 2018 paper</a>, discussing overconfidence in claims that pandemics would be rare, I argued that among the most critical risks was failure to respond to emerging pandemics which could in theory be controlled quickly enough. On the other hand, my failure to realize that this is exactly what was happening is perhaps compounded by the fact that I understood the dynamics, and should have been able to identify what was going on.</p><p>Lastly, I maintain I was correct in warning about the poorly thought out and in some cases outright dangerous &quot;preparation&quot; in some quarters of the rationality community proposed in March, such as advocating use of bleach and ozone in closed areas for disinfection. Some people in the community were stockpiling N-95 masks and food and buying up second hand ventilators, and as I said at the time, were at best being selfish and defecting. On the other hand, as I mention below, I was insufficiently clear about the need for better preparation, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jeyvzALDbjdjjv5RW/pretending-to-be-wise\">waited far too long to speak</a>.</p><h1>Some of My Mistakes, and Related Comments</h1><h2><strong>Slow to recognize the extent of the threat.</strong></h2><p>I said we should <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmanheim/status/1220017992597168129\">be very concerned</a> in January, albeit not very publicly. I took until <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmanheim/status/1236987867630575616\">early March</a> to start suggesting that it was clear that the US would expect to see large numbers of deaths. I was skeptical of valuable efforts early on, and didn&apos;t start really publicly sounding the alarm and reacting until even later. I was later than most of this community in recognizing the risks.</p><h2><strong>Skeptical about Border Closures</strong></h2><p>In a conversation that started <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RokoMijicUK/status/1221566557320634369\">Jan 27th</a>, I was asked about shutting down borders to prevent spread. I was dismissive, in large part based on the expert consensus. I&apos;m unsure whether this was a mistake on the object level, since I think that at that early point, the facts were unclear enough, and trade wars really are bad. I also expected response to be better, based on previous cases. </p><p>I do not think that border shutdowns were feasible, and historically they have not been. Quarantines at borders were and are logistically impossible. And full border closures for COVID-19 were also not very effective most places until very late in the spread, (Mongolia and Vietnam are the exceptions that disprove the rule.) Even late in the pandemic spread, lots of transmission occurred from places where there had been few or no cases at the time people entered. However, when discussing it, I excused my early claims that it was too economically damaging and would have been ineffective by substituting a different argument about political feasibility - one which I think is correct, but was not my original consideration. This was bad epistemic practice, and I should have been clearer that in retrospect, if they could have been put in place, travel bans would have been a much better idea. I still think my later excuse, that they were politically impossible, holds up - but I had not fully thought through the question until well after my early response.</p><h2><strong>Dismissive about masks.</strong></h2><p>The research on use of masks was unclear and I don&apos;t want to claim it was retrospectively obvious, but as a matter of decision making given uncertain risks, people should have started wearing <strong><em>homemade masks</em></strong> in public much earlier. We will still need to see how much impact promoting mask wearing in public has had, but at the very least it functioned as a clear and important public signal that COVID was serious, which promotes physical distance and other critical factors. </p><p>On the other hand, I said at the time, and still maintain that I was correct in suggesting that buying up P95 and surgical masks in February and March was defecting, since it was already clear that those supplies were needed desperately in hospitals. And Fauci has now <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/video/dr-fauci-masks-changing-directive-coronavirus\">said as much</a> (as a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qDmnyEMtJkE9Wrpau/simulacra-levels-and-their-interactions\">level-1+2 sage</a>, in my view.). In retrospect, I think it would have been better, consequentially, to push for cloth masks earlier, but current modeling and our understanding of spread make it clear that mask wearing by itself is only marginally effective. I was instead focused on promoting handwashing, which I think is still undersold in importance, and thought that continued focus on masks would be a net negative. I was wrong, and others here were correct.</p><h2><strong>Not clear enough about the importance of preparation.</strong></h2><p>I&apos;ve long said, following all of the experts, that people should have 2 weeks supply of food and basic supplies. Especially people in California, where earthquakes are far more common than severe pandemics. Further preparation should have been unneeded early on - but in fact, most people don&apos;t do this, and the people who were advocating making sure that you were prepared for a worse outcome were correct.</p><p>On the other hand, there is an argument I&apos;ve seen here, and by others in the rationality community elsewhere, that encouraging people to buy critical supplies and hoard early in a crisis sends a price signal to get companies to produce. The argument is that this type of hoarding masks and other PPE  will convince manufacturers to make more. I thought, and still think, that this is at least partly misunderstanding the way that price signals and supply chain delays propagate. Anyone who&apos;s familiar with MIT System Dynamics&apos; <a href=\"https://beergame.org/\">Beer Game</a> and the bullwhip effect would tell you that companies that ramped up production in response to demand quickly (rather than projections and an understanding of longer term demand) were being stupid, not prudent, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/05/811387424/face-masks-not-enough-are-made-in-america-to-deal-with-coronavirus\">and companies that tried this in exactly this area were burned in the past for doing so</a>. If that isn&apos;t clear enough, notice that it took a couple months for the toilet paper and flour &quot;shortages&quot; to be worked out, despite the fact that there was sufficient supply, and there were not actual production supply shortages. Yes, markets are largely efficient, but they aren&apos;t magical ways to eliminate production and distribution delays, much less to insulate companies from actual market dynamics - and China and other southeast Asian countries had already stepped up mask production massively by mid-January. Most of the current supply comes from those factories, so the supposed benefits of price signals from buying masks in February seem not to have been actually effective in speeding anything up.</p><h2><strong>Oversold Hospital-based transmission.</strong></h2><p>Part of my concern about hoarding of masks and other equipment was that I thought we would once again see a pattern of large transmission events being centered around hospitals. Thankfully, this didn&apos;t happen - hospitals have gotten far better at isolation of patients, and they shut down non-essential services early. We did still see many, many cases and deaths in hospital staff, and this was very clearly in large part due to a lack of supply of PPE. Still, it wasn&apos;t the critical locus of spread I expected it to be.</p><h2><strong>Overconfidence in the response of (certain agencies in) the US government.</strong></h2><p>This was a huge mistake on my part. I have been concerned about the current administration for years, have repeatedly warned that it is destroying government agencies. Despite that, I was (in retrospect very unreasonably) still confident that the CDC was going to handle the situation well. They had handbooks on influenza pandemic preparedness, I had personally discussed pandemic preparedness plans with senior people at CDC just a few years ago, and I was overconfident in the ability to respond. Based on that, in turn, I was confident that the level of concern being voiced by the CDC was a reflection of their planning and ongoing preparation. The CDC has planned for preparation for this exact case for years, and I assumed they would carry out those plans. I was wrong.</p><p>It seems, though it is still somewhat unclear, that center directors were told by the director and the head of HHS that they needed not to speak out about the risks, specific recommendations were vetoed, and (easily the worst screw up,) they let the FDA ban private tests, seemingly at the direction of the administration, to hide the extent of the spread. I&apos;m still confused by the level of non-reaction among non-political SES staff and GS-14s. We have seen many people in various agencies come forward with complaints during this administration, but CDC seems to have just dropped the ball on their response. We will likely see in the coming years how much this was due to central directives not to react, versus alack of central directives to react, therefore failing due to passivity. I still want to assume the former, but that&apos;s in large part self-justification of my prior views.</p><p>I was wrong in trying to defend the CDC&apos;s overall response in March. It definitely isn&apos;t as clear as I thought at the time that they were, and would be, net positive. I do think that the emergence of Fauci as almost a national hero has been very helpful in getting people to listen to expert recommendations, even if this did come very late. This is a point on the side of getting most people to listen more and attack less. On the other hand, Lesswrong was overall better prepared because of their skepticism, so <em>at the very least</em> I was talking to the wrong crowd to defend them, and more likely should have been quicker to judge their actions as dangerous myself.</p><p>The FDA also surprised me with how badly they did, albeit the surprise was less severe because I had lower expectations. I thought they were getting less dangerous to US public health given the previous pushes to reduce regulation by the current administration. Scott Gottlieb was there for two years, and was probably the only Trump nominee I was actually super-happy about. Unfortunately, he left (a fact I wasn&apos;t paying attention to,) and it turns out that the incompetence of a sequence of new directors and rapid changes left the FDA even less prepared that they would have been. I would have expected a doctrinaire Republican appointee to seize the opportunity of a crisis to reduce regulation, and instead it seems they did nothing but block critical testing work for months.</p><p>I&apos;ve long considered myself skeptical of government agencies abilities, and lean fairly heavily libertarian in many ways - albeit less than most others at lesswrong. I was still surprised by the level of ongoing, perhaps even malicious incompetence of the current administration. I&apos;m still unclear if this is a Hanlon-dodge, or if they really have broken the US government so badly, so quickly. Other governments managed this far less poorly, so I&apos;m unclear how generalizable the lesson is that governments are bad at everything. But I am glad I left the US.</p><h2>Being a jerk commenting on a post attacking the CDC</h2><p>Given that I&apos;m posting a retrospective, there is a different type of mistake I made that I also need to address. In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h4vWsBBjASgiQ2pn6/credibility-of-the-cdc-on-sars-cov-2\">a lesswrong thread several months ago</a>, there were a number of claims made about the CDC&apos;s response. I responded that I thought the post was an infohazard, would very plausibly lead to many more people dying, and as such, the posters should have asked for feedback from someone who could vet concerns about this, and that it should be taken down by site administrators. This was stupid, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h4vWsBBjASgiQ2pn6/credibility-of-the-cdc-on-sars-cov-2?commentId=2h78FcD2JcLaMSFnc\">I have apologized there</a>, along with laying out what I hope is a fair analysis of what I know I did wrong, and what I still think I was correct about.</p><h1>Speculation about Causes</h1><p>There are lots of things I did wrong.</p><p>First, I think I was too close to the situation. I had spent a ton of time <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1576.html\">looking at the US&apos;s system specifically</a>, and writing about the closely related -topic of influenza pandemics in my dissertation, then doing work for Open Philanthropy on GCBRs. All of this was during the Obama administration. I left the US a bit after Trump was elected, partly for that reason, and worked on related topics that had less to do with US policy. I&apos;d like to say that&apos;s why I didn&apos;t update, but to be honest, I think I was just being stupid in accepting my cached thoughts about the risk and best responses, instead of re-evaluating.</p><p>I also had too-strong priors and &quot;expert&quot; ideas to be properly fox-like in my predictions, and not quick enough to update about how things were actually going based on the data. Because I was slow to move from the base-rate, I underestimated the severity of COVID-19 for too long. I&apos;m unsure how to fix that, since most of the time it&apos;s the right move, and paying attention to every new event is very expensive in terms of mental energy. (Suggestions welcome!)</p><p>I also gave too much weight to others&apos; forecasts. Good Judgement&apos;s predictions were WAY optimistic about this early on, and I was not forecasting the question, but I was assuming that their aggregate guess was better than that of individuals, especially people who aren&apos;t forecasters. This is usually correct, but here it was a mistake. (I now think that superforecasting is materially worse than I hoped it would be at noticing rare events early.) I also followed the herd too much from expert circles, and my twitter feed from infectious disease epidemiology circles was behind even my slow self in recognizing that this was a incipient disaster back in March.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>COVID-19 went badly in some places, and went disastrously in others. This was largely predictable, and I failed to notice early enough. (The US is in deep, deep trouble, and this will continue for quite a while longer, with myriad longer term effects on the global economy, and on global stability of other types.) I&apos;m chastened about the poorly calibrated overconfidence of my expert opinion. </p><p>I&apos;m also partly unsure what the best next steps are for better-calibration. One key thing I did, several years ago, was explicitly try to rely more on other people&apos;s views in the rationality community to guide my decisions, and provide a clear source of feedback. I didn&apos;t do this as much as I should have in this case. (On the other hand, it was a large part of why I recognized the mistake as quickly as I did, albeit later than I could have - so it was at least a partial success.) </p><p>I&apos;m hoping that this exercise is another way in which thinking through the situation gives me a valuable chance to reflect, and that I can get further feedback. I also hope that it&apos;s useful for others to perhaps learn from, but I&apos;m unsure how transferable the lessons of my failures are.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>The following text first summarizes the standard moral-hazard model. Afterwards, I point out that it implies that you always get punished for bad luck. The third part is completely speculative: I speculate on how you should behave towards yourself.<br></em><br><strong>A brief summary of a moral-hazard setting</strong><br><br>A Moral Hazard situation occurs when someone takes too much risk, or does not reduce it enough because someone else bears the cost.<br><br>The following situation is a typical textbook example. A worker works for a firm, and her effort influences the probability that the firm has high revenue. The worker can exert high or low effort, the firm&apos;s revenue can be high or low, and low revenue is more likely when effort is low, but can also occur when effort is high. Moreover, the worker has to get a wage that compensates her for forgoing whatever else she would do with her time.<br><br>Suppose the firm would, in principle, be willing to compensate the worker for high effort (which means that we assume that the additional expected revenue gained from high effort ist at least as high as the additional wage needed to make the worker willing to exert high effort). Because workers are usually assumed to be risk-averse, the firm would take the risk of low revenue and the worker gets a wage that is constant in all states of the world.<br><br>However, now also suppose the firm cannot directly observe the effort - this constitutes a situation of asymmetric information, because the worker can observe her own effort and the firm cannot. Then the firm cannot condition the payment on the worker&apos;s effort. It also cannot just conclude that the worker exerted low effort by observing low revenue, because we assumed that low revenue can also occur when the worker exerted high effort.<br><br>The second-best optimal solution (that is, the best solution given this information problem) is to condition payments on the revenue - and thus, on the result instead of the effort to get it. The worker gets a higher wage when the firm has high revenue. Thereby, the firm can design the contract such that the worker will choose to exert high effort.<br><br>In this setting of asymmetric information, the worker gets the same expected utility as in the setting with symmetric information (in which effort could be observed), because the firm still has to compensate her for not doing something else. But because the worker now faces an uncertain income stream, the expected wage must be higher than if the wage were constant. (Thus, the firm has a lower expected profit. If the loss to the firm due to the high-revenue wage premium is severe enough, the firm may not even try to enforce high effort.) The asymmetric information precludes an optimal arrangement of which economic agent takes the risk.<br><br><strong><br>You&apos;ll get punished for bad luck</strong><br><br>At this point, note that the way that the firm offers a higher wage when it has high revenues and a lower one when it has low revenues is a matter of framing. The firm may for example say that it wants its workers to participate in its success, and therefore pay a premium.<br><br>Vocabulary of &quot;punishment&quot;, by contrast, may not be popular. Also, it seems wrong to call the low wage a punishment wage. Why? Because the optimal contract makes the worker exert high effort, and a low revenue will NOT indicate that the worker idled.<br><br>So that is the irony of the situation: An optimal contract punishes you for bad luck, and for nothing else. At the same time, the worker would be more likely to get &quot;punished&quot; if he idled, because low revenue would then be more likely. The threat of punishment for a bad result is exactly what makes the worker exert high effort to at least make the bad results unlikely.<br><br><strong>Optimal contracts in your brain?</strong><br><br>Suppose you feel a bit split between two &quot;agents&quot; in your brain. One part of you would like to avoid working. The other part would like you to exert high effort to have a good chance of reaching your goals.<br><br>You cannot pay yourself a wage for high effort, but you can feel good or bad. Yet the kind-of-metaphorical implication of the moral-hazard optimal-contract model is that you should not punish yourself for bad luck. There are random influences in the world, but if you can see (or remember) how much effort you exerted, it does not make sense to give yourself a hard time because you were unlucky.<br><br>On the other hand, maybe you punish yourself because you lie to yourself about your effort? If you have created such an asymmetric-information situation within yourself, punishing yourself for bad luck is a seemingly rational idea. But keep in mind that it is only second-best optimal, under the assumption that this asymmetric information indeed exists. If so, think of ways to measure your effort instead of only your outcome. If you cannot do it, consider whether forcing yourself to exert high effort is really worth it. Solve the problem that actually needs to be solved, and respect the constraints that exist, and none that do not.</p>",

Bets focus only on disagreement with probabilities, not the underlying reasons for those disagreements. Declaring a winner/loser conveys binary information about who was more correct, but this is very little information. Post-mortems give a place for the models to be brought to light.</p>\n<p>A group of people who engaged in betting-with-post-mortems together would generally be getting a lot more feedback on practical reasoning and where it can go wrong.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://www.storyofmathematics.com/hellenistic_diophantus.html\">https://www.storyofmathematics.com/hellenistic_diophantus.html</a></p><p>Diophantus of Alexandria, a 2nd Century Greek mathematician, had a lot of the concepts needed to develop an Algebra. However, he was unable to fully generalize his methods of problem solving, even if he invented some interesting methods.</p><p>Ancient math was written in paragraphs, using words for the most part, thus making reading it very, very painful compared to the compact elegance of modern mathematical notation. However, I was surprised to see Diophantus (or his very early editors at least) develop some interesting and helpful notation in his algebra.</p><p>Final sigma ‘ς’ represented the unknown variable, but there were different symbols for variables of every power so for x^2… x^6 each had a unique variable. In fact, this situation persisted into the 17th century, even Fermat used N for unknown and S for the unknown-squared and C for the unknown cubed!</p><p>The problem with this is that it meant Diophantus couldn’t devise general methods to solve algebraic problems which had multiple unknowns, and it wasn’t obvious to him that one CAN frequently relate x^2 to x.</p><p>The cool thing about this notation from the past though, is how it makes obvious something that Algebra I – Algebra II students mess up frequently. You can’t just combine x^2 + x^3, these are different variables whose relation concerns the base. And almost everyone has made this mistake in their early math career. Some never recover.</p><p>Although the editor of my copy, Sir Thomas L. Heath, claims that Diophantus experienced limited options as a mathematician because all the letters of the Greek alphabet were in use as letters except for the final sigma, which Diophantus used to represent the unknown variable, I think D <em>could </em>have invented more variables quite easily. We see this in his invention of the subtraction sign as an inverted psi, and his use of a different variable with superscript for an unknown to the nth power up to the sixth. There was also the extinct digamma and all the Egyptian symbols which at least could have cribbed off of. Surely, the problem was not a lack of imagination, but merely satisfaction with the method then in use. Besides, one person can only invent so much, unless that person is Leonard Euler or Von Neumann, neither of whom had any limits. D. merely didn't see the limits of his notation.</p><p>Although D’s problems are surprisingly challenging even using modern notation, the logic D. used to solve the problems is obscure. He does not explain his step by step process. Since they are not proofs, and they are merely problems, it’s hard to divine exactly what D. thought the import of his methods were or exactly which steps he took to come to the answer. He seems to have used trial and error to solve some problems frequently, just plugging in numbers until the right answer popped out. He only wanted positive integers in his answers, so the problems are designed to reflect that. However, some problems don’t have an answer as a whole number. For those he would estimate the answer. “X is &lt; 11 and &gt; 10.” Sometimes he is wrong on these estimations! I don’t know quite what to make of that. In problems whose answer is a negative number, Diophantus says, “Pthht, absurd!” </p><p>This is unfortunate, because if D. had credits and debts in mind when he was putting together these problems, he might have seen the utility of negative numbers and started an accounting revolution 1500 years early.</p><p>If Diophantus can teach us one thing about discovery, I believe it is that iterating over different methods of notation might lead us to make conceptual breakthroughs.</p>",

This is the second of probably several posts dumping my thought-state as of this week.</i></p><p>It is an empirical fact that we can predict the day-to-day behavior of the world around us - positions of trees or buildings, trajectories of birds or cars, color of the sky and ground, etc - without worrying about the details of plasmas roiling in any particular far-away star. We can predict the behavior of a dog without having to worry about positions of individual molecules in its cells. We can predict the behavior of reinforced concrete without having to check it under a microscope or account for the flaps of butterfly wings a thousand kilometers away.</p><p>Our universe abstracts well: it <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy/p/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks\"><u>decomposes into high-level objects whose internal details are approximately independent of far-away objects, given all of their high-level summary information</u></a>.</p><p>It didn’t have to be this way. We could imagine a universe which looks like a cryptographic hash function, where most bits are tightly entangled with most other bits and any prediction of anything requires near-perfect knowledge of the whole system state. But empirically, our universe does not look like that.</p><p>Given that we live in a universe amenable to abstraction, what sorts of agents should we expect to evolve? What can we say about agency structure and behavior in such a universe? This post comes at the question from a few different angles, looking at different properties I expect evolved agents to display in abstraction-friendly universes.</p><h2>Convergent Instrumental Goals</h2><p>The basic idea of abstraction is that any variable X is surrounded by lots of noisy unobserved variables, which mediate its interactions with the rest of the universe. Anything “far away” from X - i.e. anything outside of those noisy intermediates - can only “see” some abstract summary information f(X). Anything more than a few microns from a transistor on a CPU will only be sensitive to the transistor’s on/off state, not its exact voltage; the gravitational forces on far-apart stars depend only on their total mass, momentum and position, not on the roiling of plasmas.</p><p>One consequence: if an agent’s goals do not explicitly involve things close to X, then the agent cares only about controlling f(X). If an agent does not explicitly care about exact voltages on a CPU, then it will care only about controlling the binary states (and ultimately, the output of the computation). If an agent does not explicitly care about plasmas in far-away stars, then it will care only about the total mass, momentum and position of those stars. This holds for <i>any</i> goal which does not explicitly care about the low-level details of X or the things nearby X.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ahZQbxiPPpsTutDy2/dn4ajt8vumes0nhv9lk1\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ahZQbxiPPpsTutDy2/xtenmpaszld7oyewg6zj 97w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ahZQbxiPPpsTutDy2/faq3gkddncilckdejddh 177w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ahZQbxiPPpsTutDy2/sdsblzxyu6xx8m7ujmoq 257w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ahZQbxiPPpsTutDy2/jel5t3ckcbewcxhed818 337w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ahZQbxiPPpsTutDy2/eraex8n4gpc5getint9l 417w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ahZQbxiPPpsTutDy2/tl0hv1eklw5lw562live 497w\"><figcaption>Noisy intermediates Z mask all information about X except the summary f(X). So, if an agent's objective only explicitly depends on far-away variables Y, then the agent only wants to control f(X), not necessarily all of X.</figcaption></figure><p>This sounds like instrumental convergence: any goal which does not explicitly care about things near X itself will care only about controlling f(X), not all of X. Agents with different goals will compete to control the same things: high-level behaviors f(X), especially those with far-reaching effects.</p><p>Natural next question: does <i>all</i> instrumental convergence work this way?</p><p>Typical intuition for instrumental convergence is something like “well, having lots of resources increases one’s action space, so a wide variety of agents will try to acquire resources in order to increase their action space”. Re-wording that as an abstraction argument: “an agent’s accessible action space ‘far away’ from now (i.e. far in the future) depends mainly on what resources it acquires, and is otherwise mostly independent of specific choices made right now”.&nbsp;</p><p>That may sound surprising at first, but imagine a strategic video game (I picture Starcraft). There’s a finite world-map, so over a long-ish time horizon I can get my units wherever I want them; their exact positions don’t matter to my long-term action space. Likewise, I can always tear down my buildings and reposition them somewhere else; that’s not free, but the long-term effect of such actions is just having less resources. Similarly, on a long time horizon, I can build/lose whatever units I want, at the cost of resources. It’s ultimately just the resources which restrict my action space, over a long time horizon.</p><p>(More generally, I think mediating-long-term-action-space is part of how we intuitively decide what to call “resources” in the first place.)</p><p>Coming from a different angle, we could compare to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6DuJxY8X45Sco4bS2/seeking-power-is-instrumentally-convergent-in-mdps\"><u>TurnTrout’s formulation</u></a> of convergent instrumental goals in MDPs. Those results are similar to the argument above in that agents tend to pursue states which maximize their long-term action space. We could formally define an abstraction on MDPs in which X is the current state, and f(X) summarizes the information about the current state relevant to the far-future action space. In other words, two states X with the same long-run action space will have the same f(X). “Power”, as TurnTrout defined it, would be an increasing function of f(X) - larger long-run action spaces mean more power. Presumably agents would tend to seek states with large f(X).</p><h2>Modularity</h2><p>Fun fact: biological systems are highly modular, at multiple different scales. This can be quantified and verified statistically, e.g. by mapping out protein networks and algorithmically partitioning them into parts, then comparing the connectivity of the parts. It can also be seen more qualitatively in everyday biological work: proteins have subunits which retain their function when fused to other proteins, receptor circuits can be swapped out to make bacteria follow different chemical gradients, manipulating specific genes can turn a fly’s antennae into legs, organs perform specific functions, etc, etc.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ahZQbxiPPpsTutDy2/ud2nbuqofcmvz6g4h1fo\"></figure><p>One leading theory for <i>why</i> modularity evolves is “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JBFHzfPkXHB2XfDGj/evolution-of-modularity\"><u>modularly varying goals</u></a>”: essentially, modularity in the organism evolves to match modular requirements from the environment. For instance, animals need to breathe, eat, move, and reproduce. A new environment might have different food or require different motions, independent of respiration or reproduction - or vice versa. Since these requirements vary more-or-less independently in the environment, animals evolve modular systems to deal with them: digestive tract, lungs, etc. This has been tested in simple simulated evolution experiments, and it works.</p><p>In short: modularity of the organism evolves to match modularity of the environment.</p><p>… and modularity of the environment is essentially abstraction-friendliness. The idea of abstraction is that the environment consists of high-level components whose low-level structure is independent (given the high-level summaries) for any far-apart components. That’s modularity.</p><p>Coming from an entirely different direction, we could talk about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_regulator\"><u>good regulator theorem</u></a> from control theory: any regulator of a system which is maximally successful and simple must be isomorphic to the system itself. Again, this suggests that modular environments should evolve modular “regulators”, e.g. organisms or agents.</p><p>I expect that the right formalization of these ideas would yield a theorem saying that evolution in abstraction-friendly environments tends to produce modularity reflecting the modular structure of the environment. Or, to put it differently: evolution in abstraction-friendly environments tends to produce (implicit) world-models whose structure matches the structure of the world.</p><h2>Reflection</h2><p>Finally, we can ask what happens when one modular component of the world is itself an evolved agent modelling the world. What would we expect this agent’s model of itself to look like?</p><p>I don’t have much to say yet about what this would look like, but it would be very useful to have. It would give us a grounded, empirically-testable outside-view correctness criterion for things like embedded world models and embedded decision theory. Ultimately, I hope that it will get at Scott’s open question “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/osxNg6yBCJ4ur9hpi/does-agent-like-behavior-imply-agent-like-architecture\"><u>Does agent-like behavior imply agent-like architecture?</u></a>”, at least for evolved agents specifically.</p>",

In particular, you can look through <strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PwWbWZ6FPqAgZWOoOcXM8N_tUCuxpEyMbN1NYYC02aM/edit?usp=sharing\">this spreadsheet</a></strong> of all summaries that have ever been in the newsletter.</p><p>Audio version <strong><a href=\"http://alignment-newsletter.libsyn.com/alignment-newsletter-105\">here</a></strong> (may not be up yet). \t\t\t  </p><h1>HIGHLIGHTS </h1><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory\">Modeling the Human Trajectory</a></strong> <em>(David Roodman)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): This post analyzes the human trajectory from 10,000 BCE to the present and considers its implications for the future. The metric used for this is Gross World Product (GWP), the sum total of goods and services produced in the world over the course of a year. </p><p>Looking at GWP over this long stretch leads to a few interesting conclusions. First, until 1800, most people lived near subsistence levels. This means that growth in GWP was primarily driven by growth in population. Since then population growth has slowed and GWP per capita has increased, leading to our vastly improved quality of life today. Second, an exponential function does not fit the data well at all. In an exponential function, the time for GWP to double would be constant. Instead, GWP seems to be doubling faster, which is better fit by a power law. However, the conclusion of extrapolating this relationship forward is extremely rapid economic growth, approaching infinite GWP as we near the year 2047. </p><p>Next, Roodman creates a stochastic model in order to analyze not just the modal prediction, but also get the full distribution over how likely particular outcomes are. By fitting this to only past data, he analyzes how surprising each period of GWP was. This finds that the industrial revolution and the period after it was above the 90th percentile of the model&#x2019;s distribution, corresponding to surprisingly fast economic growth. Analogously, the past 30 years have seen anomalously lower growth, around the 25th percentile. This suggests that the model&apos;s stochasticity does not appropriately capture the real world -- while a good model can certainly be &quot;surprised&quot; by high or low growth during one period, it should probably not be <em>consistently</em> surprised in the same direction, as happens here.</p><p>In addition to looking at the data empirically, he provides a theoretical model for how this accelerating growth can occur by generalizing a standard economic model. Typically, the economic model assumes technology is a fixed input or has a fixed rate of growth and does not allow for production to be reinvested in technological improvements. Once reinvestment is incorporated into the model, then the economic growth rate accelerates similarly to the historical data.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> I found this paper very interesting and was quite surprised by its results. That said, I remain confused about what conclusions I should draw from it. The power law trend does seem to fit historical data very well, but the past 70 years are fit quite well by an <strong><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-gdp-over-the-last-two-millennia?yScale=log&amp;time=1950..\">exponential trend</a></strong>. Which one is relevant for predicting the future, if either, is quite unclear to me. </p><p>The theoretical model proposed makes more sense to me. If technology is responsible for the growth rate, then reinvesting production in technology will cause the growth rate to be faster. I&apos;d be curious to see data on what fraction of GWP gets reinvested in improved technology and how that lines up with the other trends.</p><p><strong>Rohin&#x2019;s opinion:</strong> I enjoyed this post; it gave me a visceral sense for what hyperbolic models with noise look like (see the blog post for this, the summary doesn&#x2019;t capture it). Overall, I think my takeaway is that the picture used in AI risk of explosive growth is in fact plausible, despite how crazy it initially sounds. Of course, it won&#x2019;t literally diverge to infinity -- we will eventually hit some sort of limit on growth, even with &#x201C;just&#x201D; exponential growth -- but this limit could be quite far beyond what we have achieved so far.

One natural <strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q4hLMDrFd8fbteeZ8/measuring-optimization-power\">approach</a></strong> is to say that an optimizer causes the world to have higher values according to some reasonable utility function, but this seems insufficient, as then a <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/26eupx3Byc8swRS7f/bottle-caps-aren-t-optimisers\">bottle cap would be an optimizer</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/469203093ca3/alignment-newsletter-22\">AN #22</a></strong>) for keeping water in the bottle.</p><p>This post provides a new definition of optimization, by taking a page from <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/p7x32SEt43ZMC9r7r/embedded-agents\">Embedded Agents</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/7d0e3916e3d9/alignment-newsletter-31\">AN #31</a></strong>) and analyzing a system as a whole instead of separating the agent and environment. An <strong>optimizing system</strong> is then one which tends to evolve toward some special configurations (called the <strong>target configuration set</strong>), when starting anywhere in some larger set of configurations (called the <strong>basin of attraction</strong>), <em>even if</em> the system is perturbed.</p><p>For example, in gradient descent, we start with some initial guess at the parameters &#x3B8;, and then continually compute loss gradients and move &#x3B8; in the appropriate direction. The target configuration set is all the local minima of the loss landscape. Such a program has a very special property: while it is running, you can change the value of &#x3B8; (e.g. via a debugger), and the program will probably <em>still work</em>. This is quite impressive: certainly most programs would not work if you arbitrarily changed the value of one of the variables in the middle of execution. Thus, this is an optimizing system that is robust to perturbations in &#x3B8;. Of course, it isn&#x2019;t robust to arbitrary perturbations: if you change any other variable in the program, it will probably stop working. In general, we can quantify how powerful an optimizing system is by how robust it is to perturbations, and how small the target configuration set is.</p><p>The bottle cap example is <em>not</em> an optimizing system because there is no broad basin of configurations from which we get to the bottle being full of water. The bottle cap doesn&#x2019;t cause the bottle to be full of water when it didn&#x2019;t start out full of water.</p><p>Optimizing systems are a superset of goal-directed agentic systems, which require a separation between the optimizer and the thing being optimized. For example, a tree is certainly an optimizing system (the target is to be a fully grown tree, and it is robust to perturbations of soil quality, or if you cut off a branch, etc). However, it does not seem to be a goal-directed agentic system, as it would be hard to separate into an &#x201C;optimizer&#x201D; and a &#x201C;thing being optimized&#x201D;.</p><p>This does mean that we can no longer ask &#x201C;what is doing the optimization&#x201D; in an optimizing system. This is a feature, not a bug: if you expect to always be able to answer this question, you typically get confusing results. For example, you might say that your liver is optimizing for making money, since without it you would die and fail to make money.</p><p>The full post has several other examples that help make the concept clearer.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I&#x2019;ve <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/DfcywmqRSkBaCB6Ma/intuitions-about-goal-directed-behavior\">previously argued</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/bbd47ba94e84/alignment-newsletter-35\">AN #35</a></strong>) that we need to take generalization into account in a definition of optimization or goal-directed behavior. This definition achieves that by primarily analyzing the robustness of the optimizing system to perturbations. While this does rely on a notion of counterfactuals, it still seems significantly better than any previous attempt to ground optimization.</p><p>I particularly like that the concept doesn&#x2019;t force us to have a separate agent and environment, as that distinction does seem quite leaky upon close inspection. I gave a shot at explaining several other concepts from AI alignment within this framework in <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/znfkdCoHMANwqc2WE/the-ground-of-optimization-1?commentId=NAB5KjHQTwva4tghy\">this comment</a></strong>, and it worked quite well. In particular, a computer program is a goal-directed AI system if there is an environment such that adding the computer program to the environment transforms it into an optimizing system for some &#x201C;interesting&#x201D; target configuration states (with one caveat explained in the comment).</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>AGENT FOUNDATIONS </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks/public-static-what-is-abstraction\">Public Static: What is Abstraction?</a></strong> <em>(John S Wentworth)</em> (summarized by Rohin): If we are to understand embedded agency, we will likely need to understand abstraction (see <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction\">here</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ff565f097630/an-83-sample-efficient-deep-learning-with-remixmatch\">AN #83</a></strong>)). This post presents a view of abstraction in which we abstract a low-level territory into a high-level map that can still make reliable predictions about the territory, for some set of queries (whether probabilistic or causal).</p><p>For example, in an ideal gas, the low-level configuration would specify the position and velocity of <em>every single gas particle</em>. Nonetheless, we can create a high-level model where we keep track of things like the number of molecules, average kinetic energy of the molecules, etc which can then be used to predict things like pressure exerted on a piston.</p><p>Given a low-level territory L and a set of queries Q that we&#x2019;d like to be able to answer, the minimal-information high-level model stores P(Q | L) for every possible Q and L. However, in practice we don&#x2019;t start with a set of queries and then come up with abstractions, we instead develop crisp, concise abstractions that can answer many queries. One way we could develop such abstractions is by only keeping information that is visible from &#x201C;far away&#x201D;, and throwing away information that would be wiped out by noise. For example, when typing 3+4 into a calculator, the exact voltages in the circuit don&#x2019;t affect anything more than a few microns away, except for the final result 7, which affects the broader world (e.g. via me seeing the answer).</p><p>If we instead take a systems view of this, where we want abstractions of multiple different low-level things, then we can equivalently say that two far-away low-level things should be independent of each other <em>when given their high-level summaries</em>, which are supposed to be able to quantify all of their interactions.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy\">Abstraction sequence</a></strong></p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I really like the concept of abstraction, and think it is an important part of intelligence, and so I&#x2019;m glad to get better tools for understanding it. I especially like the formulation that low-level components should be independent given high-level summaries -- this corresponds neatly to the principle of encapsulation in software design, and does seem to be a fairly natural and elegant description, though of course abstractions in practice will only approximately satisfy this property.</p><h2>LEARNING HUMAN INTENT </h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09089\">Safe Imitation Learning via Fast Bayesian Reward Inference from Preferences</a></strong> <em>(Daniel S. Brown et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Bayesian reward learning would allow for rigorous safety analysis when performing imitation learning. However, Bayesian reward learning methods are typically computationally expensive to use. This is because a separate MDP needs to be solved for each reward hypothesis. The main contribution of this work is a proposal for a more efficient reward evaluation scheme called Bayesian REX (see also an <strong><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04472\">earlier version</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/598f425b1533/an-86-improving-debate-and-factored-cognition-through-human-experiments\">AN #86</a></strong>)). It works by pre-training a low-dimensional feature encoding of the observation space which allows reward hypotheses to be evaluated as a linear combination over the learned features. Demonstrations are ranked using pair-wise preference which is relativistic and thus conceptually easier for a human to evaluate. Using this method, sampling and evaluating reward hypotheses is extremely fast: 100,000 samples in only 5 minutes using a PC. Moreover, Bayesian REX can be used to play Atari games by finding a most likely or mean reward hypothesis that best explains the ranked preferences and then using that hypothesis as a reward function for the agent.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06387\">T-REX</a></strong></p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> It&apos;s worth emphasizing that this isn&apos;t quite a pure IRL method. They use preferences over demonstrations in addition to the demonstrations themselves and so they have more information than would be available in a pure IRL context. However, it&#x2019;s also worth emphasizing that (as the authors show) pixel-level features make it difficult to use IRL or GAIL to learn an imitation policy, which means I wasn&#x2019;t expecting a pure IRL approach to work here. Conceptually, what&apos;s interesting about the Bayesian approach is that uncertainty in the reward distribution translates into confidence intervals on expected performance. This means that Bayesian REX is fairly robust to direct attempts at reward hacking due to the ability to directly measure overfitting to the reward function as high variance in the expected reward.</p><h2>PREVENTING BAD BEHAVIOR </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06547\">Avoiding Side Effects in Complex Environments</a></strong> <em>(Alexander Matt Turner, Neale Ratzlaff et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Previously, attainable utility preservation (AUP) has been used to <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mDTded2Dn7BKRBEPX/penalizing-impact-via-attainable-utility-preservation\">solve</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/036ba834bcaf/alignment-newsletter-39\">AN #39</a></strong>) some simple gridworlds. Can we use it to avoid side effects in complex high dimensional environments as well? This paper shows that we can, at least in <strong><a href=\"https://www.partnershiponai.org/safelife/\">SafeLife</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/1acb030735dd/an-91concepts-implementations-problems-and-a-benchmark-for-impact-measurement\">AN #91</a></strong>). The method is simple: first train a VAE on random rollouts in the environment, and use randomly generated linear functions of the VAE features as the auxiliary reward functions for the AUP penalty. The Q-functions for these auxiliary reward functions can be learned using deep RL algorithms. Then we can just do regular deep RL using the specified reward and the AUP penalty. It turns out that this leads to fewer side effects with just <em>one</em> auxiliary reward function and a VAE whose latent space is size <em>one</em>! It also leads to faster learning for some reason. The authors hypothesize that this occurs because the AUP penalty is a useful shaping term, but don&#x2019;t know why this would be the case.</p><h2>FORECASTING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFJcvyxpGSo\">Reasons you might think human level AI soon is unlikely</a></strong> <em>(Asya Bergal)</em> (summarized by Rohin): There is a lot of disagreement about AI timelines, that can be quite decision-relevant. In particular, if we were convinced that there was a &lt; 5% chance of AGI in the next 20 years, that could change the field&#x2019;s overall strategy significantly: for example, we might focus more on movement building, less on empirical research, and more on MIRI&#x2019;s agent foundations research. This talk doesn&apos;t decisively answer this question, but discusses three different sources of evidence one might have for this position: the results of expert surveys, trends in compute, and arguments that current methods are insufficient for AGI.</p><p>Expert surveys usually suggest a significantly higher than 5% chance of AGI in 20 years, but this is quite sensitive to the specific framing of the question, and so it&#x2019;s not clear how informative this is. If we instead ask experts what percentage of their field has been solved during their tenure and extrapolate to 100%, the extrapolations for junior researchers tend to be optimistic (decades), whereas those of senior researchers are pessimistic (centuries).</p><p>Meanwhile, the <strong><a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/\">amount spent on compute</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/3e550712419a/alignment-newsletter-7\">AN #7</a></strong>) has been increasing rapidly. At the estimated trend, it would hit $200 billion in 2022, which is within reach of large governments, but would presumably have to slow down at that point, potentially causing overall AI progress to slow. Better price performance (how many flops you can buy per dollar) might compensate for this, but hasn&apos;t been growing at comparable rates historically.</p><p>Another argument is that most of our effort is now going into deep learning, and methods that depend primarily on deep learning are insufficient for AGI, e.g. because they can&#x2019;t use human priors, or can&#x2019;t do causal reasoning, etc. Asya doesn&#x2019;t try to evaluate these arguments, and so doesn&#x2019;t have a specific takeaway.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> While there is a lot of uncertainty over timelines, I don&#x2019;t think under 5% chance of AGI in the next 20 years is very plausible. Claims of the form &#x201C;neural nets are fundamentally incapable of X&#x201D; are almost always false: recurrent neural nets are Turing-complete, and so can encode arbitrary computation. Thus, the real question is whether we can <em>find</em> the parameterization that would correspond to e.g. causal reasoning.</p><p>I&#x2019;m quite sympathetic to the claim that this would be very hard to do: neural nets find the simplest way of doing the task, which usually does not involve general reasoning. Nonetheless, it seems like by having more and more complex and diverse tasks, you can get closer to general reasoning, with <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\">GPT-3</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/2485e6b42012/an-102-meta-learning-by-gpt-3-and-a-list-of-full-proposals-for-ai-alignment\">AN #102</a></strong>) being the latest example in this trend. Of course, even then it may be hard to reach AGI due to limits on compute. I&#x2019;m not claiming that we already have general reasoning, nor that we necessarily will get it soon: just that it seems like we can&#x2019;t rule out the possibility that general reasoning does happen soon, at least not without a relatively sophisticated analysis of how much compute we can expect in the future and some lower bound on how much we would need for AGI-via-diversity-of-tasks.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/\">Relevant pre-AGI possibilities</a></strong> <em>(Daniel Kokotajlo)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This page lists 47 things that could plausibly happen before the development of AGI, that could matter for AI safety or AI policy. You can also use the web page to generate a very simple trajectory for the future, as done in this <strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd6qQx-SP6rfAVQE5rzfPH0zXYOOHXBa13JSUd2zROQ/edit\">scenario</a></strong> that Daniel wrote up.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think this sort of reasoning about the future, where you are forced into a scenario and have to reason what must have happened and draw implications, seems particularly good for ensuring that you don&#x2019;t get too locked in to your own beliefs about the future, which will likely be too narrow.</p><h2>MISCELLANEOUS (ALIGNMENT) </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QSBgGv8byWMjmaGE5/preparing-for-the-talk-with-ai-projects\">Preparing for &quot;The Talk&quot; with AI projects</a></strong> <em>(Daniel Kokotajlo)</em> (summarized by Rohin): At some point in the future, it seems plausible that there will be a conversation in which people decide whether or not to deploy a potentially risky AI system. So one class of interventions to consider is interventions that make such conversations go well. This includes raising awareness about specific problems and risks, but could also include identifying people who are likely to be involved in such conversations <em>and</em> concerned about AI risk, and helping them prepare for such conversations through training, resources, and practice. This latter intervention hasn&apos;t been done yet: some simple examples of potential interventions would be generating official lists of AI safety problems and solutions which can be pointed to in such conversations, or doing &quot;practice runs&quot; of these conversations.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I certainly agree that we should be thinking about how we can convince key decision makers of the level of risk of the systems they are building (whatever that level of risk is). I think that on the current margin it&apos;s much more likely that this is best done through better estimation and explanation of risks with AI systems, but it seems likely that the interventions laid out here will become more important in the future.</p><h1>AI STRATEGY AND POLICY </h1><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/6/290/htm\">Medium-Term Artificial Intelligence and Society</a></strong> <em>(Seth D. Baum)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Like a <strong><a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/resources/beyond-near-long-term/\">previously summarized paper</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/0180cf9ba264/an-90how-search-landscapes-can-contain-self-reinforcing-feedback-loops\">AN #90</a></strong>), this paper aims to find common ground between near-term and long-term priorities in medium-term concerns. This can be defined along several dimensions of an AI system: when it chronologically appears, how feasible it is to build it, how certain it is that we can build it, how capable the system is, how impactful the system is, and how urgent it is to work on it.</p><p>The paper formulates and evaluates the plausibility of the <em>medium term AI hypothesis</em>: that there is an intermediate time period in which AI technology and accompanying societal issues are important from both presentist and futurist perspectives. However, it does not come to a strong opinion on whether the hypothesis is true or not.</p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p>I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=\"https://rohinshah.com/\">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

Take for example this adversarial example of a pig classified as an airliner:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/k0y092qcxx3cy4c/pig_adversarial.png?raw=1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Imagine that the neural net was not only classifying \"pig\" and \"airliner\", but other things like \"has wings\" and \"has fur\".</p>\n<p>Then the \"pig-airliner\" doesn't have wings, and has fur, which are features of pigs but not airliners. Of course, you could build an adversarial model that also breaks \"has wings\" and \"has fur\", but, hopefully, the more features that need to be faked, the harder it would become.</p>\n<p>This suggests that, as algorithms get smarter, they will become more adept at avoiding adversarial examples - as long as the ultimate question is clear.

I&#x2019;ve been told there&#x2019;s a real debt to Robert Trivers, which I hope to educate myself on shortly. I may just be reinventing signal theory.</em></p><p>In the beginning there was defection.</p><p>We can treat a prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma as an elegant stand-in for coordination more generally. A one-off dilemma has as its ideal solution defection. <em>Bellum omnium contra omnes</em>: the war of all against all, or, &#x201C;hyper-individualism.&#x201D;</p><p>At the same time, it is clear that many of the &#x201C;benefits sought by living things&#x201D;[1]&#x2014;which is to say, that which assists survival&#x2014;are more readily reached by group effort. </p><p>Crucially, an iterated prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma has the <em>opposite</em> optimal equilibrium: tit-for-tat, or cooperation, in its many variations, its various guises. And so the trick becomes how to switch individuals over from one-offs onto iterated dilemmas. The technology which achieves this is <em>reputation</em>, allowing formation of a ledger anchored to names[2], faces, identities. Individuals sharing an ecosystem continually run into each other, and given a reputation ledger, cannot defect and &#x201C;get away&#x201D; with it, continuing to freeride into oblivion.[3]</p><p>Tit-for-tat is exceedingly simple. It enables mutualism (in symbiosis[4]) and is practiced internally to species as diverse as stickleback fish, tree swallows, all primates, bats. All it requires is a sense of continuous identity and tracking of that identity&#x2019;s (recent-)historical actions. We can take bats as an example: Since mothers&#x2019; hunting returns are unequally distributed, but bat babies do better when consistently fed, mothers communally share food. But should a researcher pump up a mother&#x2019;s gullet full of air, so it appears she had a strong return but is refusing to share, suddenly the other mothers will no longer feed her children, will allow them to starve. </p><p>We can read human progress as a history of instituting cooperation. The Stele of Hammurabi&#x2019;s famous law is eye for an eye; many of its other decrees are variations thereof: if a building collapses and kills its occupant, its builder shall be put to death as well. The Old Testament introduces the Commandments, the laws of Exodus. Almost every major religion has its in-house variation on the Golden Rule. These are efforts at securing internal coordination of the group, which <em>a la </em>&#x201C;<u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GZSzMqr8hAB2dR8pk/studies-on-slack\">Studies on Slack</a></u>&#x201D; and multi-level selection theory, will outcompete other groups once instituted. I have heard from reliable sources that laws in the Quran, and many other major religious texts, have similar structures. </p><p>But vanilla tit-for-tat reputational ledgers, like a barter system, are difficult and costly to continuously verify. It requires small, local communities of recognition, and prevents civilizations from scaling up. And so there was a need for currency, for credit, for the accumulation, transportation, and commensurability of capital, all of which together say: <em>this individual cooperates</em>. (Or to generalize across contexts, since optics signal more broadly than mere cooperation: <em>This individual carries value; an interaction with her will be positive-sum</em>.) This currency needed to be legible and exchanged across markets, across subcommunities. For these and a thousand other reasons we invented proxies, heuristics, measurements; instituted CVs, letters of recommendation, titles of achievement and nobility, and of course, <em>fashion</em>. But currency is easily counterfeited.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Clothing arises to serve object-level purposes: warmth from cold, shelter from sun. But soon it gives rise in turn to fashion: equally tactical, but suited for the social, rather than literal, landscape. (For a social being, both are essential to survival.) Because the garments, the choices of paint pigment, the geometric patterns and metal hanging from the ears, reflected both the wealth of the individual and his affiliation to group, they became sources of information for recipients, on-lookers: ways of deducing whole from part, of grokking a person. As social reality devours the physical&#x2014;in Baudrillard&#x2019;s terms, <em>simulacra</em>&#x2014;thus fashion devours its mother.</p><p>In the Upper-Middle Paleolithic Transition, human societies and economies grow increasingly complex. Trade deals and diplomacy are performed among credible spokesmen, and social hierarchies need preservation across interactions between strangers. Fashion enters as a technology for maintaining and navigating the social graph. &#x201C;By the production of symbolic artefacts that signified different social groups and kinds of relationships, Aurignacian people were able to maintain wider networks that could exist even between people who had never set eyes on each other,&#x201D; giving them a competitive advantage. The practice spreads through the law of cultural evolution: &#x201C;The surface of the body&#x2026; becomes the symbolic stage upon which the drama of socialisation is enacted, and body adornment&#x2026; becomes the language through which it was expressed.&#x201D;[5] We have entered the second stage of simulacra. The territory has a map, and there are parties interested in manipulating it.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Or consider the butterfly. A &#x201C;protected&#x201D; species (poisonous, inedible, etc) gains a survival advantage through <em>honest signaling </em>of this protection. An honest signal is a Pareto improvement&#x2014;a win-win. The butterfly does not wish to be eaten; the predator does not wish to eat a toxic insect. How does it evolve this protection?</p><p>Brute association. The outward phenotypic expression of the butterfly&#x2014;its <em>public information</em>&#x2014;becomes associated with some interior, private information&#x2014;its toxicity. Let&#x2019;s say the distinctive pattern is black and red. A predator cannot tell whether an insect is toxic from sight, but it can tell by <em>proxy</em>. In other words, the butterfly develops a reputation.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Once this association between optics and essence, between appearance and reality, between signal and quality (the biological frame) or public and private information (the economic one), is formed, it can be freeridden. It becomes, in most cases, easier to pay &#x201C;lip service&#x201D;&#x2014;to outwardly express the associated public characteristic&#x2014;than it is to to develop the private characteristic. This is not entirely the fault of the freerider; it is a difficult situation he finds himself in. Imagine he &#x201C;chooses&#x201D; (I&#x2019;m anthropomorphizing evolution) to remain with his blue and yellow colors: even if his &#x201C;product&#x201D; is &#x201C;good&#x201D; (I&#x2019;m mixing metaphors, but I mean to say, his <em>advertising</em> is <em>honest</em>), it will take some time for a trusted association between signal and quality, public and private, to form. As consumers, we may initially disbelieve an advertiser&#x2019;s claims, and for good reason, since there is incentive to deceive. And thus it is with the sun-basking lizard, deciding which butterfly to eat. Far easier for a precarious insect to ride coattails, to imitate and pretend toward what he is not&#x2014;and so, quite simply, it does.</p><p>The connection with fashion should come into view now. The &#x201C;barberpole&#x201D; metaphor of fashion, where lower classes continually imitate higher classes, who are themselves engaged in a continual quest for &#x201C;distinction&#x201D; from the chasing  masses, is a popular one in rationalist circles for good reason. Its cyclical nature is the result of limited options and a continual evasion of freeriders who exploit an associative proxy: clothing for caste.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>A quick inventory of where we are: Individuals profit from cooperation, but are always personally incentivized to defect. Reputation ledgers switch us from the one-off tit-for-tat, and its incentivized defection, into an iterated tit-for-tat, and its incentivized cooperation. As civilizations scale, and we wish to do more with what we have, achieve new complexities, we move to an alternate system. A credit system of heuristic and proxy. Thus an individual who wishes to enter the art world will work internships in which she forges relationships of trust, in the hope that she will be recommended. And the employer who takes the recommendation will do so on account of having built up trust with the recommender; this trust is built by history, and its credits are transferable. (Each exchange, of course, comes with a diminishment.) Across many recommendations and positions, across many cities, the accumulating recommendations become virtualized: not only can one fabricate a CV, but one can embellish it, and the latter behavior is so ubiquitous it is hard to call it &#x201C;cheating,&#x201D; even though this is what a dishonest signal <em>is</em>. And, at the same time, this intern will find herself competing in a much larger implicit landscape of associations, in which the clothes she wears, the way she speaks, and a hundred other variables come together to&#x2014;by proxy&#x2014;provide further evidence of value.</p><p>Imagine that a bat mother, instead of having her gullets pumped full of air by researchers, developed a technology to achieve the opposite: to appear as if she <em>had not </em>caught insects, when in reality she had. In other words, to appear as if she was cooperating when in <em>fact</em> she was defecting. To present public information at odds with private information. This bat&#x2019;s offspring would be most fit, would pass on its genes at higher rates. This bat would have discovered the miracle of optics. But it is a dark, and short-term miracle: the population as a whole would lose its fitness, as its ability to cooperate diminished.</p><p>It is better to cooperate than defect. But it is better still to defect while others around you cooperate: to reap the advantages of coordinated effort while contributing none of the work (freeriding). This behavior is blocked insofar as it is noticed. Social systems are not two-player, but N-player games, and resemble <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods_game\">public goods games</a></u> more than prisoners dilemmas, and thus even in the presence of parasites, it can be optimal for other players to invest in the pool.[6] But freeriders remain a burden on the system that rational players will wish to eliminate.</p><p>While an honest signal is beneficial to all parties involved&#x2014;it adds <em>true information </em>to the informational ecosystem which actors can base actions on&#x2014;a dishonest signal is definitionally exploitative. It causes another self-interested actor to behave against its interest, because its premises are malformed. It causes the sun-basking lizard to pass up on the butterfly, believing it to be protected, when in reality, it is only masquerading. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>This is the tragedy of appearances. The cheater is punished if he is caught cheating; a society which punishes cheaters (or &#x201C;parasites&#x201D;) outperforms that which does not; and thus his optimal behavior will always be to cheat <em>and </em>pretend otherwise, to evade enforcers. He can do this by means of appearance, and the more that appearance is selected for, the more easily he can simply pretend, while embodying none of the internal, proxied-for qualities. <em>freerider situations don&#x2019;t work when the supporting actor can recognize freeriding, </em>thus the trick, if one wishes to continue freeriding, is to prevent such a recognition.</p><p>This is the superset of Goodhart-Campbell. The solution is the superset of costly signaling. The greater the divergence in the incentive structure between proxy and proxied, the greater the incentives to optimize for appearance. Thus we can understand politics, where everything &#x201C;real&#x201D; is hidden behind a great veil, and public image carefully manipulated. Thus we can understand Baudrillard&#x2019;s simulacra, at least in its steelmanned form: the first level is <em>honest </em>signaling, a one-to-one relationship between public and private. Levels 2-4 are self-aware manipulations, &#x201C;complex patterns of strategic interactions,&#x201D;[7] and if you believe Baudrillard, we are long past naivete, between simple one-to-oneness. An unsophisticated relationship to maps is a departure point, not a finish.</p><p>The tragedy of appearances, and our incessant optimization thereof, is a problem society does not yet seem to have stable solutions to. Taleb might admonish us, in <em>Skin In The Game</em>, to never trust a surgeon who looks the part, to never employee a straight-A student&#x2014;but while wise as manipulations of the current fashion field, these are inherently unstable and contingent solutions. As soon as we would follow his advice we would see surgeons trending toward slovenliness, students strategically achieving B-grades in Bio for the sake of seeming interesting. Those familiar with Goodhard-Campbell know the pattern well, and the only answers are the same: diminish the gap between incentivized appearance and desired behavior.

I always want to see a <strong>half-baked product</strong>.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*8vczYs4FG6cGvbcK.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>You can half-bake something in an hour or two, or even in a few minutes.</p><p>The advantage of half-baking is that you get a quick feedback loop. The more you think there&#x2019;s a possibility that I&#x2019;ll say &#x201C;no, that&#x2019;s not what I wanted&#x201D;, the more half-baked you should make your first effort before getting my feedback.</p><p>When brainstorming ideas, my term for a half-baked idea is a <strong>kernel</strong>. A kernel is usually a crappy idea on its own, but there&#x2019;s &#x201C;something to it&#x201D; that could make it the seed of a better idea. I encourage people to toss out kernels.</p><p>There are two reasons why operating this way is efficient:</p><h1><strong>Diminishing Returns on Time Spent</strong></h1><p>Say you work on something for 100 hours. While each hour adds value, typically the highest-value hour is the first hour and the lowest-value hour is the last hour, and it follows a curve like this:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*K49kJVbKPGxfQuknR3dkTg.jpeg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>For example, if you&apos;re going to spend 100 hours writing a long report, spending one hour to brain-dump the key bullet points would give a reader a lot more than 1% of the final value of your report. Realistically, it&#x2019;s probably more like 20%.</p><p>So the less time you spend working before getting feedback, the higher your productivity was in that time.</p><h1><strong>Efficient Course Correction</strong></h1><p>When you&#x2019;re starting out on a new project that isn&#x2019;t well-understood, you&#x2019;re unlikely to go in the exact right direction. So you don&#x2019;t want to go too far before getting a course correction, or you&#x2019;ll waste time.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*EVbMOCz2ASlAZyjv2-QXuA.jpeg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>The top path shows how most people waste their time by investing too much effort between course corrections. The bottom path shows the efficient approach: you do a small chunk of work, then get feedback from your boss or your customers to correct your course, then do the next small chunk of work.</p><p>Once your course corrections become small, you can do larger chunks of work between course corrections. Until then, take small steps that produce half-baked products and idea kernels.</p>",

A habit you want to install, or a plan you’d like to execute, or a project you want to complete.</li>\n<li>Outline your plan. Be sure to list next actions, concrete steps, and specific deadlines or benchmarks.

It’s been months, and you’ve made little or no progress! Where are you, on the scale from yeah, that sounds right to I literally don’t understand what happened? If you’re completely shocked—good job, your inner sim endorses your plan! If you’re not, though, go to Step 4.</li>\n<li>Pre-hindsight. Try to construct a plausible narrative for what kept you from succeeding. Remember to look at both internal and external factors.</li>\n<li>Bulletproofing. What actions can you take to prevent these hypothetical failure modes? Visualize taking those preemptive actions and then ask your inner sim “What comes next?” Have you successfully defused the danger?</li>\n<li>Iterate steps 3-5. That’s right—it’s not over yet! Even with your new failsafes, your plan still failed. Are you shocked? If so, victory! If not—keep going.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems like this process presumes that mitigations are low-cost and that the project you are trying to achieve is fundamentally achievable according to your inner sim. Most of this is presumption is contained in step 3. I've been thinking about how to apply this process to projects in a professional context (rather than a \"self-help\" context I guess) and in many cases you face costly tradeoffs regarding derisking mitigations. Also, sometimes your project may just be a big bet.</p>\n<p>How do you change Murphyjitsu to work in such situations? Also, if people have experiences using Murphyjitsu in projects (e.g. a 1-3 month project involving a small team people), I'd be interested in learning how it's different.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5WECpYABCT62TJrhY/will-ai-undergo-discontinuous-progress\">have previously argued </a>for two claims about AI takeoff speeds. First, almost everyone agrees that if we had AGI, progress would be very fast. Second, the major disagreement is between those who think progress will be discontinuous and sudden (such as Eliezer Yudkowsky, MIRI) and those who think progress will be very fast by normal historical standards but continuous (Paul Chrisiano, Robin Hanson).</p><blockquote>What do I mean by &#x2018;discontinuous&#x2019;? If we were to graph world GDP over the last 10,000 years, it fits onto a <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/22/1960-the-year-the-singularity-was-cancelled/\">hyperbolic growth pattern</a></u>.  We could call this &#x2018;continuous&#x2019; since it is following a single trend,  or we could call it &#x2018;discontinuous&#x2019; because, on the scale of millennia,  the industrial revolution exploded out of nowhere. I will call these  sorts of hyperbolic trends &#x2018;continuous, but fast&#x2019;, in line with Paul  Christiano, who argued for continuous takeoff, defining it <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/\">this way</a>:</blockquote><blockquote>AI is just another, faster step in the<u><a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2017/10/04/hyperbolic-growth/\"> hyperbolic growth we are currently experiencing</a></u>, which corresponds to a further increase in rate but not a discontinuity (or even a discontinuity in rate).</blockquote><blockquote>I&#x2019;ll  be using Paul&#x2019;s understanding of &#x2018;discontinuous&#x2019; and &#x2018;fast&#x2019; here. For  progress in AI to be discontinuous, we need a switch to a new growth  mode, which will show up as a step function in the capability of AI or  in the rate of change of the capability of the AI over time. For takeoff  to be fast, it is enough that there is one single growth mode that is  hyperbolic or some other function that is very fast-growing.</blockquote><p>This post tries to build on a simplified mathematical model of takeoff which was first put forward by Eliezer Yudkowsky and then refined by Bostrom in Superintelligence, modifying it to account for the different assumptions behind continuous, fast progress as opposed to discontinuous progress. As far as I can tell, few people have touched these sorts of simple models since the early 2010&#x2019;s, and no-one has tried to formalize how newer notions of continuous takeoff fit into them. I find that it is surprisingly easy to accommodate continuous progress and that the results are intuitive and fit with what has already been said qualitatively about continuous progress.</p><p><em>The code for the model can be found <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/bC6Nb19U\">here</a>.</em></p><h1>The Model</h1><p>The original mathematical model was put forward <u><a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9wZnasT3uXzmFCcaB/sustained-strong-recursion\">here</a></u> by Eliezer Yudkowsky in 2008:</p><blockquote>In our world where human brains run at constant speed (and eyes and hands work at constant speed), Moore&#x2019;s Law for computing power <em>s</em> is:</blockquote><blockquote>s = R(t) = e^t</blockquote><blockquote>...</blockquote><blockquote>So to understand what happens when the Intel engineers themselves run on computers (and use robotics) subject to Moore&#x2019;s Law, we recursify and get:</blockquote><blockquote>dy/dt = s = R(y) = e^y</blockquote><blockquote>Here <em>y</em> is the total amount of elapsed <em>subjective</em> time, which at any given point is increasing according to the computer speed <em>s</em> given by Moore&#x2019;s Law, which is determined by the same function R that describes how Research converts elapsed subjective time into faster computers. Observed human history to date roughly matches the hypothesis that R is exponential with a doubling time of eighteen subjective months (or whatever).</blockquote><p>In other words, we start with </p><div><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"I(t)=e^t\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.064em;\">I</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">e</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.584em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div><p>because we assume speed is a reasonable proxy for general optimization power, and progress in processing speed is currently exponential.

padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">d</span></span></span></span></span></span> and the overall strength of the RSI <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"s\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span></span></span></span></span>, with a few simplifying assumptions - that Bostrom&apos;s 2012 model is correct and that RSI progress, like most technologies, follows a <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Logistic_function#In_economics_and_sociology:_diffusion_of_innovations\">logistic curve</a>. This model produces results that fit with what proponents of continuous progress expect - progress to superintelligence is smoother with more warning time, and occurs earlier.</p><h2>Appendix: &apos;Paul Slow&apos; Takeoff</h2><p>Paul Christiano&apos;s view is that takeoff will be both continuous and relatively slow - sufficiently slow that <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/precedents-for-economic-n-year-doubling-before-4n-year-doubling/\">this is the case:</a></p><blockquote>There will be a complete 4 year interval in which world  output doubles, before the first 1 year interval in which world output  doubles. (Similarly, we&#x2019;ll see an 8 year doubling before a 2 year  doubling, etc.)</blockquote><p>Does a slow continuous takeoff on this model replicate this? What we want is a scenario where you don&apos;t get intermediate doubling intervals at all in the discontinuous case, but you get at least one in the continuous case. Setting <em>s</em> relatively high appears to do the trick. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/RSjIKQH.png\">Here is a scenario </a>where we have very fast post-RSI growth with s=5,c=1,I0=1 and I_AGI=3.</p><p>I wrote some more code to produce plots of how long <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mw27P7H.png\">each complete interval of doubling took </a>in each scenario. The &apos;default&apos; rate with no contribution from RSI was 0.7. All the continuous scenarios had two complete doubling intervals over intermediate time frames before the doubling time collapsed to under 0.05 on the third doubling. The discontinuous model simply kept the original doubling interval until it collapsed to under 0.05 on the third doubling interval. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mw27P7H.png\">It&apos;s all in this graph</a>.</p><p>Let&apos;s make the irresponsible assumption that this actually applies to the real economy, with the current growth mode, non-RSI condition being given by the &apos;slow/no takeoff&apos;, s=0 condition.The current doubling time is <a href=\"https://openborders.info/double-world-gdp/\">a bit over 23 years</a>. In the shallow continuous progress scenario (red line), we get a 9 year doubling, a 4 year doubling and then a ~1 year doubling. In the discontinuous scenario (purple line) we get 2 23 year doublings and then a ~1 year doubling out of nowhere. In other words, this fairly random setting of the parameters (this was the second set I tried) gives us a Paul slow takeoff when progress is continuous.  <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/EE3AgMU.png\">You can see that graph here.</a> </p>",

Ulterior motive: AI safety (and also progress towards a university degree).</p>\n<h3>Motivation, Goal, Background</h3>\n<p>To my current understanding, any endeavor to figure out how to program<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-1\" id=\"fnref-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-1\">[1]</a></sup> safe AI would probably eventually<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-2\" id=\"fnref-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-2\">[2]</a></sup> benefit a lot from an ability to prove various properties of programs:<br>\nThe AI will have to self-modify, or create successor agents, i.e. (re)write (parts of) new AI-software; and we'd probably want the AI to be able to prove<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-3\" id=\"fnref-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-3\">[3]</a></sup> that said AI-software satisfies various \"safety properties\" (which I would not yet even know how to specify).</p>\n<p>I'd like to get closer to being able to design the above kind of AI, and to better understand (the limits of) proving things about programs. To my current tentative understanding, the knowledge I'm looking for probably lies mostly under the umbrella of type theory.</p>\n<p>(Also, I'm currently studying for a degree at a university and have the opportunity to choose a project for myself; and I think learning about type theory, lambda calculus, and/or automated theorem proving might be the most useful way to use that opportunity. (Since I don't see a way to pass deconfusion work off as a university project.))</p>\n<h4>Sub-goals, skills</h4>\n<p>To clarify the top-level goal here (viz. being able to design AIs that are able to prove stuff about AI-programs), I've listed below some (semi-)concrete examples of skills/abilities which I imagine would constitute progress towards said goal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Given a type system S and some property P of programs/terms, be able to\n(dis)prove that some, all, or no terms of S have property P.<br>\nAs simple concrete examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are programs in a given language guaranteed to terminate? (Do all terms in the given type system have normal forms?)</li>\n<li>Given some function F: Can some term in the given type system implement F?</li>\n<li>Does a given type system allow general recursion?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be able to write a program R that, given encodings of S, P, and a term T of S,<br>\nfinds a (dis)proof that T has property P (if doing so is possible).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Given a property P of programs, and a type system S,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>design a (minimal) type system S' that admits terms/programs R that are able to prove (as above) properties P of some/all terms of S</li>\n<li>or prove that no such type system S' exists (for P and S).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyze the computational complexity of finding a (dis)proof of term T having property P, for various T and P.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Understand the different ways that program-properties can be specified, and how different specification methods might affect (e.g.) the complexity of proving those properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be able to determine whether, when, and how<br>\ndesigning type systems would actually even be relevant/useful for building safe AI (sufficiently useful to merit spending time on it).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Questions</h3>\n<p>Problem: There appears to be a very wide variety of theory<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-4\" id=\"fnref-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-4\">[4]</a></sup> that might (or might not) be useful to the above goals. I lack the knowledge to discern what theory would be useful. And so, to avoid wasting a lot of time on studying non-useful things, my questions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>What would be good interventions for learning the above mentioned skills? (Ideally, the interventions would be something like studying a textbook, reading a bunch of papers, or programming a bare-bones theorem prover, or some other compact project that can be undertaken in 100h-200h of work; but any and all suggestions are very welcome.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are the skills/knowledge listed above actually useful to the stated top-level goal? (Are they even coherent?) Aside from the skills listed above, what would be some other useful skills or knowledge?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is your assessment of the (non-)usefulness to AI safety of developing the above kinds of skills? What about the (non-)usefulness to AI safety of studying type theory more generally? <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-3\" id=\"fnref-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-3:1\">[3:1]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Does the reasoning in this post make sense? What parts of this post feel most wrong or confused to you?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Update</h4>\n<p>I tried to read MIRI’s paper on <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/VingeanReflection.pdf\">Vingean reflection</a>, and skimmed <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/ProofProducingReflection.pdf\">Proof-producing reflection for HOL</a>, but didn’t understand much. Notable knowledge I seem to be missing includes things like</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modal logic, or provability logic, or some kind of proof theory</li>\n<li>More than a superficial familiarity with Gödel’s theorems</li>\n<li>Higher-order logic (I only have a basic familiarity with FOL).</li>\n<li>Possibly: Model theory?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now I’m wondering: How useful/necessary would it be to study those subjects? Would it be possible to approach the AI-proves-things-about-AI-software problem via type theory, without going much into the above? (Although I’m guessing that some kinds of incompleteness results à la Gödel would come up in type theory too.)</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>To program safe seed AI \"by hand\", as opposed to outsourcing the programming (/weight-finding) to e.g. gradient descent. <a href=\"#fnref-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>I'm guessing there's probably a large amount of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i3BTagvt3HbPMx6PN/embedded-agency-full-text-version\">deconfusion work</a> that would need to be done before program-verification-stuff becomes applicable to AI safety. <a href=\"#fnref-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-orPdNqhvaMiK8syhq-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>My (ignorant, fuzzy-intuition-based) guess is that in practice, to get over Vingean reflection / corrigibility problems, we'll need to use some means other than trying to design an AI that can <em>formally prove</em> complicated properties of AI-software it writes for itself.

Not hard, government mandated censorship, but censorship in the form of online mobs prepared to harass and threaten those seen to say the wrong thing.</p><p>The current choice for a rationalist with a controversial idea seems to be to publish it online, where the most angry mobs from around the world can access it easily, or not to publish at all. </p><p>My solution, digital infrastructure for a properly anonymous, hidden rationalist community.</p><p>Related to kolmogorov-complicity-and-the-parable-of-lightning (Now also deleted, but here are a few people discussing it)</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-has-religion-hindered-scientific-progress-during-the-reformation-period\">https://www.quora.com/How-has-religion-hindered-scientific-progress-during-the-reformation-period</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/78d8co/kolmogorov_complicity_and_the_parable_of_lightning/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/78d8co/kolmogorov_complicity_and_the_parable_of_lightning/</a></p><p>So we need to create the social norms and digital technologies to allow good rationalist content to be created without fear of mobs. My current suggestions include.</p><h2>Security</h2><p>1) Properly anonymous publishing. Each post that is put into this system is anonymous. If a rationalist posts many posts, then subtle clues about their identity could add up, so make each post independently anonymous. Given a specific post, you can&apos;t find others by the same author. Record nothing more than the actual post. With many rationalists putting posts into this system, and none of the posts attributable to a specific person, mobs won&apos;t be able to find a target. And noone knows who is putting posts into the pool at all. </p><p>2) Delay all published posts by a random time up to a week, we don&apos;t want to give info away about your timezone, do we. </p><p>3) Only certain people can access the content. Maybe restrict viewing to people with enough less wrong karma. Maybe rate limit it to 4 posts a day or something, to make it harder to scrape the whole anonymous site. (Unrestricted anonymous posting, restricted viewing is an unusual dynamic)</p><p>4) Of course only some posts will warrant such levels of paranoia, so maybe these features could be something that can be turned on and off independently.</p><p>My current model of online mobs is that they are not particularly good at updating on subtle strands of evidence and digging around online. One person who wants to stir up a mob does the digging, and then posts the result somewhere obvious. This raises the possibility of misinformation. If we can&apos;t stop one person putting our real name and address on a social media post where mobs can pass it around, could we put out other false names and addresses.</p><h2>Preventing Spam</h2><p>1) Precondition GPT-X on a sample of rationalist writings. Precondition another on samples of spam. Anything that causes more surprise on the rationalist net than the spam net is probably spam. (In general, AI based spam filtering)</p><p>2) Reuse codes. When you input a post, you can also put in a random codeword. Posts are given preferential treatment for the spam filtering if they are associated with a code that was also given with known good posts. codewords are hashed and salted before being stored on the server, along with a number representing reputation, and never shown. Posts are stored with their reputation + a small random offset. </p><p>3) Changing password. Every hour, come up with a new password. Whenever anyone with enough Karma requests any page, put the hours password in small text at the bottom of the page (or even in a html comment). When someone uses this password, you know that it was someone who visited some lesswrong page in the last hour, and can&apos;t tell who. You could restrict viewing with the same password. </p><p>I look forward to a discussion of which cryptographic protocols are most suitable for building this.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>When a nasty political problem (like the current <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/22/nyt-is-threatening-my-safety-by-revealing-my-real-name-so-i-am-deleting-the-blog/\">SSC</a> situation) hits my consciousness, I'm habituated to Do Something About It. I feel an urge to investigate the political climate, find allies, and fight back against the threat. In the current Internet age, and with my nonexistent political clout and social influence (especially considering I live in Iran and people here generally can't be counted on to know or care about global politics), the substitution bias kicks in; I substitute doing The Real Thing (to which my contribution would be very meager if any) with reading online forums (Reddit, Twitter, Lesswrong, SSC, Hackernews, ...)(substituted for \"investigate the political climate\"), voting the Correct posts in said forums and possibly writing some low-effort answers to particularly egregious pieces (\"find allies, and fight back\"), and generally feeling bad that I have failed the Mission (and that the Society is broken).</p>\n<p>I speculate that this fallacy probably has some evolutionary roots. In a hunter-gatherer tribe, a person such as myself (I estimate myself to be upper-mid status.) would have had a fair chance of affecting political change against causes that mostly hurt everyone but a minority of politicians who don't produce much value anyways. Especially since I (and my family) have been quite morally upstanding and honest, in a small community, we would have had a reputation to draw on. Even if not, engaging with the community would have been the essential first step in being part of a coalition, necessary for survival.</p>\n<p>Obviously, in the 21st century, all this is moot for political stuff that actually matters. Most people are quite powerless in affecting those matters, one reason being that the important issues now affect orders of magnitude more people. I don't know what the optimal strategy currently is. My gut feeling is that a lot of the good people are un-politicizing themselves and simply giving up. (Hasn't Scott's default defensive strategy been more (self)censorship?) Individual contributory power being what it is, this might actually be the best heuristic. If political \"activism\" consists mostly of low-skill low-reputation noise-making, a game of quantity over quality, then \"good\" people will immediately lose the comparative advantage. In fact, in Iran, the situation seems to be that the only marginally effective activism is violence. Which, in an authoritarian regime, obviously leaves the hungry and the criminal to fend off the evil. The second derivative of their numbers being positive because of abject government failure does not exactly lend me hope.</p>\n<p>To summarize; The old-world politics fallacy is the mistaken alief that you have meaningful political power in the 21st century. It often manifests via the substitution bias as fervent but ultimately zero-impact digital activity. Obviously, the fallacy leaves a bitter taste when you do notice that your efforts bore no fruits.</p>\n<p>A related phenomenon might be our largely unwarranted interest/motivation (the two are subtly different) for participating in social media that engage mostly with strangers. We are wired to find coalitions of like-minded people and join them, because like-minded people's values align better with our own. The modern era, by allowing our freedom and individuality to flourish, has allowed us to be ever more different than one another. Social media empower us to find and communicate with people much more precisely than is possible in the physical world. These two trends cause us to seek coalition-building in the cyberspace, when the cyberspace usually does not facilitate that function (yet). This will, necessarily, cause us to overvalue our social media interactions. (Because we have the alief that we are actually accumulating social capital when no such thing is happening.)</p>\n<p>I don't know what to call this cognitive error. \"Pseudo-socializing?\"</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>My life took a turn in 2015. That was when I first started drinking coffee on a regular basis. Not Americanos or Lattes, but &apos;<a href=\"https://expatliving.sg/local-coffee-in-singapore-all-you-need-to-know-about-kopi/\">Kopi</a>&apos; brewed with higher-caffeine Robusta beans using a &apos;sock&apos; immersed in water close to boiling temperature, extracting massive amounts of caffeine along with strong bitter notes that are neutralized by sweet, sugary condensed milk. </p><p>My rate of learning in sports shot up seemingly overnight. My field of vision and attention increased tremendously. I gained more stamina and muscle control. It wasn&apos;t just a subjective feeling. The results showed in the speed and accuracy of the pitches I threw.  The first training session I had with coffee was so productive, I almost swore that I would never train without it again.</p><p>Seeing its benefits, I began to use it for my studies as well. The hit of dopamine I got from starting problem sets with a cup of kopi was nothing like I&apos;d experienced before. While in the past I had to start slow and enter &apos;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">flow</a>&apos; gradually, this was a shortcut to the flow state. Sure, learning didn&apos;t happen instantly, and I still had to struggle, but I enjoyed the process. I felt unnaturally productive; my absorption of information shot up, and I could go at it for progressively longer hours. This was my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless_(film)\">NZT pill</a>.</p><p>Gradually, the more I was able to accomplish, the greater the aims I set for myself. I couldn&apos;t believe it. As a result of drinking coffee, my &apos;ambition&apos; increased because my self-judgement on learning ability and productivity increased. I had other strong reasons for working hard, but the biochemical changes that occurred in my brain and body after ingesting coffee brought an emotional multiplier to those reasons.</p><p>However, this is where complications came in. I slowly began to build up a heavy tolerance to it. When before it raised my energy and loosened my social inhibitions, I started &quot;zoning out&quot; with friends, craving for that focused mode where I could work on my studies. Initially, I attributed the gradual shelling up to the long hours of study and mental stress caused by the major exam at the end of the year. Only after abstaining from coffee for a period of time, did I think of linking that never-before-experienced social discomfort to coffee. </p><p>On hindsight, I realised that I might have been experiencing a mild but non-negligible form of anxiety that came from work-related stress, compounded by the spikes in cortisol and adrenaline my body was producing in reaction to coffee. The initial spike of motivation in getting things done was offset by the dreaded caffeine crash. The sharp contrast of focus and pleasure in pre-coffee and post-coffee states was what got me into daily consumption, but in the long run, consuming coffee at that rate was a net detriment. </p><p>This leads to a question I have been trying to solve, and would like to pose to the community: if a common beverage like coffee can cause such a marked increase in life satisfaction <em>and </em>work/study output, what other foods or practices can lead to the same changes in subjective state, and is sustainable on a time scale of decades? </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>(Talk given on Sunday 21st June, over a zoom call with 40 attendees. Alkjash is responsible for the talk, Ben Pace is responsible for the transcription.)</em></p><p><em><strong>Ben Pace: </strong>Our next speaker is someone you&apos;ll all know as Alkjash on LessWrong, who has written an awesome number of posts. Babble and Prune, Hammertime Final Exam &#x2013; which is one of my favorite names of a curated post on LessWrong. Alkjash, go for it.</em></p><h2>Prediction = Compression Talk</h2><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>I will be talking about a bit of mathematics today. It&apos;s funny that this audience is bigger than any I&apos;ve gotten in an actual maths talk. It&apos;s a bit depressing. Kind of makes me question my life choices...</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>Hopefully this mathematics is new to some of you. I&apos;m sure that the machine learning people know this already. The principle is that prediction is the same thing as compression. And what that means is that whenever you have a prediction algorithm, you can also get a correspondingly good compression algorithm for data you already have, and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>Let me dive straight into some examples. Take this sentence and try to fill in the vowels.</p><blockquote><em>Ppl bcm wh thy r mnt t b, Mss Grngr, by dng wht s rght.</em></blockquote><p>Translation:</p><div class=\"spoilers\"><p class=\"spoiler-v2\"><em>People become who they are meant to be, Miss Granger, by doing what is right.</em></p></div><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>You&apos;ll notice that it&apos;s actually quite easy, hopefully, to read the sentence, even though I&apos;ve taken out all the vowels. The human brain is very good at reconstructing certain kinds of missing data, and in some sense, that&apos;s a prediction algorithm, but immediately it also gives us a compression algorithm. If I take this sentence and I remove all the vowels, it&apos;s transmitting the same amount of data to a human brain because they can predict what&apos;s missing.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>This is a very simple example where you can predict with certainty what&apos;s missing. In general, we don&apos;t always have prediction algorithms that can predict the future with certainty. But anytime we can do better than chance, we can also get some compression improvements.</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>Here&apos;s a slightly more sophisticated example. Suppose I have a four character alphabet and I encode some language with a four character alphabet in this obvious default way. Each character is encoded in two bits, then the following string will be encoded in this fifth string.&#xA0;</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yVSaRz_KwVoNaRE0OuZ2x0lHRp5kcOaPcpIai_LD2s8CriLGjK4FumL6-bW_--XOhEGtu4Ti403edkReoya-WPS9zr65rgbMaq8BrtLU5DyaDk4kE0mdS5mvZC5fjbLPLHKNjL-Q\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>I&apos;ve highlighted every other code word for you to just see the emphasis. And you can see that this string has encoded as 32 bits in memory.</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>However, I might have a little more information or better priors about what this language looks like. I might know for example that As appear more frequently and Cs and Ds appear less frequently. Then I can choose a more suitable encoding for the task. I can choose a different encoding where A is given a shorter bit string because it appears more frequently, and C and D are given longer ones to balance that out. And, using this encoding instead, we see that the same string is encoded only 28 bits.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6987rkzqDuTLXO2wQKOKzrtlpmtn_GG1rphVDRKPy2S7UM1sDvgRPRpe8XoqrtV7HQpo-MgBV3fhIrOdO4HeTqMO5vdeinPs7WSEQWpZX0DDneIufRXqSKcQMthZ_3itlI5cdGe4\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>This time I didn&apos;t have any certainty about my predictions, but because I was able to do better than chance about predicting what the next character would be, I achieved a better compression ratio. I can store the same amount of data in memory with less bits.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p5cRk_opU0Karhon9zzndCcQWHkqK1mEWjEphU1cK53JHB7NgHINzr6dAGbXyQ7VXIO-dOHBS6dKJEBKbnAqwBbhgHVSTTzOE1rqwJTU8I9LmQGtPZiPmJkhcBTFZ6qneruzyNgr\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>The third example is very similar, but it&apos;s a different sort of prediction. Previously we just used letter frequencies, but now suppose I have a three character alphabet and I encode A as 0, B as 10, and C as 11, then by default I get 25 bits in this encoding.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>But now suppose I notice a different sort of pattern about this language, which here, the pattern is that no letter appears consecutively twice in a row. So, that&apos;s the different sort of predictive information from letter frequencies that we&apos;ve had before.</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>Perhaps you could think for a moment about how you could use that information to store the same memory in fewer bits. No two As appear twice in a row; no two Bs appear twice in a row; no two Cs appear twice in a row. How would you use that information to compress the data?</p><p><em>[Pause for thinking]</em></p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>Here&apos;s one way you might do it.</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>I&apos;m going to encode the first letter as whatever it would have been before, and then I&apos;ll draw this little triangle and each next letter, because it has to be different, will either be clockwise or counter-clockwise from the previous letter in this triangle that I&apos;ve drawn.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>So if the next letter is clockwise from my previous letter, I put down a zero. If the next letter is counter-clockwise from the previous letter, I put down a 1. And this is a very specific example of some very general algorithm in entropy encoding in the information theory.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vT-5nKwgysPKSC9A7Lx19pzwnOR86W0J0lEoFsdtMhgkiNzoxLagwi8xDTxpMa0HqwALi8g-trttkoSZTARLTZw5LG42Yn_Kl4m4Te4dYV8R8oEdP5E-3-C-qB8EGwZbCjwDvJKE\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>So whenever you have any sort of way of better predicting the future than chance, it corresponds to a better data compression algorithm for that type of data, where you store the same amount of information in your bits.</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>That&apos;s really all I have to say. So, I guess the question I want to open up for discussion about what this principle has applications in rationality. For example, we care a lot about super-forecasters predicting the future. Is it true that people who are good at predicting the future are good at storing the same amount of knowledge in their minds very efficiently? Are these very closely related skills?

And what sorts of things could be designed as, for example, rationality exercises for that, I&apos;d be interested to hear ideas about that.</p><h2>Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Thank you very much, Alkjash. I really like the idea of super-forecasters and super-compressors. I want to start a similar tournament for super-compressors.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> If any of you are interested, I have been personally interested in questions of which languages have the highest information rate. Perhaps with the newer neural networks, we might actually be close to answering this sort of question.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> By languages, you don&apos;t mean computer science languages?</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> No, I mean human languages. What language seems to use more letters per idea.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Interesting. Do you have a basic sense of which languages do compress things more?</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> Very naively, I expect things, for example languages with genders and other unnecessary dongles to be slightly worse, but I really don&apos;t know.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> All right, interesting. I think Jacob has a question.</p><p><strong>Jacob Lagerros:</strong> So, when we spoke about this yesterday, Alkjash, you gave some interesting examples of the third bullet point. I was curious if you wanted to share some of those now as well?</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> Sure, here&apos;s one example I&apos;m thinking about. So I have a general model about learning certain sorts of things. The model is that when you start out, there&apos;s so few data points that you just stick them into an array but as time goes on and you learn more stuff, your brain builds a more sophisticated data structure to store the same amount of data more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> For example, my wife and I occasionally have competed in <a href=\"https://www.sporcle.com/\">geography sporcles</a>, and one of the things we noticed is that I remember all the states as a visual map (I&apos;m a more spacial person) and where each state is. I tried to list out the states by going through vertically scanning my internal map of the United States; on the other hand, she remembers it by this alphabet song that she learned in elementary school.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> And so these are equally useful for the application of &#x2018;remembering the states&#x2019;. But when I turn to the addition of state capitals, my model seemed to be more useful for that because it&apos;s harder to fit in the state capitals into the alphabet song than into the geographical map, especially when I roughly already know where 10 or 20 of those cities would be geographically.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> Thinking about how these data representations&#x2026; it depends on the application, what compression actually means, I think.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Nice. Dennis, do you want to ask your question?</p><p><strong>Dennis:</strong> Looks like compression is related a little to the Zettlekasten system. Have you tried it, and what do you think about it?</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> I don&apos;t know anything about that. Could you explain what that is?</p><p><strong>Dennis:</strong> This is the system of compact little cards which is used to store information, not in categories but with links relating one to another, which was used by sociologists.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> I see. That&apos;s very interesting. Yeah, that seems like a very natural thing, closely related. It seems like, just naively, when I learn stuff, I start out just learning a list of things and then slowly, over time, what happens is the connection build up and making this more explicit. It seems like a great thing, to skip the whole store everything as an array and stuff, altogether.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Cool. Thanks, Dennis.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Gosh, I&apos;m excited by these questions. Abram if you want to go for it, you can go for it. Just for Alkjash&apos;s reference, Abram wrote that he had &quot;not a question, but a dumb argumentive comment relating this to my talk.&quot;</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> Yeah, so my dumb argumentive comment is, prediction does not equal compression. Sequential prediction equals compression. But non-sequential prediction is also important and does not equal compression. And so, compression doesn&apos;t capture everything about what it means to be a rational agent in the world, predicting things.</p><p><strong>Alkjash: </strong>Interesting.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> And by non-sequential prediction, I mean you have a sequence of bits in the information theory model, but if instead you have this broad array of things that you could think about, and you&apos;re not sure when any one of them will become observed, [then] you want all of your beliefs to be good, but you don&apos;t have any next bit... You can&apos;t express the goodness just in terms of this sequential goodness.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> I feel like there is some corresponding compression rate I could write down based on whatever you&apos;re being able to predict in this general non-sequential picture, but I haven&apos;t thought about it.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> Yeah. I think that you could get it into compression, but my claim is that compression won&apos;t capture all the notion of goodness.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> I see. Yeah...</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Abram will go into more depth I expect in his talk.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> I should also mention that if you wanted to look at more of that Zettlekasten thing Abram has written a solid introduction to the idea on LessWrong.</p><p><strong>Abram Demski:</strong> I am also a big fan of Zettlekasten, and recommend people check it out.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> All right, let me see. There was another question from Vaniver. You want to go for it?</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Yeah, so it seems to me like the idea of trying to compress your concepts, or like your understanding of the world that you already have, is a thing that we already do a lot of.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> It feels to me that abstraction and categorization, this is the big thing. I guess the interesting comment to add onto that is something like, there&apos;s lumping and splitting as distinct things that are worth thinking about, where lumping is sort of saying, okay I&apos;ve got a bunch of objects, how do I figure out the right categories that divide this in a small amount? And splitting is like, okay, I&apos;ve got &#x2018;all dogs&#x2019; or something and can I further subgroup within &#x2018;dogs&#x2019; and keep going down until I have a thing that is a concrete object?</p><p><strong>Vaniver</strong>: I think this is interesting to do because with real categories, it&apos;s much harder to find the right character encoding, or something. If we&apos;re looking at a bit-string like, we&#x2019;re like oh yeah, letters are letters. And sometimes you&apos;re like, oh actually maybe we want words instead of letters.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> That&apos;s right, yeah.</p><p><strong>Vaniver:</strong> Your conceptual understanding of the world, it feels like there&apos;s much more variation in what you care about for different purposes.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> Yeah, so I definitely agree that categorization is an important part of this compression. But I think, actually, probably the more important thing for compression is, as orthonormal says, having a model.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> Here&apos;s a good example that I&apos;ve thought about for a while. When I was playing Go, I spent about my first semester in college just studying Go 24/7 instead of going to class. At the end of those six months, I noticed that after playing a game, I could reproduce the entire game from memory. I don&apos;t know how much you guys know about Go, but it&apos;s a 19x19 board, and a game is placing down these black and white stones; there&apos;s probably 200 moves in the average game.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> And this skill that I have is not at all exceptional, I think almost anyone who becomes a strong amateur will be able to reproduce their games from memory after playing for about a year. The reason they achieve such a good memory, I claim, is because they&apos;re getting good compression and it&apos;s not because they&apos;re good at categorizing. It&apos;s because for the vast majority of moves, they can predict exactly what the next move is because they have a model of how players at their level play. Even though there&apos;s a 19x19 board, 90 percent of the time the next move is obvious.</p><p><strong>Alkjash:</strong> So, that&apos;s why there&apos;s so little data in that actual game.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> Cool, thanks. I wanted to just add one thought of mine which is: I think the super-forecasters and super-compressors idea is very fun, and I think if anyone wanted an idea for a LessWrong post to write and wanted to have a format in which to Babble a bit, something that&#x2019;s got different constraints, you could write one taking something like Tetlock&#x2019;s 10 Heuristics that Superforecasters Use and trying to turn them into 10 Heuristics that Supercompressors Use, and seeing if you come up with anything interesting there, I would be excited to read that.</p><p><strong>Ben Pace:</strong> All right, thanks a lot, Alkjash. I think we&apos;ll move next onto Abram.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Studying goal-directedness produces two kinds of questions: questions about goals, and questions about being directed towards a goal. Most of my previous posts focused on the second kind; this one shifts to the first kind.</p><p>Assume some goal-directed system with a known goal. The nature of this goal will influence which issues of safety the system might have. If the goal focuses on the input, the system might <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading\">wirehead</a> itself and/or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7b2RJJQ76hjZwarnj/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity\">game its specification</a>. On the other hand, if the goal lies firmly in the environment, the system might have <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Basic_AI_drives\">convergent instrumental subgoals</a> and/or destroy<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile\"> any unspecified value</a>.</p><p>Locality aims at capturing this distinction.</p><p>Intuitively, the locality of the system&apos;s goal captures how far away from the system one must look to check the accomplishment of the goal. </p><p>Let&apos;s give some examples:</p><ul><li>The goal of &quot;My sensor reaches the number 23&quot; is very local, probably maximally local.</li><li>The goal of &quot;Maintain the temperature of the room at 23 &#xB0;C&quot; is less local, but still focused on a close neighborhood of the system.</li><li>The goal of &quot;No death from cancer in the whole world&quot; is even less local.</li></ul><p>Locality isn&apos;t about how the system extract a model of the world from its input, but about whether and how much it cares about the world beyond it.</p><h1>Starting points</h1><p>This intuition about locality came from the collision of two different classification of goals: the first from from Daniel Dennett and the second from Evan Hubinger.</p><h2>Thermostats and Goals</h2><p>In &quot;The Intentional Stance&quot;, Dennett explains, extends and defends... the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance\">intentional stance</a>. One point he discusses is his liberalism: he is completely comfortable with admitting ridiculously simple systems like thermostats in the club of intentional systems -- to give them meaningful mental states about beliefs, desires and goals.</p><p>Lest we readers feel insulted at the comparison, Dennett nonetheless admits that the goals of a thermostat differ from ours.</p><blockquote>Going along with the gag, we might agree to grant [the thermostat] the capacity for about half a dozen different beliefs and fewer desires&#x2014;it can believe the room is too cold or too hot, that the boiler is on or off, and that if it wants the room warmer it should turn on the boiler, and so forth. But surely this is imputing too much to the thermostat; it has no concept of heat or of a boiler, for instance. So suppose we de-interpret its beliefs and desires: it can believe the A is too F or G, and if it wants the A to be more F it should do K, and so forth. After all, by attaching the thermostatic control mechanism to different input and output devices, it could be made to regulate the amount of water in a tank, or the speed of a train, for instance.</blockquote><p>The goals and beliefs of a thermostat are thus not about heat and the room it is in, as our anthropomorphic bias might suggest, but about the binary state of its sensor.</p><p>Now, if the thermostat had more information about the world -- a camera, GPS position, general reasoning ability to infer information about the actual temperature from all its inputs --, then Dennett argues its beliefs and goals would be much more related to heat in the room.</p><blockquote>The more of this we add, the less amenable our device becomes to serving as the control structure of anything other than a room-temperature maintenance system. A more formal way of saying this is that the class of indistinguishably satisfactory models of the formal system embodied in its internal states gets smaller and smaller as we add such complexities; the more we add, the richer or more demanding or specific the semantics of the system, until eventually we reach systems for which a unique semantic interpretation is practically (but never in principle) dictated (cf. Hayes 1979). At that point we say this device (or animal or person) has beliefs about heat and about this very room, and so forth, not only because of the system&apos;s actual location in, and operations on, the world, but because we cannot imagine an-other niche in which it could be placed where it would work.</blockquote><p>Humans, Dennett argues, are more like this enhanced thermostat, in that our beliefs and goals intertwine with the state of the world. Or put differently, when the world around us changes, it will influence almost always influence our mental states; whereas a basic thermostat might react the exact same way in vastly different environments.</p><blockquote>But as systems become perceptually richer and behaviorally more versatile, it becomes harder and harder to make substitutions in the actual links of the system to the world without changing the organization of the system itself. If you change its environment, it will notice, in effect, and make a change in its internal state in response. There comes to be a two-way constraint of growing specificity between the device and the environment. Fix the device in any one state and it demands a very specific environment in which to operate properly (you can no longer switch it easily from regulating temperature to regulating speed or anything else); but at the same time, if you do not fix the state it is in, but just plonk it down in a changed environment, its sensory attachments will be sensitive and discriminative enough to respond appropriately to the change, driving the system into a new state, in which it will operate effectively in the new environment.</blockquote><p>Part of this distinction between goals comes from generalization, a property considered necessary for goal-directedness since Rohin&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/DfcywmqRSkBaCB6Ma#Generalization_to_novel_circumstances\">initial post</a> on the subject. But the two goals also differs in their &quot;groundedness&quot;: the thermostat&apos;s goal lies completely in its sensors&apos; inputs, whereas the goals of humans depend on things farther away, on the environment itself.</p><p>That is, these two goals have different locality.</p><h2>Goals Across Cartesian Boundaries</h2><p>The other classification of goals comes from Evan Hubinger, in a personal discussion. Assuming a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/cartesian-boundary-as-abstraction-boundary\">Cartesian Boundary</a> outlining the system and its inputs and outputs, goals can be functions of:</p><ul><li><strong>The environment</strong>. This includes most human goals, since we tend to refuse wireheading. Hence the goal depends on something else than our brain state.</li><li><strong>The input</strong>. A typical goal as a function of the input is the one ascribed to the simple thermostat: maintaining the number given by its sensor above some threshold. If we look at the thermostat without assuming that its goal is a proxy for something else, then this system would happily wirehead itself, as the goal IS the input.</li><li><strong>The output</strong>. This one is a bit weirder, but captures goals about actions: for example, the goal of twitching. If there is a robot that only twitches, not even trying to keep twitching, just twitching, its goal seems about its output only.</li><li><strong>The internals</strong>. Lastly, goals can depend on what happens inside the system. For example, a very depressed person might have the goal of &quot;Feeling good&quot;. If that is the only thing that matters, then it is a goal about their internal state, and nothing else.</li></ul><p>Of course, many goals are functions of multiple parts of this quatuor. Yet separating them allows a characterization of a given goal through their proportions.</p><p>Going back to Dennett&apos;s example, the basic thermostat&apos;s goal is a function of its input, while human goals tend to be functions of the environment. And once again, an important aspect of the difference appears to lie in how far from the system is there information relevant to the goal -- locality.</p><h1>What Is Locality Anyway?</h1><p>Assuming some model of the world (possibly a causal DAG) containing the system, the locality of the goal is inversely proportional to the minimum radius of a ball, centered at the system, which suffice to evaluate the goal. Basically, one needs to look a certain distance away to check whether one&#x2019;s goal is accomplished; locality is a measure of this distance. The more local a goal, the less grounded in the environment, and the most it is susceptible to wireheading or change of environment without change of internal state.</p><p>Running with this attempt at formalization, a couple of interesting point follow:</p><ul><li>If the model of the world includes time, then locality also captures how far in the future and in the past one must go to evaluate the goal. This is basically the short-sightedness of a goal, as exemplified by variants of twitching robots: the robot that simply twitches; the one that want to maximize its twitch in the next second; the one that want to maximize its twitching in the next 2 seconds,... up to the robot that want to maximize the time it twitches in the future.</li><li>Despite the previous point, locality differs from the short term/long term split. An example of a short-term goal (or one-shot goal) is wanting an ice cream: after its accomplishment, the goal simply dissolves. Whereas an example of a long-term goal (or continuous goal) is to bring about and maintaing world peace -- something that is never over, but instead constrains the shape of the whole future. Short-sightedness differs from short-term, as a short-sighted goal can be long-term: &quot;for all times t (in hours to simplify),  I need to eat an ice cream in the interval [t-4,t+4]&quot;.</li><li>Where we put the center of the ball inside the system is probably irrelevant, as the classes of locality should matter more than the exact distance.</li><li>An alternative definition would be to allow the center of the ball to be anywhere in the world, and make locality inversely proportional to the sum of the distance of the center to the system plus the radius. This captures goals that do not depend on the state of the system, but would give similar numbers than the initial definition.</li></ul><p>In summary, locality is a measure of the distance at which information about the world matters for a system&apos;s goal. It appears in various guises in different classification of goals, and underlies multiple safety issues. What I give is far from a formalization; it is instead a first exploration of the concept, with open directions to boot. Yet I believe that the concept can be put into more formal terms, and that such a measure of locality captures a fundamental aspect of goal-directedness.</p><p><em>Thanks to Victoria Krakovna, Evan Hubinger and Michele Campolo for discussions on this idea.</em></p>",

This is the first of probably several posts dumping my thought-state as of this week.</i></p><p>Suppose we have a simple causal model of a system:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/f0pevwfcaapfv2va64gc\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/utiamzpw0gwjubuwh3q1 99w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/cnsynwdxnsv2yoxutdtv 179w\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>We hire someone to study the system, and eventually they come back with some data: “X=2”, they tell us. Apparently they are using a different naming convention than we are; what is this variable X? Does it correspond to a? To b? To c? To something else entirely?</p><p>I’ll call this the indexing problem: “index into” a model to specify where some data “came from”. (If someone knows of a better existing name, let me know.)</p><p>In practice, we usually “solve” the indexing problem by coordinating on names of things. I use descriptive variable names like “counterweight mass” or “customer age” in my model, and then when someone gives me data, it comes with object names like “counterweight” or “customer” and field names like “mass” or “age”. Of course, this has a major failure mode: names can be deceiving. A poorly documented API may have a field called “date”, and I might mistake it for the date on which some document was signed when really it was the date on which the document was delivered. Or a social scientist may have data on “empathy” or “status” constructed from a weighted sum of questionnaire responses, which may or may not correspond to anybody else’ notion/measurement of “empathy” or “status”.</p><p>The expensive way around this is to explicitly model the data-generation process. If I look at the actual procedure followed by the social scientist, or the actual code behind the poorly-documented API, then I can ignore the names and figure out for myself what the variables tell me about the world.</p><p>Usually this is where we’d start talking about social norms or something like that, but the indexing problem still needs to be solved <i>even in the absence of any other agents</i>. Even if I were the last person on a postapocalyptic Earth, I might find a photograph and think “where was this photograph taken?” - that would be an indexing problem. I might get lost and end up in front of a distinctive building, and wonder “where is this? Where am I?” - that’s an indexing problem. A premodern natural philosopher might stare through a telescope and wonder where that image is really coming from, and if it can really be trusted - that’s an indexing problem. I might smell oranges but not see any fruit, or I might hear water but see only desert, and wonder where the anomalous sensory inputs are coming from - that’s an indexing problem. Any time I’m wondering “where something came from” - i.e. which components of my world-model I should attach the data to - that’s an indexing problem.</p><p>When thinking about embedded agents, even just <i>representing</i> indices is nontrivial.</p><h2>Representing Indices</h2><p>If our world-model were just a plain graphical causal model in the usual format, and our data were just variables in that model, then representation would be simple: we just have a hash table mapping each variable to data on that variable (or null, for variables without any known data).&nbsp;</p><p>For agents modelling environments which contain themselves, this doesn’t work: the environment is necessarily larger than the model. If it’s a graphical causal model, we need to compress it somehow; we can’t even explicitly list all the variables. The main way I imagine doing this is to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy/p/Xd9FLs4geRAWxkQPE\"><u>write causal models like we write progams</u></a>: use recursive “calls” to submodels to build small representations of our world-model, the same way source code represents large computations.</p><p>… which means that, when data comes in, we need to index into a data structure representing the trace of a program’s execution graph, without actually calculating/storing that trace.</p><p>Here’s an example. We have a causal model representing this python program:</p><pre><code>def factorial(n):\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if n == 0:\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return n * factorial(n-1)</code></pre><p>Expanded out, the causal model for this program executing on n=3 looks like this:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/lmxxd59csqrzuwjxtkp9\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/h4ovf8jr5xr117umarly 142w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/deazbdnkvuatwadjyfoo 222w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/fztekf5imntshoiputa0 302w\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>… where there are implicit arrows going downwards within each box (i.e. the variables in each box depend on the variables above them within the box). Notice that the causal model consists of repeated blocks; we can compress them with a representation like this:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/emlmiq1jiirmuespqjkb\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/gr5u7jxi05i22mi2hjyc 141w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/tachormpablk67ww4umo 221w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/oihks00ecz4rleeuboh4 301w\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>That’s the compressed world-model.</p><p>Now, forget about n=3. I just have the compressed world-model for the general case. I’m playing around with a debugger, setting breakpoints and stepping through the code. Some data comes in; it tells me that the value of “factorial(n-1)” in the “second block from the top” in the expanded model is 7.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/z0a9jk1rmhhu7t4wzqs8\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/g5hlkuiqx2fqbztd7jl7 142w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/ryzdbixpdkgc60gacdru 222w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/tgd41aqqf2aebnaxfe1h 302w\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Now, there’s a whole hairy problem here about how to update our world-model to reflect this new data, but we’re not even going to worry about that. First we need to ask: how do we even represent this? What data structure do we use to point to the “second block from the top” in an expansion of a computation - a computation which we don’t want to fully expand out because it may be too large? Obviously we could hack something together, but my inner software engineer says that will get very ugly very quickly. We want a <i>clean</i> way to index into the model in order to attach data.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/hgw5wwokugleckmrgtim\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/kuuweevj52z9ttylubdl 142w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/ctitwqvmsusdy8jj11f5 222w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/os725mlrkaypvpjkk6ug 302w\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and just to make it a bit more interesting, remember that sometimes we might not even know which block we’re looking for. Maybe we’ve been stepping through with the debugger for a while, and we’re looking at a recursive call somewhere between ten and twenty deep but we’re not sure exactly which. We want to be able to represent that too. So there can be “indexical uncertainty” - i.e. we’re unsure of the index itself.</p><p>I don’t have a complete answer to this yet, but I expect it will look something like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AfkSop9dxAcP4NDGW/high-school-algebra-for-data-structures-1\"><u>algebraic equations on data structures (algex)</u></a>. For instance, we might have a plain causal model for name-generation like&nbsp;</p><pre><code>{\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ethnicity = random_ethnicity()\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first_name = random_first(ethnicity)\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last_name = random_last(ethnicity)\n}</code></pre><p>… and then we could represent some data via an equation like</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/sl6c4bmbtvhdb5zlwvhh\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/pq7ojpy0smvqhwk3luh7 88w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/gsgwal8vqmt9oqhvlnis 168w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/akhcvbt51xfkpctmqgo5 248w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/yoxbbg9mrimvy9dp3azi 328w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/wr2lakjcfcddsd2542dc 408w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ABNjLr2H39g2oXqGb/j5bzvb0fa7bvdxse8efq 488w\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The left-hand-side would be the same data structure we use to represent world models, and the right-hand-side would be a “similarly-shaped” structure containing our data. Like algex, the “equation” would be interpreted asymmetrically - missing data on the right means that we just don’t know that value yet, whereas the left has the whole world model, and in general we “solve” for things on the left in terms of things on the right.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/johnswentworth/algex\"><u>algex library</u></a> already does this sort of thing with deeply-nested data structures, and extending it to the sort of lazy recursively-nested data structures relevant to world models should be straightforward. The main task is coming up with a clean set of Transformations which allow walking around the graph, e.g. something which says “follow this recursive call two times”.</p>",

For other entries in this series, navigate to the <a href=\"https://cullenokeefe.com/ai-benefits-index\">AI Benefits Blog Series Index page</a>.</p>\n<p>This post is also discussed on the Effective Altruism Forum. Links to those cross-posts are available on the Index page.</p>\n<p>For comments on this series, I am thankful to Katya Klinova, Max Ghenis, Avital Balwit, Joel Becker, Anton Korinek, and others. Errors are my own.</p>\n<p>If you are an expert in a relevant area and would like to help me further explore this topic, please <a href=\"mailto:cullen@openai.com\">contact me</a>.</p>\n<h1>Introducing “AI Benefits”</h1>\n<p>Since I started working on the <a href=\"https://www.cullenokeefe.com/windfallclause\">Windfall Clause</a> report in summer 2018, I have become increasingly focused on how advanced AI systems might benefit humanity. My present role at OpenAI has increased my attention to this question, given <a href=\"https://www.openai.com/charter\">OpenAI’s mission</a> of “ensur[ing] artificial general intelligence (AGI) . . . benefits all of humanity.”</p>\n<p>This post is the first in a series on “AI Benefits.” The series will be divided into two parts. In the first part, I will explain the current state of my thinking on AI Benefits. In the second part, I will highlight some of the questions on which I have substantial uncertainty.</p>\n<p>My hope is that this series will generate useful discussion—and particularly criticism—that can improve my thinking. I am particularly interested in the assistance of subject-matter experts in the fields listed at the end of who can offer feedback on how to approach these questions. Although I do raise some questions explicitly, I also have uncertainty surrounding many of the framing assumptions made in this series. Thus, commentary on any part of this series is welcome and encouraged.</p>\n<p>In the first few posts, starting with this one, I want to briefly explain what I mean by “AI Benefits” for the purposes of this series. The essential idea of AI Benefits is simple: AI Benefits means AI applications that are good for humanity. However, the concept has some wrinkles that need further explaining.</p>\n<h1>AI Benefits is Distinct from Default Market Outcomes</h1>\n<p>One important clarification is the distinction between AI Benefits as I will be using the term and other benefits from AI that arise through market mechanisms.</p>\n<p>I expect AI to create and distribute many benefits through market systems, and in no way wish to reject markets as important mechanisms for generating and distributing social benefits. However, I also expect profit-seeking businesses to vigorously search for and develop profitable forms of benefits, and thus likely to be generated absent further intervention.</p>\n<p>Since I care about being beneficial relative to a <a href=\"https://conceptually.org/concepts/counterfactual-thinking\">counterfactual scenario</a> in which I do nothing, I am more interested in discussing benefits that businesses are unlikely to generate from profit-maximizing activities alone. Thus, for the rest of this series I will be focusing on the subset of AI Benefits that individuals could receive other than what markets would likely provide by default by actors not motivated by social benefit.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why an AI Benefit might not be well provided-for by profit-maximizing businesses.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-1\" id=\"fnref-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-1\">[1]</a></sup> The first is that some positive externalities from a Benefit might not be easily capturable by market actors.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-2\" id=\"fnref-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-2\">[2]</a></sup> A classic example of this might be using AI to combat climate change—a global public good. It is common for innovations to have such positive externalities. The Internet is a great example of this; its “creators”—whoever they are—likely captured very little of the benefits that flow from it.</p>\n<p>Profit-maximizers focus on consumers’ willingness to pay (“WTP”). However, a product for which rich consumers have high WTP can yield far lower improvements to human welfare and happiness than a product aimed at poor consumers, giving the latter’s low WTP. Accordingly, investments in products benefitting poor consumers might be underproduced by profit-seekers relative to the social value—happiness and flourishing—it could create.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-3\" id=\"fnref-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-3\">[3]</a></sup>\nActors less concerned with profits should fill this gap. Consumers’ bounded rationality could also lead them to undervalue certain products.</p>\n<p>This line of work also focuses on what benefactors can do unilaterally. Therefore, I largely take market incentives as stable, even though the maximally beneficial thing to do might be to improve market incentives. (As an example, carbon pricing could fix the negative externalities associated with carbon emissions.) Such market-shaping work is very important to good outcomes, but is less tractable for individual benefactors other than entire governments. However, a complete portfolio of Benefits might include funding advocacy for better policies.</p>\n<p>A point of clarification: although by definition markets will generally not provide the subset of AI Benefits on which I am focusing, market actors can play a key role in providing AI Benefits. Some profit-driven firms already engage in philanthropy and other corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) efforts. Such behaviors may or may not be ultimately aimed at profit. Regardless, the resources available to large for-profit AI developers may make them adept at generating AI Benefits. The motivation, not the legal status of the actor, determines whether a beneficial activity counts as the type of AI Benefits I care about.</p>\n<p>Of course, nonprofits, educational institutions, governments, and individuals also provide such nonmarket benefits. The intended audience for this work is anyone aiming to provide nonmarket AI Benefits, including for-profit firms acting in a philanthropic or beneficent capacity.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><em>Cf.</em> <strong>Hauke Hillebrandt &amp; John Halstead, Impact Investing Report</strong> 26–27 (2018), <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-impact-investing\">https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-impact-investing</a> [<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7S5Y-7S6F\">https://perma.cc/7S5Y-7S6F</a>]; Holden Karnofsky, <em>Broad Market Efficiency</em>, <strong>The GiveWell Blog</strong> (July 25, 2016), <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">https://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/</a> [<a href=\"https://perma.cc/TA8D-YT69\">https://perma.cc/TA8D-YT69</a>]. <a href=\"#fnref-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><em>See</em> <strong>Hillebrandt &amp; Halstead</strong>, <em>supra</em>, at 14–15. <a href=\"#fnref-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><em>See id.</em> at 12–14. <a href=\"#fnref-a74tNcLJ4cof8LGpM-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n</body></html>",

He was tall and lanky, rough, ragged on the edges, with a normally relaxed and carefree demeanor, dust worn and weather beaten. He was scruffy, with eyes that made him look older than he actually was, those dark eyes had seen a thousand little tragedies. Murders, execution, torture, and worse.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Endorsei Edlrif looked like a paragon of the world of professional business. She was polished and sharpened, from her perfectly pressed suit to her immaculately brushed hair, the tasteful but understated jewelry she wore and the smooth and confident manner she carried herself with. She radiated an almost innocent poise, and with a face had hid her years, she would have fit in anywhere from a boardroom to a college campus.</p>\n<p>She absolutely terrified Metz. The crimes, the inhumanities, the deaths, they weighed on Metz like a heavy stone around his neck, he felt the weight of his deeds with every step he took. He saw the faces of the dead when he closed his eyes. He wasn’t a good person, but he felt the cost of his sins, the barbs embedded in his soul. In contrast, Endorsei had an almost insane lightness to her. She was happy, cheerful, even chipper. He’d seen her squeal with glee and clap like a little girl when a group of traitors was strung up in front of her, none of the horror seemed to phase her in the slightest, on the contrary, she seemed to revel in it.</p>\n<p>Metz Jerindold was a fixer, he made problems go away, but he was also a leader, he took responsibility for his actions, he might be a murderous bastard, but Skarkon was<em> his system </em>and he was still very protective of it. He was an Angel first, but he was a Skarkon native second. He was a matari, even if many in the republic would be loath to admit he was one of them.</p>\n<p>Endorsei Edlrif on the other hand, was a monster. Metz had trouble believing she was actually human at times, much less Matari. The slaver’s fangs voluval appearing beneath her lips marked her as an outcast even among outcasts. She was the Cartel’s razor, gleaming in the darkness, the Queen of the Damned.</p>\n<p>“I had to do something,” he said, nervously taking a drag of his cigarette, “ we couldn’t just let the Krullefor continue muscling into our turf.”</p>\n<p>Endorsei looked out the panoramic windows of their meeting room aboard her custom Machariel. The deserts of Skarkon were like a painted canvas far below them. She watched a dust storm moving across the world with only the faintest hint of disgust.</p>\n<p>“And so you set off a nuke in the middle of the city they were basing out of, killing a bunch of random people and giving the RSS an excuse to escalate the conflict further.” She shook her head, gesturing with the sucker she’d been slurping on,  “They played you Metz, they wanted you to react so they could say they were bringing justice and restoring order, and you reacted exactly the way they wanted. Now they get to bring the hammer down and play the heroes.”</p>\n<p>“They won’t be seen as liberators,” Metz told her, following her eyes out the windows towards the planet, “Not in Skarkon. You don’t wipe away decades of bad blood and abandonment with a few soldiers and rations. They’d have to kill half the people down there to even begin to contest our grip.”</p>\n<p>“You think the republic would give a fedo’s arse if half the people on that dustball died tomorrow?” She said, raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>“They couldn’t…” he said, his voice trailing off, “That’s a bad look, even for them. I doubt they would want that much negative PR.”</p>\n<p>“They’re going to put thousands of troops on the ground down there and turn that planet over for months,” Endorsei told him. “Long term occupations of hostile worlds are never pretty, just look at Caldari Prime.”</p>\n<p>“What makes you so sure they’re going to stick around?” Metz asked her.</p>\n<p>“Because they’re trying to find something,” she said, grinning darkly, “and they won’t leave a stone unturned if they think what they want is under it.”</p>\n<p>“I know they’ve got people looking for Archeotech,” Metz told her, “What are they after?”</p>\n<p>She giggled, “Sorry love, but that’s above your paygrade. All you need to know is that they won’t find it. We found it and took everything out over a decade ago.”</p>\n<p>“So why are you here then Endorsei?” Metz said apprehensively, wondering if he was about to eat a bullet.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I’m just tying up loose ends,” she said, skipping up to the window and peering out it with a wide eyed childlike fascination, “Ooh, look at that!” She jumped up and down, pointing at something out in the desert.</p>\n<p>On the planet below, as if on queue, a trio of atomic explosions twinkled silently on the Ngelgneig, followed a few seconds later by five more. As far as Metz knew, there was nothing out there in the desert worth nuking. Just some mobile bases operated by various cartel backed corporate outfits.</p>\n<p>“There!” She said happily, “No more loose ends, no one left alive who could say anything and no easily accessed evidence. It will take them months to find out that what they’re looking for isn’t on Skarkon II anymore, and you Metz, I have big plans for you!”</p>\n<p>She put an arm over Metz’s shoulder, and the big man tried not to wince. She ran her fingers across his back and he had the sickening feeling of being sized up as a meal by some sort of giant predatory insect.</p>\n<p>“You’re going to make sure the RSS’s stay on Skarkon II is an extra special one. I want you to pull out all the stops. Hold protests, throw rocks, arrange strikes, send gift baskets with grenades in the bottom, plant roadside bombs, hit squad leaders with snipers, everything you can do to turn that planet into as much of a slaver trap as possible, I want you to do it. Feel free to tap into the local discretionary fund. Fight smart, make the republic afraid of absolutely everyone on that damned planet. I want you to make it abundantly clear to them that Skarkon is not and will never be their planet, and that the people of Skarkon will never pledge loyalty to them. If they want Skarkon II, they’ll have to plant their flag in a pile of children’s corpses. Do I make myself clear?”</p>\n<p>“Abundantly,” Metz said, carefully removing Endorsei’s hand from his back like one might remove a venomous snake.</p>\n<p>“Just one last thing,” he said, “That necklace you’re wearing,” he pointed to the faintly luminescent sky blue pearl hanging by a simple silver chain from her neck, “There was a girl, a capsuleer, from one of the groups operating warclones on the planet. She had a jewel like that, said it was spiritually significant to her people and wanted to know what the Angels knew about them.”</p>\n<p>Endorsei frowned faintly, looking at Metz and then down at her necklace. She shook her head, “That’s also above your paygrade Metz. But since I’m feeling…<em>generous, </em>here, give her my card.”</p>\n<p>She held out a small piece of paper containing Endorsei’s neocom address. He knew the card also contained some nasty malware and a tiny sliver of antimatter which could be remotely detonated, he took the card carefully, handling it like the bomb it was.</p>\n<p>Metz looked like he wanted to say something else, and then thought better of it, he wanted to be out of the room and away from Endorsei Edlrif as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>“Now take care love,” she said, giggling and shooing him out of the meeting room, already bored of the sebiestor, “Make sure to give the RSS our best welcome, and give your girlfriend that card, we’ll see about getting her a nice trinket.”</p>\n<p>Metz let himself be pushed out the door and practically ran back to his shuttle.</p>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

Hoping to leverage Cunningham's Law to reach enlightenment.</i></p><p>Kaj Sotala has a great sequence on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip\">Multiagent Models of the Mind</a>, a sequence that's lead to a lot of fun developments in how I think about minds in general. It also introduced me to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq\">Global Workspace Theory</a>, one of the current mainstream theories of consciousness.&nbsp;</p><p>When studying the mind, you can attack from different levels of abstraction. From the lowest level of studying the anatomy of neurons, all the way up to postulating abstract cognitive algorithms that people might use in their thought. Kaj's sequence lives mostly on a mid-tier level; \"imagine a system that works like <i>this</i>\", and only dips into the neuroscience enough to give you a sense that someone has in fact looked into the neural plausibility of the idea. I think this was a good decision, as most of the interesting ideas come at the mid-tier functional level (\"If you think of your mind as composed of subagents communicating through a global workspace, you'd expect <i>ABC</i> behavior\").</p><p>This post details some of the lower level brain anatomy I've been investigating in an attempt to clear up some confusions I've had from thinking a lot of about Global Workspace Theory and how it relates to consciousness and Predictive Processing. Specifically, it looks at the neural basis for attention mechanisms, and the neural basis for the Global Workspace. Most of the details come from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608097000609\">this</a> paper, and <a href=\"http://cogprints.org/73/1/CINSART.htm\">this</a> paper.</p><h1>The Tangential Intracortical Network (TIN) (i.e The Global Neuronal Workplace?)</h1><p>People like Jeff Hawkins assert that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FoJSa8mgLPT83g9e8/jeff-hawkins-on-neuromorphic-agi-within-20-years?\">every part of the neocortex is running the same algorithm</a>. Even people that don't go as far as him note that there's a lot of uniformity in the neocortex (it looks like it's mostly composed of tons of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_column#:~:text=A%20cortical%20column%2C%20also%20called,have%20nearly%20identical%20receptive%20fields.\">cortical columns</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the connections in the cortex go from one part of a column to another part of the same column. There's also plenty of cortex to [non cortex part of the brain] connections. Most of the intracortical connections are part of a big web of mid-range fibers that span the whole neocortex, called the Tangential Intracortical Network (TIN) by Baars and Newman. They point to it as a plausible physical basis for the GNW. We'll run with that.</p><p>Functionally, the global workspace is an area that disparate parts of the cortex can all compete to put a value on. This competition is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner-take-all_(computing)\">winner-takes-all</a>, and only one value can be on the network at a time. Once a value is on the network, the rest of the cortex is able to read the value, thus serving as a temporary \"global state\", hence the name.</p><p>I'm not exactly sure how the TIN implements this functionality, but I'm imagining it as resulting from fairly mechanistic network dynamics. Something like:</p><ul><li>If multiple areas of cortex are active, they'll all automatically be sending signals on the TIN.</li><li>All the signals will briefly propagate, but because of [<i>network dynamics magic</i>] even slight differences in signal strength or random chance will lead to one overwhelming the others and taking over the entire network.</li></ul><p>The important aspect of this to me is the mechanistic nature of the competition. A winner is not \"chosen\", one signal simply beats out the others. Though to be fair, when we get to the thalamus, we'll find that that thalamus has lot of connections to the cortex that seem capable of signal boosting a chunk of the cortex, allowing it to dominate and become the contents of the GNW. This creates an indirect route through which the contents of the GNW can be manipulated.</p><h2>Basal Ganglia (BG) and \"Action\" Selection</h2><p>The BG is <a href=\"https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Pharmacology_and_Neuroscience/Book%3A_Computational_Cognitive_Neuroscience_(O'Reilly_and_Munakata)/07%3A_Motor_Control_and_Reinforcement_Learning/7.02%3A_Basal_Ganglia%2C_Action_Selection_and_Reinforcement_Learning\">pretty solidly</a> understood to be central to \"action\" selection. The air quotes are because the BG also seems to do a selection operation on inputs from places that aren't motor regions (like the prefrontal cortex). So it's capable of doing a winner-takes-all selection of various abstract and concrete \"cognitive actions\".</p><p>There are a few things that makes competition on the BG different from competition on the GNW. First, the BG has several different selection channels that can act in parallel. There's at least five different loops that all follow the pattern of: cortex projecting onto BG which uses the thalamus to give a go-ahead to the cortex.</p><figure style=\"width:81.23%;\"><img src=\"https://med.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/7206/800px-fig_bg_loops_ads86.png?revision=1\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Pharmacology_and_Neuroscience/Book%3A_Computational_Cognitive_Neuroscience_(O'Reilly_and_Munakata)/07%3A_Motor_Control_and_Reinforcement_Learning/7.02%3A_Basal_Ganglia%2C_Action_Selection_and_Reinforcement_Learning\">source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Second difference is that action selection in the BG makes use of previous learned rewards. It basically seems to be doing the <i>evidence accumulation</i> that Kaj outlines in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh\">Subagents, neural Turing Machines, thought selection, and blindspots</a>. Multiple subsystem (chunks of cortex) put their plans on the BG. The first option whose accumulated expected reward exceeds some threshold is chosen. Compare this to the mechanistic network dynamical magic of the GNW.</p><p>Third difference is what happens after the \"selection\" occurs. In the GNW, being \"selected\" just means you are the signal currently dominating the GNW. This results in the rest of the cortex being able to use your value as an input. With the BG, there seem to be two possible results; either the thalamus is used to boost you into taking over the GNW (like what happens when a production rule fires in the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh\">neural Turing machine</a> model), or the BG can use the thalamus to route your plan to another part of the cortex. This seems to be what happens with motor actions. High-level action plans made in the frontal cortex are approved by the BG and routed to the motor cortex which creates the implementation details with the help of the cerebellum.</p><p>The difference between competition on the BG and competition on the GNW also accounts for one discrepancy Kaj <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh\">mentions</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There seems to me to be a conceptual difference between the kinds of actions that change the contents of consciousness, and the kinds of actions which accumulate evidence over many items <i>in</i> consciousness (such as iterative memories of snacks). Zylberberg et al. talk about a “winner-take-all race” to trigger a production rule, which to me implies that the evidence accumulated in favor of each production rule is cleared each time that the contents of consciousness is changed. This is seemingly incompatible with accumulating evidence over many consciousness-moments, so postulating a two-level distinction between accumulators seems like a straightforward way of resolving the issue.</p></blockquote><p>Something being on the GNW can boost evidence accumulation at the basal ganglia, which is maintained across changes in the contents of GNW.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding the role of the BG was big for me, because it helped make a lot more sense of where you do and don't expect to find bottlenecks. The BG can be choosing and routing actions that are being proposed by the cortex without having to wait to use the GNW. If there's a clear and obvious winner, the BG just chooses the right action and sends it along. It's only going to be novel situations when one action doesn't have a clear expected reward edge, and that's exactly when you'd expect someone's conscious attention to be on high, searching for any sliver of information that could push you towards a decisive action!</p><p>Also, don't forget that the GNW can only do one thing at a time, whereas the BG has multiple selection channels.&nbsp;</p><h1>The Thalamus: router/central hub</h1><p>Though the TIN is supposed to be the network that <i>is</i> the GNW, the thalamus is what allows for the guiding and management of attention. There are three attention-esque things that the thalamus seems to do:</p><ol><li>Allow for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_gating\">sensory gating</a>, controlling what sense data even makes it to the cortex for higher level processing.</li><li>Allow for affecting the contents of the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq\">global neuronal workspace</a>.</li><li>Allow for routing information between disparate chunks of cortex.</li></ol><p>The following is a brief overview of the thalamus that will help us build up to understanding its role in these three functions.</p><p>The thalamus is a central hub that all cortex-bound sense data has to pass through, making it a prime suspect for some sort of attentional control system. An important note, though the cortex is where most of the \"intelligent\" processing of data happens, it's not the only place that processes sense data. All sensory channels also connect directly to the brain stem. For vision, the optic nerve is connected to the thalamus (specifically the <i>lateral geniculate nucleus</i>) and <i>also</i> connected to the midbrain (specifically the <i>superior colliculus</i>), where as with audition all data goes hindbrain -&gt; midbrain -&gt; thalamus.&nbsp;</p><p>This is important for thinking about voluntary and involuntary control of attention and brain processing; we're going to be talking about attention mechanisms that act on the thalamus, which means these mechanisms hold no sway over what data the brainstem receives. One prediction I'd make from this: we see things where inattention can lead to ignoring huge changes in your environment. But the things that change in those experiments are visual features that are processed in the cortex. If you had a small black dot scuttling across the screen (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00067/full\">what your brainstem uses to trigger the \"AAAH SPIDERS\" reflex</a>), I'd bet people would still have a startle reflex even if they weren't paying attention.</p><p>Here's a picture of the thalamus, split into its various parts (the names aren't super important for the post, I just like visuals).</p><figure style=\"width:57.46%;\"><img src=\"https://image.slidesharecdn.com/thalamus-160315134631/95/thalamus-19-638.jpg?cb=1458049751\"></figure><p>It's common to split the thalamus into \"first-order\" and \"high-order\" sections. The first-order parts (also called <i>relay</i> sections) don't interconnect that much, and mostly just shuttle their sensory data off to the cortex. The <i>lateral geniculate nucleus</i> routes most of the visual data, the <i>medial geniculate nucleus</i> routes most of the auditory data, and other parts do other things. I think of them as mostly inert pipes that just transmit whatever is coming from their fixed input location. The way that these relays connect to the cortex is highly organized; neurons that are close together in <i>lateral geniculate nucleus</i> space are close together in <i>retina</i> space and get mapped close together in <i>visual cortex</i> space.</p><p>In contrast, the higher-order nuclei are much more interconnected, projecting out of the thalamus in more diffuse patterns, and receiving their inputs from various chunks of cortex as opposed to from sensory channels. Some of these are called <i>association nuclei</i> and seem to allow for routing info from one chunk of cortex to another, and others are called <i>nonspecific nuclei</i> and project out to the cortex in a very diffuse manner. The former seem to be important for cortex to cortex routing, and the latter seems to be important for influencing the global neuronal workspace.</p><p>Cortex to cortex routing is used in the execution of motor plans that we talked about with the BG. The diffuse connections to the cortex are used to signal boost things onto the GNW.</p><p>For every connection taking data from the thalamus to the cortex, there's several reverse connections connecting the cortex to the thalamus. This sort of re-entrant feedback is what makes advanced control loops possible.</p><h2>The Thalamic Reticular Nucleus (TRN): the gates of the thalamus</h2><p>The thalamus has a \"shell\" around it called the thalamic reticular nucleus. It's composed of a web of inhibitory neurons, and all of the thalamus's outgoing axons pass through it. If a chunk of the TRN gets activated, it will block outgoing signals. You can think of the TRN as being composed of a bunch of little gates that can all be triggered to block outgoing data.&nbsp;</p><p>Since neurons spike over time (as opposed to logic gates which maintain ON or OFF), these gates are controlled by maintaining standing waves across the TRN. Baars and Newman describe it as being capable of acting as a <a href=\"https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/\">fourier filter</a>, selectively blocking outgoing signals that don't match the frequency of the filtering standing wave. This is really cool because it allows a lot more fine grained control than \"don't let visual data in\". The parts of the brain that control the TRN can learn what sorts of oscillations block what sorts of sense data. You won't get filtering at the highest conceptual levels (\"block incoming visuals of bats\"), but you can get more sophisticated than simple topographic blocking like \"ignore everything in my peripherals\".</p><p>There are at least three areas of the brain that plug into the TRN that control how it filters thalamic output.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)</strong>: responsible for the \"executive\" attention; attending to something because you want to, noticing stuff that's relevant to your goals, etc.</li><li><strong>Midbrain reticular formation (MRF)</strong>: responsible for attending to novel and dangerous stuff.</li><li><strong>Posterior Cortex (PC)</strong>: responsible for attending to stimuli similar to what you were just attending to, creating a sort of recency bias.</li></ul><p>All of these are capable of exerting control over the TRN and the thalamus. Sensory gating is what happens when the TRN is filtering out certain sense data, preventing it from ever reaching the cortex. This is very different from GNW attention, where various data is all being processed in the cortex, but only one value is being held in attention at any given moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Once again, just like we split apart \"selection\" into the BG and the GNW, we can split the phenomena of \"attending to something\" into having it on the GNW, and sensory gating.</p><p>I'd expect GNW attention to allow for things like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect\">cocktail party effect</a>, and being completely zoned out of driving, yet upon being prompted being able to recall the last few seconds of detail. Basically any situation where you weren't paying attention to something, but when you do you find details that imply you must have already been processing the situation.</p><p>Sensory gating seems to correspond to having your attention broadened or narrowed. Being intensely focused a math problem and then jumping out of your skin when your roommate taps you on your shoulder; putting down your phone and feeling like you've suddenly been flooded with <i>all this space</i>. A wilderness first aid instructor I know that spent a lot of time as a kid coon hunting told me a story about a similar phenomena in dogs. When they get really into a chase, their senses \"shut off\" in order of their least to most important as they get more and more aroused; first the hearing goes, then vision, leaving them navigating only by smell.</p><h1>Outro</h1><p>I'm confident in the broad strokes of the neuroscience here, but I am certainly wrong about a large number of the details. When writing this I was really faced with the magnitude of everything I just don't understand about the brain. I often questioned why I was investigating the neuroscience if I was only going to do an amateur job, and when I was really interested in the more abstract implications.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all that, this has been really helpful for getting a sense of better questions to ask.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding the difference between competition on the GNW and competition on the BG was really useful. Understanding the difference between attention via sensory gating and attention via the GNW was also really useful. If you've been following along with Kaj's sequence, I think these are the two main takeaways.</p><hr><p><i><strong>References</strong></i></p><p><i>Newman, James, Bernard J.

That’s completely gone, and with it there’s been a bleeding away of expert authority, and a public has been created that’s essentially very angry…</p><p><i>– </i><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/martin-gurri-revolt-of-the-public/\"><i><u>Martin Gurri</u></i></a><i>, author of</i> “The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority”</p></blockquote><p>Martin Gurri wrote <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22451908-the-revolt-of-the-public-and-the-crisis-of-authority\"><u>his seminal book in 2014</u></a>, to explain the public revolts against authority in the early part of the 21st century, such as the Arab Spring. But as the century wears on, the book becomes even more timely than when it was written, the events proceeding exactly as he described them. Trump, Brexit, the fall of old media, culture war in academia — all are revolts by a newly informed public against established authorities and gatekeepers of information.</p><p>In Martin Gurri’s world, it is no surprise that we are seeing protests and revolts on a global scale right on the heels of the first wave of a global pandemic. COVID exposed what few authorities made claims to credibility beforehand. The government, <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/03/27/the-great-annealing/\"><u>the media</u></a>, acronym bureaucracies like the CDC and FDA — they all abdicated their responsibilities, lied at every turn, and failed to do much of anything about a disease that has been killing 1,000 Americans a day for months.</p><p>The collapse of authority, even for those who yet cling to one of those I mentioned in the previous paragraph, provokes anxiety and anger. They intuitively seek epistemic authority, to tell them what is true and false. They seek moral authority, to tell them what is good and evil. And they want someone to blame, someone to take their anxiety and anger out on. It can’t be the virus. It has to be a person, and they have to be within reach of a fist.</p><h2>The Grab</h2><p>Humans did not evolve to tell very well what is true or false, or to think clearly about good and evil. But we evolved to be good at tribalism, to divide into “us” and “them”, to be on the winning side when “us” gain an edge in power and jump on “them” to take their stuff, their status, or their lives. We do this subconsciously, <a href=\"http://elephantinthebrain.com/\"><u>even as our brains confirm our moral righteousness to ourselves</u></a>.</p><p>Coordinated grabs for status, wealth, and power need a coordination mechanism. This mechanism consists of a shared language and ideology, anything from common jokes to a holy text. Then an opportune moment arrives, often when the public is galvanized by a mass movement. The grabbers strike under the cover of the movement’s worthy cause.</p><p>A clear demonstration of this happened during the Arab Spring itself <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_revolution_of_2011\"><u>in Egypt from 2011-2014</u></a>. The revolution started with a protest organized mostly by student activists and liberal youth movements. They protested curtailed freedoms, unchecked presidential powers, and police brutality. Several months and dead protesters later, the president of Egypt was deposed only to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%932013_Egyptian_protests\"><u>be replaced by the head of the Muslim Brotherhood</u></a>, Morsi. Morsi immediately proceeded to curtail freedoms further, remove checks on his power, and sent the police to brutalize protesters.</p><p>While the students faced the police in Tahrir Square, the Brotherhood coordinated a power grab. Now Egypt has a different dictator still, and the young activists are wondering what happened to their cause that seemed to enjoy such popular support.</p><p>A lot of the Egyptians who brought Morsi and then Al-Sisi to power did not do so out of a desire to see their country sink further into despotism. They just got swept up in the angry revolt, and then intuitively supported the side that seemed poised to gain power. Anger leads to chaos, chaos leads to fear, fear leads to submission to whomever is strongest, whoever grabs for power most forcefully.</p><figure><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg/w_80 80w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg/w_160 160w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg/w_240 240w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg/w_320 320w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg/w_480 480w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg/w_560 560w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg/w_640 640w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95a6cb39b68d707a27fdc21037bb5df0da18604f886105eb.jpg/w_720 720w\"><figcaption>Protests in Tahrir Square in Cairo</figcaption></figure><p>Everything so far was just setting the stage, outlining a general model of how revolts erupt in anger and how this anger is repurposed for grabbing power and settling scores with the outgroup.

If you’re looking for hot takes on these topics, I don’t have any.</p><h2>The Fear</h2><p>George Floyd was killed, protests erupted, “Black lives matter!” rings from Minneapolis to <a href=\"https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/06/livestream-auckland-black-lives-matter-march-sunday-june-14.html\"><u>New Zealand</u></a>. You want to express something too, write something, say something. What should you say?</p><p>First, ask yourself:&nbsp;<i>What <strong>can’t </strong>I say, even if were true?

What could be said <strong>yesterday</strong> that is scary to say <strong>today</strong>?</i></p><p>This fear is not a sign of truth. You cannot reason back to reality from human emotions. Galileo was right because he carefully watched the stars, not because he said things that made the church angry.</p><p>This fear is a sign that someone is gaining power over you, aiming a weapon your way. The things you can’t or must say are the battle lines being drawn. Those you’re afraid to speak in front of are those preparing to grab and strike. The accelerating speed of change in what is forbidden or mandatory is a sign that war is looming.</p><p><strong>Consider not saying things that will fuel the war and give power to those you’re afraid of.</strong></p><p>One way to give them power is to make them your enemy directly, to focus your energy on fighting them on their own terms. Direct enemies are very useful to those people, and you serve them by becoming one.</p><p>Some people I know have been possessed by a strong urge recently to quote black crime statistics. There are two groups of people who talk about black crime statistics: criminal justice activists, and racists. If you only start talking about black crime statistics when a white cop kills a black civilian you are probably not a criminal justice activist. Consider not repeating the talking points of racists if you’re worried about being called a racist.</p><p>The other way to give power to those grabbing for it is to mindlessly repeat their slogans. Slogans are rarely innocuous. They are often start reasonable and then escalate to absurdity. Once someone gets you to chant absurdities you start believing them, and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20527-those-who-can-make-you-believe-absurdities-can-make-you\"><u>once you believe in absurdities you’re ready to commit atrocities</u></a>.</p><p>You probably remember this strange thing that happened at Trump rallies throughout 2016. In the early days, Trumpers were chanting <i>“Make America great again!” </i>Even if you quibble with the “again” part, this isn’t terribly objectionable. But in short order they started chanting <i>“Lock her up!”</i> instead, a direct threat to Trump’s opponent and to democratic norms. A person who chanted <i>“Lock her up!”</i> in public, even if they didn’t&nbsp;<i>literally </i>mean it, cannot go back and vote for Hillary no matter what information comes out about the candidates. They have enlisted in an army, and declared Democrats to be their enemy.</p><p>This happens a lot to movement slogans — they start of positive and uniting, then suddenly find an enemy to turn on. Solidarity turns into hate. “Black lives matter” turns into “All cops are bastards”. “We stand against hate” turns into “Abolish the police”.</p><p>Now, perhaps it is not absurd to abolish the police <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-10/after-police-reform-crime-falls-in-camden-new-jersey\"><u>in some way</u></a>. I’m not expressing an opinion on the matter here. But a lot of people are repeating that slogan not because they thought independently about a world without armed law enforcement but because they started chanting with a crowd and that’s what the crowd ended up chanting. This is made clear by the fact that many of those saying “abolish the police” <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/12/21283813/george-floyd-blm-abolish-the-police-8cantwait-minneapolis\"><u>are hastening to clarify</u></a>&nbsp;that they do not literally mean that the police should be abolished. And yet they’re chanting it.</p><p>Again, if you have formed an independent opinion that the police should be abolished then you’re not feeding those that are building the war machine. You can discuss your plans for police dissolution, and realize those plans in a democratic way if you convince enough people through argument. Hopefully, it means that if the slogan switches tomorrow to “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2014/03/a-twitter-hashtag-probably-doesnt-prove-feminists-want-to-kill-all-men/359493/\"><u>kill all cops</u></a>” you would not switch with them, and will retain your independence. But those who repeat a slogan they do not really endorse and cannot defend with argument have given up the power of their independent though to those who write the slogans.</p><p>“It’s just a slogan” is the same as “I’m just following orders”. It makes you complicit. It will not protect you.</p><h2>The War</h2><p>When the enemy is marked and the soldiers are enlisted under banners of absurd slogans, the war will come. Those who are in the war to grab what they can for themselves will grab a lot. Those who are in it for a higher cause will find that a lot is lost and little is gained.</p><p>Primarily this will happen because the ostensible enemy is far and hard to strike at. Those who grab for power and status will grab it in their institutions, their workplaces, their social networks. But in our world of bubbles people don’t often share those with their ideological enemies. Instead they will strike at those near them, at whomever fails to learn the latest slogan and repeat it quickly and loudly. Or at those who fail at nimbly shifting the blame to their former friend or colleague, to let her take the hit in their stead.</p><p>This is already happening. People are getting mobbed, fired, and cancelled, often by their ideological allies. Relationships and friendships built over years are destroyed in seconds. It will be terrible and painful for all involved, even the people inflicting most of the harm. As I mentioned, a lot of this violence especially in the social sphere is not motivated by conscious malevolence. People will experience anger, anxiety, fear, and then submit to those with power unless they protect their independence.</p><h2>The Cause</h2><p>While this war rages in workplaces and on Facebook, the poor remain poor, the oppressed remain oppressed, and the corporate PR departments are going brrr to feed the flames and their own profits. This is not an unfortunate collateral of fighting for the cause. It directly undermines the cause.</p><p>What’s wrong with people being afraid to say something racist, you may ask? When people are threatened, whether they’re racist or not, their energy becomes entirely dedicated to self preservation, not to fighting for racial equity or police reform. If people call you racist, that accusation will not disappear the moment minorities achieve equal treatment by the law and law enforcement. Those who feel threatened will shout all the right slogans publicly but spend all their time privately sabotaging others around them. Cancel first, lest ye be cancelled.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/02/25/donald-trump-supporters-brexit-preference-falsfication-2016-primaries-column/80856410/\"><u>People who were scared</u></a> to speak <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BretEastonEllis/status/701300328675700736\"><u>voted for Trump</u></a>, and will do so again.</p><p>If you believe in a cause, your main tools must be truth and reason.

They want dialogue and inclusion. Those who are using anger at the police to grab power are interested in obedience and submission. They want outrage and exclusion.</p><p>So what&nbsp;<i>should</i> you say? <strong>Whatever you actually believe in and thought through</strong>.</p><p>If you care about racial equity and police reform and say what you think will help, you are making the conversation smarter and more effective.

If you protest so as not to be seen not protesting, the protests are making you corrupt. It takes some courage to think for yourself, but what do you think happens when everyone betrays that courage?</p><p>And if you’re not sure what you believe, it’s OK not to say anything. Even the police allow you to remain silent under arrest, informing you that whatever you say can be used against you. Think for yourself, or shut up.</p></body></html>",

But recently, they started posting links to research papers supposedly proving their point. And so, in the name of stance #1, I got up in the morning and put way too much time and effort into my own research project to investigate: do assholes really do better romantically, or is there hope for men and women to get along after all?</p><h2>Literature Review</h2><p>The literature sucks. That’s it, that’s the review.</p><p>Granted, this question is hard to measure empirically. It’s hard to define who is an asshole, let alone to identify them, let alone to measure how well they do with women in the long run — I struggled with those issues in my own research. But that’s far from the only problem.</p><p>The study I was sent most often is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/The-Dark-Triad-Personality.pdf\"><i><u>The Dark Triad personality: Attractiveness to women</u></i></a> by Carter et al (2013). The <strong>dark triad</strong> is the combination of narcissism (entitlement, grandiose self-image), psychopathy (callousness, lack of empathy), and Machiavellianism (insincere manipulation). The <strong>attractiveness</strong> was measured by asking women in an online questionnaire to read descriptions of men and say how attractive they find them. The <strong>women</strong> are 128 college undergrads in psychology.</p><p>The result of the study was a positive but statistically insignificant boost to the attractiveness of the dark triad descriptions. The DT guys were rated&nbsp;<i>significantly&nbsp;higher </i>on extraversion (which is attractive)<i> and significantly lower</i> on neuroticism (which isn’t). This would seem to imply that the dark triad isn’t attractive in itself, but only in what it signals about extraversion and neuroticism. Yet, somehow, the authors threw those three into a structural equation model (while conveniently ignoring other confounders like agreeableness) and squeezed out the requisite p-value to get published:</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/dt-sem.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/dt-sem.png 373w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/dt-sem.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/dt-sem.png?w=300 300w\"></figure><p>SEMs are a legitimate tool of social science research, but they’re impossible to replicate without access to the data and are rife with opportunities for <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2016/12/18/multiplicitous/\"><u>multiplicity and p-hacking</u></a>. I don’t know if this study shows anything at all about dark triad and attractiveness. Even if it does, I’m not sure <i>for whom</i> it shows this effect:</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-3.png?w=537&amp;h=90\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-3.png 412w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-3.png?w=150&amp;h=25 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-3.png?w=300&amp;h=50 300w\"></figure><p>Here are a couple of other studies I looked at:</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-1.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-1.png 719w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-1.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-1.png?w=300 300w\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-2.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-2.png 557w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-2.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/study-age-2.png?w=300 300w\"></figure><p>Basically, all the studies in this field use 19-year-old girls on college campuses. Not only are they <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/us-anthropologist-argues-applying-a-new-approach-to-avoid-weird-psychology\"><u>WEIRD</u></a>, which is a problem for a lot of psychology research, but 19-year-old women in college are <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/01/26/skewed-and-the-screwed/#age\"><u>in an extreme and unusual mating situation</u></a>.</p><p>With this, I stopped searching for more papers based on hungover college students with one exception I’ll get to later. I instead listened to six hours of dating podcasts with Geoffrey Miller, David Buss, and Tucker Max. Miller <a href=\"https://www.primalpoly.com/the-mating-mind\"><u>wrote books</u></a> about how sexual selection shaped our evolution. Buss <a href=\"https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/books/\"><u>wrote books</u></a> about how evolution shapes our sexual selections. Max <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Hope_They_Serve_Beer_in_Hell\"><u>wrote books</u></a> about being an asshole and getting laid. If anyone would know whether women prefer jerks and why, it’s those guys.</p><p>Everyone who believes that women like jerks is convinced that they know why, but of course they each have their own story. I’ve compiled a laundry list of hypotheses on the subject, based on the literature, the experts, and people I know.</p><h2>Why may women prefer assholes?</h2><p><strong>Hypothesis 1 — Signal of extraversion and assertiveness</strong></p><p>Women strongly prefer men who are extraverted and assertive to those who are socially passive. It could be that social dominance leads to social and professional success for the man making them a desirable partner, or that outgoing and decisive men simply make better lovers.</p><p><strong>1a</strong>&nbsp;Being an asshole is, in fact, positively correlated with assertiveness and extraversion and is thus a signal of those traits.</p><p><strong>1b</strong>&nbsp;Being an asshole <i>isn’t</i> correlated but is <i>mistaken</i> for assertiveness and extraversion. For example, someone may strive to be the center of attention because they are socially skilled and popular or because they are narcissistic, and it’s hard to immediately tell which is which.</p><p><strong>1c&nbsp;</strong>Being an asshole is a signal of high status or skills, because a loser could not get away with being a jerk. A weak and unpopular man would get laughed at for narcissistic delusions or beaten up for acting like a psychopath. Thus, exhibiting dark triad traits is a signal that one is not a loser.</p><p><strong>1d</strong> A corollary to the “asshole as signal” theories is that women will fall for assholes less as they grow in experience and wisdom. This is the main reason why studying this on 19-year-olds may be useless: women at 19 don’t have the experience to read men’s status and personality well. Moreover, men sharing a college campus at 19 are very undifferentiated, unlike later in life when women can look at stronger signals like career success.</p><p>When I was 19 I was nice and considerate and didn’t get laid a lot with 19-year-olds. Now that I’m 33 I’m trying to be nice and considerate and I’m happily married <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2019/10/16/polyamory-is-rational/\"><u>and having threesomes</u></a> with smart and lovely women my age. A few of the women I asked admitted to falling for jerks who mistreated them while in college, and how they learned from that experience to recognize assholes and avoid them.</p><p><strong>Hypothesis 2 — Short-term mating strategy</strong></p><p>Assholes aggressively seek out short-term mating: more casual sex, less lasting relationships. They are more successful at it mostly because of their single-minded pursuit of it. The downsides of dating assholes only emerge in the long term, when the Machiavellian’s lies can’t be sustained or the narcissist’s volatile self-esteem swings from peak to nadir.</p><p><strong>2a&nbsp;</strong>Women don’t like assholes but sleep with them because of selection effects — only psychopaths approach women aggressively at bars and clubs and it works because of the law of large numbers. This would be kinda funny if true because the sort of guy who posts links to research papers on blogs is almost certainly the sort of guy who will never do well in a bar or nightclub no matter what personality he adopts.</p><p>I’m the sort of guy who <i>writes</i> research posts, and none of the women I ever dated or slept with were met in a bar or nightclub. I mostly get dates through friends or <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/meet/\"><u>my online presence</u></a>, two areas that I built up through years of long-term-oriented effort. In the club nothing matters beyond the next 30 seconds.</p><p><strong>2b</strong> Some women just want a guy for short-term mating and are choosing the assholes consciously because they know these men will not want to hang around. What kind of women?</p><p>One trope that comes up often is women who have bad relationships with their fathers date jerks. My evo psych take on it is that in the absence of a role model for good fatherhood, women take the good genes in the good genes-good father tradeoff. Tucker Max’s take is that <i>“some girls need to work through the trauma of their daddy issues on some asshole’s dick, and there’s nothing wrong with that”</i>. Either way, I regret not asking about it on the survey.</p><p><strong>Hypothesis 3 — Being an asshole is just better</strong></p><p>The final option is that being an asshole is not a signal or a correlate of anything, it just works better for romantic and sexual success.</p><p><strong>3a&nbsp;</strong>Assholes successfully manipulate women into sleeping with them and staying with them with their dark skills.</p><p><strong>3b</strong> No manipulation needed — women just consciously prefer to date jerks and be mistreated.</p><p><strong>Hypothesis 4 — Women actually don’t prefer assholes</strong></p><p>But some people think that they do because:</p><p><strong>4a</strong> — They’re misogynists and want an excuse to be mean to women.</p><p><strong>4b —&nbsp;</strong>Instead of simply being nice they’re being <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2016/03/23/20_nice_guys/\"><u>Nice Guys (TM)</u></a> who objectify women and treat relationships as transactional.</p><p><strong>4c</strong> — They confuse being high status among men (which is obviously attractive) to being high status relative to your partner. The latter would imply that belittling (negging) and undermining your partner to lower their status would be a successful strategy.</p><p><strong>4d</strong> — They’re neophyte PUAs who measure success by getting numbers at bars, and scared women readily give a fake number to pushy psychopaths.</p><p><strong>4e —&nbsp;</strong>They assume that guys with different norms around flirting (e.g., working-class people, or the French)&nbsp; are assholes, when in fact they’re just more direct (which women like).</p><p><strong>4f </strong>— They derive the causation backwards, judging men who talk about their own romantic success to be assholes&nbsp;<i>because</i> they talk about it (to less successful men).</p><p>The hypotheses in this group are outside the scope of this research, but they’re worth mentioning. Even if women don’t prefer assholes at all, there are many reasons why this trope could flourish.</p><h2>Study Setup</h2><p><strong>Participants</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/05/10/please-fill-out-my-survey-on-personality-and-relationships/\"><u>My survey on personality and relationships</u></a> received 1,220 responses. Thank you to everyone who filled it out, and huge thanks to everyone who shared, retweeted, reddited, and told their mom. Thanks for nothing to the 8 people whose responses I threw out for being nonsensical and fucking up the attention check questions. This is a huge sample, larger than in any academic paper I looked at, and quite varied. I’m really grateful.</p><p>The median age is 29, with 90% of respondents between the ages of 21-45. We’re talking about adults who are looking to date, not college freshmen looking for course credit.</p><p>801 of the respondents are male and straight. 256 are female and either straight or bi, i.e. the mating target for straight men. Given the core question, the bulk of my study focuses on these two groups and I will mostly use <i>men</i> and&nbsp;<i>women</i> as shorthand to refer to them. I’ll discuss some findings that relate to everyone else separately.</p><p><strong>Personality Variables</strong></p><p>The survey estimated 6 personality traits using 4 questions each (you can review all the questions <a href=\"https://forms.gle/P76GtQixfBANu3jV7\"><u>on the survey itself</u></a>). Narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism with questions taken from <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0019265\"><u>this paper</u></a>, agreeableness and extraversion with questions <a href=\"https://ipip.ori.org/new_ipip-50-item-scale.htm\"><u>from here</u></a>, assertiveness <a href=\"https://www.unh.edu/health/sites/default/files/media/PDF/EmotionalHealth/assertivness_inventory.pdf\"><u>from here</u></a>.</p><p>The first three are collectively referred to as the <i>Dark Triad</i>. By subtracting Dark Triad from agreeableness I get a measure of&nbsp;<i>niceness</i>. Henceforth,&nbsp;<i>nice guys</i> are those high in agreeableness and low on the DT traits, while&nbsp;<i>assholes</i> are the opposite.</p><p>Assertiveness is often considered a sub-trait of extraversion, and the two showed up very similarly on the survey. They correlate highly with each other and have the same correlations with other traits. Given this, I sometimes combined both into a single measure I called <i>social dominance</i> for lack of a better term.&nbsp;<i>Dominant&nbsp;</i>people are decisive, talkative, like attention.&nbsp;<i>Passive</i> people are the opposite.</p><p>I also asked people to rate themselves on physical attractiveness (<i>hotness</i>), attractive talents, and popularity. My responders are slightly hotter than average according to themselves, and hotter the more cisgendered they are without any difference between men and women.</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/gender-hotness-1.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/gender-hotness-1.png?w=900 900w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/gender-hotness-1.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/gender-hotness-1.png?w=300 300w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/gender-hotness-1.png?w=768 768w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/gender-hotness-1.png 1019w\"></figure><p>Relationships Variables</p><p>I asked people for their lifetime number of sexual partners, current relationship status, and percent of their adult life that they’ve been in a relationship. I also asked what they’re looking for, which I operationalized as a numeric scale for <i>short-term orientation</i>: 3 for those looking for sex, 2 for casual dating, 1 for serious relationships, and 0 for those not looking for any more partners (14% of this latter group are single).</p><p>Here is the correlation matrix for all the raw variables measured, it does not look particularly different when broken down by gender.</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/raw-variable-corr-mat.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/raw-variable-corr-mat.png 725w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/raw-variable-corr-mat.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/raw-variable-corr-mat.png?w=300 300w\"></figure><p>We see some interesting things right away. Narcissism is correlated with attractive traits, but so is agreeableness. As people get older they become less narcissistic and more assertive. Extraversion is great for both friends and lovers. Of course, many of these traits confound each other so we’ll use regressions and controls to tease out the effects.</p><p>The direct measure of short-term mating success is the number of lifetime partners, but we’d expect that to correlate with age in a non-linear fashion. To control for age I pulled data from the giant <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5795598/#APP1title\"><u>National Survey of Family Growth</u></a> to derive the average number of partners for each age bracket. This is shown in the black line in the chart below (with the dots being my actual respondents), going up from 1 to 9 partners over people’s teens and twenties and topping out at 12 partners. Note the log scale of the Y-axis, modified to include those reporting 0 partners.</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/success-exptected-1.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/success-exptected-1.png?w=900 900w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/success-exptected-1.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/success-exptected-1.png?w=300 300w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/success-exptected-1.png?w=768 768w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/success-exptected-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/success-exptected-1.png 1080w\"></figure><p>On the NSFG men report a lot more partners than women (15 vs. 8 by age 40), <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2322523/Women-divide-men-times-How-BOTH-sexes-lie-partners-theyve-had.html\"><u>as common wisdom would suggest</u></a>. In my survey women actually reported more partners (12 vs. 10), especially bi women. Gay men reported slightly fewer partners (but they are 6 years younger on average than straight men in my sample), lesbians the least, queers the most (despite lower self-rated hotness). By and large, my data seems at least as trustworthy as the NSFG.</p><p>My ultimate metric for short-term mating success is log(N partners + 1 / expected N partners for age). The log scale makes intuitive sense since finding your first partner is about as hard as the next two, or going from N to 2N. Using a log scale prevents it from being overly skewed by outliers reporting hundreds of partners. So a virgin at 32 (expected N is 10) scores -3.3, while someone with 99 partners at that age scores +3.3 on short-term mating.</p><p>For long-term success, I wanted to combine the questions on current relationship status and overall percent of time in relationships. Looking at a bunch of data <a href=\"https://flowingdata.com/2017/11/01/who-is-married-by-now/\"><u>like this</u></a>, it seems that married people should expect 20 more years of marriage and single people should expect to stay unmarried for another 12. I decided to err on the conservative side and just add 15 years of “being in a serious relationship” to those currently in one for the purpose of calculating % of time romantically engaged. So a 33-year who spent half the time since age 18 in a relationship (7.5 years) but is now in a serious one will have that metric upgraded to 75%, since I assume their next 15 will be in a relationship as well.</p><p><strong>Regressions and reporting</strong></p><p>We’re 2,400 words in and I haven’t told you what the mainline finding is or mentioned p-values. That’s because <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1199351281669804032\"><u>p-values are a perversion of science</u></a>, and reporting headline results out of context is a perversion of science reporting.</p><p>Instead, I’ll post a lot of regression tables (which you can derive the p-value from if you’re kinky), a lot of colorful charts (all clickable for a larger version), and precise results like <i>the 20% nicest men are slightly likelier to be virgins (13.5% of them) than the 20% least nice ones (11%)</i>. My goal is to showcase the data first, not to argue a particular narrative.</p><h2>Results for Straight Men</h2><p>Here’s the regression of short-term mating success on all the personality and attractiveness variables. All the variables except for age have been normalized to have the same sample standard deviation so that their coefficients can be compared directly.</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th>Age-Adjusted Number of Sexual Partners (on a log scale)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>R</strong><sup>2 </sup>= 0.24</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Coefficient (SD)</th></tr><tr><th>Narcissism</th><th>-.09 (.05)</th></tr><tr><th>Psychopathy</th><th>.11 (.06)</th></tr><tr><th>Machiavellianism</th><th><strong>.21 (.06)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Agreeableness</th><th>-.03 (.07)</th></tr><tr><th>Assertiveness</th><th><strong>.15 (.06)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Extraversion</th><th><strong>.23 (.07)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Physical attractiveness (self-rated)</th><th><strong>.23 (.05)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Attractive talents</th><th><strong>.14 (.06)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Popularity</th><th><strong>.27 (.06)</strong></th></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>No big surprises here: men who are popular, good looking, and extraverted have more sexual partners. On the nice-asshole axis, assholes do have more partners mostly due to Machiavellianism. Let’s dig into this.</p><p><strong>Hypothesis 1 – Asshole as signal</strong></p><p>Narcissism and agreeableness are the strongest predictors of social dominance (sum of assertiveness and extraversion), accounting for 25% of the variance in it. You can see on the chart that the bright red dots (for socially dominant people) are concentrated towards the top right corner of those high in both agreeableness and narcissism.</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/nice-narcissists.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/nice-narcissists.png?w=900 900w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/nice-narcissists.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/nice-narcissists.png?w=300 300w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/nice-narcissists.png?w=768 768w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/nice-narcissists.png?w=1024 1024w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/nice-narcissists.png 1060w\"></figure><p>These two traits are also correlated with popularity, but once we control for social dominance the effect of narcissism is cut in half while the effect of agreeableness remains.</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th>Popularity&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>R</strong><sup>2 </sup>= 0.30</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Coefficient (SD)</th></tr><tr><th>Narcissism</th><th><strong>&nbsp;.11 (.04)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Psychopathy</th><th>-.08 (.04)</th></tr><tr><th>Machiavellianism</th><th>&nbsp; 0</th></tr><tr><th>Agreeableness</th><th><strong>&nbsp;.22 (.04)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Social Dominance</th><th><strong>&nbsp;.36 (.04)</strong></th></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>So narcissism is close to assertiveness and extraversion and is some signal of popularity (i.e. social status). Narcissism is also the only personality trait that positively predicts short-term orientation, i.e. reporting that you’re looking for sex or something casual and not a serious relationship (.13 coefficient with .04 SD). And yet, narcissists are not getting laid.</p><p>This matches the story I told in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/01/13/go-f-someone/\"><i><u>Go Fuck Someone</u></i></a><i>.&nbsp;</i>Narcissists <a href=\"https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1095744739410759680\"><u>want to be fuckable more than want to fuck</u></a>. They put all their effort into preserving their image and status, while getting intimate involves vulnerability and making room for the other person’s story. Narcissism is also the only personality trait that strongly predicts caring about one’s partner being good looking — a trait that’s more important for making impression on observers than for building relationships.</p><p>Agreeableness (measured as empathy, willingness to help, putting others at ease) is an even stronger predictor of social dominance and popularity, while Machiavellianism has no correlation with them and psychopaths are unpopular introverts.&nbsp; The latter are the two asshole traits that actually contribute to getting laid. So insofar as being an asshole helps, it is not through signaling status or extraversion.</p><p><strong>Hypothesis 2 – Assholes (and some women) just want to bang and ghost</strong></p><p>As mentioned, narcissism is the only trait that predicts short-term orientation for single men. For women, short-term orientation is basically predicted only by age — older women want more serious relationships.</p><p>However, women are less short-term oriented in general. Despite being slightly younger in my sample, 65% of single women report looking for a serious relationship (55% of men) and only 7% are looking for mere sex (12% of men). As I mentioned <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/01/26/skewed-and-the-screwed/#ratio\"><u>when discussing gender ratios</u></a>, this is not a huge difference but it’s important on the margin. For every two men looking for a one night stand (and those are likely the guys driving the number-of-partners metric), there is just one woman seeking the same.</p><p>62% of women who look for serious relationships answered that it’s very (5/5) important that their partners share their relationship goals. 45% of men don’t actually share those relationship goals, but would still like to bang those women.</p><p>Here are the four questions I used to assess Machiavellianism, which is a predictor of short-term mating success:</p><blockquote><p>I have used deceit or lied to get my way</p><p>I tend to exploit others towards my own end</p><p>I have used flattery to get my way</p><p>I tend to manipulate others to get my way</p></blockquote><p>Women don’t report seeking out assholes in any way — “nice and considerate” was a close second to “shares my goals” among the traits that are important to women in a partner, ahead of “happy and confident”, “physically attractive”, and “assertive and dominant”. This rules out hypothesis 3b (if women liked jerks, why would they lie about it?) and leads us to:</p><p><strong>Hypothesis 3a — </strong><a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fuckboi\"><strong><u>Fuckbois</u></strong></a></p><p>My data, as well as the entirety of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/\"><u>this horrible subreddit</u></a>, seem to point to some number of Machiavellian dudes successfully manipulating women to get laid. For example by lying about their relationship intentions. Machiavellianism (along with psychopathy) is in fact negatively correlated with caring about your partner sharing your relationship goals — they only care about getting what they want themselves.</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fuckbois.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fuckbois.png?w=900 900w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fuckbois.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fuckbois.png?w=300 300w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fuckbois.png?w=768 768w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fuckbois.png?w=1024 1024w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fuckbois.png 1060w\"></figure><p>However, successful manipulation is not the only possibility. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188690000180X\"><u>Machiavellianism</u><i><u> and sexuality: on the moderating role of biological sex</u></i></a><i> </i>by McHoskey (2001) looks at the relationship between, well, Machiavellianism and sexuality. Machiavellianism correlates with psychopathy and extraversion (replicated in my data), sexual success, and also with promiscuity, curiosity, and excitement about sex. Machiavellians are also more likely to feign love, get someone drunk, and coerce someone into sex.</p><p>So there are three reasons why Machiavellians could be having more sexual partners:</p><ol><li>Coercion and manipulation.</li><li>Correlation with extraversion, which gets you laid.</li><li>Promiscuity and seeking out sex — if you seek you shall find.</li></ol><p>If the first reason was the main one, it’s likely that Machiavellianism would correlate in particular with the number of partners but not the longevity of relationships. Once the lies come to light the Machiavellian fuckboi would have to move on to their next victim. We should see this in a negative relationship with long-term relationship success.</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th>Serious Relationship Success&nbsp; <strong>R</strong><sup>2 </sup>= 0.31</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Coefficient (SD)</th></tr><tr><th>Narcissism</th><th>0</th></tr><tr><th>Psychopathy</th><th>.03 (.06)</th></tr><tr><th>Machiavellianism</th><th>.10 (.06)</th></tr><tr><th>Agreeableness</th><th>.06 (.06)</th></tr><tr><th>Assertiveness</th><th>.11 (.06)</th></tr><tr><th>Extraversion</th><th>.02 (.07)</th></tr><tr><th>Physical attractiveness (self-rated)</th><th><strong>.18 (.05)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Attractive talents</th><th><strong>.14 (.06)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Popularity</th><th>.09 (.06)</th></tr><tr><th>Age</th><th><strong>.05 (.005)</strong></th></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>In fact, Machiavellianism has a weak but positive impact on serious relationship success. This still holds if we look at both components of long-term success separately, the percent of adult life spent in serious relationships and being in one right now. This could be an artifact of noise, but it’s likely that there’s at least some weak effect there which provides some evidence against the idea that the success of Machiavellians is entirely due to nefarious tactics.</p><p>The data also goes against the “signaling extraversion” hypothesis, since neither including nor removing extraversion from the regression has any effect on the coefficient of Machiavellianism. We are left with the story that Machiavellians are simply more promiscuous.</p><p>Machiavellians in my sample don’t show any unusual preferences for casual sex over serious relationships, although that’s not quite the same as promiscuity and excitement. They could just be more relationship-seeking overall, or they get a woman drunk for a one-night stand and then catch feelings by accident and end up a decade later married with three kids and a golden retriever while also cheating on the side. Many such cases, as they say.</p><p>Other than that, what’s the secret to finding a serious relationship? Be hot, be funny, be assertive, be <strong>patient</strong>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/eventual-relationships.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/eventual-relationships.png?w=900 900w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/eventual-relationships.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/eventual-relationships.png?w=300 300w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/eventual-relationships.png?w=768 768w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/eventual-relationships.png?w=1024 1024w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/eventual-relationships.png 1060w\"></figure><p>30% of men below age 30 report never having been in a serious relationship, but only 2 out of the 128 men over the age of 40 report the same.

Some of them fit what I would have predicted and some were surprising, but take them all with a pinch of salt since they were not the original object of the study.</p><p><strong>We seek partners like us</strong></p><p>Attractive people care more about their partner’s attractiveness, nice people care about their partner being nice, assertive people care more about their partner being happy and confident (although they don’t care about their partner being assertive). All of those relationships are significant and hold for both men and women. This should serve as a word of caution for those looking to be assholes as a romantic strategy — you may end up dating assholes yourself.</p><p>You can imagine virtuous and vicious cycles as a result of this. I was always nice and considerate, and it didn’t work until I figured out how to filter for women who are themselves lovely and kind. Now my partners and I can all be nice to each other and enjoy life. If you start off being a jerk you attract jerks, and this further justifies being mean and perpetuating the cycle.</p><p><strong>Attractiveness matters for women only in the short term</strong></p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-sex.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-sex.png?w=900 900w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-sex.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-sex.png?w=300 300w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-sex.png?w=768 768w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-sex.png?w=1024 1024w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-sex.png 1060w\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-relat.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-relat.png?w=900 900w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-relat.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-relat.png?w=300 300w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-relat.png?w=768 768w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-relat.png?w=1024 1024w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/hot-women-relat.png 1060w\"></figure><p>A woman’s self-rated attractiveness predicts her number of sexual partners, but not her success at being in serious romantic relationships. The latter is correlated with assertiveness and agreeableness, and of course with age. This matches the preferences reported by men: guys who look for casual sex care more about a partner’s looks than those who look for serious relationships.</p><p>Narcissism also correlates with women’s short-term mating success but not serious relationships. I talked about it when discussing <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/01/26/skewed-and-the-screwed/\"><u>women’s mating markets</u></a>. Hot young women have their choice of short-term partners, and they don’t pay much of a penalty for narcissism or disagreeable political stances like #KillAllMen. But they can remain in the mindset that a relationship is something they <i>deserve</i> <i>for who they are</i> instead of something they have to <i>build and compromise for.</i> <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/01/13/go-f-someone/\"><u>If that’s you</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Perhaps you are going on dates with lovely people but the dates aren’t going exactly according to the script you envisioned. Or the people who flirt and match with you are not quite what someone with your degrees and BMI and yoga skill deserves. In this case you <i>should</i>&nbsp;go back to self-development: fix your narcissism and figure out what value you actually provide to a romantic partner besides imagining that you raise their status through mere association.</p><p>How to tell if you’re in the latter category? If you get a lot of&nbsp;<i>“I can’t believe a great guy/gal like you can’t find a girlfriend/boyfriend”&nbsp;</i>from your friends, that’s a sign. Your friends saying that is not a compliment, it’s a mockery of your misguided self-focus.</p></blockquote><p><strong>The opposite is true for gay men</strong></p><p>The only trait that contributes to <i>short-term</i> success for the 122 gay and bisexual men in my sample is agreeableness (.59 coefficient with .19 SD, p=.003 without correcting for multiplicity). The only trait that correlates with<i> long-term</i> success aside from age is hotness (.09 coefficient with .03 SD, p=.006). I have no theories about this result or much confidence in it despite the statistical significance.</p><p><strong>Personality and gender</strong></p><p>Cis men are more psychopathic, disagreeable, and assertive. Women (queer and cis) are more narcissistic. Queer men (N=16) are meek sweethearts. This seems mostly in line with prevailing stereotypes.</p><p>True self-confidence comes with age</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th>Personality predictors of age&nbsp; <strong>R</strong><sup>2 </sup>= 0.05</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Coefficient (SD)</th></tr><tr><th>Narcissism</th><th><strong>-1.96 (.35)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Psychopathy</th><th>-.38 (.37)</th></tr><tr><th>Machiavellianism</th><th>&nbsp;.13 (.37)</th></tr><tr><th>Agreeableness</th><th>-.35 (.36)</th></tr><tr><th>Assertiveness</th><th><strong>1.44 (.35)</strong></th></tr><tr><th>Extraversion</th><th>&nbsp;.46 (.40)</th></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>People become less narcissistic and more assertive with age. This result is statistically significant although the effect is quite weak — people who are 1 SD more assertive are only 1.44 years older on average. Older people and people who date younger partners are also significantly less likely to report wanting a partner who is dominant and assertive, with no other major changes in partner preference.</p><p><strong>Good looks don’t affect popularity</strong></p><p>Popularity with friends is driven by the same traits for both men and women: extraversion, agreeableness, and attractive talents. Quite remarkably, physical attractiveness has almost no impact for either gender, and neither does the dark triad.</p><p>I find the lack of relationship between looks and popularity surprising. Looks are strongly correlated with attractive talents (humor, art, athletics) and if we don’t control for those talents then the relationship between looks and popularity shows up, although still much weaker than either extraversion or agreeableness. Perhaps people prefer to hang out with friends of similar physical attractiveness, rather than those who overshadow them in the beauty department.</p><h2>Sex is Other People</h2><p>As I said before, my goal with this post was to showcase a lot of information and let the readers draw their own conclusions. Before you do, remember that statistical significance doesn’t imply a huge effect size, that my measures are messy and limited, and that some of the positive results are likely artifacts of noise. My sample also has various selection biases, although if you’re the sort of person who reads Putanumonit you’re probably dating the sort of people who fill out Putanumonit surveys and so these results are very relevant to your own life.</p><p>But with all those caveats, I think there’s a major theme that emerges: <strong>mating success is about focusing on other people, not yourself</strong>. Assertiveness, extraversion, humor — engaging with others leads to romantic success for both genders. Caring about others also helps men make friends and helps women find partners. Of the dark triad traits, the one that is focused on engaging with others even if in a nefarious way (Machiavellianism) is helpful, while caring about oneself instead of others (narcissism, psychopathy) are neutral or negative. Physical attractiveness is important, but it’s far from being an overwhelming factor.</p><p>This is good news. Assertiveness and extraversion don’t show up on your forehead, they are demonstrated in your behavior which you have control over. It’s hard to change fixed characteristics about yourself such as beauty or status. It’s easier to practice engaging with people.</p><p>People who have met me since I came to New York in my mid twenties find it hard to believe that for long stretches of my youth I didn’t have social confidence or many friends, but it’s true. <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/05/08/predictable-identities-9-how-to-change/\"><u>I had to change social scenes several times</u></a> and learn to thread the line between assertiveness and disagreeableness. I became less self-absorbed, more curious about others. This all massively helped my dating life. I also got older, of course, which helps.</p><p>Mating success isn’t guaranteed, and some people have a much stronger starting point than others. But it always starts with <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/meet/\"><u>going out and talking to people</u></a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/virgin-chad.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/virgin-chad.png?w=900 900w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/virgin-chad.png?w=1800 1800w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/virgin-chad.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/virgin-chad.png?w=300 300w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/virgin-chad.png?w=768 768w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/virgin-chad.png?w=1024 1024w\"></figure><h2>P.S.</h2><p>I’m not sure if I’m going to publish the raw data, but I can prepare a sanitized version to share upon request if you <a href=\"mailto:putanumonit@gmail.com\"><u>write</u></a> to let me know what you want it for.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>This post is my attempt to summarize and distill the major public debates about MIRI's <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf\">highly reliable agent designs</a> (HRAD) work (which includes work on decision theory), including the discussions in <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality\">Realism about rationality</a> and Daniel Dewey's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SEL9PW8jozrvLnkb4/my-current-thoughts-on-miri-s-highly-reliable-agent-design\">My current thoughts on MIRI's \"highly reliable agent design\" work</a>. Part of the difficulty with discussing the value of HRAD work is that it's not even clear what the disagreement is about, so my summary takes the form of multiple possible \"worlds\" we might be in; each world consists of a positive case for doing HRAD work, along with the potential objections to that case, which results in one or more cruxes.</p>\n<p>I will talk about \"being in a world\" throughout this post. What I mean by this is the following: If we are \"in world X\", that means that the case for HRAD work outlined in world X is the one that most resonates with MIRI people as their motivation for doing HRAD work; and that when people disagree about the value of HRAD work, this is what the disagreement is about. When I say that \"I think we are in this world\", I don't mean that I agree with this case for HRAD work; it just means that this is what I think MIRI people think.</p>\n<p>In this post, the pro-HRAD stance is something like \"HRAD work is the most important kind of technical research in AI alignment; it is the overwhelming priority and we're pretty much screwed if we under-invest in this kind of research\" and the anti-HRAD stance is something like \"HRAD work seems significantly less promising than other technical AI alignment agendas, such as the approaches to directly align machine learning systems (e.g. iterated amplification)\". There is a much <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JSjagTDGdz2y6nNE3/on-the-purposes-of-decision-theory-research/comment/GBZt6scwpAseroYjR\">weaker pro-HRAD stance</a>, which is something like \"HRAD work is interesting and doing more of it adds value, but it's not necessarily the most important kind of technical AI alignment research to be working on\"; this post is not about this weaker stance.</p>\n<h2>Clarifying some terms</h2>\n<p>Before describing the various worlds, I want to present some distinctions that have come up in discussions about HRAD, which will be relevant when distinguishing between the worlds.</p>\n<h3>Levels of abstraction vs levels of indirection</h3>\n<p>The idea of levels of abstraction was introduced in the context of debate about HRAD work by Rohin Shah, and is described in <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/YMNwHcPNPd4pDK7MR\">this comment</a> (start from \"When groups of humans try to build complicated stuff\"). For more background, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29#Levels_of_abstraction\">these</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction\">articles</a> on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>Later on, in <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/aNHTM9iwfrCeAcHtn\">this comment</a> Rohin gave a somewhat different \"levels\" idea, which I've decided to call \"levels of indirection\". The idea is that there might not be a <em>hierarchy of abstraction</em>, but there's still multiple intermediate layers between the theory you have and the end-result you want. The relevant \"levels of indirection\" is the sequence HRAD → machine learning → AGI. Even though levels of indirection are different from levels of abstraction, the idea is that the same principle applies, where the more levels there are, the harder it becomes for a theory to apply to the final level.</p>\n<h3>Precise vs imprecise theory</h3>\n<p>A precise theory is one which can scale to 2+ levels of abstraction/indirection.</p>\n<p>An imprecise theory is one which can scale to at most 1 level of abstraction/indirection.</p>\n<p>More intuitively, a precise theory is more mathy, rigorous, and exact like pure math and physics, and an imprecise theory is less mathy, like economics and psychology.</p>\n<h3>Building agents from the ground up vs understanding the behavior of rational agents and predicting roughly what they will do</h3>\n<p>This distinction comes from Abram Demski's <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/3f6fadtcv8FsgwKsz\">comment</a>. However, I'm not confident I've understood this distinction in the way that Abram intended it, so what I describe below may be a slightly different distinction.</p>\n<p>Building agents from the ground up means having a precise theory of rationality that allows us to build an AGI in a satisfying way, e.g. where someone with <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/8gqrbnW758qjHFTrH/security-mindset-and-ordinary-paranoia\">security mindset</a> can be confident that it is aligned. Importantly, we allow the AGI to be built using whatever way is safest or most theoretically satisfying, rather than requiring that the AGI be built using whatever methods are mainstream (e.g. current machine learning methods).</p>\n<p>Understanding the behavior of rational agents and predicting roughly what they will do means being handed an arbitrary agent implemented in some way (e.g. via blackbox ML) and then being able to predict roughly how it will act.</p>\n<p>I think of the difference between these two as the difference between existential and universal quantification: \"there exists x such that P(x)\" and \"for all x we have P(x)\", where P(x) is something like \"we can understand and predict how x will act in a satisfying way\". The former only says that we can build some AGI using the precise theory that we understand well, whereas the latter says we have to deal with whatever kind of AGI that ends up being developed using methods we might not understand well.</p>\n<h2>World 1</h2>\n<h3>Case for HRAD</h3>\n<p>The goal of HRAD research is to generally become less confused about things like counterfactual reasoning and logical uncertainty. Becoming less confused about these things will: help AGI builders avoid, detect, and fix safety issues; help AGI builders predict or explain safety issues; help to conceptually clarify the AI alignment problem; and help us be satisfied that the AGI is doing what we want. Moreover, unless we become less confused about these things, we are likely to screw up alignment because we won't deeply understand how our AI systems are reasoning. There are other ways to gain clarity on alignment, such as by working on iterated amplification, but these approaches <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/wkF5rHDFKEWyJJLj2/link-book-review-reframing-superintelligence-ssc/comment/4zkpL3DZXaCMuR4Mn\">don't decompose cognitive work enough</a>.</p>\n<p>For this case, it is not important for the final product of HRAD to be a precise theory. Even if the final theory of embedded agency is imprecise, or even if <em>there is no</em> \"final say\" on the topic, if we are merely much less confused than we are now, that is still good enough to help us ensure AI systems are aligned.</p>\n<h3>Why I think we might be in this world</h3>\n<p>The main reason I think we might be in this world (i.e. that the above case is the motivating reason for MIRI prioritizing HRAD work) is that people at MIRI frequently seem to be saying something like the case above. However, they also seem to be saying different things in other places, so I'm not confident this is actually their case. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/OpenPhil2016Supplement.pdf#page=13\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>: \"Techniques you can actually adapt in a safe AI, come the day, will probably have very simple cores — the sort of core concept that takes up three paragraphs, where any reviewer who didn’t spend five years struggling on the problem themselves will think, “Oh I could have thought of that.” Someday there may be a book full of clever and difficult things to say about the simple core — contrast the simplicity of the core concept of causal models, versus the complexity of proving all the clever things Judea Pearl had to say about causal models. But the planetary benefit is mainly from posing understandable problems crisply enough so that people can see they are open, and then from the simpler abstract properties of a found solution — complicated aspects will not carry over to real AIs later.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/uKbxi2EJ3KBNRDGpL/comment-on-decision-theory\">Rob Bensinger</a>: \"We’re working on decision theory because there’s a cluster of confusing issues here (e.g., counterfactuals, updatelessness, coordination) that represent a lot of holes or anomalies in our current best understanding of what high-quality reasoning is and how it works.\" and phrases like \"developing an understanding of roughly what counterfactuals are and how they work\" and \"very roughly how/why it works\"  -- This post then doesn't really specify whether or not the final output is expected to be precise. (The analogy with probability theory and rockets gestures at precise theories, but the post doesn't come out and say it.)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/XEbNPAyvjpTcGufLm\">Abram Demski</a>: \"I don't think there's a true rationality out there in the world, or a true decision theory out there in the world, or even a true notion of intelligence out there in the world. I work on agent foundations because there's <em>still something I'm confused about</em> even after that, and furthermore, AI safety work seems fairly hopeless while still so radically confused about the-phenomena-which-we-use-intelligence-and-rationality-and-agency-and-decision-theory-to-describe.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SEL9PW8jozrvLnkb4/my-current-thoughts-on-miri-s-highly-reliable-agent-design?commentId=D3PDv7kqJuByt8TRr\">Nate Soares</a>: \"The main case for HRAD problems is that we expect them to help in a gestalt way with many different known failure modes (and, plausibly, unknown ones). E.g., 'developing a basic understanding of counterfactual reasoning improves our ability to understand the first AGI systems in a general way, and if we understand AGI better it's likelier we can build systems to address deception, edge instantiation, goal instability, and a number of other problems'.\"</li>\n<li>In the <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2018/11/22/2018-update-our-new-research-directions/#section2\">deconfusion</a> section of MIRI's 2018 update, some of the examples of deconfusion are not precise/mathematical in nature (e.g. see the paragraph starting with \"In 1998, conversations about AI risk and technological singularity scenarios often went in circles in a funny sort of way\" and the list after \"Among the bits of conceptual progress that MIRI contributed to are\"). There are more mathematical examples in the post, but the fact that there are also non-mathematical examples suggests that having a precise theory of rationality is not important to the case for HRAD work. There's also the quote \"As AI researchers explore the space of optimizers, what will it take to ensure that the first highly capable optimizers that researchers find are optimizers they know how to aim at chosen tasks? I’m not sure, because I’m still in some sense confused about the question.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The crux</h3>\n<p>One way to reject this case for HRAD work is by saying that imprecise theories of rationality are insufficient for helping to align AI systems. This is what Rohin does in <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/iSubbXvKW7uM6rus6\">this comment</a> where he says imprecise theories cannot build things \"2+ levels above\".</p>\n<p>There is a separate potential rejection, which is to say that either HRAD work will never result in precise theories or that even a precise theory is insufficient for helping to align AI systems. However, these move the crux to a place where they apply to more restricted worlds where the goal of HRAD work is specifically to come up with a precise theory, so these will be covered in the other worlds below.</p>\n<p>There is a third rejection, which is to argue that other approaches (such as iterated amplification) are more promising for gaining clarity on alignment. In this case, the main disagreement may instead be about other agendas rather than about HRAD.</p>\n<h2>World 2</h2>\n<h3>Case for HRAD</h3>\n<p>The goal of HRAD research is to come up with a theory of rationality that is so precise that it allows one to build an agent from the ground up. Deconfusion is still important, as with world 1, but in this case we don't merely want any kind of deconfusion, but specifically deconfusion which is accompanied by a precise theory of rationality.</p>\n<p>For this case, HRAD research isn't intended to produce a precise theory about how to predict ML systems, or to be able to make precise predictions about what ML systems will do. Instead, the idea is that the precise theory of rationality will help AGI builders avoid, detect, and fix safety issues; predict or explain safety issues; help to conceptually clarify the AI alignment problem; and help us be satisfied that the AGI is doing what we want. In other words, instead of directly using a precise theory about understanding/predicting rational agents in general, we use the precise theory about rationality to help us <em>roughly</em> predict what rational agents will do in general (including ML systems).</p>\n<p>As with world 1, unless we become less confused, we are likely to screw up alignment because we won't deeply understand how our AI systems are reasoning. There are other ways to gain clarity on alignment, such as by working on iterated amplification, but these approaches <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/wkF5rHDFKEWyJJLj2/link-book-review-reframing-superintelligence-ssc/comment/4zkpL3DZXaCMuR4Mn\">don't decompose cognitive work enough</a>.</p>\n<h3>Why I think we might be in this world</h3>\n<p>This seems to be what Abram is saying in <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/3f6fadtcv8FsgwKsz\">this comment</a> (see especially the part after \"I guess there's a tricky interpretational issue here\").</p>\n<p>It also seems to match what Rohin is saying in <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/iSubbXvKW7uM6rus6\">these</a> <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/YMNwHcPNPd4pDK7MR\">two</a> comments.</p>\n<p>The examples MIRI people sometimes give for precedents of HRAD-ish work, like the work done by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SEL9PW8jozrvLnkb4/my-current-thoughts-on-miri-s-highly-reliable-agent-design?commentId=Z6TbXivpjxWyc8NYM\">Turing</a>, <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/27/miris-approach/\">Shannon</a>, and <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2018/11/22/2018-update-our-new-research-directions/#section2\">Maxwell</a> are precise mathematical theories.</p>\n<h3>The crux</h3>\n<p>There seem to be two possible rejections of this case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can reject the existence of the precise theory of rationality. This is what Rohin does in <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/YMNwHcPNPd4pDK7MR\">this comment</a> and <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/iSubbXvKW7uM6rus6\">this comment</a> where he says \"MIRI's theories will always be the relatively-imprecise theories that can't scale to '2+ levels above'.\" Paul Christiano seems to also do this, as summarized by Jessica Taylor in <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1129\">this post</a>: intuition 18 is \"There are reasons to expect the details of reasoning well to be 'messy'.\"</li>\n<li>We can argue that even a precise theory of rationality is insufficient for helping to align AI systems. This seems to be what Daniel Dewey is doing in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SEL9PW8jozrvLnkb4/my-current-thoughts-on-miri-s-highly-reliable-agent-design\">this post</a> when he says things like \"AIXI and Solomonoff induction are particularly strong examples of work that is very close to HRAD, but don't seem to have been applicable to real AI systems\" and \"It seems plausible that the kinds of axiomatic descriptions that HRAD work could produce would be too taxing to be usefully applied to any practical AI system\".</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>World 3</h2>\n<h3>Case for HRAD</h3>\n<p>The goal of HRAD research is to directly come up with a precise theory for understanding the behavior of rational agents and predicting what they will do. Deconfusion is still important, as with worlds 1 and 2, but in this case we don't merely want any kind of deconfusion, but specifically deconfusion which is accompanied by a precise theory that allows us to predict agents' behavior in general. And a precise theory is important, but we don't merely want a precise theory that lets us <em>build</em> an agent; we want our theory to act like a box that takes in an arbitrary agent (such as one built using ML and other black boxes) and allows us to analyze its behavior.</p>\n<p>This theory can then be used to help AGI builders avoid, detect, and fix safety issues; predict or explain safety issues; help to conceptually clarify the AI alignment problem; and help us be satisfied that the AGI is doing what we want.</p>\n<p>As with world 1 and 2, unless we become less confused, we are likely to screw up alignment because we won't deeply understand how our AI systems are reasoning. There are other ways to gain clarity on alignment, such as by working on iterated amplification, but these approaches <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/wkF5rHDFKEWyJJLj2/link-book-review-reframing-superintelligence-ssc/comment/4zkpL3DZXaCMuR4Mn\">don't decompose cognitive work enough</a>.</p>\n<h3>Why I think we might be in this world</h3>\n<p>I mostly don't think we're in this world, but some critics might think we are.</p>\n<p>For example Abram says in <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD/realism-about-rationality/comment/3f6fadtcv8FsgwKsz\">this comment</a>: \"I can see how Ricraz would read statements of the first type [i.e. having precise understanding of rationality] as suggesting very strong claims of the second type [i.e. being able to understand the behavior of agents in general].\"</p>\n<p>Daniel Dewey might also expect to be in this world; it's hard for me to tell based on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SEL9PW8jozrvLnkb4/my-current-thoughts-on-miri-s-highly-reliable-agent-design\">his post about HRAD</a>.</p>\n<h3>The crux</h3>\n<p>The crux in this world is basically the same as the first rejection for world 2: we can reject the existence of a precise theory for understanding the behavior of arbitrary rational agents.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion, and moving forward</h2>\n<p>To summarize the above, combining all of possible worlds, the pro-HRAD stance becomes:</p>\n<pre><code>(ML safety agenda not promising) and (\n  (even an imprecise theory of rationality helps to align AGI) or\n  ((a precise theory of rationality can be found) and\n   (a precise theory of rationality can be used to help align AGI)) or\n  (a precise theory to predict behavior of arbitrary agent can be found)\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and the anti-HRAD stance is the negation of the above:</p>\n<pre><code>(ML safety agenda promising) or (\n  (an imprecise theory of rationality cannot be used to help align AGI) and\n  ((a precise theory of rationality cannot be found) or\n   (even a precise theory of rationality cannot be used to help align AGI)) and\n  (a precise theory to predict behavior of arbitrary agent cannot be found)\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>How does this fit under the <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/faaoyve5ryY8E5M4r/eli-s-shortform-feed/comment/HpFfoqZXAbBZcsPKF\">Double</a> <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/faaoyve5ryY8E5M4r/eli-s-shortform-feed/comment/D2v9JH7DX9s7GXHWF\">Crux</a> framework? The current \"overall crux\" is a messy proposition consisting of multiple conjunctions and disjunctions, and fully resolving the disagreement can in the worst case require assigning truth values to all five parts: the statement \"A and (B or (C and D) or E)\", with disagreements resolved in the order A=True, B=False, C=True, D=False can still be true or false depending on the value of E. From an efficiency perspective, if some of the conjunctions/disjunctions don't matter, we want to get rid of them in order to simplify the structure of the overall crux (this corresponds to identifying which \"world\" we are in, using the terminology of this post), and we also might want to pick an ordering of which parts to resolve first (for example, with A=True and B=True, we already know the overall proposition is true).</p>\n<p>So some steps for moving the discussion forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think it would be great to get HRAD proponents/opponents to be like \"we're definitely in world X, and not any of the other worlds\" or even be like \"actually, the case for HRAD really is disjunctive, so both of the cases in worlds X and Y apply\".</li>\n<li>If I missed any additional possible worlds, or if I described one of the worlds incorrectly, I am interested in hearing about it.</li>\n<li>If it becomes clear which world we are in, then the next step is to drill down on the crux(es) in that world.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thanks to Ben Cottier, Rohin Shah, and Joe Bernstein for feedback on this post.</em></p>\n</body></html>",

We train ML models on the tasks they are meant to solve</h2><p>When we train (fit) any given ML model for a specific problem, on  which we have a training dataset, there are several ways we go about it,  but all of them involve using that dataset.</p><p>Say we&#x2019;re training a model that takes a 2d image of some glassware  and turn it into a 3d rendering. We have images of 2000 glasses from  different angles and in different lighting conditions and an associated  3d model.</p><p>How do we go about training the model? Well, arguable, we could start  small then feed the whole dataset, we could use different sizes for  test/train/validation, we could use cv to determine the overall accuracy  of our method or decide it would take to long... etc</p><p>But I&apos;m fairly sure that nobody will ever say:</p><blockquote>I know, let&apos;s take a dataset of 2d images of cars and their 3d rendering and train the model on that first.</blockquote><p>If you already have a trained model that does some other 2d image  processing or predicts 3d structure from 2d images, you might try doing  some weight transfer or using part of the model as a backbone. But  that&apos;s just because the hard part, the training, is already done.</p><p>To have a very charitable example, maybe our 3d rendering is not  accurate enough and we&apos;ve tried everything but getting more data is too  expensive. At that point, we could decide to bring in other 2d to 3d  datasets and also train the model on that and hope there&apos;s enough  similarity between the two datasets that the model will get better at  the glassware task.</p><p>One way or another, we&apos;d try to use the most relevant dataset first.</p><h2>2. We don&apos;t do this with humans</h2><p>I&apos;m certain some % of the people studying how to implement basic  building blocks (e.g. allocators, decision trees, and vectors) in C  during a 4-year CS degree end up becoming language designers or kernel  developers and are glad they took the time to learn those things.</p><p>But the vast majority of CS students go on to become frontend  developer or full-stack developers where all the &quot;backend&quot; knowledge  they require is how to write SQL and how to read/write from file and  high-level abstractions over TCP or UDP sockets.</p><p>At which point I ask something like:</p><blockquote>Well, why not just teach those people how to make UIs and how to write a basic backend in flask?</blockquote><p>And I get a mumbled answer about something-something having to learn the fundamentals. To which I reply:</p><blockquote>I mean, I don&apos;t think you&apos;re getting it, the things you are teaching  haven&apos;t been fundamental for 20+ years, they are hard as fuck. I know  how to write a half-decent allocator or an almost std-level vector  implementation and I know how to make a basic CRMS and I can&apos;t imagine  what sort of insane mind would find the former two easier to learn. I  also can&apos;t imagine the former two being useful in any way to building a  CRMS, other than by virtue of the fact that learning them will transfer  some of the skills needed to build a CRMS.</blockquote><p>At which point I get into <a href=\"https://blog.cerebralab.com/A_Better_Way_of_Understanding_Systems\">arguments</a> about how education seems only <a href=\"https://blog.cerebralab.com/Is_a_trillion-dollar_worth_of_programming_lying_on_the_ground\">marginally related to salary</a>  and job performance in most programming jobs.

The whole thing boils  down to half-arsed statistics because evaluating things like salary, job  performance, and education levels is, who would have guessed, really  hard.</p><p>So for the moment, I will just assume that your run of the mill  angular developer doesn&apos;t need a 4 year CS degree to do his job and a  6-month online program that teaches the direct skills required is  sufficient.</p><h2>3. Based on purely empirical evidence, I think we should</h2><p>Going even further, let&apos;s get into topics like memory ordering. I&apos;m  fairly sure these would be considered fairly advanced subjects as far as  programming is concerned, to know how to properly use memory ordering  is to basically write ASM code.</p><p>I learned about the subject by just deciding one day that I will write a <a href=\"https://github.com/George3d6/Ouraglyfi-Cpp\">fixed size, lock-free, wait-free, thread-safe queue</a> that allows more multi-reader, multi-writer, or both... then to make it a bit harder I went ahead and also <a href=\"https://github.com/George3d6/Ouraglyfi-Rust\">developed a Rust version in parallel</a>.</p><p><strong>Note: I&apos;m fairly proud of the above implementations since I  was basically a kid 4 years ago when I wrote them. I don&apos;t think they  are well tested enough to use in production and they likely have flaws  that basic testing on an x86 and raspberry PI ARM processor didn&apos;t  catch. Nor are they anywhere close to the most efficient implementations  possible.</strong></p><p>I&apos;m certain that I don&apos;t have anywhere near a perfect grasp of memory  ordering and &quot;low level&quot; parallelism in general. However, I do think  the above learning experience was a good way to get an understanding  equivalent to an advanced university course in ~2 weeks of work.</p><p>Now, this is an n=1 example, but I don&apos;t think that I&apos;m alone in liking to learn this way.</p><p>The few people I know that can write an above half-arsed compiler  didn&apos;t finish the Dragon book and then started making their first one,  they did the two in parallel or even the other way around.</p><p>I know a lot of people who swear by Elm, Clojure, and Haskell, to my  knowledge none of them bothered to learn Category theory in-depth or  ever read Hilbert, G&#xF6;del or Russel. This didn&apos;t seem to stop them from  learning Haskell or becoming good at it.</p><p>Most ML practitioners I know don&apos;t have a perfect grasp of linear  algebra, they can compute the gradients for a simple neural network by  hand or even speculate on the gradients resulting from using a specific  loss function, but it&apos;s not a skill they are very confident in. On the  other hand, most ML practitioners I know are fairly confident in writing  their own loss functions when it suits the problem.</p><p>That&apos;s because most people learning ML don&apos;t start with a Ph.D. in  applied mathematics, they start playing around with models and learn  just enough LA to understand(?) what they are doing.</p><p>Conversely, most people that want to get a Ph.D. in applied  mathematics working on automatic differentiation might not know how to  use TensorFlow very well, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s something which is at  all harmful to their progress. Even though the final results will find  practical applications in libraries over which Tensorflow might serve as  a wrapper.</p><p>Indeed, in any area of computer-based research or engineering people  seem comfortable tackling hard problems even if they don&apos;t have all the  relevant context for understanding those problems, they have to be, one  lifetime is enough to learn all the relevant context.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say you never have to learn anything other than the  thing you are working on, I&apos;d be the last person to make that claim. But  usually, if you have enough context to understand a problem, the  relevant context will inevitably come up as you are trying to solve it.</p><h1>4. Why learning the contextual skills independently is useful</h1><p>But say that you are a medieval knight and are trying to learn how to  be the most efficient killing machine in a mounted charge with lances.</p><p>There are many ways to do it, but hopping on a horse, strapping you  spurs and charging with a heavy lance attached your warhorse (the  1,000kg beast charging at 25km/h into a sea of sharp metal) is 100% not  the way to do it.</p><p>You&apos;d probably learn how to ride first, then learn how to ride fast,  then learn how to ride in formation, then learn how to do it in heavy  armor, then how to do it with a lance... etc</p><p>In parallel, you&apos;d probably be practicing with a lance on foot, or by  stabbing hey sacks with a long blunt stick while riding a poney.</p><p>You might also do quite a lot of adjacent physical training, learn to  fight with and against a dozen or so weapons and types of shield and  armor.</p><p>Then you&apos;d spend years helping on the battlefield as a squire, a role  that didn&apos;t involve being in the vanguard of a mounted charge.</p><p>Maybe you&apos;d participate in a tourney or two, maybe you&apos;d participate a  dozen mock tourneys where the goal is slightly patting your opponent  with a blunt stick.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because the cost of using the &quot;real training data&quot; is high. If I  would be teleported inside a knight&apos;s armor strapped to horse galloping  towards an enemy formation with a lance in my hand I would almost  certainly die.</p><p>If someone with only 20% of a knight&apos;s training did so, the chance of death or debilitating injury might go down to half.</p><p>But at the end of the day, even for the best knight out there, the  cost of learning in battle is still a, say, 1/20th chance of death or  debilitating injury.</p><p>Even partially realistic training examples like tourneys would still  be very dangerous, with a small chance of death, a small but significant  chance of a debilitating injury, and an almost certainty of suffering a  minor trauma and damage to your expensive equipment.</p><p>I&apos;ve never tried fighting with blunt weapons in a mock battle, but I  have friends who did and they inform me you get injured all the time and  it&apos;s tiresome and painful and not a thing one could do for a long time.  I tend to believe them, even if I was wearing a steel helmet, the  thought of being hit over the head full strength with a 1kg piece of  steel is not a pleasant one.</p><p>On the other hand, practicing combat stances or riding around on a  horse involve almost zero risk of injury, death, or damage to expensive  equipment.</p><p>The knight example might be a bit extreme, but even for something as  simple as baking bread, the cost of failure might be the difference  between being able to feed yourself or starving/begging for food for the  next few weeks.</p><p>The same idea applied and to some extent still applies to any trade.  When the stakes involve the physical world and your own body &quot;training  on real data&quot; is prohibitively expensive if you&apos;re not already 99% fit  for the task.</p><h2>5. Why the idea stuck</h2><p>We are very irrational and for good reason, most of the time we try to be rational we fail.</p><p>If for 10,000 years of written history &quot;learning&quot; something was 1%  doing and 99% learning contextual skills we might assume this is a good  pattern and stick to it without questioning it much.</p><p>Maybe we slowly observe that in e.g. CS people that code more and  learn theory less do better, so our CS courses go from 99% theory and 1%  coding to 25/75. Maybe we observe that frontend devs that learn their  craft in 10 weeks are just as good interns as people with a CS degree,  so we start replacing CS degrees for frontend developers with 6-month  &quot;boot camps&quot;.</p><p>But what we should instead be thinking is whether or not we should  throw away the explicit learning of contextual skills altogether in  these kinds of fields.</p><p>I will, however, go even further and say that we sometimes learn  contextual skills when we&apos;d be better of using technology to play with  fake but realistic &quot;training data&quot;.</p><p>Most kids learn science as if it&apos;s a collection of theories and thus  end up thinking of it as a sort of math-based religion, rather than as  an incomplete and always shifting body of knowledge that&apos;s made easier  to understand with layers of mathematical abstraction and gets  constantly changed and refactored.</p><p>This is <strong>really</strong> bad, since many people end up  rejection is the same way they&apos;d reject a religion, refusing to bow down  before the tenured priesthood. It&apos;s even worst because the people that  &quot;learn&quot; science usually learn it as if it were a religion or some kind  of logic-based exercise where all conclusions are absolute and all  theories perfectly correct.</p><p>But why do we teach kids about theory instead of letting them  experiment and analyze data, thus teach them the core idea of scientific  understanding? Because experiments are expensive and potentially  dangerous.</p><p>Sure, there&apos;s plenty of token chemistry, physics, and even biology  experiments that you can do in a lab. However, telling an 8th-grade  class:</p><blockquote>Alright kids, today we are going to take nicotine and try to design  an offshoot that it&apos;s particularly harmful to creatures with this  particular quick in their dopaminergic pathways.</blockquote><p>It sounds like a joke or something done by genius kids inside the  walls of an ivory tower. Not something that can be done in a random  school serving a pop-2,000 village in Bavaria.</p><p>But why?</p><p>After all, if you make enough tradeoffs, it doesn&apos;t seem that hard to  make a simulation for this experiment. Not one that can be used to  design industrial insecticides mind you. But you can take a 1,000  play-neurons model of an insect brain then create 500 different  populations, some of which have a wired quickly that causes arrhythmia  when certain dopamine pathways are overly stimulated.</p><p>You can equally well make a toy simulation for mimicking the  dopaminergic effects of nicotine derivative based on 100 simple to model  parameters (e.g. expression of certain enzymes that can destroy  nicotine, affinity to certain sites, ease of passing the blood-brain  barrier).</p><p>You&apos;re not going to come up with anything useful, but you might even  stumble close to an already known design for a neonicotinoid  insecticide.</p><p>The kids or teachers needn&apos;t understand the whole simulation, after  all that would defeat the point. They need only be allowed to look at  parts of it and use their existing chemistry and biology knowledge to  speculate on what change might work.</p><p>Maybe that&apos;s too high of a bar for a kid? Fine, then they need only  use their chemistry knowledge to figure out if a specific molecule could  even exist in theory, then fire away as many molecules as possible and  see how the simulation reacts. After all, that sounds like 99% of  applied biochemistry in the past and potentially even now.</p><p>This analogy breaks down at some point, but what we have currently is  so skewed towards the &quot;training on real data is a bad approach&quot; extreme  that I think any shift towards the &quot;training on real data is the  correct approach&quot; would be good.</p><p>The shift from &quot;training of real data&quot; being expensive and dangerous  is a very recent one, to be charitable it might have happened in the  last 30 years or so with the advent of reasonably priced computers.</p><p>Thus I think it&apos;s perfectly reasonable to assume most people haven&apos;t  seen this potential paradigm shift. However, it seems like the kind of  swim or sink distinction that will make or break many education systems  in the 21st century. In many ways, I think this process has already  started, but we are just not comprehending it fully as of yet.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Every Saturday morning, I take 3-4 hours to think about how my week went and how I’ll make the next one better.</p>\n<p>The format has changed over time, but for example, here’s some of what I reflected on last week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I noticed I’d fallen far short of my goal for written output. I decided to allocate more time to reading this week, hoping that it would generate more ideas. And I reorganized my morning routine to make it easier to start writing in the morning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I looked at some stats from <a href=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/rp/ben\" target=\"_blank\">RescueTime</a> and <a href=\"https://complice.co/?r=6ct6ukjyqf\" target=\"_blank\">Complice</a> about what I’d spent time on and accomplished. I noticed that my time spent on Slack was nearing dangerous levels, so I decided to make a couple experimental tweaks to get it down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I tried out <a href=\"https://contexts.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Contexts</a>, a replacement for the macOS window switcher, which I configured to only show windows from my current workspace—hoping that this would prevent me from cmd+tabbing over to Slack and getting distracted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I decided to run an experiment of not answering immediately when coworkers called me in the middle of a focused block of time, and keeping a paper “todo when done focusing” list to remind myself to call them back, check Slack, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I noticed that it felt hard for me to get useful info from the time-tracking data in RescueTime and Complice, so I revisited what questions I actually wanted to answer and how I could make them easy to answer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I realized that I should be using Google Calendar, not RescueTime or Complice, to track my time spent in meetings, so I added that to my time-tracking data sources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I also made several tweaks to the way I used Complice to make it easier to see various stats I was interested in.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so on. By the end of the review I had surfaced lots of other improvements for the coming week.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While each individual tweak is small, over the weeks and years they’ve compounded to make me a lot more effective. Because of that, this weekly review is the most useful habit (or habit-generating meta-habit) I’ve built. Here are some of the improvements I’ve made that have come out of weekly reviews:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I decided to experiment with time tracking, realized that it needed to be <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/zero/\">zero-effort</a> to succeed, and identified RescueTime as the best option, giving me much better data on how I was <em>actually</em> spending my time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once I started using RescueTime, I eliminated a bunch of distractions that it flagged. As a result I <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/50pct/\">improved my focused time by 50%</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Later on, reviewing RescueTime stats also helped me realized I was spending much more time distracted by the Internet than I’d realized. I tried various things to break my Internet news habit and eventually found <a href=\"https://a.paddle.com/v2/click/447/116794?link=46\" target=\"_blank\">Focus</a>, a zero-effort website blocker which has probably saved me hundreds of hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I identified “feeling low-energy on winter evenings” as a blocker and tried several experiments to improve my evening energy levels. One of them was <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/lux/\">an ultra-bright lightbulb</a> which worked amazingly well, giving me back about an hour a day.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By thinking about how to help my partner with her PhD, I came up with the idea of doing <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/11/\">one-on-ones</a>, which she thinks helped her finish her dissertation a year faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By thinking about ways to improve our relationship and points of friction we’ve had over the last week, we’ve both started lots of useful discussions in those one-on-ones that have helped us understand each other and communicate better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I’ve made hundreds of tweaks to my daily routine and habits to make sure I reliably exercise, sleep enough, and maintain high energy levels.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, you don’t <em>need</em> to have a weekly review habit to come up with this type of improvement. But by systematically thinking it through, you’ll generate more of them. And by doing it consistently, you’ll be able to build these small improvements on top of each other.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I’ve had to iterate a lot on the format and timing of the weekly review to get to one where I can consistently maintain the habit and output useful weekly reviews. The format I currently have is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Review happens first thing every Saturday morning. This time is sacred and (largely) immovable. Morning is really important for having the right energy and mindset; weekend is important so I’m not distracted by work; consistency is important so that I don’t lose the habit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I start the review by re-reading some parts of my favorite essays of life advice. (Different parts/essays every week. This also sometimes gets me to notice new parts of the essays that resonate or spark interesting thoughts.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Next, I load the week back into working memory by reviewing what happened during the week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Based on the above I’ll write down a list of topics to think about, taking written notes on each topic as I think about them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I also have a set of recurring prompts that I think about every week. I tweak them over time as they get stale, but some examples would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Was I consistent at my core habits this week (exercise, morning routine, todo system, etc.)? How can I tweak them to be more consistent or more useful?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What did I do this week that was a mistake and how can I avoid repeating it?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How much of this week did I spend on stuff that was truly my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage\" target=\"_blank\">comparative advantage</a>? For everything else, how can I get out of the loop?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>As an appendix, some random tactical tips for weekly reviews:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Changing my physical environment helps me context-switch into a less focused, more reflective mindset. Back when cafes were open I’d often go to the cafe near my house. At home, I’ll work from a different room, play different background music, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I still find it’s easy to get distracted during weekly reviews, so I make sure to close everything else on my computer when I start.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When I have granular, objective data on “what happened this week” (e.g. RescueTime, calendar, todo lists) I’ve found it helpful to review that because it occasionally surprises me. (See the points about RescueTime above.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I find that taking notes while I think about things is really important—otherwise I lose track of what I’m thinking about or get distracted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For note-taking, I’d recommend using hierarchical bulleted lists, not free-written paragraphs. Lists are more efficient because you can write in incomplete sentences and leave out transitions (relying on the bullet hierarchy to make the structure clear).</p>\n<p>Bulleted lists are also easier to reorder (especially if you use an app that gives you keyboard shortcuts for it), so if you’re like me, they’ll let you more efficiently exercise your nervous tic of stack-ranking all lists.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>General Juan Velasco Alvarado was the military dictator of Peru from 1968 to 1975. In 1964-5 he put down revolutionary peasant guerilla movements, defending an unequal and brutally exploitative pattern of land ownership. Afterward he became frustrated with the bickering and gridlock of Peru&#x2019;s parliament. With a small cadre of military coconspirators, he planned a coup d&#x2019;&#xE9;tat. Forestalling an uprising by pro-peasant parties, he sent tanks to kidnap the democratically elected president. The parliament was closed indefinitely. On the one year anniversary of his coup, Velasco stated &#x201C;Some people expected very different things and were confident, as had been the custom, that we came to power for the sole purpose of calling elections and returning to them all their privileges. The people who thought that way were and are mistaken&#x201D;.[1]</p><p>What would you expect Velasco&#x2019;s policy toward land ownership and peasants to be? You would probably expect him to continue their exploitation by the oligarchy land-owning families. But you would be mistaken. Velasco and his successor redistributed 45% of all arable land in Peru to peasant lead communes, which were later broken up. Land redistribution is a rare spot of consensus in development economics, improving both the lives of the poor and increasing growth. [2]</p><p>I told you this story to highlight how your attitudes toward the actor affect your predictions. It is justifiable to dislike Velasco for his violence, for ending Peruvian democracy, for his state-controlled economy. But our brains predict off of those value judgements. <a href=\"https://d.docs.live.net/79586996f97a2bc8/Documents/Flo.docx\">The affect heuristic</a> (aka the halo/horn effect) is when one positive/negative attribute of an actor causes people to assume positive/negative attributes in another area. The affect heuristic causes attractive candidates to be hired more often, or honest people to be rated as more intelligent. Subjects told about the benefit of nuclear power are likely to rate it as having fewer risks, et cetera. Our moral attitudes toward the coup are not evidence for Velasco&#x2019;s policy preference, but our brains treat them as evidence.[3] <em>That is bad if you think predicting what policies autocrats will adopt is important. Which I do.</em></p><p>The same problem applies to agents you <em>like</em>. One of my research projects involved interviewing Jordanian policymakers. I studied policies for rural-urban water reallocation, which I broadly endorse. Because I agreed with some interviewees about this issue, over-trusted them when selecting evidence. During fieldwork, I heard rumors about high radon activity in the water for the Disi-Amman conveyance. I even found a power-point made by MWI staff advocating that Jordan&#x2019;s drinking water standards be revised to protect the project. But I never looked deeply into the issue. I could have, I have a physics degree, I have operated spectroscopes, I understand radiation physics and can parse radiology articles at a high level. But I never did, because I assumed that this evidence would support my positive attitude toward my interviewees.  I never noticed the bias because evidence selection is mostly subconscious. There is no time for probability-theory calculations when you have an hour to speak with a bureaucrat.</p><p>Eventually, I looked into the issue at the request of peer reviewers (when I had to). Even then, I looked for evidence only until it supported my conclusions. Radon evaporates out of water, so maybe it evaporates in the mixing reservoirs. I checked <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257610780_Determination_of_radon_partitioning_between_groundwater_and_atmosphere_by_liquid_scintillation_counter\">the long-time-horizon equilibrium</a>, then assumed the evaporation was fast enough. Once the analysis agreed with my assumptions I stopped looking for more information. I would have submitted this falsehood but by chance found <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/10.2166/wh.2016.265\">a ministry paper</a> revealing that transport reduces activity by just one eighth. At last, I had to reinvestigate and conclude that the radon activity is a public health hazard worth considering. The effect of low-doses of radiation are hotly debated, but the linear no threshold model predicts excess mortality risk from a lifetime of consumption <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es501140b\">greater than 10^-4</a>. Because I had a positive attitude toward the policy-makers, I subconsciously avoided evidence that cast them in a negative light. </p><p>What to do about the affect heuristic in comparative politics research? At first, I wrote an elegant ending paragraph suggesting not caring or assigning moral value to people or institutions. But that answer relies on rejecting your own feelings, which is morally dubious and impossible anyway. If the goal of modern comparative politics to connect political institutions to outcomes, we still have normative judgments attached to those outcomes. <a href=\"http://93.174.95.29/main/44D5EA8403F2CAC31EBFC1FA2F73EB89\">Brian Min</a> wants poor people to have access to electricity. <a href=\"https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=CAB2B21CF1448094D7C6839BE010DE0E\">Michael Albertus</a> wants poor people to own the land they work. Removing those concerns would not improve their work. Assigning all agency to institutions would attach the halo and horns to the institutions. In any case waking up every day saying &#x201C;I have no moral attachments&#x201D; and talking like spock does not &#x201C;cure&#x201D; you of preference.</p><p>I am unsure what researchers should do. My first two guesses are</p><p>1.       Using prediction exercise <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/13/21055740/trump-reelection-biden-nomination-brexit-2020-predictions\">to calibrate yourself</a>. I was overconfident in my assumptions, so prediction exercises should reduce my overconfidence. </p><p>2.       Only write up the obvious conclusions from your case-studies. I had plenty of subtle theories to explain Jordan&#x2019;s policies, but just a few which strong evidence. I asked myself &#x201C;if a young man from Mafraq reproduced my methodology, would he arrive at the same conclusions&#x201D;, and left out ideas which failed the test. </p><p>Bib</p><p>[1] Albertus, M.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Once someone has made several insightful self-help observations, I think it's often tempting to then go and find some sort of cohering framework which can explain all of those observations. In this essay, I'll argue for why I think it can be better to skip the post-hoc theorizing altogether and just present the insights in a modular way.</p>\n<p>First, let me be clear about definitions for the terms I'm using.</p>\n<p>By \"insight\", I mean some sort of observation about how the world works. For example, someone trying to figure out how to do better in social situations might realize that finishing their thoughts before speaking aloud helps them be more eloquent. Of course this doesn't mean that insights are free from an underlying framework, but no attempt is made to bring the assumptions and models into the foreground. The focus is on some small mechanism or model.</p>\n<p>By \"framework\", I mean some sort of set of beliefs that form an overarching model about how the world works. For example, some people have tried to model all of social interactions as an <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/AqbWna2S85pFTsHH4/the-intelligent-social-web\">intelligent social web</a>. Insights about social interactions are then contextualized under this framework. Perhaps, under this framework, finishing your thoughts help with eloquence because they give off the impression that you are thoughtful, which coheres with the framework's claims about interactions being similar to a theatrical performance. The focus is on the framework, and the insights are corollaries.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I think people like coming up with frameworks. I think people like having neat explanations that can explain all of the neat things they've been observing. I am also guilty of this. There is something satisfying about finding some crystallization of all your past thoughts, like putting them through a strainer.</p>\n<p>However, recently, I've bowed to pragmatism, and I think that frameworks are not as useful as I'd previously thought.</p>\n<p>Firstly, there are too many frameworks. Most pieces of self-help content do not just promise a few (potentially) helpful observations, but rather an entire system. Sure, the system might have some good parts, but it's difficult to evaluate an entire framework without putting in the mental effort to really inhabit it for a while. And this is costly; you can't expect to do this each time a new self-help guru comes out with another new analogy or metaphor for the world.</p>\n<p>Secondly, frameworks are often post-hoc. In self-help, the explanations basically have to come after the observations. This isn't necessarily bad. After all, if your goal is to maximize personal effectiveness (or effectiveness for a group of people similar to you), it seems probably better to just go out and try a bunch of things instead of armchair theorizing about what would or wouldn't work. <em>You</em> are the source of empirical data, which can be cheap to collect.</p>\n<p>What this means is that the framework itself is likely the least interesting part of what you have to say! If I'm reading your self-help guide, I really just want to know about the places where it can excel for me locally, or what sorts of effects you saw in yourself. All of that information is in the insights, not in the framework itself, which could be nonsense for all I know.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, I think it's important to respect your audience. By that, I mean that they likely already have their own self-help systems and frameworks coming into your content; most people are not impressionable blank slates. And, as the saying goes, the best self-help is the one that works for you. If your audience already has some system that's 70% optimal, it's possibly not worth their effort to try and relearn your system to get to 75% optimality. (Assuming for the moment that percentages like these even make sense.)</p>\n<p>Insights, however, can be much more easily incorporated into any existing worldview. Furthermore, if the audience finds many of your insights compelling, they may come up with some sort of coherent framework themselves (as our brains are wont to do), which could end up looking similar to the framework you wanted to give them. Except in this case they'll likely appreciate it much more, as they've done the messy work of theorizing themselves.</p>\n<p>Thus, instead of giving your audience some sort of grand theory, I think it can be better to just give the disparate list of insights. This allows your audience to pick and choose which observations they think can be useful for them, and it puts the focus back where I think it should be. There's also something to be said for gradually changing your worldview to subsume many insights, rather than always doing a hard switch.</p>\n<p>As a parting note of caution, this approach also runs into its own type of perverse selection pressure. While a focus on large frameworks can lead to sprawling essays requiring major intellectual buy-in, modular insights can go the way of Buzzfeed listicles, often too trite and regularly doled out in small dopamine hits that can lead to a false sense of illumination.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>[Speculative philosophy. Originally on <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2019/04/28/wrong-clicking-on-cows/\">Grand, Unified, Crazy</a>.]</em></p><h3>Three Stories</h3><p>Imagine, for a moment, three young adults recently embarked on the same promising career path. The first comes home from work each day, and spends their evenings practising and playing a musical instrument. The second comes home from work each day, and spends their evenings practising and playing a video game. The third comes home from work each day, and spends their evenings hooked up to a machine which directly stimulates the pleasure and reward centres of their brain.</p><p>How do these people make you feel?</p><p>For some people with more libertarian, utilitarian, or hedonistic perspectives, all three people are equally positive. They harm no-one, and are spending their time on activities they enjoy and freely chose. We can ask nothing more of them.</p><p>And yet this perspective does not line up with my intuitions. For me, and I suspect for many people, the musician&#x2019;s choice of hobby is laudable, the gamer&#x2019;s is relatively neutral, and the &#x201C;stimmer&#x201D;&#x2018;s (the person with the brain-stimulating machine) is distinctly repugnant in a way that feels vaguely ethics-related. It may be difficult to actually draw that repugnance out in clear moral language &#x2013; after all, no-one is being harmed &#x2013; but still&#x2026; they&#x2019;re not the kind of person you&#x2019;d want your children to marry.</p><h3>The Good and The Bad</h3><p>Untangling the &#x201C;why&#x201D; of these intuitions is quite an interesting problem. Technically all three hobbies rely on hijacking the reward centres of the brain, whose original evolutionary advantages were more to do with food, sex, and other survival-related tasks. There&#x2019;s a fairly short path from arguing that the stimmer&#x2019;s behaviour is repugnant to arguing that all three cases are repugnant; after all none of them result in food or anything truly &#x201C;productive&#x201D;. But this tack also seems to go a bit against our intuitions.</p><p>Fortunately, the world has a <em>lot</em> of different video games, and we can use that range to draw out some more concrete differences. At the low-end are games like <a href=\"http://www.cowclicker.com/\">Cow Clicker</a> and <a href=\"http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/\">Cookie Clicker</a>, which are so basic as to be little more than indirect versions of the reward-centre-stimulating machine. More complex games seem to intuitively fare a little better, as do games with a non-trivial social element. Games that directly attempt to train us in some way also seem to do a little better, <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322648.php\">whether they actually work or not</a>.</p><p>Generalizing slightly, it seems like the things we care about to make video games more &#x201C;positive&#x201D; are roughly: transferable skills, personal growth, and social contact. But this model doesn&#x2019;t seem to fit so well when applied to learning an instrument. You could argue that it includes transferable skills, but the obvious candidates only transfer to other instruments and forms of musicianship, not to anything strictly &#x201C;practical&#x201D;. Similarly, social contact is a positive, but it&#x2019;s not a required component of learning an instrument. Playing in a group seems distinctly better than learning it by yourself, but learning it on your own still seems like a net positive. Our final option of &#x201C;personal growth&#x201D; now seems very wishy-washy. Yes, learning an instrument seems to be a clear case of personal growth, but&#x2026; what does that mean exactly? How is it useful, if it doesn&#x2019;t include transferable skills or social contact?</p><p>There are a few possible explanations that I&#x2019;m not going to explore fully in this post, since it would take us a bit far afield from the point I originally wanted to address. For one, perhaps music is seen as more of a shared or public good, one that naturally increases social cohesion. It seems plausible that maybe our intuitions just can&#x2019;t account for somebody learning music entirely in private, with no social benefits.</p><p>Another approach would be to lean on Jonathan Haidt&#x2019;s <em>A Righteous Mind</em> and its Moral Foundations Theory. Certainly none of the three people are causing harm with their actions, but perhaps they are triggering one of our weirder loyalty or sanctity intuitions?</p><p>Thirdly, perhaps the issue with the third hobby is less &#x201C;it&#x2019;s not useful&#x201D; and more of a concern than it&#x2019;s actively dangerous. We know from <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/compass-pleasure_n_890342\">experiments on rats</a> (and a few unethical ones on humans) that such machines can lead to addictive behaviour and very dangerous disregard for food and other critical needs. Perhaps as video games become more indirect, they become less addictive and simply less dangerous.</p><h3>Moral Obligations</h3><p>Really though, these questions are being unpacked in order to answer the more interesting one in this essay&#x2019;s title: when is it wrong to click on a cow? Or slightly less metaphorically: what moral obligations do we have around how we spend our leisure time? Should I feel bad about reading a book if it doesn&#x2019;t teach me anything? Should I feel bad about going out to see a show if it&#x2019;s not some deep philosophical exploration of the human spirit? What about the widely-shat-upon genre of reality television?</p><p>Even more disturbingly, what are the implications for just hanging out with your friends? Surely that&#x2019;s still a good thing?</p><p>If I generalize my intuitions well past my ability to back them up with reason, we have some weak moral obligation to spend our time in a way that benefits our group, either through direct development of publicly beneficial skills like music, or through more general self-improvement in one form or another, or through socializing and social play and the resulting group bonding. Anything that we do entirely without benefit to others is onanistic and probably wrong.</p><p>The final question is then: what if that isn&#x2019;t what I find enjoyable? How much room is there in life for reading trashy novels and watching the Kardashians? The moral absolutist in me suggests that there is none; that we must do our best to optimize what little time we have as effectively as possible. But that&#x2019;s a topic for another post.</p>",

There are many like it, but this one is mine.</span></p>\n<p><span>First, there is knowledge you could regurgitate on a test.

Examples:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Reciting the symptoms of childbed fever on command </span></li>\n<li><span>Reciting Newton’s first law of motion</span></li>\n<li><span>Reciting a list of medications’ scientific and brand names</span></li>\n<li><span>Reciting historical growth rate of the stock market</span></li>\n<li><span>Reciting that acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.807 m/s²</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span>Second, there is engineering knowledge- something you can repeat and get reasonably consistent results. It also lets you hill climb to local improvements. Examples:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Knowing how to wash your hands to prevent childbed fever </span><i><span>and doing so</span></i></li>\n<li><span>Driving without crashing</span></li>\n<li><span>Making bread from a memorized recipe.</span></li>\n<li><span>What are the average benefits and side effects from this antidepressant?</span></li>\n<li><span>Knowing how much a mask will limit covid’s spread</span></li>\n<li><span>Investing in index funds</span></li>\n<li><span>Knowing that if you shoot a cannon ball of a certain weight at a certain speed, it will go X far.</span></li>\n<li><span>Knowing people are nicer to me when I say “please” and “thank you”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span>Third, there is scientific knowledge.

    "htmlBody": "<p><span>\n\nWith everyone staying home, cities make a lot less sense. Many people\nwho previously wanted to minimize their commutes are working from\nhome, and could live anywhere.  People who wanted to live close to\nfriends and family aren't seeing them. People who like to go to\nrestaurants, bars, clubs, or dances aren't doing that either.  On the\nother hand, the benefits of living farther out, such as space,\nproximity to nature, and cost, are if anything even more important.\nSo I've seen a stream of friends posting about how they're leaving\nBoston, NYC, SF, and other cities, at least for now.\n\n</span>\n\n</p><p>\n\nI track Boston rental listings for my <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/apartment_prices\">rent\nmap</a>, and you can see this reflected in the data.  Here are new\ntwo-bedroom listings for the last three months, compared to the same\nthree months last year:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-april-2020-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-april-2020.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-april-2020.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-april-2020-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-may-2020-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-may-2020.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-may-2020.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-may-2020-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-june-2020-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-june-2020.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-june-2020.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/boston-apartment-prices-june-2020-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\n\nEach chart shows all two-bedroom listings in the data, sorted from\ncheapest to most expensive (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/125gEBgmnQPDeHReGa9KuAuClggHA_YYBCCsgej5OupI/edit?usp=sharing\">sheet</a>).\nIn April prices were about the same as last year, but they dropped in\nMay, and even further in June.  Most of the change is in fancy units:\nthe median 2BR (~$2800) was $50 cheaper (2%) in May year-over-year\nand $75 (3%) cheaper in June y/y, while the 90th percentile 2BR\n(~$4250) fell $440 (10%) for May and $700 (16%) for June.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis makes sense: the people renting expensive units are probably\ndisproportionately people who can work from anywhere remotely, and\npeople who in normal times are highly reliant on the city for\nentertainment.  I expect it's even more dramatic in SF, where so much\nof the housing boom has been driven by tech employment.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI think we're probably not done, though. Many landlords are small, and\nslow to react to changing market conditions. We're playing reverse\nmusical chairs, where many landlords are going to be stuck without a\ntenant come September first. The ones who have realized this are\noffering lower rents, trying to keep their tenants, and as we get\ncloser to September I expect more will catch on.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf you're a tenant you can probably negotiate lower rent.  Or,\nhigher risk, higher expected value, wait longer and hope for prices to\nfall further.  We may see some pretty desperate landlords.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhere does this leave me?  While I'm a landlord, I'm on the side of\ntenants here.  I care much more that friends and neighbors aren't\npriced out than that we make the highest possible rent from our\nrooms. I'm happy to see rents falling, though I wish it were \"we built\nan enormous amount of new housing\" and not \"there's a pandemic\".  The\narrangement we have with our tenants is that in mid-August we look at\nwhat comparable units are going for, and use that as our rent for the\nnext year.  I'm expecting that will be down, and I'm OK with that.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nLonger-term, I'm very curious whether will see a reversal of the past\ndecade where cities had been growing more and more desirable relative\nto the rest of the country.  I can see a world where post-covid\nthere's a lot of remote work, people are nervous about density, people\nhave become more attached to having a lot of space, and people have\nformed new communities farther out.  On the other hand, I can also see\na world where when this is over people are eager to get back to where\nthey were, and I've had enough isolation for a lifetime.  Luckily I\ndon't need to decide whether to buy a house right now!\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100169864037942\">facebook</a></i></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p> <em>Epistemic status: I started this as an AI Impacts research project, but given that it&#x2019;s fundamentally a fun speculative brainstorm, it worked better as a blog post.</em></p><p>The default, when reasoning about advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI), is to imagine it appearing in a world that is basically like the present. Yet almost everyone agrees the world will likely be importantly different by the time advanced AGI arrives.</p><p>One way to address this problem is to reason in abstract, general ways that are hopefully robust to whatever unforeseen developments lie ahead. Another is to brainstorm particular changes that might happen, and check our reasoning against the resulting list.</p><p>This is an attempt to begin the second approach.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-2336\">2</a> I sought things that might happen that seemed both (a) within the realm of plausibility, and (b) probably strategically relevant to AI safety or AI policy.</p><p>I collected potential list entries via brainstorming, asking others for ideas, googling, and reading lists that seemed relevant (e.g. Wikipedia&#x2019;s list of emerging technologies,<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-2336\">3</a> a list of Ray Kurzweil&#x2019;s predictions<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-2336\">4</a>, and DARPA&#x2019;s list of projects.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-2336\">5</a>)</p><p>I then shortened the list based on my guesses about the plausibility and relevance of these possibilities. I did not put much time into evaluating any particular possibility, so my guesses should not be treated as anything more. I erred on the side of inclusion, so the entries in this list vary greatly in plausibility and relevance. I made some attempt to categorize these entries and merge similar ones, but this document is fundamentally a brainstorm, not a taxonomy, so keep your expectations low.</p><p>I hope to update this post as new ideas find me and old ideas are refined or refuted. I welcome suggestions and criticisms; email me (gmail kokotajlod) or leave a comment.</p><h3><strong>Interactive &#x201C;Generate Future&#x201D; button</strong></h3><p>Asya Bergal and I made an interactive button to go with the list. The button randomly generates a possible future according to probabilities that you choose. It is very crude, but it has been fun to play with, and perhaps even slightly useful. For example, once I decided that my credences were probably systematically too high because the futures generated with them were too crazy. Another time I used the alternate method (described below) to recursively generate a detailed future trajectory, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd6qQx-SP6rfAVQE5rzfPH0zXYOOHXBa13JSUd2zROQ/edit?usp=sharing\">written up here</a>. I hope to make more trajectories like this in the future, since I think this method is less biased than the usual method for imagining detailed futures.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-2336\">6</a></p><p>To choose probabilities, scroll down to the list below and fill each box with a number representing how likely you think the entry is to occur in a strategically relevant way prior to the advent of advanced AI. (1 means certainly, 0 means certainly not. <strong>The boxes are all 0 by default.</strong>) Once you are done, scroll back up and click the button.</p><p>A major limitation is that the button doesn&#x2019;t take correlations between possibilities into account. The user needs to do this themselves, e.g. by redoing any generated future that seems silly, or by flipping a coin to choose between two generated possibilities that seem contradictory, or by choosing between them based on what else was generated.</p><p>Here is an alternate way to use this button that mostly avoids this limitation:</p><ol><li>Fill all the boxes with probability-of-happening-in-the-next-5-years (instead of happening before advanced AGI, as in the default method)</li><li>Click the &#x201C;Generate Future&#x201D; button and record the results, interpreted as what happens in the next 5 years.</li><li>Update the probabilities accordingly to represent the upcoming 5-year period, in light of what has happened so far.</li><li>Repeat steps 2 &#x2013; 4 until satisfied. I used <a href=\"https://www.random.org/\">a random number generator</a> to determine whether AGI arrived each year.</li></ol><p>If you don&#x2019;t want to choose probabilities yourself, click &#x201C;fill with pre-set values&#x201D; to populate the fields with my non-expert, hasty guesses.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-2336\">7</a></p><p>GENERATE FUTURE<br>Fill with pre-set values (default method)<br>Fill with pre-set values (alternate method)</p><h3>Key</h3><p>Letters after list titles indicate that I think the change might be relevant to:</p><ul><li>TML: Timelines&#x2014;how long it takes for advanced AI to be developed</li><li>TAS: Technical AI safety&#x2014;how easy it is (on a technical level) to make advanced AI safe, or what sort of technical research needs to be done</li><li>POL: Policy&#x2014;how easy it is to coordinate relevant actors to mitigate risks from AI, and what policies are relevant to this.&#xA0;</li><li>CHA: Chaos&#x2014;how chaotic the world is.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-2336\">8</a></li><li>MIS: Miscellaneous</li></ul><p>Each possibility is followed by some explanation or justification where necessary, and a non-exhaustive list of ways the possibility may be relevant to AI outcomes in particular (which is not guaranteed to cover the most important ones).

Advanced science automation and research tools (TML, TAS, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Narrow research and development tools might speed up technological progress in general or in specific domains. For example, several of the other technologies on this list might be achieved with the help of narrow research and development tools.</p><p><strong>2. Dramatically improved computing hardware (TML, TAS, POL, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>By this I mean computing hardware improves at least as fast as Moore&#x2019;s Law. Computing hardware has <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/trends-in-the-cost-of-computing/\">historically</a> become steadily cheaper, though it is unclear <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/2019-recent-trends-in-gpu-price-per-flops/\">whether this trend will continue</a>. Some example pathways by which hardware might improve at least moderately include:</p><ul><li>Ordinary scale economies<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-2336\">9</a></li><li>Improved data locality<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-2336\">10</a></li><li>Increased specialization for specific AI applications<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-2336\">11</a></li><li>Optical computing<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-2336\">12</a></li><li>Neuromorphic chips<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-2336\">13</a></li><li>3D integrated circuits<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-2336\">14</a></li><li>Wafer-scale chips<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-2336\">15</a></li><li>Quantum computing<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-16-2336\">16</a></li><li>Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-17-2336\">17</a></li></ul><p>Dramatically improved computing hardware may:&#xA0;</p><ul><li>Cause any given AI capability to arrive earlier</li><li>Increase the probability of <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/hardware-overhang/\">hardware overhang</a>.&#xA0;</li><li>Affect which kinds of AI are developed first (e.g. those which are more compute-intensive.)&#xA0;</li><li>Affect AI policy, e.g. by changing the relative importance of hardware vs. research talent</li></ul><p><strong>3. Stagnation in computing hardware progress (TML, TAS, POL, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Many forecasters think Moore&#x2019;s Law will be ending soon (as of 2020).<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-18-2336\">18</a> In the absence of successful new technologies, computing hardware could progress substantially more slowly than Moore&#x2019;s Law would predict.</p><p>Stagnation in computing hardware progress may:&#xA0;</p><ul><li>Cause any given AI capability to arrive later</li><li>Decrease the probability of <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/hardware-overhang/\">hardware overhang</a>.&#xA0;</li><li>Affect which kinds of AI are developed first (e.g. those which are less compute-intensive.)&#xA0;</li><li>Influence the relative strategic importance of hardware compared to researchers</li><li>Make energy and raw materials a greater part of the cost of computing</li></ul><p><strong>4. Manufacturing consolidation (POL)</strong><br></p><p>Chip fabrication has become more specialized and consolidated over time, to the point where all of the hardware relevant to AI research depends on production from a handful of locations.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-19-2336\">19</a> Perhaps this trend will continue.</p><p>One country (or a small number working together) could control or restrict AI research by controlling the production and distribution of necessary hardware.</p><p><strong>5. Advanced additive manufacturing (e.g. 3D printing or nanotechnology) (TML, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>Advanced additive manufacturing could lead to various materials, products and forms of capital being cheaper and more broadly accessible, as well as to new varieties of them becoming feasible and quicker to develop. For example, sufficiently advanced 3D printing could destabilize the world by allowing almost anyone to secretly produce terror weapons. If nanotechnology advances rapidly, so that nanofactories can be created, the consequences could be dramatic:<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-20-2336\">20</a> </p><ul><li>Greatly reduced cost of most manufactured products</li><li>Greatly faster growth of capital formation</li><li>Lower energy costs</li><li>New kinds of materials, such as stronger, lighter spaceship hulls</li><li>Medical nanorobots</li><li>New kinds of weaponry and other disruptive technologies</li></ul><p><strong>6. Massive resource glut (TML, TAS, POL, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>By &#x201C;glut&#x201D; I don&#x2019;t necessarily mean that there is too much of a resource. Rather, I mean that the real price falls dramatically. Rapid decreases in the price of important resources have happened before.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-21-2336\">21</a> It could happen again via:</p><ul><li>Cheap energy (e.g. fusion power, He-3 extracted from lunar regolith,<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-22-2336\">22</a> methane hydrate extracted from the seafloor,<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-23-2336\">23</a> cheap solar energy<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-24-2336\">24</a>)</li><li>A source of abundant cheap raw materials (e.g. asteroid mining,<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-25-2336\">25</a> undersea mining<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-26-2336\">26</a>)</li><li>Automation of relevant human labor. Where human labor is an important part of the cost of manufacturing, resource extraction, or energy production, automating labor might substantially increase economic growth, which might result in a greater amount of resources devoted to strategically relevant things (such as AI research) which is relevantly similar to a price drop even if technically the price doesn&#x2019;t drop.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-27-2336\">27</a> and therefore investment in AI.</li></ul><p>My impression is that energy, raw materials, and unskilled labor combined are less than half the cost of computing, so a decrease in the price of one of these (and possibly even all three) would probably not have large direct consequences on the price of computing.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-28-2336\">28</a> But a resource glut might lead to general economic prosperity, with many subsequent effects on society, and moreover the cost structure of computing may change in the future, creating a situation where a resource glut could dramatically lower the cost of computing.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-29-2336\">29</a></p><p><strong>7. Hardware overhang (TML, TAS, POL)</strong><br></p><p><a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/hardware-overhang/\">Hardware overhang</a> refers to a situation where large quantities of computing hardware can be diverted to running powerful AI systems as soon as the AI software is developed.</p><p>If advanced AGI (or some other powerful software) appears during a period of hardware overhang, its capabilities and prominence in the world could grow very quickly.</p><p><strong>8. Hardware underhang (TML, TAS, POL)</strong><br></p><p>The opposite of hardware overhang might happen. Researchers may understand how to build advanced AGI at a time when the requisite hardware is not yet available.&#xA0; For example, perhaps the relevant AI research will involve expensive chips custom-built for the particular AI architecture being trained.</p><p>A successful AI project during a period of hardware underhang would not be able to instantly copy the AI to many other devices, nor would they be able to iterate quickly and make an architecturally improved version.</p><h4><strong>Technical tools</strong></h4><p><strong>9. Prediction tools (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Tools may be developed that are dramatically better at predicting some important aspect of the world; for example, technological progress, cultural shifts, or the outcomes of elections, military clashes, or research projects. Such tools could for instance be based on advances in AI or other algorithms, prediction markets, or improved scientific understanding of forecasting (e.g. <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/evidence-on-good-forecasting-practices-from-the-good-judgment-project/\">lessons from the Good Judgment Project</a>).</p><p>Such tools might conceivably increase stability via promoting accurate beliefs, reducing surprises, errors or unnecessary conflicts. However they could also conceivably promote instability via conflict encouraged by a powerful new tool being available to a subset of actors. Such tools might also help with forecasting the arrival and effects of advanced AGI, thereby helping guide policy and AI safety work. They might also accelerate timelines, for instance by assisting project management in general and notifying potential investors when advanced AGI is within reach.</p><p><strong>10. Persuasion tools (POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Present technology for influencing a person&#x2019;s beliefs and behavior is crude and weak, relative to what one can imagine. Tools may be developed that more reliably steer a person&#x2019;s opinion and are not so vulnerable to the victim&#x2019;s reasoning and possession of evidence. These could involve:</p><ul><li>Advanced understanding of how humans respond to stimuli depending on context, based on massive amounts of data</li><li>Coaching for the user on how to convince the target of something</li><li>Software that interacts directly with other people, e.g. via text or email&#xA0;</li></ul><p>Strong persuasion tools could:</p><ul><li>Allow a group in conflict who has them to quickly attract spies and then infiltrate an enemy group</li><li>Allow governments to control their populations</li><li>Allow corporations to control their employees</li><li>Lead to a breakdown of collective epistemology<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-30-2336\">30</a></li></ul><p><strong>11. Theorem provers (TAS)</strong><br></p><p>Powerful theorem provers might help with the kinds of AI alignment research that involve proofs or help solve computational choice problems.</p><p><strong>12. Narrow AI for natural language processing (TML, TAS, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>Researchers may develop narrow AI that understands human language well, including concepts such as &#x201C;moral&#x201D; and &#x201C;honest.&#x201D;</p><p>Natural language processing tools could help with many kinds of technology, including AI and various&#xA0; AI safety projects. They could also help enable AI arbitration systems. If researchers develop software that can autocomplete code&#x2014;much as it currently autocompletes text messages&#x2014;it could multiply software engineering productivity.</p><p><strong>13. AI interpretability tools (TML, TAS, POL)</strong><br></p><p>Tools for understanding what a given AI system is thinking, what it wants, and what it is planning would be useful for AI safety.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-31-2336\">31</a></p><p><strong>14. Credible commitment mechanisms (POL, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>There are significant restrictions on which contracts governments are willing and able to enforce&#x2013;for example, they can&#x2019;t enforce a contract to try hard to achieve a goal, and won&#x2019;t enforce a contract to commit a crime. Perhaps some technology (e.g. lie detectors, narrow AI, or blockchain) could significantly expand the space of possible credible commitments for some relevant actors: corporations, decentralized autonomous organizations, crowds of ordinary people using assurance contracts, terrorist cells, rogue AGIs, or even individuals.</p><p>This might destabilize the world by making threats of various kinds more credible, for various actors. It might stabilize the world in other ways, e.g. by making it easier for some parties to enforce agreements.</p><p><strong>15. Better coordination tools (POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Technology for allowing groups of people to coordinate effectively could improve, potentially avoiding losses from collective choice problems, helping existing large groups (e.g. nations and companies) to make choices in their own interests, and producing new forms of coordinated social behavior (e.g. the 2010&#x2019;s saw the rise of the Facebook group)).&#xA0; Dominant assurance contracts,<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-32-2336\">32</a> improved voting systems,<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-33-2336\">33</a> AI arbitration systems, lie detectors, and similar things not yet imagined might significantly improve the effectiveness of some groups of people.</p><p>If only a few groups use this technology, they might have outsized influence. If most groups do, there could be a general reduction in conflict and increase in good judgment.</p><h4><strong>Human effectiveness</strong></h4><p><strong>16. Deterioration of collective epistemology (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Society has mechanisms and processes that allow it to identify new problems, discuss them, and arrive at the truth and/or coordinate a solution. These processes might deteriorate. Some examples of things which might contribute to this:</p><ul><li>Increased investment in online propaganda by more powerful actors, perhaps assisted by chatbots, deepfakes and persuasion tools</li><li>Echo chambers, filter bubbles, and online polarization, perhaps driven in part by recommendation algorithms</li><li>Memetic evolution in general might intensify, increasing the spreadability of ideas/topics at the expense of their truth/importance<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-34-2336\">34</a></li><li>Trends towards political polarization and radicalization might exist and continue</li><li>Trends towards general institutional dysfunction might exist and continue</li></ul><p>This could cause chaos in the world in general, and lead to many hard-to-predict effects. It would likely make the market for influencing the course of AI development less efficient (see section on &#x201C;Landscape of&#x2026;&#x201D; below) and present epistemic hazards for anyone trying to participate effectively.</p><p><strong>17. New and powerful forms of addiction (TML, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Technology that wastes time and ruins lives could become more effective. The average person spends 144 minutes per day on social media, and there is a clear upward trend in this metric.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-35-2336\">35</a> The average time spent watching TV is even greater.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-36-2336\">36</a> Perhaps this time is not wasted but rather serves some important recuperative, educational, or other function. Or perhaps not; perhaps instead the effect of social media on society is like the effect of a new addictive drug &#x2014; opium, heroin, cocaine, etc. &#x2014; which causes serious damage until society adapts. Maybe there will be more things like this: extremely addictive video games, or newly invented drugs, or wireheading (directly stimulating the reward circuitry of the brain).<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-37-2336\">37</a></p><p>This could lead to economic and scientific slowdown. It could also concentrate power and influence in fewer people&#x2014;those who for whatever reason remain relatively unaffected by the various productivity-draining technologies. Depending on how these practices spread, they might affect some communities more or sooner than others.</p><p><strong>18. Medicine to boost human mental abilities (TML, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>To my knowledge, existing &#x201C;study drugs&#x201D; such as modafinil don&#x2019;t seem to have substantially sped up the rate of scientific progress in any field. However, new drugs (or other treatments) might be more effective. Moreover, in some fields, researchers typically do their best work at a certain age. Medicine which extends this period of peak mental ability might have a similar effect.</p><p>This could speed up the rate of scientific progress in some fields, among other effects.</p><p><strong>19. Genetic engineering, human cloning, iterated embryo selection (TML, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Changes in human capabilities or other human traits via genetic interventions<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-38-2336\">38</a> could affect many areas of life. If the changes were dramatic, they might have a large impact even if only a small fraction of humanity were altered by them.&#xA0;</p><p>Changes in human capabilities or other human traits via genetic interventions might:</p><ul><li>Accelerate research in general</li><li>Differentially accelerate research projects that depend more on &#x201C;genius&#x201D; and less on money or experience</li><li>Influence politics and ideology</li><li>Cause social upheaval</li><li>Increase the number of people capable of causing great harm</li><li>Have a huge variety of effects not considered here, given the ubiquitous relevance of human nature to events</li><li>Shift the landscape of effective strategies for influencing AI development (see below)</li></ul><p><strong>20. Landscape of effective strategies for influencing AI development changes substantially (CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>For a person at a time, there is a landscape of strategies for influencing the world, and in particular for influencing AI development and the effects of advanced AGI. The landscape could change such that the most effective strategies for influencing AI development are:</p><ul><li>More or less reliably helpful (e.g. working for an hour on a major unsolved technical problem might have a low chance of a very high payoff, and so not be very reliable)</li><li>More or less &#x201C;outside the box&#x201D; (e.g. being an employee, publishing academic papers, and signing petitions are normal strategies, whereas writing Harry Potter fanfiction to illustrate rationality concepts and inspire teenagers to work on AI safety is not)<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-39-2336\">39</a></li><li>Easier or harder to find, such that marginal returns to investment in strategy research change</li></ul><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of reasons to think these features might change systematically over time:</p><ul><li>As more people devote more effort to achieving some goal, one might expect that effective strategies become common, and it becomes harder to find novel strategies that perform better than common strategies. As advanced AI becomes closer, one might expect more effort to flow into influencing the situation. Currently some &#x2018;markets&#x2019; are more efficient than others; in some the orthodox strategies are best or close to the best, whereas in others clever and careful reasoning can find strategies vastly better than what most people do. How efficient a market is depends on how many people are genuinely trying to compete in it, and how accurate their beliefs are. For example, the stock market and the market for political influence are fairly efficient, because many highly-knowledgeable actors are competing.&#xA0; As more people take interest, the &#x2018;market&#x2019; for influencing the course of AI may become more efficient. (This would also decrease the marginal returns to investment in strategy research, by making orthodox strategies closer to optimal.) If there is a deterioration of social epistemology (see below), the market might instead become less efficient.&#xA0;&#xA0;</li><li>Currently there are some tasks at which the most skilled people are not much better than the average person&#xA0; (e.g. manual labor, voting) and others in which the distribution of effectiveness is heavy-tailed, such that a large fraction of the total influence comes from a small fraction of individuals (e.g. theoretical math, donating to politicians). The types of activity that are most useful for influencing the course of AI development may change over time in this regard, which in turn might affect the strategy landscape in all three ways described above.</li><li>Transformative technologies can lead to new opportunities and windfalls for people who recognize them early. As more people take interest, opportunities for easy success disappear. Perhaps there will be a burst of new technologies prior to advanced AGI, creating opportunities for unorthodox or risky strategies to be very successful.</li></ul><p>A shift in the landscape of effective strategies for influencing the course of AI is relevant to anyone who wants to have an effective strategy for influencing the course of AI.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-40-2336\">40</a> If it is part of a more general shift in the landscape of effective strategies for other goals &#x2014; e.g. winning wars, making money, influencing politics &#x2014; the world could be significantly disrupted in ways that may be hard to predict.</p><p><strong>21. Global economic collapse (TML, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>This might slow down research or precipitate other relevant events, such as war.</p><p><strong>22. Scientific stagnation (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>There is some evidence that scientific progress in general might be slowing down. For example, the millennia-long trend of decreasing economic doubling time seems to have stopped around 1960.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-41-2336\">41</a> Meanwhile, scientific progress has arguably come from increased investment in research. Since research investment has been growing faster than the economy, it might eventually saturate and grow only as fast as the economy.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-42-2336\">42</a></p><p>This might slow down AI research, making the events on this list (but not the technologies) more likely to happen before advanced AGI.</p><p><strong>23. Global catastrophe (TML, POL, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>Here are some examples of potential global catastrophes:</p><ul><li>Climate change tail risks, e.g. feedback loop of melting permafrost releasing methane<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-43-2336\">43</a></li><li>Major nuclear exchange</li><li>Global pandemic</li><li>Volcano eruption that leads to 10% reduction in global agricultural production<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-44-2336\">44</a></li><li>Exceptionally bad solar storm knocks out world electrical grid<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-45-2336\">45</a></li><li>Geoengineering project backfires or has major negative side-effects<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-46-2336\">46</a></li></ul><p>A global catastrophe might be expected to cause conflict and slowing of projects such as research, though it could also conceivably increase attention on projects that are useful for dealing with the problem. It seems likely to have other hard to predict effects.</p><h4><strong>Attitudes toward AGI</strong></h4><p><strong>24. Shift in level of public attention on AGI (TML, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>The level of attention paid to AGI by the public, governments, and other relevant actors might increase (e.g. due to an impressive demonstration or a bad accident) or decrease (e.g. due to other issues drawing more attention, or evidence that AI is less dangerous or imminent).</p><p>Changes in the level of attention could affect the amount of work on AI and AI safety. More attention could also lead to changes in public opinion such as panic or an AI rights movement.&#xA0;</p><p>If the level of attention increases but AGI does not arrive soon thereafter, there might be a subsequent period of disillusionment.</p><p><strong>25. Change in investment in AGI development (TML, TAS, POL)</strong><br></p><p>There could be a rush for AGI, for instance if major nations begin megaprojects to build it. Or there could be a rush away from AGI, for instance if it comes to be seen as immoral or dangerous like human cloning or nuclear rocketry.&#xA0;</p><p>Increased investment in AGI might make advanced AGI happen sooner, with less <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/hardware-overhang/\">hardware overhang</a> and potentially less proportional investment in safety. Decreased investment might have the opposite effects.</p><p><strong>26. New social movements or ideological shifts (TML, TAS, POL, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>The communities that build and regulate AI could undergo a substantial ideological shift. Historically, entire nations have been swept by radical ideologies within about a decade or so, e.g. Communism, Fascism, the Cultural Revolution, and the First Great Awakening.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-47-2336\">47</a> Major ideological shifts within communities smaller than nations (or within nations, but on specific topics) presumably happen more often. There might even appear powerful social movements explicitly focused on AI, for instance in opposition to it&#xA0; or attempting to secure legal rights and moral status for AI agents.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-48-2336\">48</a> Finally, there could be a general rise in extremist movements, for instance due to a symbiotic feedback effect hypothesized by some,<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-49-2336\">49</a> which might have strategically relevant implications even if mainstream opinions do not change.</p><p>Changes in public opinion on AI might change the speed of AI research, change who is doing it, change which types of AI are developed or used, and limit or alter discussion. For example, attempts to limit an AI system&#x2019;s effects on the world by containing it might be seen as inhumane, as might adversarial and population-based training methods. Broader ideological change or a rise in extremisms might increase the probability of a massive crisis, revolution, civil war, or world war.</p><p><strong>27. Harbinger of AGI (ALN, POL, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Events could occur that provide compelling evidence, to at least a relevant minority of people, that advanced AGI is near.</p><p>This could increase the amount of technical AI safety work and AI policy work being done, to the extent that people are sufficiently well-informed and good at forecasting. It could also enable people already doing such work to more efficiently focus their efforts on the true scenario.</p><p><strong>28. AI alignment warning shot (ALN, POL)</strong><br></p><p>A convincing real-world example of AI alignment failure could occur.</p><p>This could motivate more effort into mitigating AI risk and perhaps also provide useful evidence about some kinds of risks and how to avoid them.</p><h4><strong>Precursors to AGI</strong></h4><p><strong>29. Brain scanning (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>An accurate way to scan human brains at a very high resolution could be developed.</p><p>Combined with a good low-level understanding of the brain (see below) and sufficient computational resources, this might enable brain emulations, a form of AGI in which the AGI is similar, mentally, to some original human. This would change the kind of technical AI safety work that would be relevant, as well as introducing new AI policy questions. It would also likely make AGI timelines easier to predict. It might influence takeoff speeds.</p><p><strong>30. Good low-level understanding of the brain (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>To my knowledge, as of April 2020, humanity does not understand how neurons work well enough to accurately simulate the behavior of a C. Elegans worm, though all connections between its neurons have been mapped<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-50-2336\">50</a> Ongoing progress in modeling individual neurons could change this, and perhaps ultimately allow accurate simulation of entire human brains.</p><p>Combined with brain scanning (see above) and sufficient computational resources, this may enable brain emulations, a form of AGI in which the AI system is similar, mentally, to some original human. This would change the kind of AI safety work that would be relevant, as well as introducing new AI policy questions. It would also likely make the time until AGI is developed more predictable. It might influence takeoff speeds. Even if brain scanning is not possible, a good low-level understanding of the brain might speed AI development, especially of systems that are more similar to human brains.</p><p><strong>31. Brain-machine interfaces (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Better, safer, and cheaper methods to control computers directly with our brains may be developed. At least one project is explicitly working towards this goal.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-51-2336\">51</a></p><p>Strong brain-machine interfaces might:</p><ul><li>Accelerate research, including on AI and AI safety<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-52-2336\">52</a></li><li>Accelerate in vitro brain technology</li><li>Accelerate mind-reading, lie detection, and persuasion tools</li><li>Deteriorate collective epistemology (e.g. by contributing to wireheading or short attention spans)</li><li>Improve collective epistemology (e.g. by improving communication abilities)</li><li>Increase inequality in influence among people</li></ul><p><strong>32. In vitro brains (TML, TAS, POL, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>Neural tissue can be grown in a dish (or in an animal and transplanted) and connected to computers, sensors, and even actuators.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-53-2336\">53</a> If this tissue can be trained to perform important tasks, and the technology develops enough, it might function as a sort of artificial intelligence. Its components would not be faster than humans, but it might be cheaper or more intelligent. Meanwhile, this technology might also allow fresh neural tissue to be grafted onto existing humans, potentially serving as a cognitive enhancer.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-54-2336\">54</a></p><p>This might change the sorts of systems AI safety efforts should focus on. It might also automate much human labor, inspire changes in public opinion about AI research (e.g. promoting concern about the rights of AI systems), and have other effects which are hard to predict.</p><p><strong>33. Weak AGI (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Researchers may develop something which is a true artificial general intelligence&#x2014;able to learn and perform competently all the tasks humans do&#x2014;but just isn&#x2019;t very good at them, at least, not as good as a skilled human.&#xA0;</p><p>If weak AGI is faster or cheaper than humans, it might still replace humans in many jobs, potentially speeding economic or technological progress. Separately, weak AGI might provide testing opportunities for technical AI safety research. It might also change public opinion about AI, for instance inspiring a &#x201C;robot rights&#x201D; movement, or an anti-AI movement.</p><p><strong>34. Expensive AGI (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Researchers may develop something which is a true artificial general intelligence, and moreover is qualitatively more intelligent than any human, but is vastly more expensive, so that there is some substantial period of time before cheap AGI is developed.&#xA0;</p><p>An expensive AGI might contribute to endeavors that are sufficiently valuable, such as some science and technology, and so may have a large effect on society. It might also prompt increased effort on AI or AI safety, or inspire public thought about AI that produces changes in public opinion and thus policy, e.g. regarding the rights of machines. It might also allow opportunities for trialing AI safety plans prior to very widespread use.</p><p><strong>35. Slow AGI (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Researchers may develop something which is a true artificial general intelligence, and moreover is qualitatively as intelligent as the smartest humans, but takes a lot longer to train and learn than today&#x2019;s AI systems.</p><p>Slow AGI might be easier to understand and control than other kinds of AGI, because it would train and learn more slowly, giving humans more time to react and understand it. It might produce changes in public opinion about AI.</p><p><strong>36. Automation of human labor (TML, TAS, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>If the pace of automation substantially increases prior to advanced AGI, there could be social upheaval and also dramatic economic growth. This might affect investment in AI.</p><h4><strong>Shifts in the balance of power</strong></h4><p><strong>37. Major leak of AI research (TML, TAS, POL, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>Edward Snowden defected from the NSA and made public a vast trove of information. Perhaps something similar could happen to a leading tech company or AI project.&#xA0;</p><p>In a world where much AI progress is hoarded, such an event could accelerate timelines and make the political situation more multipolar and chaotic.</p><p><strong>38. Shift in favor of espionage (POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Espionage techniques might become more effective relative to counterespionage techniques. In particular:</p><ul><li>Quantum computing could break current encryption protocols.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-55-2336\">55</a></li><li>Automated vulnerability detection<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-56-2336\">56</a> could turn out to have an advantage over automated cyberdefense systems, at least in the years leading up to advanced AGI.</li></ul><p>More successful espionage techniques might make it impossible for any AI project to maintain a lead over other projects for any substantial period of time. Other disruptions may become more likely, such as hacking into nuclear launch facilities, or large scale cyberwarfare.</p><p><strong>39. Shift in favor of counterespionage (POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Counterespionage techniques might become more effective relative to espionage techniques than they are now. In particular:</p><ul><li>Post-quantum encryption might be secure against attack by quantum computers.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-57-2336\">57</a></li><li>Automated cyberdefense systems could turn out to have an advantage over automated vulnerability detection. Ben Garfinkel and Allan Dafoe<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-58-2336\">58</a> give reason to think the balance will ultimately shift to favor defense.</li></ul><p>Stronger counterespionage techniques might make it easier for an AI project to maintain a technological lead over the rest of the world. Cyber wars and other disruptive events could become less likely.</p><p><strong>40. Broader or more sophisticated surveillance (POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>More extensive or more sophisticated surveillance could allow strong and selective policing of technological development. It would also have other social effects, such as making totalitarianism easier and making terrorism harder.</p><p><strong>41. Autonomous weapons (POL, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>Autonomous weapons could shift the balance of power between nations, or shift the offense-defense balances resulting in more or fewer wars or terrorist attacks, or help to make totalitarian governments more stable. As a potentially early, visible and controversial use of AI, they may also especially influence public opinion on AI more broadly, e.g. prompting anti-AI sentiment.</p><p><strong>42. Shift in importance of governments, corporations, and other groups in AI development (POL, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>Currently both governments and corporations are strategically relevant actors in determining the course of AI development. Perhaps governments will become more important, e.g. by nationalizing and merging AI companies. Or perhaps governments will become less important, e.g. by not paying attention to AI issues at all, or by becoming less powerful and competent generally. Perhaps some third kind of actor (such as religion, insurgency, organized crime, or special individual) will become more important, e.g. due to persuasion tools, countermeasures to surveillance, or new weapons of guerilla warfare.<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-59-2336\">59</a></p><p>This influences AI policy by affecting which actors are relevant to how AI is developed and deployed.</p><p><strong>43. Catastrophe in strategically important location (TML, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>Perhaps some strategically important location (e.g. tech hub, seat of government, or chip fab) will be suddenly destroyed. Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways this could happen:</p><ul><li>Terrorist attack with weapon of mass destruction</li><li>Major earthquake, flood, tsunami, etc. (e.g. this research claims a 2% chance of magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake in San Francisco by 2044.)<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/#easy-footnote-bottom-60-2336\">60</a></li></ul><p>If it happens, it might be strategically disruptive, causing e.g. the dissolution and diaspora of the front-runner AI project, or making it more likely that some government makes a radical move of some sort.</p><p><strong>44. Change in national AI research loci (POL, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>For instance, a new major national hub of AI research could arise, rivalling the USA and China in research output. Or either the USA or China could cease to be relevant to AI research.</p><p>This might make coordinating AI policy more difficult. It might make a rush for AGI more or less likely.</p><p><strong>45. Large war (TML, POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>This might cause short-term, militarily relevant AI capabilities research to be prioritized over AI safety and foundational research. It could also make global coordination on AI policy difficult.</p><p><strong>46. Civil war or regime change in major relevant countries (POL, CHA, MIS)</strong><br></p><p>This might be very dangerous for people living in those countries. It might change who the strategically relevant actors are for shaping AI development. It might result in increased instability, or cause a new social movement or ideological shift.</p><p><strong>47. Formation of a world government (POL, CHA)</strong><br></p><p>This would make coordinating AI policy easier in some ways (e.g. there would be no need for multiple governing bodies to coordinate their policy at the highest level), however it might be harder in others (e.g. there might be a more complicated regulatory system overall).</p><p><em>18 June 2020.</em><br></p><h2><strong>Notes</strong></h2><p>(Edited to add text)</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>A memory palace seems like an inefficient way to learn, unless it&apos;s for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/mar/13/pi-day-2015-memory-memorisation-world-record-japanese-akira-haraguchi#:~:text=The%20world%20champion%20is%20Akira,has%20not%20validated%20his%20record.\">memorization stunt</a>. At least, that&apos;s what it seems like as a beginner. It&apos;s slow, requires a very peaceful frame of mind, and isn&apos;t the kind of thing you can just dip into when needed in a time crunch. Nor does it make you better at the sort of fast calculations you get on an exam. Flash cards and homework seem like a more efficient way to grind in order to improve your speed and accuracy of recall.</p><p>We now have fast tools for information retrieval and visualization. It&apos;s usually more efficient to build a personal reference sheet than to construct a memory palace, unless you&apos;re trying to count cards.</p><p>Yet my experiences with visualization practice and memory palaces have been intriguing. I want to outline some of the benefits I&apos;ve seen.</p><p><strong>1) Constructing a memory palace makes textbook reading more engaging and focused.</strong></p><p>Textbooks are dry, dense, and full of explanations that eventually become distractions from the information you&apos;re searching for. A memory palace turns dry prose into a far more engaging multi-sensory experience. When you&apos;re already in a peaceful, relaxed frame of mind, the dense charts and long lists of equations become interesting memorization challenges rather than dry references. I can study far, far longer if I&apos;m visualizing the material than if I&apos;m just scanning words on a page, trying to figure out which equations I&apos;ll need for the next test.</p><p>School does <em>not</em> incentivize this kind of scientific reading for pleasure, or even suggest it might be possible. It 100% incentivizes students to calculate, calculate, calculate, and to get their gratification from high grades. This is a disgusting outcome, and I see visualization practice as a way to reclaim your own mind and imagination from this Molochian trap.</p><p><strong>2) Visualization lets you see what you know all at once.</strong></p><p>I&apos;m a classically trained pianist, and the trouble with audio/kinetic memorization is that you can only hold one posture or sound in your head at a time. At least that I&apos;m aware of. Audio/kinetic memory can also be fragile. Ever tried to play a piece of classical music, hit a single point in the music where you can&apos;t remember what comes next, and just found yourself looping and floundering at the stuck place?</p><p>With the visual sense, we can all keep track of many objects all at once, and it&apos;s effortless to observe them. We might drop details. But because we&apos;re often imagining the thing itself (the molecular diagram, a 3D map with labeled extreme values, a photograph of a person), we have some structure available to help us fill in the blanks.</p><p>That makes it easy to go over a list. If you&apos;ve placed 7 objects on a table in your mind palace, you just have to stand back and look at it. No more depending on remembering a sequence of words in the same order they were presented to you. </p><p><strong>3) A memory palace helps you relate and understand concepts.</strong></p><p>In my gen chem textbook, electronegativity and formal charge are presented in the same chapter, but are separated by a few sections. I understood how nuclear size and electron configuration gave rise to electronegativity, and I understood how electronegativity was important in determining which formal charge made for the best atomic diagram. But I hadn&apos;t thought at all about relating nuclear size and electron configuration to formal charge.</p><p>Scott Alexander&apos;s piece on <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/26/mental-mountains/\">mental mountains</a> keeps coming back to me. Visual thinking seems to allow you hold up chunks of your memory that weren&apos;t formed together, and let the mind&apos;s natural tendency to find patterns go to work. If you&apos;re studying science, this is productive, because the whole idea is that it all links together. I visualize each textbook chapter as a room in my mind. But I can look through the doors into the other rooms and see the objects inside.</p><p><strong>4) Visualization practice and memory palaces make you more able to see and manipulate 3D structures.</strong></p><p>We&apos;ve all had the experience of looking at a complex 3D image and not being able to untangle the full structure from the 2D representation. It just looks like a jumble of lines and colors. The eye slides off it, since we&apos;re not in the habit of figuring out how to translate it from the image to the object. Take a look at this molecule. You probably notice the central atom, the three branches, and the way that there&apos;s six blue atoms, each with two black atoms, and everything with white atoms.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DmWqg5y.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>But did you notice the way each looped branch is twisted relative to the others? Did you see how the angle of the tetrahedrons within each branch is rotated from link to link to link? Those are features that I only picked out when I committed this image to memory. Afterward, they jumped out at me even when I look at the original image. The picture looks different to me than it did before.</p><p><strong>So what?</strong></p><p><em>If you want to learn, <a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/05/04/do-the-real-thing/\">do the real thing</a>. Everybody learns what their job requires them to memorize, what it allows them to reference, and when it&apos;s best to consult with an expert. The memorization you&apos;ll accomplish by doing the work, not building a memory palace.</em></p><p><em>School is a signalling system. The smart thing to do is focus on maximizing your grades with minimal effort, not memorizing your gen chem textbook. Real learning is what you do on the job. So you should focus all your efforts on getting the job you want as efficiently as possible, not on this self-gratifying scholasticism. If you&apos;re getting tested on your calculations, and admitted to grad school or hired on the basis of your grades, then screw deep learning - start grinding!</em></p><p>I&apos;m hoping the grind-and-graduate perspective is not just sad, but also suboptimal. It might be that memory palaces can be not just a slow and vivid hard drive, but can also allow you to do original thinking, set up calculation schemes, and expand what you&apos;re able to learn.</p><p>It&apos;ll be hard to say what&apos;s possible without a lot more practice. But I&apos;ve never heard any teacher give one iota of guidance on any of this in my life, which makes me think it&apos;s probably a neglected topic. Visual thinking ability and imagination is hard to measure even by the standards of psychology and education science, and it&apos;s hard to turn into a product. So no wonder. I think it would be valuable just to have some case studies from people in this community who are willing to try it and see what happens.</p>",

What is the relationship between a computational optimization process — say, a computer program solving an optimization problem — and a physical optimization process — say, a team of humans building a house?</p>\n<p>We propose the concept of an optimizing system as a physically closed system containing both that which is being optimized and that which is doing the optimizing, and defined by a tendency to evolve from a broad basin of attraction towards a small set of target configurations despite perturbations to the system. We compare our definition to that proposed by Yudkowsky, and place our work in the context of work by Demski and Garrabrant’s <em>Embedded Agency</em>, and Drexler’s <em>Comprehensive AI Services</em>. We show that our definition resolves difficult cases proposed by Daniel Filan. We work through numerous examples of biological, computational, and simple physical systems showing how our definition relates to each.</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In the field of computer science, an optimization algorithm is a computer program that outputs the solution, or an approximation thereof, to an optimization problem. An optimization problem consists of an objective function to be maximized or minimized, and a feasible region within which to search for a solution.

For example, we might choose to measure a nail factory by the rate at which it outputs nails, relative to the cost of production inputs. We can view this as a kind of objective function, with the factory as the object of optimization just as the variable x was the object of optimization in the previous example.</p>\n<p>There is clearly a connection between optimizing the factory and optimizing for x, but what exactly is this connection? What is it that identifies an algorithm as an optimization algorithm? What is it that identifies a process as an optimization process?</p>\n<p>The answer proposed in this essay is: an optimizing system is a physical process in which the configuration of some part of the universe moves predictably towards a small set of target configurations from any point in a broad basin of optimization, <em>despite perturbations during the optimization process</em>.</p>\n<p>We do not imagine that there is some engine or agent or mind performing optimization, separately from that which is being optimized. We consider the whole system jointly — engine and object of optimization — and ask whether it exhibits a tendency to evolve towards a predictable target configuration. If so, then we call it an optimizing system. If the basin of attraction is deep and wide then we say that this is a robust optimizing system.</p>\n<p>An optimizing system as defined in this essay is known in dynamical systems theory as a dynamical system with one or more attractors. In this essay we show how this framework can help to understand optimization as manifested in physically closed systems containing both engine and object of optimization.</p>\n<p>In this way we find that optimizing systems are not something that are designed but are discovered. The configuration space of the world contains countless pockets shaped like small and large basins, such that if the world should crest the rim of one of these pockets then it will naturally evolve towards the bottom of the basin. We care about them because we can use our own agency to tip the world into such a basin and then let go, knowing that from here on things will evolve towards the target region.</p>\n<p>All optimization basins have a finite extent. A ball may roll to the center of a valley if initially placed anywhere within the valley, but if it is placed outside the valley then it will roll somewhere else entirely, or perhaps will not roll at all. Similarly, even a very robust optimizing system has an outer rim to its basin of attraction, such that if the configuration of the system is perturbed beyond that rim then the system no longer evolves towards the target that it once did. When an optimizing system deviates beyond its own rim, we say that it dies. An existential catastrophe is when the optimizing system of life on Earth moves beyond its own outer rim.</p>\n<h2>Example: computing the square root of two</h2>\n<p>Say I ask my computer to compute the square root of two, for example by opening a python interpreter and typing:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(math.sqrt(2))\n1.41421356237\n</code></pre>\n<p>The value printed here is actually calculated by solving an optimization problem. It works roughly as follows. First we set up an objective function that has as its minimum value the square root of two. One function we could use is <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"y = (x^2 - 2)^2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;\">y</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">−</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cnqxuNC.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Next we pick an initial estimate for the square root of two, which can be any number whatsoever. Let’s take 1.0 as our initial guess. Then we take a gradient step in the direction indicated by computing the slope of the objective function at our initial estimate:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PvObUiQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Then we repeat this process of computing the slope and updating our estimate over and over, and our optimization algorithm quickly converges to the square root of two:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/feM3AON.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This is gradient descent, and it can be implemented in a few lines of python code:</p>\n<pre><code>\tcurrent_estimate = 1.0\n\tstep_size = 1e-3\n\twhile True:\n\t\tobjective = (current_estimate**2 - 2) ** 2\n\t\tgradient = 4 * current_estimate * (current_estimate**2 - 2)\n\t\tif abs(gradient) &lt; 1e-8:\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\tcurrent_estimate -= gradient * step_size\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this program has the following unusual property: we can modify the variable that holds the current estimate of the square root of two at any point while the program is running, <em>and the algorithm will still converge to the square root of two</em>. That is, while the code above is running, if I drop in with a debugger and overwrite the current estimate while the loop is still executing, what will happen is that the next gradient step will start correcting for this perturbation, pushing the estimate back towards the square root of two:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bo7l5Tu.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If we give the algorithm time to converge to within machine precision of the actual square root of two then the final output will be bit-for-bit identical to the result we would have gotten without the perturbation.</p>\n<p>Consider this for a moment. For most kinds of computer code, overwriting a variable while the code is running will either have no effect because the variable isn’t used, or it will have a catastrophic effect and the code will crash, or it will simply cause the code to output the wrong answer. If I use a debugger to drop in on a webserver servicing an http request and I overwrite some variable with an arbitrary value just as the code is performing a loop in which this variable is used in a central way, bad things are likely to happen! Most computer code is not robust to arbitrary in-flight data modifications.</p>\n<p>But this code that computes the square root of two <em>is</em> robust to in-flight data modifications, or at least the \"current estimate\" variable is. It’s not that our perturbation has no effect: if we change the value, the next iteration of the algorithm will compute the objective function and its slope at a completely different point, and each iteration after that will be different to how it would have been if we hadn’t intervened. The perturbation may change the total number of iterations before convergence is reached. But ultimately the algorithm will <em>still output an estimate of the square root of two</em>, and, given time to fully converge, it will output the exact same answer it would have output without the perturbation. This is an unusual breed of computer program indeed!</p>\n<p>What is happening here is that we have constructed a physical system consisting of a computer and a python program that computes the square root of two, such that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>for a set of starting configurations (in this case the set of configurations in which the \"current estimate\" variable is set to each representable floating point number),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the system exhibits a tendency to evolve towards a small set of target configurations (in this case just the single configuration in which the \"current estimate\" variable is set to the square root of two),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and this tendency is robust to in-flight perturbations to the system’s configuration (in this case robustness is limited to just the dimensions corresponding to changes in the \"current estimate\" variable).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this essay I argue that systems that converge to some target configuration, and will do so despite perturbations to the system, are the systems we should rightly call \"optimizing systems\".</p>\n<h2>Example: building a house</h2>\n<p>Consider a group of humans building a house. Let us consider the humans together with the building materials and construction site as a single physical system. Let us imagine that we assemble this system inside a completely closed chamber, including food and sleeping quarters for the humans, lighting, a power source, construction materials, construction blueprint, as well as the physical humans with appropriate instructions and incentives to build the house. If we just put these physical elements together we get a system that has a tendency to evolve under the natural laws of physics towards a configuration in which there is a house matching the blueprint.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ABxluiy.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We could perturb the system while the house is being built — say by dropping in at night and removing some walls or moving some construction materials about — and this physical system will recover. The team of humans will come in the next day and find the construction materials that were moved, put in new walls to replace the ones that were removed, and so on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jTjeG2C.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Just like the square root of two example, here is a physical system with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A basin of attraction (all the possible arrangements of viable humans and building materials)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A target configuration set that is small relative to the basin of attraction (those in which the building materials have been arranged into a house matching the design)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A tendency to evolve towards the target configurations when starting from any point within the basin of attraction, <em>despite in-flight perturbations to the system</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now this system is not infinitely robust. If we really scramble the arrangement of atoms within this system then we’ll quickly wind up with a configuration that does not contain any humans, or in which the building materials are irrevocably destroyed, and then we will have a system without the tendency to evolve towards any small set of final configurations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vxmaV61.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In the physical world we are not surprised to find systems that have this tendency to evolve towards a small set of target configurations. If I pick up my dog while he is sleeping and move him by a few inches, he still finds his way to his water bowl when he wakes up. If I pull a piece of bark off a tree, the tree continues to grow in the same upward direction. If I make a noise that surprises a friend working on some math homework, the math homework still gets done. Systems that contain living beings regularly exhibit this tendency to evolve towards target configurations, and tend to do so in a way that is robust to in-flight perturbations. As a result we are familiar with physical systems that have this property, and we are not surprised when they arise in our lives.</p>\n<p>But physical systems in general do not have the tendency to evolve towards target configurations. If I move a billiard ball a few inches to the left while a bunch of billiard balls are energetically bouncing around a billiard table, the balls are likely to come to rest in a very different position than if I had not moved the ball. If I change the trajectory of a satellite a little bit, the satellite does not have any tendency to move back into its old orbit.</p>\n<p>The computer systems that we have built are still, by and large, more primitive than the living systems that we inhabit, and most computer systems do not have the tendency to evolve robustly towards some set of target configurations, so optimization algorithms as discussed in the previous section, which do have this property, are somewhat unusual.</p>\n<h2>Defining optimization</h2>\n<p>An optimizing system is a system that has a tendency to evolve towards one of a set of configurations that we will call the <em>target configuration set</em>, when started from any configuration within a larger set of configurations, which we call the <em>basin of attraction</em>, and continues to exhibit this tendency with respect to the same target configuration set despite perturbations.</p>\n<p>Some systems may have a single target configuration towards which they inevitably evolve. Examples are a ball in a steep valley with a single local minimum, and a computer computing the square root of two. Other systems may have a set of target configurations and perturbing the system may cause it to evolve towards a different member of this set. Examples are a ball in a valley with multiple local minima, or a tree growing upwards (perturbing the tree by, for example, cutting off some branches while it is growing will probably change its final shape, but will not change its tendency to grow towards <em>one</em> of the configurations in which it has reached its maximum size).</p>\n<p>We can quantify optimizing systems in the following ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Robustness</strong>. Along how many dimensions can we perturb the system without altering its tendency to evolve towards the target configuration set? What magnitude perturbation can the system absorb along these dimensions? A self-driving car navigating through a city may be robust to perturbations that involve physically moving the car to a different position on the road in the city, but not to perturbations that involve changing the state of physical memory registers that contain critical bits of computer code in the car’s internal computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Duality</strong>. To what extent can we identify subsets of the system corresponding to \"that which is being optimized\" and \"that which is doing the optimization\"? Between engine and object of optimization; between agent and world. Highly dualistic systems may be robust to perturbations of the object of optimization, but brittle with respect to perturbations of the engine of optimization. For example, a system containing a 2020s-era robot moving a vase around is a dualistic optimizing system: there is a clear subset of the system that is the engine of optimization (the robot), and object of optimization (the vase). Furthermore, the robot may be able to deal with a wide variety of perturbations to the environment and to the vase, but there are likely to be numerous small perturbations to the robot itself that will render it inert. In contrast, a tree is a non-dualistic optimizing system: the tree does grow towards a set of target configurations, but it makes no sense to ask which part of the tree is \"doing\" the optimization and which part is \"being\" optimized. This latter example is discussed further below.</p>\n<p><strong>Retargetability</strong>. Is it possible, using only a microscopic perturbation to the system, to change the system such that it is still an optimizing system but with a different target configuration set? A system containing a robot with the goal of moving a vase to a certain location can be modified by making just a small number of microscopic perturbations to key memory registers such that the robot holds the goal of moving the vase to a different location and the whole vase/robot system now exhibits a tendency to evolve towards a different target configuration. In contrast, a system containing a ball rolling towards the bottom of a valley cannot generally be modified by any <em>microscopic</em> perturbation such that the ball will roll to a different target location. A tree is an intermediate example: to cause the tree to evolve towards a different target configuration set — say, one in which its leaves were of a different shape — one would have to modify the genetic code simultaneously in all of the tree’s cells.</p>\n<h2>Relationship to Yudkowsky’s definition of optimization</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q4hLMDrFd8fbteeZ8/measuring-optimization-power\"><em>Measuring Optimization Power</em></a>, Eliezer Yudkowsky defines optimization as a process in which some part of the world ends up in a configuration that is high in an agent’s preference ordering, yet has low probability of arising spontaneously. Yudkowsky’s definition asks us to look at a patch of the world that has already undergone optimization by an agent or mind, and draw conclusions about the power or intelligence of that mind by asking how unlikely it would be for a configuration of equal or greater utility (to the agent) to arise spontaneously.</p>\n<p>Our definition differs from this in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We look at whole systems that evolve naturally under physical laws. We do not assume that we can decompose these systems into some engine and object of optimization, or into mind and environment. We do not look at systems that are \"being optimized\" by some external entity but rather at \"optimizing systems\" that exhibit a natural tendency to evolve towards a target configuration set. These optimizing systems may contain subsystems that have the properties of agents, but as we will see there are many instances of optimizing systems that do not contain dualistic agentic subsystems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When discerning the boundary between optimization and non-optimization, we look principally at robustness — whether the system will continue to evolve towards its target configuration set in the face of perturbations — whereas Yudkowsky looks at the improbability of the final configuration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Relationship to Drexler’s <em>Comprehensive AI Services</em></h2>\n<p>Eric Drexler has <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reframing\">written</a> about the need to consider AI systems that are not goal-directed agents. He points out that the most economically important AI systems today are not constructed within the agent paradigm, and that in fact agents represent just a tiny fraction of the design space of intelligent systems. For example, a system that identifies faces in images would be an intelligent system but not an agent according to Drexler’s taxonomy. This perspective is highly relevant to our discussion here since we seek to go beyond the narrow agent model in which intelligent systems are conceived of as unitary entities that receive observations from the environment, send actions back into the environment, but are otherwise separate from the environment.</p>\n<p>Our perspective is that there is a specific class of intelligent systems — which we call optimizing systems — that are worthy of special attention and study due to their potential to reshape the world. The set of optimizing systems is smaller than the set of all AI services, but larger than the set of goal-directed agentic systems.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0Wb14m8.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Figure: relationship between our optimizing system concept and Drexler’s taxonomy of AI systems</em></p>\n<p>Examples of systems that lie in each of these three tiers are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A system that identifies faces in images by evaluating a feed-forward neural network is an AI system but not an optimizing system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A tree is an optimizing system but not a goal-directed agent system (see section below analyzing a tree as an optimizing system).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A robot with the goal of moving a ball to a specific destination is a goal-directed agent system.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Relationship to Garrabrant and Demski’s <em>Embedded Agency</em></h2>\n<p>Scott Garrabrant and Abram Demski have <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/embedded-agency/\">written</a> about the many ways that a dualistic view of agency in which one conceives of a hard separation between agent and environment fails to capture the reality of agents that are reducible to the same basic building-blocks as the environments in which they are embedded. They show that if one starts from a dualistic view of agency then it is difficult to design agents capable of reflecting on and making improvements to their own cognitive processes, since the dualistic view of agency rests on a unitary agent whose cognition does not affect the world except via explicit actions. They also show that reasoning about counterfactuals becomes nonsensical if starting from a dualistic view of agency, since the agent’s cognitive processes are governed by the same physical laws as those that govern the environment, and the agent can come to notice this fact, leading to confusion when considering the consequences actions that are different from the actions that the agent will, in fact, output.</p>\n<p>One could view the <em>Embedded Agency</em> work as enumerating the many logical pitfalls one falls into if one takes the \"optimizer\" concept as the starting point for designing intelligent systems, rather than \"optimizing system\" as we propose here. The present work is strongly inspired by Garrabrant and Demski’s work. Our hope is to point the way to a view of optimization and agency that captures reality sufficiently well to avoid the logical pitfalls identified in the <em>Embedded Agency</em> work.</p>\n<h2>Example: ball in a valley</h2>\n<p>Consider a physical ball rolling around in a small valley. According to our definition of optimization, this is an optimizing system:</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration space</strong>. The system we are studying consists of the physical valley plus the ball</p>\n<p><strong>Basin of attraction</strong>. The ball could initially be placed anywhere in the valley (these are the configurations comprising the basin of attraction)</p>\n<p><strong>Target configuration set</strong>. The ball will roll until it ends up at the bottom of the valley (the set of local minima are the target configurations)</p>\n<p>We can perturb the ball while it is \"in flight\", say by changing its position or velocity, and the ball will still ultimately end up at one of the target configurations. This system is robust to perturbations along dimensions corresponding to the spatial position and velocity of the ball, but there are many more dimensions along which this system is not robust. If we change the shape of the ball to a cube, for example, then the ball will not continue rolling to the bottom of the valley.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AeO0ryZ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Example: ball in valley with robot</h2>\n<p>Consider now a ball in a valley as above, but this time with the addition of an intelligent robot holding the goal of ensuring that the ball reaches the bottom of the valley.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration space</strong>. The system we are studying now consists of the physical valley, the ball, and the robot. We consider the evolution of and perturbations to this whole joint system.</p>\n<p><strong>Target configuration set</strong>. As before, the target configuration is the ball being at the bottom of the valley</p>\n<p><strong>Basin of attraction</strong>. As before, the basin of attraction consists of all the possible spatial locations that the ball could be placed in the valley.</p>\n<p>We can now perturb the system along many more dimensions than in the case where there was no robot. For example, we could introduce a barrier that prevents the ball from rolling downhill past a certain point, and we can then expect a sufficiently intelligent robot to move the ball over the barrier. We can expect a sufficiently well-designed robot to be able to overcome a wide variety of hurdles that gravity would not overcome on its own. Therefore we say that this system is more robust than the system without the robot.</p>\n<p>There is a sequence of systems spanning the gap between a ball rolling in a valley, which is robust to a narrow set of perturbations and therefore we say exhibits a weak degree of optimization, up to a robot with a goal of moving a ball around in a valley, which is robust to a much wider set of perturbations, and therefore we say exhibits a stronger degree of optimization. Therefore the difference between systems that do and do not undergo optimization is not a binary distinction but a continuous gradient of increasing robustness to perturbations.</p>\n<p>By introducing the robot to the system we have also introduced new dimensions along which the system is fragile: the dimensions corresponding to modifications to the robot itself, and in particular the dimensions corresponding to modifications to the code running on the robot (i.e. physical perturbations to the configuration of the memory cells in which the code is stored). There are two types of perturbation we might consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Perturbations that destroy the robot. There are numerous ways we could cut wires or scramble computer code that would leave the robot completely non-operational. Many of these would be physically microscopic, such as flipping a single bit in a memory cell containing some critical computer code. In fact there are now <em>more</em> ways to break the system via microscopic perturbations compared to when we were considering a ball in a valley without a robot, since there are few ways to cause a ball not to reach the bottom of a valley by making only a microscopic perturbation to the system, but there are many ways to break modern computer systems via a microscopic perturbation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perturbations that change the target configurations. We could also make physically microscopic perturbations to this system that change the robot’s goal. For example we might flip the sign on some critical computations in the robot’s code such that the robot works to place the ball at the highest point rather than the lowest. This is still a physical perturbation to the valley/ball/robot system: it is one that affects the configuration of the memory cells containing the robot’s computer code. These kinds of perturbations may point to a concept with some similarity to that of an agent. If we have a system that can be perturbed in a way that preserves the robustness of the basin of convergence but changes the target configuration towards which the system tends to evolve, and if we can find perturbations that cause the target configurations to match our own goals, then we have a way to navigate between convergence basins.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Example: computer performing gradient descent</h2>\n<p>Consider now a computer running an iterative gradient descent algorithm in order to solve an optimization problem. For concreteness let us imagine that the objective function being optimized is globally convex, in which case the algorithm will certainly reach the global optimum given sufficient time. Let us further imagine that the computer stores its current best estimate of the location of the global optimum (which we will henceforth call the \"optimizand\") at some known memory location, and updates this after every iteration of gradient descent.</p>\n<p>Since this is a purely computational process, it may be tempting to define the configuration space at the computational level — for example by taking the configuration space to be the domain of the objective function. However, it is of utmost importance when analyzing any optimizing system to ground our analysis in a physical system evolving according to the physical laws of nature, just as we have for all previous examples. The reason this is important is to ensure that we always study complete systems, not just some inert part of the system that is \"being optimized\" by something external to the system. Therefore we analyze this system as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration space</strong>. The system consists of a physical computer running some code that performs gradient descent. The configurations of the system are the physical configurations of the atoms comprising the computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Target-configuration set.</strong> The target configuration set consists of the set of physical configurations of the computer in which the memory cells that store the current optimized state contain the true location of the global optimum (or the closest floating point representation of it).</p>\n<p><strong>Basin of attraction</strong>. The basin of attraction consists of the set of physical configurations in which there is a viable computer and it is running the gradient descent algorithm.</p>\n<h2>Example: billiard balls</h2>\n<p>Let us now examine a system that is not an optimizing system according to our definition. Consider a billiard table with some billiard balls that are currently bouncing around in motion. Left alone, the balls will eventually come to rest in some configuration. Is this an optimizing system?</p>\n<p>In order to qualify as an optimizing system, a system must (1) have a tendency to evolve towards a set of target configurations that are small relative to the basin of attraction, and (2) continue to evolve towards the same set of target configurations if perturbed.</p>\n<p>If we reach in while the billiard balls are bouncing around and move one of the balls that is in motion, the system will now come to rest in a different configuration. Therefore this is not an optimizing system, because there is no set of target configurations towards which the system evolves despite perturbations. A system does not need to be robust along all dimensions in order to be an optimizing system, but a billiard table exhibits no such robust dimensions at all, so it is not an optimizing system.</p>\n<h2>Example: satellite in orbit</h2>\n<p>Consider a second example of a system that is not an optimizing system: a satellite in orbit around Earth. Unlike the billiard balls, there is no chaotic tendency for small perturbations to lead to large deviations in the system’s evolution, but neither is there any tendency for the system to come back to some target configuration when perturbed. If we perturb the satellite’s velocity or position, then from that point on it is in a different orbit and has no tendency to return to its previous orbit. There is no set of target configurations towards which the system evolves despite perturbations, so this is not an optimizing system.</p>\n<h2>Example: a tree</h2>\n<p>Consider a patch of fertile ground with a tree growing in it. Is this an optimizing system?</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration space</strong>. For the sake of concreteness let us take a region of space that is sealed off from the outside world — say 100m x 100m x 100m. This region is filled at the bottom with fertile soil and at the top with an atmosphere conducive to the tree’s growth. Let us say that the region contains a single tree.</p>\n<p>We will analyze this system in terms of the arrangement of atoms inside this region of space. Out of all the possible configurations of these atoms, the vast majority consist of a uniform hazy gas. An astronomically tiny fraction of configurations contain a non-trivial mass of complex biological nutrients making up soil. An even tinier fraction of configurations contain a viable tree.</p>\n<p><strong>Target-configuration set.</strong> A tree has a tendency to grow taller over time, to sprout more branches and leaves, and so on. Furthermore, trees <a href=\"https://www.calacademy.org/explore-science/trees-can-only-grow-so-tall\">can only grow so tall</a> due to the physics of transporting sugars up and down the trunk. So we can identify a set of target configurations in which the atoms in our region of space are arranged into a tree that has grown to its maximum size (has sprouted as many branches and leaves as it can support given the atmosphere, the soil that it is growing in, and the constraints of its own biology). There are many topologies in which the tree’s branches could divide, many positions that leaves could sprout in, and so on, so there are many configurations within the target configuration set. But this set is still tiny compared to all the ways that the same atoms could be arranged without the constraint of forming a viable tree.</p>\n<p><strong>Basin of convergence.</strong> This system will evolve towards the target configuration set starting from any configuration in which there is a viable tree. This includes configurations in which there is just a seed in the ground, as well as configurations in which there is a tree of small, medium, or large size. Starting from any of these configurations, if we leave the system to evolve under the natural laws of physics then the tree will grow towards its maximum size, at which point the system will be in one of the target configurations.</p>\n<p><strong>Robustness to perturbations.</strong> This system is highly robust to perturbations. Consider perturbing the system in any of the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Moving soil from one place to another</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removing some leaves from the tree</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cutting a branch off the tree</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These perturbations might change which particular target configuration is eventually reached — the particular arrangement of branches and leaves in the tree once it reaches its maximum size — but they will not stop the tree from growing taller and evolving towards a target configuration. In fact we could cut the tree right at the base of the trunk and it would continue to evolve towards a target configuration by sprouting a new trunk and growing a whole new tree.</p>\n<p><strong>Duality</strong>. A tree is a non-dualistic optimizing system. There is no subsystem that is responsible for \"doing\" the optimization, separately from that which is \"being\" optimized. Yet the tree does exhibit a tendency to evolve towards a set of target configurations, and can overcome a wide variety of perturbations in order to do so. There are no man-made systems in existence today that are capable of gathering and utilizing resources so flexibly as a tree, from so broad a variety of environments, and there are certainly no man-made systems that can recover from being physically dismembered to such an extent that a tree can recover from being cut at the trunk.</p>\n<p>At this point it may be tempting to say that the engine of optimization is natural selection. But recall that we are studying just a single tree growing from seed to maximum size. Can you identify a physical subset of our 100m x 100m x 100m region of space that is this engine of optimization, analogous to how we identified a physical subset of the robot-and-ball system as the engine of optimization (i.e. the physical robot)? Natural selection might be the process by which the initial system came into existence, but it is not the process that drives the growth of the tree towards a target configuration.</p>\n<p>It may then be tempting to say that it is the tree’s DNA that is the engine of optimization. It is true that the tree’s DNA exhibits some characteristics of an engine of optimization: it remains unchanged throughout the life of the tree, and physically microscopic perturbations to it can disable the tree. But a tree replicates its DNA in each of its cells, and perturbing just one or a small number of these is not likely to affect the tree’s overall growth trajectory. More importantly, a single strand of DNA does not really have agency on its own: it requires the molecular machinery of the whole cell to synthesize proteins based on the genetic code in the DNA, and the physical machinery of the whole tree to collect and deploy energy, water, and nutrients. Just as it would be incorrect to identify the memory registers containing computer code within a robot as the \"true\" engine of optimization separate from the rest of the computing and physical machinery that brings this code to life, it is not quite accurate to identify DNA as an engine of optimization. A tree simply does not decompose into engine and object of optimization.</p>\n<p>It may also be tempting to ask whether the tree can \"really\" be said to be undergoing optimization in the absence of any \"intention\" to reach one of the target configurations. But this expectation of a centralized mind with centralized intentions is really an artifact of us projecting our view of our self onto the world: we believe that we have a centralized mind with centralized intentions, so we focus our attention on optimizing systems with a similar structure. But this turns out to be misguided on two counts: first, the vast majority of optimizing systems do not contain centralized minds, and second, our own minds are actually far less centralized than we think! For now we put this question of whether optimization requires intentions and instead just work within our definition of optimizing systems, which a tree definitely satisfies.</p>\n<h2>Example: bottle cap</h2>\n<p>Daniel Filan has <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/26eupx3Byc8swRS7f/bottle-caps-aren-t-optimisers\">pointed out</a> that some definitions of optimization would nonsensically classify a bottle cap as an optimizer, since a bottle cap causes water molecules in a bottle to stay inside the bottle, and the set of configurations in which the molecules are inside a bottle is much smaller than the set of configurations in which the molecules are each allowed to take a position either inside or outside the bottle.</p>\n<p>In our framework we have the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The system consists of a bottle, a bottle cap, and water molecules. The configuration space consists of all the possible spatial arrangements of water molecules, either inside or outside the bottle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The basin of attraction is the set of configurations in which the water molecules are inside the bottle</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The target configuration set is the same as the basin of attraction</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3pahZK1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This is not an optimizing system for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, the target configuration set is no smaller than the basin of attraction. To be an optimizing system there must be a tendency to evolve from any configuration within a basin of attraction towards a smaller target configuration set, but in this case the system merely remains within the set of configurations in which the water molecules are inside the bottle. This is no different from a rock sitting on a beach: due to basic chemistry there is a tendency to remain within the set of configurations in which the molecules comprising the rock are physically bound to one another, but it has no tendency to evolve from a wide basin of attraction towards a small set of target configuration.</p>\n<p>Second, the bottle cap system is not robust to perturbations since if we perturb the position of a single water molecule so that it is outside the bottle, there is no tendency for it to move back inside the bottle. This is really just the first point above restated, since if there were a tendency for water molecules moved outside the bottle to evolve back towards a configuration in which all the water molecules were inside the bottle, then we would have a basin of attraction larger than the target configuration set.</p>\n<h2>Example: the human liver</h2>\n<p>Filan also <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/26eupx3Byc8swRS7f/bottle-caps-aren-t-optimisers\">asks</a> whether one’s liver should be considered an optimizer. Suppose we observe a human working to make money. If this person were deprived of a liver, or if their liver stopped functioning, they would presumably be unable to make money. So are we then to view the liver as an optimizer working towards the goal of making money? Filan asks this question as a challenge to Yudkowsky’s definition of optimization, since it seems absurd to view one’s liver as an optimizer working towards the goal of making money, yet <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q4hLMDrFd8fbteeZ8/measuring-optimization-power\">Yudkowsky’s definition of optimization</a> might classify it as such.</p>\n<p>In our framework we have the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The system consists of a human working to make money, together with the whole human economy and world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The basin of attraction consists of the configurations in which there is a healthy human (with a healthy liver) having the goal of making money</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The target configurations are those in which this person’s bank balance is high. (Interestingly there is no upper bound here, so there is no fixed point but rather a continuous gradient.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can expect that this person is capable of overcoming a reasonably broad variety of obstacles in pursuit of making money, so we recognize that this <em>overall</em> system (the human together with the whole economy) is an optimizing system. But Filan would surely agree on this point and his question is more specific: he is asking whether the liver is an optimizer.</p>\n<p>In general we cannot expect to decompose optimizing systems into an engine of optimization and object of optimization. We can see that the system has the characteristics of an optimizing system, and we may identify parts, including in this case the person’s liver, that are necessary for these characteristics to exist, but we cannot in general identify any crisp subset of the system as that which is <em>doing</em> the optimization. And picking various subcomponents of the system (such as the person’s liver) and asking \"<em>is this the part that is doing the optimization?\"</em> does not in general have an answer.</p>\n<p>By analogy, suppose we looked at a planet orbiting a star and asked: \"which part here is <em>doing</em> the orbiting?\" Is it the planet or the star that is the \"engine of orbiting\"? Or suppose we looked at a car and noticed that the fuel pump is a complex piece of machinery without which the car’s locomotion would cease. We might ask: is this fuel pump the true \"engine of locomotion\"? These questions don’t have answers because they mistakenly presuppose that we can identify a subsystem that is uniquely responsible for the orbiting of the planet or the locomotion of the car. Asking whether a human liver is an \"optimizer\" is similarly mistaken: we can see that the liver is a complex piece of machinery that is necessary in order for the overall system to exhibit the characteristics of an optimizing system (robust evolution towards a target configuration set), but beyond this it makes no more sense to ask whether the liver is a true \"locus of optimization\".</p>\n<p>So rather than answering Filan’s question in either the positive or the negative, the appropriate move is to dissolve the concept of an optimizer, and instead ask whether the overall system is an optimizing system.</p>\n<h2>Example: the universe as a whole</h2>\n<p>Consider the whole physical universe as a single closed system. Is this an optimizing system?</p>\n<p>The second law of thermodynamics tells us that the universe is evolving towards a maximally disordered thermodynamic equilibrium in which it cycles through various maxentropy configuration. We might then imagine that the universe is an optimizing system in which the basin of attraction is all possible configurations of matter and energy, and the target configuration set consists of the maxentropy configurations.</p>\n<p>However, this is not quite accurate. Out of all possible configurations of the universe, the vast majority of configurations are at or close to maximum entropy. That is, if we sample a configuration of the universe at random, we have only an astronomically tiny chance of finding anything other than a close-to-uniform gas of basic particles. If we define the basin of attraction as all possible configurations of matter in the universe and the target configuration set as the set of maxentropy configurations, then the target configuration set actually contains almost the entirety of the basin of attraction, with the only configurations that are in the basin of attraction but not the target configuration set being the highly unusual configurations of matter containing stars, galaxies, and so on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/62CT09J.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For this reason the universe as a whole does not qualify as an optimizing system under our definition. (Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it qualifies as an extremely weak optimizing system.)</p>\n<h2>Power sources and entropy</h2>\n<p>The second law of thermodynamics tells us that any closed system will eventually tend towards a maximally disordered state in which matter and energy is spread approximately uniformly through space. So if we were to isolate one of the systems explore above inside a sealed chamber and leave it for a very long period then eventually whatever power source we put inside the sealed chamber would become depleted, and then eventually after that every complex material or compound in the system would degrade into its base products, and then finally we would be left with a chamber filled with a uniform gaseous mixture of whatever base elements we originally put in.</p>\n<p>So in this sense there are no optimizing systems at all, since any of the systems above evolve towards their target configuration sets only for a finite period of time, after which they degrade and evolve towards a maxentropy configuration.</p>\n<p>This is not a very serious challenge to our definition of optimization since it is common throughout physics and computer science to study various \"steady-state\" or \"fixed point\" systems even though the same objection could be made about any of them. We say that a thermometer can be used to build a heat regulator that will keep the temperature of a house within a desired range, and we do not usually need to add the caveat that eventually the house and regulator will degrade into a uniform gaseous mixture due to the heat death of the universe.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, two possible ways to refine our definition are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We could stipulate that some power source is provided externally to each system we analyze, and then perform our analysis conditional on the existence of that power source.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We could specify a finite time horizon and say that \"a system is an optimizing system if it tends towards a target configuration set up to time T\".</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Connection to dynamical systems theory</h2>\n<p>The concept of \"optimizing system\" in this essay is very close to that of a dynamical system with one or more attractors. We offer the following remarks on this connection.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A general dynamical system is any system with a state that evolves over time as a function of the state itself. This encompasses a very broad range of systems indeed!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In dynamical system theory, an attractor is the term used for what we have called the target configuration set. A fixed point attractor is, in our language, a target configuration set with just one element, such as when computing the square root of two. A limit cycle is, in our language, a system that eventually stably loops through a sequence of states all of which are in the target configuration set, such as a satellite in orbit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have discussed systems that evolve towards target configurations along some dimensions but not others (e.g. ball in a valley). We have not yet discovered whether dynamical systems theory explicitly studies attractors that operate along a subset of the system’s dimensions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is a concept of \"well-posedness\" in dynamical systems theory that justifies the identification of a mathematical model with a physical system. The conditions for a model to be well-posed are (1) that a solution exists (i.e. the model is not self-contradictory), (2) that there is a unique solution (i.e. the model contains enough information to pick out a single system trajectory), and (3) that the solution changes continuously with the initial conditions (the behavior of the system is not too chaotic). This third condition may present an interesting avenue for future investigation as it seems related to but not quite equivalent to our notion of robustness since robustness as we define it additionally requires that the system continue to evolve towards the same attractor state despite perturbations. Exploring this connection may present an interesting avenue for future investigation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We have proposed a concept that we call \"optimizing systems\" to describe systems that have a tendency to evolve towards a narrow target configuration set when started from any point within a broader basin of attraction, and continue to do so despite perturbations.</p>\n<p>We have analyzed optimizing systems along three dimensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Robustness, which measures the number of dimensions along which the system is robust to perturbations, and the magnitude of perturbation along these dimensions that the system can withstand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Duality, which measures the extent to which an approximate \"engine of optimization\" subsystem can be identified.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Retargetability, which measures the extent to which the system can be transformed via microscopic perturbations into an equally robust optimizing system but with a different target configuration set.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have argued that the \"optimizer\" concept rests on an assumption that optimizing systems can be decomposed into engine and object of optimization (or agent and environment, or mind and world). We have described systems that do exhibit optimization yet cannot be decomposed this way, such as the tree example. We have also pointed out that, even among those systems that can be decomposed approximately into engine and object of optimization (for example, a robot moving a ball around), we will not in general be able to meaningfully answer the question of whether arbitrary subcomponents of the agent are an optimizer not (c.f. the human liver example).</p>\n<p>Therefore, while the \"optimizer\" concept clearly still has much utility in designing intelligent systems, we should be cautious about taking it as a primitive in our understanding of the world. In particular we should not expect questions of the form \"is X an optimizer?\" to always have answers.</p>\n",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Cross-posted from the  <strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/\">Effective Altruism Forum</a>, </strong>and edited slightly.</p><p><strong>Summary: </strong>The value of human problem-solving ability is the value that can be accumulated through abstraction of value (e.g. defining value in terms of money) and through the exchange of that abstraction. This value can be observed to be orders of magnitude higher than without human intelligence. The value of the problem-solving ability of a General Collective Intelligence is the value that can be accummulated through the abstraction of that abstraction of value (e.g. defining value in terms ability to generalize one process and to reuse it where it is applicable in other processes) and through the exchange of that abstraction. This value (and therefor the problem-solving ability of a GCI as well as it&apos;s capacity to solve existential risks) can be orders of magnitude higher still than possible for human intelligence.</p><p>From the perspective of an approach called Human-Centric Functional Modeling (HCFM), which defines systems according to their function, the earth is an adaptive problem-solving system that functions to solve the problems posed by it&apos;s environment. As we&apos;ll see, this perspective is important in defining in the simplest possible way why human intelligence has been so impactful on the planet. And this approach is important in understanding how to fix that impact.<br></p><p>From this functional modeling perspective, the earth can be defined in terms of a minimal (simplest possible) set of functions of the earth, and higher order interactions between those functions, to the limit of some order N that is reliably achievable without a new system of organization to govern those interactions. Biological life consists of all the Nth order interactions between those functions, where these interactions are higher order and therefore of greater complexity than reliably achievable without life. From the functional modeling perspective homeostasis is the process of seeking to sustain fitness to function, and all life shares this feature. In essence, in that the earth converted part of itself into life, life is a set of processes the earth has developed during it&apos;s lifetime to adapt to give itself greater capacity to maintain stability in it&apos;s fitness to function. <br></p><p>The earth&apos;s adaptation to produce human intelligence marks a functional transition point in the life of the earth. Human intelligence has enabled the part of the earth that is mankind to not only generate a surplus of resources, which other animals can do, but has also given mankind sufficient capacity for abstraction to enable that surplus to be represented in abstract terms that remove the barriers to accumulation. Whether accumulation of knowledge of where fruits or vegetables can be gathered, whether accumulation of reasoning processes enabling prey animals to be outwitted or predator animals to be escaped, with such abstraction any accumulation can potentially be represented as, for example, abstract economic value that can be stored and exchanged, so that economic value can be accumulated at levels orders of magnitude greater. But value in the abstract is impact on any targeted problem in the world, so capacity to accumulate value is the capacity for this subset of the world that is human to achieve impact on the entire world itself. And this removal of barriers to accumulating value has enabled human-beings to accumulate orders of magnitude greater value, and to have the potential for orders of magnitude greater impact on the world around us, than any other organism.<br></p><p>If it&apos;s true that no other animal has had the intelligence to have been able to abstract value into a form that can be accumulated in this way, then looking at economic value as one measure of capacity for impact, the economic value of human intelligence might be at least the value of all economic wealth that has been accumulated to date, that is, all the economic wealth in existence on the earth. For this reason human intelligence, in terms of capacity for not only economic but also of other impacts, might be nature&apos;s most important innovation in the entire 3.5 billion year history of the earth. Human intelligence is not only likely the most impactful innovation in the history of the planet, but it also might be the most impactful innovation possible in the planet&#x2019;s future until a similarly transformative change in ability to create impact on any objective (to create and store value) might be achieved. <br></p><p>Human intelligence is unique in it&apos;s capacity for impact as measured in this way, however, a model of human cognition defined using HCFM suggests that without a fundamental change in the organization of groups, human cognition, whether individual or in groups, faces a limit to the complexity of problems it can reliably define or solve, and a limit to the degree that it can reliably scale cooperation to increase that capacity.<br></p><p>A new cognitive system with the ability to solve even higher order problems would make solving entirely new problems possible, such as the problem of abstracting value even further so it can be exchanged and accumulated at many orders of magnitude higher still. For example, such a system might make it possible to solve the problem of understanding, at a specific enough level to communicate sufficient incentive to everyone who needs to be incentivized to participate, how cooperating in one thing, like making better cell phones, can benefit cooperation in everything else, like gardening. Because at some level of abstraction, all cooperation is the same task. But this can&apos;t reliably be achieved without groups having the capacity to reliably abstract the value in abstraction itself, and to reliably exchange that value, which would provide an entirely new level of value the group might accumulate, and therefore an entirely new level of potential impact.<br></p><p>This ability to accumulate exponentially greater value would mark another transition point in the life of the earth. Currently even though mankind can travel to the moon or to mars, we are constrained to the earth&apos;s resources in doing so. A new cognitive system with the potential to conceive higher order problems and solutions might potentially operate not just with the earth&apos;s resources, but with resources of other planets or celestial bodies, and therefore effectively be part of a larger system than the earth, such as the solar system or galaxy. In the increased capacity it provides for this subset of the solar system or galaxy that is human to change the entire earth itself, this new cognitive system would be the most important innovation in both the history and immediate future of mankind.<br></p><p>An ability to accumulate value (impact problems) at such a scale would represent such a transformative change that it would replace human intelligence in importance. When at some time in the future that point of transformation arrives and our collective capacity to accumulate value scales dramatically, no innovation resulting from human intelligence at any time in the history of human civilization, whether discovering the wheel, the printing press, electricity, the internal combustion engine, or even the computer, will have been more important. Just as no innovation before that point can have been more important than nature&#x2019;s invention of intelligence itself which led to them.<br></p><p>General Collective Intelligence or GCI is a system that organizes groups of individuals into a single collective intelligence with the potential for vastly greater general problem solving ability than any individual in the group. Because GCI leverages a model of human cognition that might be used to implement a system of Artificial General Intelligence or AGI, implementing a GCI will create semantic models of reasoning processes and information, as well as other components, that can be reused to create an AGI. However, GCI has been suggested to be more important that AGI because there are problems that are predicted to be not reliably solvable without GCI. One such problem is making an AGI safe. AGI has been predicted to drive unprecedented inequality, and has been predicted to enable unprecedented surveillance, for whomever owns it. The potential centralization of authority resulting from such destabilizing levels of inequality, and surveillance has been suggested to be an existential risk in itself. In particular, because once such a system is used to centralize decision-making in this way, objection to harm caused by that system might not be reliably possible, while misalignment of that system with collective interests might virtually guarantee such harm will occur. And because once such a decision-making system is in place, controlling it might not be reliably achievable where it is too complex to understand. However, GCI is predicted to have the capacity to reliably define a sufficiently complex web of decentralized mutual cooperation to bind an AGI to the well-being of people and the planet.<br></p><p>AGI is only one existential risk. But a system for significantly increasing a group&apos;s general problem solving ability is relevant to solving the problem posed by every other existential risk as well. Because if the problem with complex problems is that they are too complex for us to currently have the ability to conceptualize either the problem, or its solution, then the problem of all existential risks is the lack of a system that reliably makes us smart enough to do so. One experiment to validate the capacity of a GCI to significantly increase the problem-solving ability of a group in this way is discussed here: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cc8WN9LFz8pATRMYz/how-to-launch-an-experiment-in-the-effective-altruism\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cc8WN9LFz8pATRMYz/how-to-launch-an-experiment-in-the-effective-altruism</a></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Today&#x2019;s innovations and progress swoop humanity into a neat cycle of anticipation and acquisition through deceptive notions that guide it to dependence. We&#x2019;re sold on products and ideas through questionable but politically acceptable marketing tactics. We buy, pre-order, take out loans, only to supposedly upgrade later to a somehow inferior product.</p><p>We were always conditioned for this, like many others, back in school it was suggested by adults to perceive school and homework as a real job. Having little visibility into what I got out of this job - little freedom, no money, - the desire for an actual job was obvious. A whole streak of professions later, I&#x2019;m engulfed in work that I&#x2019;m glad I enjoy, but there&#x2019;s always a thought in the back of my mind of what could&#x2019;ve been, an alternative lifestyle I see practiced by numerous acquaintances: a much less stable career opposite more free time, less toys, a stricter necessity to default to mentally stimulating activities like reading, socializing, exercising; simply because there wouldn&#x2019;t be spare resources to purchase garbage entertainment. There&#x2019;s a slight feeling of entrapment: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/134739-the-things-you-own-end-up-owning-you-it-s-only\">&#x201C;The things you own end up owning you.&#x201D;</a> On the other hand, of course, it could just be the same struggle but highlighted by debt. Yet, I digress: this is a social example of the cycle of anticipation and dependence, where expectations of freedom (a job, a car, a place to live) didn&#x2019;t match reality - added responsibilities, stress, less free time.</p><p>Over the last few years, I&#x2019;ve worked hard to become a hardcore minimalist to ease some of the burden of falling into capitalist traps - obviously not hard enough. Three-four years ago my end goal was to only have as much crap as would fit in my car. At my best I got down to two or three car loads. Having grown addicted to change for irrelevant reasons, I tend to move every year: a good way to gauge how much of the house became storage in that time; though isn&#x2019;t it a nice capitalist dream to have the space for all the toys and trinkets? A shed with tools to build a white picket fence, those collages of family photographs on the stairwell, an RV in the backyard, a lawn mower you can sit on, a car for each family member. It&#x2019;s a circular requirement: get the house for the stuff, get more stuff for the house, fill the house with a family, get a bigger house. Quite reminiscent of &#x201C;get a car to go to work to pay for the car,&#x201D; except with a stronger dependency cycle, higher risks and debts. The anticipation and dependence in this case is for items marketed as <em>tools</em>, which are rather <em>toys</em>.</p><p>There&#x2019;s an inherent issue with progress. Someone keeps telling us that things will make our lives easier, our work better, our time more meaningful. Smartphones, new payment methods, cars with gimmicks no one needs. Why are we being offered touchscreen radios, inefficient biometric locks on smartphones, less universal USB cables? Smartphones are becoming the answer to everything from buying a local bus ticket to authentication and travel routes, yet important metrics, like battery life are never improved. Somehow everyone is okay with it, even though we&#x2019;re all aware of the control companies impose on their devices, the fact that somehow the hardware will get slower over the years. We&#x2019;re not even in control of these devices we buy, they&#x2019;re nothing but rentals: their producers fight against third party repairs, reselling parts, even installing our own software.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution was the same concept: introduce machinery to automate routine tasks while advertising a lighter workload for the workers. Due to marvels of capitalism, to save costs and generate more revenue, that naturally didn&#x2019;t happen: folks simply lost their jobs. Realistically, in such an environment it would never be possible to automate work and keep the workers at the same rates: a competitor would quickly duplicate the product at a lower price. Corporate competition ensures that the workforce is used to its highest potential at all times, and realistically - there isn&#x2019;t a political stance that can fix this at our levels of populations and diversity.</p><p>I suppose what I really want to say is this: we ought to look past marketing and presentation, see products and notions for what they are and strive for the ones with clear improvements.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/wwcfhArpZt94pFkNG\">previous posts in this sequence</a> were largely setup; still important, but not intended to contain significant new material. Now, finally, we get to the good stuff. Once you&#x2019;ve got the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3R59J4mDLihLrgwfk/a-practical-guide-to-conflict-resolution-attitude\">right attitude</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/wwcfhArpZt94pFkNG/p/X8DAqE9t3iPzuGQr4\">good communication</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j2D2dcsAsK5zLKDup/a-practical-guide-to-conflict-resolution-comprehension\">a decent grasp of what both sides are saying</a>, how do you actually get to a successful resolution? For me, it boils down to understanding the building blocks of how we argue, and how we disagree.</p><p>Philosophers and linguists have spent millennia studying the nature of logic, rhetoric, and argument, all the way from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion\">Aristotle</a> through to predicate logic and beyond. However, while rhetoric and disagreement are obviously related, the nature of disagreement itself is much less studied. The rationalist community has explored parts of it, coming up with some interesting ideas like <a href=\"https://www.rationality.org/resources/updates/2016/double-crux\">double-cruxing</a>, but as far as I know has only a few disconnected heuristics - no comprehensive theory.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2017/10/28/classifying-disagreements/\">a very brief post</a> in 2017 (well before I joined Less Wrong) I sketched out a basic categorization of disagreements with almost no explanation. Several years later, my core model remains almost the same. While there can be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_valid_argument_forms\">many forms of valid argument</a> and <a href=\"https://daverobinson.id.au/propositiontypes.html\">many kinds of propositions</a> to slot into those arguments, there are in fact only three kinds of atomic disagreement: fact, value, and meaning. As far as I can tell every disagreement must either belong to one of these categories, be &quot;empty&quot; (meaning there&apos;s technically no disagreement at all), or be a complex combination of smaller disagreements. I&#x2019;ll tackle them one at a time, including tips for resolving each type, and then talk about how to understand and break down the more complex combinations.</p><h3>Disagreements of Fact</h3><p>Disagreements of fact are disagreements over how the world was, is, or will be. They are fundamentally empirical in nature: if I believe that there are only ten chickens on the planet and you believe that there are more, that&#x2019;s something we can physically check; we just have to go out and count enough chickens. Disagreements about historical facts are often harder to resolve (we can&#x2019;t just count the chickens alive in the year 1500 to see how many there were) but the factual nature of the disagreement remains; there is a single right answer, and we just have to find it.</p><p>Resolving disagreements of fact is the specialty of science and <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2014/01/13/the-scientific-method/\">the scientific method</a>. When a disagreement of fact is not directly resolvable through empirical observation, hunt for places where the core disagreement results in differing predictions about something that <em>is</em> directly observable. Maybe if there were as many chickens as you believe, the nutrient content of human skeletons from that era will back you up (I really don&#x2019;t know, historical chicken population is not my specialty and this example is getting out of hand).</p><p>Of course, some disagreements of fact may not be perfectly resolvable with the technology we have available to us. The nutrient content of skeletons may give some indication of chicken population, but it&#x2019;s not going to give us a precise count. In these cases, it&#x2019;s best to fall back on reasoning based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics\">Bayesian statistics</a>. What are your prior confidence levels, and how do the various pieces of evidence affect them? What else can you easily empirically check which will impact those confidence levels?</p><p>Even then, there are some cases where there just doesn&#x2019;t seem to be any checkable predictions that come out of a conflict of fact (the various debates around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory\">string theory</a> were like this for a while). The nice thing is that when you hit a disagreement like this, it somehow stops mattering. If there are no differences in the predictions that can be tested with current technology, then until that technology exists, the two possible worlds are by definition indistinguishable.</p><p>Finally, for cases about the future, it&#x2019;s important to distinguish between disagreements about how the world <em>will</em> be (for example whether there will be more or fewer chickens tomorrow), and disagreements about how the world <em>should</em> be (for example whether we ought to breed more chickens). Disagreements about how the world will be can sometimes be resolved like historical facts, by looking for more immediately checkable predictions. They can also be resolved just by waiting until the future comes to pass. On the other hand, disagreements about how the world should be take us into our next type of disagreement: disagreements of value.</p><h3>Disagreements of Value</h3><p>Disagreements of value are disagreements over what we ought to value. This tends to play out more concretely in disagreements over how the world ought to be, and what we ought to do to get there. For example, if I believe that we should value chickens&#x2019; lives as much as human lives and you believe we should value them less, that is inherently a disagreement over value. There&#x2019;s no checkable fact or testable prediction, now or in the future; the disagreement is fundamentally about what is important. Of course in practice you&#x2019;re unlikely to see <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/26/cortical-neuron-number-matches-intuitive-perceptions-of-moral-value-across-animals/\">a direct disagreement over the value of chicken lives</a>; you&#x2019;re more likely to see a disagreement over whether humans should eat chickens or not, but it&#x2019;s often the same thing.</p><p>Disagreements of value are difficult to deal with. This is often because there is really a complex multi-part disagreement masquerading as a simple value disagreement (for example a disagreement over whether we &#x201C;ought&#x201D; to be vegetarian may be about environmental factors as much as it is about the value of a chicken&#x2019;s life). The key thing to pay attention to is whether the values under debate are <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Terminal_value\">instrumental or terminal</a>.</p><p>If the values under debate are instrumental (for example vegetarianism as a means to value chicken life), then things are by definition complex, as there are at least two possible underlying disagreements. The root cause could be a disagreement over the terminal value (whether a chicken&#x2019;s life should be valued) or a disagreement over the best way to achieve that terminal value (our consumption of chicken has caused a great increase in the total number of chickens, which might be a more effective way to value their lives). When you see a debate over an instrumental value, apply <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem\">Hume&#x2019;s guillotine</a> to slice apart the pieces and find the more fundamental disagreement. Keep in mind that there&#x2019;s nothing to stop both pieces from being sources of disagreement at once, in which case you should at least try and take them one at a time.</p><p>Recognizing instrumental value debates can be tricky, as can breaking them down into their constituent parts. In practice, one of the best ways to do both of these things is to simply try the question &#x201C;Why does that matter?&#x201D;, and not accept &#x201C;it just does&#x201D; as an answer. When pressed, most people will be able to articulate that, for example, they actually value vegetarianism <em>because</em> they value the lives of animals.</p><p>The other way to recognize many instrumental value debates is to look for two apparently-unrelated values being traded off against one another. Imagine we&#x2019;re building a coop for all of these chickens; if one person thinks we should prioritize security against foxes, while the other thinks we should prioritize the number of chickens it can hold, it might seem like they&#x2019;re at an impasse. But this is actually an instrumental value debate that can easily be resolved; all we have to do is &#x201C;normalize&#x201D; the units under debate. Fox-security and number-of-chickens are not directly comparable values, but in practice they&#x2019;re probably both backed by the same terminal value: maximizing the number of eggs we can collect per day. By normalizing the two sides into a single terminal value unit, we&#x2019;re left with a simple disagreement of fact which can be resolved via experimentation: which approach results in more eggs?</p><p>Unfortunately, if the values under debate are truly terminal (back to whether chickens&#x2019; lives should be valued as human lives) then there isn&#x2019;t a good way to resolve this conflict. The conflict will exist until somebody changes their core values, and that&#x2019;s incredibly hard to do. The best &#x201C;hack&#x201D; I&#x2019;ve found is to come up with an unrelated value or problem which both participants agree is more important, and thus makes the current conflict either irrelevant or at least not worth arguing over. Whether a chicken&#x2019;s life is worth a human life tends to take a backseat when the human&#x2019;s house is on fire.</p><p><em>(note: I am not advocating arson as a means of avoiding debates about vegetarianism)</em></p><h3>Disagreements of Meaning</h3><p>The third kind of disagreement is a disagreement over meaning. This is best understood by examining the classic question: if a <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">chicken</span> tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, does it make a sound? While on the surface a disagreement on this point may seem to be a disagreement of fact, it&#x2019;s almost always instead a disagreement of meaning.</p><p>Most reasonable people will agree to the same core facts of what happens when a tree falls in the forest. First, they&#x2019;ll agree that it produces vibrations in the air, also known as sound waves. Second, they&#x2019;ll agree that those sound waves dissipate before reaching anybody&#x2019;s ears, as stipulated in the question. These two points actually cover all of the questions of fact relevant to the disagreement; the conflict is really over the meaning of the word &#x201C;sound&#x201D;. Does it refer to the simple production of sound waves (in which case the tree makes a sound) or does it refer to the sensation created by sound waves heard by a person (in which case it does not).</p><p>The nice thing about disagreements of meaning is that they almost never matter. Language is <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2014/08/02/conventional-language-a-problem-of-social-negotiation/\">socially negotiated</a>, and at the end of the day word meanings are entirely arbitrary. The only thing you need to do to resolve a conflict like this is be very clear about your definitions, and the conflict magically evaporates. Replacing problem words with new nonsense words that have clear definitions is a great trick for this (borrowed from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE/disputing-definitions\">this Less Wrong post</a> on the same topic).</p><p>The one case where the meaning of words does legitimately matter is in law. As a friend of mine so nicely put it, &#x201C;laws are stored in words&#x201D;, and interpreting the meaning of those words can impact how the law is applied, who goes to jail, etc. Ultimately though, word definitions are still arbitrary and will even shift over time, meaning that these disagreements are not resolvable without getting really deep into the philosophy of law (the question of literal meaning vs author&#x2019;s intent, just to start). Fortunately we have a standard method for making these decisions anyway: judges and juries. The result is that the law evolves over time, just like the people that interpret it, and the language that stores it.</p><p>The other case where people like to argue that word meanings matter is when certain words are offensive, disrespectful, or even harmful (if that&#x2019;s a thing you believe words can be). Fortunately this one is a bit more clear-cut: the use of these words is a thing people can disagree about, but it&#x2019;s not a disagreement of meaning. It actually has two parts, tying up an instrumental or potentially terminal value (we should not offend or harm people) with a factual claim (some proportion or group of people are offended or harmed by a given word). The <em>meaning</em> of the word no longer matters at all.</p><h3>Empty Disagreements</h3><p>Empty disagreements are a later addition to this post, and are quite different from the other three types. In a certain sense they are not real disagreements at all, and are merely what happens when disagreement becomes disconnected from any tangible point. But in practice they are fairly common, and my goal with this sequence is ultimately a practical one.</p><p>Empty disagreement happens when there is no fundamental disagreement of fact, value, or meaning between two parties, but something in the situation causes them to start or continue a conflict regardless. This is usually related either to social status (when someone knows they&#x2019;re wrong but won&#x2019;t back down to avoid losing face), or to internal emotional state (when someone is caught up in the heat of the moment). In both cases, it is ideas from the prior posts of this sequence that are the key to a successful resolution.</p><p>Status-based conflicts are frequently best-solved by changing venue, usually to one with a smaller audience. In most cases people are happy to resolve the conflict themselves once doing so would no longer cost them status. Things become trickier if this isn&#x2019;t possible, or if the status issue is actually between the two people involved in the conflict. You can try to build enough trust to overcome the status issue, or compensate for it by making an unrelated concession, but ultimately you&#x2019;ll have to resolve the status issue to resolve the conflict.</p><p>Similarly, heat-of-the-moment conflicts are usually best solved by committing more strongly to the four attitudes I described in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3R59J4mDLihLrgwfk/a-practical-guide-to-conflict-resolution-attitude\">the first post on attitude</a>. Breathe deep, and aim for success instead of victory. Use humility to build the trust necessary to reach that point, and never lose sight of the fact that both sides are operating in good faith (mistakes in the heat of the moment are still fundamentally different from malice). If necessary, suggest taking a five-minute break to go to the washroom or get a drink of water; time away is often all that is really needed for people to cool down.</p><h3>Complex Disagreements</h3><p>As we&#x2019;ve gone through the types so far, we&#x2019;ve seen a couple of examples of complex disagreements masquerading as simpler forms of disagreement. This is typically how they show up in practice, since if the complexity is obvious the participants will break it apart themselves without thinking about it. The fact that instrumental values show up frequently in this way is also not a coincidence; the combination of a value with a fact to produce an instrumental value is one of the easiest signs of a complex disagreement that needs to be split up.</p><p>The other major sign of a complex disagreement is the use of the forms of propositional and predicate logic. Argument forms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens\">modus ponens</a> are how complex arguments get built up, and thus naturally how complex disagreements can be broken down. Of course, people rarely phrase their arguments in pure logical form, so you&#x2019;ll probably have to do some steelmanning along the way, but if you&#x2019;re lucky somebody will make their arguments in roughly the right shape.</p><p>As mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j2D2dcsAsK5zLKDup/a-practical-guide-to-conflict-resolution-comprehension\">the post on comprehension</a>, regular practice is the best way to build these skills. Even when an argument is really trivial, (for example &#x201C;A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut!&#x201D; while <a href=\"http://www.montypython.net/scripts/HG-cocoscene.php\">talking about the carrying capacity of swallows</a>) it can be worth breaking down. In its pure logical form, that example becomes something like:</p><ul><li>P1: If a bird weighs five ounces, it cannot carry a coconut.</li><li>P2: Swallows weigh five ounces.</li><li>C: Swallows cannot carry coconuts.</li></ul><p>Just like with instrumental values, we now have two different pieces (P1 and P2) where either could be the source of disagreement. By narrowing in on the root cause, or at least taking them one at a time, you&#x2019;ve made the conflict smaller and more focused. Once you&#x2019;ve gone down a few layers you&#x2019;ll usually end up either at a testable disagreement of fact or a shared terminal value, and will be able to resolve it appropriately. The goal with a complex disagreement is always to break it down and deal with the pieces, not to swallow it whole.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>When faced with a disagreement, I try to approach it the way I would approach a newly synthesized molecule - I know that it must be made of atoms, somehow, but I don&apos;t yet know which atoms, or in what structure. Every disagreement I have come across is made up of one or more of the atomic types in this post, stuck together (mostly) using the forms of propositional and predicate logic.</p><p>Typically, once you start peeling back the layers, you&apos;ll find that most parts of a disagreement aren&apos;t disagreements at all. Yes, you started out by arguing about X, but in fact X was a complex type, and three of its four component pieces were ones you actually agreed on. The underlying disagreement was about Y, which is either complex itself (break it down again!) or atomic. Wrapping it all up into a bullet-list algorithm, this is roughly how I approach conflict resolution in my real life:</p><ul><li>Use logical forms to break down a complex disagreement into simpler parts.</li><li>Discard the parts that are actually agreed upon. Tackle the remaining parts one at a time.</li><li>Repeat.</li><li>Once you have atomic disagreements and can&apos;t repeat:</li><ul><li>Use science and Bayesian statistics to resolve disagreements of fact.</li><li>Use clear definitions to resolve disagreements of meaning.</li><li>Use overriding values to try to avoid disagreements of terminal value (but watch out for values that are actually instrumental).</li></ul><li>If there are no atomic disagreements, resolve the empty conflict by building trust, addressing status issues, and cooling runaway emotions.</li></ul><p><em>I hope reading this sequence proves as helpful to you as writing it was for me. I want to once again thank the person who prompted me to write it, as well as all the other people who read early drafts and provided invaluable feedback. You make me better.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I spent the week prepping for finals. One is a year-long cumulative closed-book chemistry exam that I haven&apos;t had much time to practice for. I was worried about memorizing a few things:</p><ul><li>Periodic trends and exceptions</li><li>The form and application of approximately 100 workhorse equations and various forms of measurement (molarity vs. molality vs. mole fraction).</li><li>Equations that get used rarely in homework or on exercises, but might be used as &quot;gotchas&quot; on the test.</li><li>Some concepts that I found either confusing, or so simple that I didn&apos;t bother to remember them the first time.</li></ul><p>My anxiety wasn&apos;t just my ability to recall these ideas when prompted:</p><blockquote>&quot;What&apos;s the two-point form of the Clausius-Clapeyron Equation?&quot;</blockquote><blockquote>ln(P2 / P1) = - &#x394; Hvap/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)</blockquote><p>Nor was I unable to perform the calculations.</p><p>My real concern was that I had spent the year treating my chemistry textbook like a reference manual, a repository for concepts and equations that I could look up when needed. I just memorized the few bits I&apos;d need on any given quiz. Looking back at 1,000 pages of chemistry, I foresaw myself reviewing chapter 5 for a couple hours, but forgetting that review by the time I got to chapter 19.</p><p>The sheer volume of work that seemed to be involved in memorizing a textbook seemed unreasonable. I hate using Anki, and I spend far too much time in front of screens as it is.</p><p>So I decided to try something different - experimenting with the memory palace technique.</p><p>I perceive myself as having a poor visual imagination, but I&apos;ve been trying to practice improving it lately, with some success. Gwern points to expert opinion that visual thinking ability might be second only to IQ in terms of intellectual importance. My experience is that when I&apos;m using psychedelics, or deliberately practicing my visualization abilities, I do improve far beyond my perceived abilities. We&apos;re stuck with our IQ, but if it&apos;s possible to improve our visual thinking skills through practice in adulthood, that&apos;s important.</p><p>I want to describe my attempts and the outcome.</p><p><strong>First Room</strong></p><p>I tried this both with a single calculus textbook chapter, and my entire chemistry textbook. The results were similar but different. I&apos;m going to focus on the chemistry palace here.</p><p>I close my eyes and allow myself to picture nothing, or whatever random nonsense comes to mind. No attempt to control.</p><p>Then I invite the concept of a room into mind. I don&apos;t picture it clearly. There&apos;s a vague sense, though, of imagining a space of some kind. I can vaguely see fleeting shadowy walls. I don&apos;t need to get everything crystal clear, though.</p><p>I mentally label the room as the &quot;Ch. 14 room,&quot; or the &quot;rates room.&quot; That means doing lots of things to make the label stick. I speak the words in my head. I picture a banner with them printed on it hanging from the ceiling. Or if I can&apos;t see it clearly, I picture a banner-like thing and just <em>know</em> that it says &quot;rates room.&quot; I picture hourglasses sitting on furniture - the image comes to me much more easily than a banner with text.</p><p>I imagine the crucial equations sitting on columnar pedestals. Again, they are easier to picture for some reason. I make sure that I can visually see each piece of the equation. I imagine a label on the pedestal - one says &quot;t1/2&quot; for the half-life equations; the other says &quot;Integrated rate law,&quot; with an hourglass made out of two intertwined integration signs.</p><p>I look up a picture of Svante Arrhenius and picture him in the room. He takes on a life of his own. I can tell he&apos;s proud of his equation, which appears in bold letters at the back of the room, with a sort of curtain around it. He&apos;s the keeper of the room. It takes on a calm atmosphere here. He&apos;s also the doorman. I have to tell him how to calculate the overall reaction order in order to enter. But if <em>he knows</em> that <em>I know</em> how to do it, I don&apos;t have to explain it in as much detail. We have a psychic relationship.</p><p><strong>Second Room</strong></p><p>Moving backwards to Ch. 13, I once again imagine a new room, the Solutions Room. Standing there, I can still see the entrance to the first room - I can even picture some of the things inside, from a distance. I start populating the room with symbols, objects, equations, and the chemists they&apos;re named after. They are happy to explain things to me as many times as necessary.</p><p>Abstract concepts that the book presents in words, still images, or equations get visualized in new ways. Partial pressures become two beakers, one with yellow steam and the other with red steam emerging. They get mixed into a single beaker that now emits a mixture of yellow and red steam, somewhere in between the amounts that the yellow and red beaker emit on their own. Fran&#xE7;ois-Marie Raoult is standing by to demonstrate his law to me. There&apos;s a bottle of Coke with Henry&apos;s Law printed on it.</p><p>The solubility rules are accessible when I glance at the periodic table on the wall. Rather than seeing a list of rules, I see the individual elements, which take on a life of their own. The alkali metals, ammonium, and nitrate zoom around the room, not interested in talking to anybody, on their own adventure. The halogens are too cool to talk to anybody except silver, mercury, and lead, who are immensely popular. Silver had a falling out with acetate, who&apos;s a communist and not interested in money. Be sensitive! Chromate is a rich chick in an expensive chrome-hubbed car cruising around, looking for a boyfriend. Sulfur is bicurious, so she&apos;ll bond not only with the transition metals but with astatine, arsenic, bismuth, and lead.</p><p>I practice traveling back and forth between the first and second rooms. They stay remarkably stable. Unlike recalling flash cards or the textbook, when I&apos;m in my memory palace the ideas come almost unbidden. The elemental relationships I&apos;ve used to conceptualize the solubility rules come <em>bursting </em>out of the periodic table.</p><p><strong>Further rooms</strong></p><p>I continue this for 6 chapters over the course of several hours. I am shocked and delighted at how easy and pleasant it is both to create the memory palace and to access the memories stored there. Not everything goes in - just the bits that I tend to forget. If I&apos;m not sure about something, the famous chemists who populate the rooms will remind me, literally by talking me through their ideas.</p><p>The presence of the chemists is also helpful for keeping me focused. I suspect that my brain is recruiting my social motivation. If the only people in my environment are genius chemists who are delighted to keep me interested in chemistry, then why would I get distracted by the internet?</p><p>I find it deeply reassuring to stand in the Intermolecular Forces room and know that just by walking a few rooms over, I can get back to the Rates Room, where all the equations are stored. Perhaps I&apos;ve built a path through the mental mountains? The next day, it&apos;s pretty easy to get back to the memory palace, and everything is as I left it. I just have to close my eyes and wait for a moment to get back in.</p><p><strong>Concerns and questions</strong></p><p>I also did a memory palace for calculus. I did it day-of because I felt more confident about calculus, it wasn&apos;t a comprehensive exam, and it was open book. I&apos;ll describe it another time. Mostly, it helped me feel more confident that I understood the breadth of the material. I found it much more convenient to refer to the textbook when necessary.</p><p>But for tomorrow&apos;s, I&apos;m very glad that I now have a store of chemical facts in my memory palace. The anxiety that had been plaguing me this week has vanished. I&apos;m not certain that it will really help. But I do anticipate continuing to use this technique in the future. I think it helps not only my memory but my synthesis of learning.</p><p>For example, our chapter on Lewis Structures also introduces the topic of electronegativity and formal charge. Anyone who&apos;s taken first year gen chem knows they&apos;re related: any negative formal charge should go on the most electronegative atom.</p><p>But when I would stare at the electronegativity pages in the textbook, I would focus on the rules offered there: the range of EN difference that characterizes a covalent vs. ionic bond, the periodic trend in EN, and how to calculate net dipole moment. Likewise, in the formal charge section, I would focus on how to calculate the charge.</p><p>It took seeing Linus Pauling holding a symbol for electronegativity in one hand, and a symbol for formal charge in the other, to more deeply understand that these are not just two different calculations to do. They&apos;re deeply related ways of modeling how molecules are structured. They go together like yeast and flour.</p><p>I also see how much faster and more intuitively I think about both chemistry and calculus when I can visualize them. It&apos;s just no comparison. Trying to remember Raoult&apos;s Law by remembering a verbal description or picturing the equation is just no comparison to looking at those yellow and red steaming beakers. Similarly, it&apos;s so helpful to picture a 3D mountain range and see a tiny little yellow gradient vector surfing up and down it on the steepest slopes.</p><p><strong>Advice</strong></p><p>I&apos;m a true beginner here, so I don&apos;t want to make any grand claims about how to learn or how useful these techniques are. But I&apos;d give a few pointers so far:</p><ul><li>If you think you can&apos;t visualize, you might be wrong.</li><li>Start by just closing your eyes and allowing your brain to produce images without trying to control them. It seems important to have a relaxed, accepting attitude toward my own brain&apos;s way of visualizing.</li><li>The way to add control is to take a gentle, experimental attitude. Go with what&apos;s easy. Let yourself be surprised by what&apos;s do-able and what&apos;s useful. Is it hard to picture letters on a banner? Try visualizing Isaac Newton and ask him to say the thing you&apos;re trying to remember. Maybe you don&apos;t even need to do that - maybe it&apos;s enough to picture a vague stripe in the sky that you <em>just know </em>is a banner, and you <em>just know</em> has the words &quot;rate room&quot; printed on it.</li><li>It takes a while to navigate the rooms and get the information you need, so this might need refinement or practice if you&apos;ve got to remember things quickly.</li></ul>",

Please tear it apart!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I looked at GPT-2 last year, I thought: \"Huh, when I look at my own thought process... I could summarize most of what I'm doing as: 'predict the next thing I'd say using crude concept association, and then say it.'\"</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FoJSa8mgLPT83g9e8/jeff-hawkins-on-neuromorphic-agi-within-20-years\">Jeff Hawkins says</a> \"Every part of the neocortex is running the same algorithm\", and it's looking like maybe brains aren't doing that complicated a set of things.</p><p>Am I just GPT-2?</p><p>This was an obvious question to ask, but I haven't seen anyone write it up the question in detail.</p><p>I asked around. One mathematician friend said \"I agree most people are doing GPT-style thinking where they regurgitate and recombine concepts from their neighbors. But, you can't get civilization from <i>just</i> that. Some people need to have model-based thinking.\"</p><p>Another mathematician friend agreed and added: \"Young math students who try to prove theorems often do it GPT-style &nbsp;– they ramble their way through a bunch of math buzzwords and try to assemble them without understanding the structure of how they fit together. But, actual math proofs <i>require</i> clear understanding. You can't just 'predict the next word'\"</p><p>I agree there is something additional going on here that gets you to formal math proofs and building skyscrapers. But... I don't think it's all that <i>much</i> more.</p><p>This post has three parts:</p><ul><li>Lay out the cognitive algorithm I personally seem to be following</li><li>Outline how I think that algorithm developed</li><li>Work through some examples of how I do \"advanced thinking\" (i.e. the sort of thinking that might literally advance the sum of human knowledge), and doublecheck if there are any surprising elements</li></ul><h1>My algorithm, as I understand it</h1><p>Even when I'm developing novel concepts, or thinking through effortful procedures, most of my thinking following the same basic algorithm of:</p><p><strong>A. Find the Next \"Good Enough\" Thought</strong></p><ol><li>My subconscious finds some nearby concepts that are associated with my previous thought-chunk</li><li>If a <i>\"good enough\" </i>thought appears, think that thought, and then repeat. (\"good enough\" means \"I feel optimistic about the next thought in the chain leading somewhere useful\")</li><li>If a <i>\"not obviously good enough\"</i> thought appears, check the next few associated concepts and see if they're good enough.</li><li>If none of the nearby concepts seem good enough, either give up and switch topics, or conduct an <i>effortful search. </i>This usually involves feeling stuck for awhile, spending willpower or getting a headache. Eventually I either:<ul><li>a) find a good enough concept for my next thought, and proceed</li><li>b) find a better search algorithm. (Still basically \"find a good enough concept\", except it's not actually going to help me directly. Instead, I'll think something like \"make a list of possibly hypotheses\", or \"search on google\", or \"ask my friend who knows about X\", and then begin doing that.)</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>B. Check for Badness</strong></p><ul><li>While doing all this, there's a followup processing that's periodically checking \"was a recent thought-chunk somehow bad?\".<ul><li>Is this sloppy thinking that a respected rationalist would give me a disapproving look for?</li><li>Is this thoughtcrime that my tribe punish me for thinking?</li><li>Does it \"smell bad\" somehow, such that if I built a whole series of concepts off of this next thought-chunk, the result would be a flimsy construction? (i.e. bad code smell)</li></ul></li><li>If the thought seems maybe-bad, start associating towards concepts that help crystalize whether it's bad, or fix the badness</li></ul><p>There's a few other things going on – I'm storing concepts in working memory, and sometimes in <i>mood, </i>which shape which other concepts are easily accessible. I'm sometimes using concepts that initiate <i>chains</i>, where I'll think \"oh, I'm supposed to do algebra here. What's the first step of algebra?\" and then the first step associates to the second step. But these parts seem like something I wouldn't be too surprised if GPT-2 developed on its own, or some equivalent version of.</p><p>Almost all of that condenses down to \"find nearby associated concepts\" and \"direct my attention to more distant associated concepts.\"&nbsp;</p><p>(My understanding of this is based on the <a href=\"http://bewelltuned.com/tune_your_cognitive_strategies\">Tuning Your Cognitive Algorithms</a> exercise, where you solve problems mindfully, paying lots of attention to what your brain seems to be doing on the sub-second timescale)</p><h2>How far removed from that is GPT-2?</h2><p>First, I'm not making any claims about the exact structuring of the learning algorithm. My understanding is that there's a few different neural network architectures that are more optimal for different kinds of processing (i.e. convolutional nets for image processing).&nbsp;</p><p>Some people have responded to my \"what if all thought boils down to simple associations?\" questioning with \"but, model based learning!\". I agree that model based learning is a thing, but it's not obvious to me that GPT-2 doesn't have it, at least to some degree.</p><p>Second, a key thing GPT-2 is missing is the \"check for badness\" aspect. After predicting a word, AFAIK there's nothing that later punishes GPT-2 for thinking sloppily, or rewards it for doing something particularly great, which means it can't learn things like \"You're supposed to generate multiple hypotheses before getting attached to the first one\" and then deliberately apply them.&nbsp;</p><p>It probably also takes longer to learn things. (I don't actually know for sure how either GPT-2 or other leading language generators are rewarded. Has anyone done anything like \"Train a neural net on Reddit, where it's somehow separately rewarded for predicting the next word, and also for predicting how much karma a cluster of words will get, and somehow propagating that back into the language generation?\")</p><h1>From Toddlers to Software Architects</h1><p>How might the algorithm I described above develop in humans?</p><p><strong>Step 1: Toddlers and Stoves</strong></p><p>Toddlers have little longterm planning. If they see a bright red stove, they might think \"shiny object!\" and their little GPT processes think \"what are some things that might come next?\" and one of them is \"touch the stove\" and one of them is \"look at it intently\" and a third is \"shrug and wander off\". They pick \"touch the stove\" and then <i>OUCH.</i></p><p>After a few iterations, they reach a point where, when they hypothesize \"maybe the next action should be 'touch the stove'\", they get a little flash of \"but, two steps later, it will hurt, and that will be bad.\"</p><p>One way to conceive of this is \"GPT-style, but you predict two words ahead instead of one.\"</p><p>But I don't think that's right. I think it's more like: \"GPT style, but thinking certain thoughts brings up associations, and some associations just directly change the likely next actions. i.e. you think \"touch the stove!\" and then you think \"ow!\" and then, \"ow\" is treated as an incorrect end to the sentence of the narrative you're constructing. So you don't do the \"touch stove\" action.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually this is cached into the System 1 GPT system such that \"touch the stove\" has a low predictive weight of \"thing you might do\", and it doesn't even come up any more.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Toddlers and Mom Yelling</strong></p><p>The first time Billy the Toddler came upon a hot stove, he reached out to touch it, and beforehand, Mom yelled \"Billy don't touch that!\"</p><p>And, possibly, Billy touched it anyway. And then he learned \"ow!\" and also learned that \"Mom yells\" is something that correlates with \"ow!\", which propagates back into his model of what sort of actions are good next-actions-to-take.</p><p>Or, previously, perhaps Billy had done some less immediately painful thing – perhaps walking into the street. Mom yells at him. He ignores her. A nearby car slows down, and doesn't hit him, so he doesn't learn \"street ==&gt; cars ==&gt; bad\". <i>But</i>, his Mom then runs and grabs him and pulls him away from the street, which is kinda painful. So he does gain the \"Mom yelling ==&gt; bad\" association (as well as the \"Walk into street\" ==&gt; \"Mom Yelling\" association).</p><p>Eventually Mom Yelling is treated as a failure state in the \"predict which action I should take next\" function.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Internalized Mom Yelling</strong></p><p>A couple years later, Billy periodically comes across novel situations – perhaps a wild animal in his backyard. This might remind him of similar situations where Mom Yelled in the past. By now, Billy doesn't need to hear Mom yell at him directly, he's able to think \"Cool situation! Take Action\" ==&gt; \"Hmm, Mom may yell at me later\" ==&gt; \"Failure state\" ==&gt; \"Okay, back up a step, take a different action.\"</p><p>And eventually this voice gets internalized as some kind of conscience/morality/guide, which doesn't even need to be physically present or temporally proximate to be relevant.&nbsp;</p><p>You <i>could</i> model this as \"GPT style thinking, but predicting multiple steps down the line instead of just one or two.\" But, I think this doesn't match my internal experience. It's often <i>many </i>steps down the line that a bad thing would happen to me, that I need to avoid. More steps than I could feasibly be modeling.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the direct-association...</p><ul><li>Previous chunk: \"notice dangerous situation\"</li><li>Next chunk: \"association with mom yelling\" (evaluates to \"low predicted reward\")</li></ul><p>...is simpler to execute than:</p><ul><li>Previous chunk: \"notice dangerous situation\"</li><li>Next chunk 1: \"go play in dangerous situation\"</li><li>Next chunks 2 - 10: Do a bunch of steps in the dangerous situation\"</li><li>Chunk N: Mom eventually finds out and yells (evaluates to \"low predicted reward\")</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Internalized Punishment and Reward for Types of Cognition</strong></p><p>Eventually Billy gains some internalized concept of \"X is bad\", which can be directly associated with various inputs.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Social Shame</i></p><p>For me, Doing X Would be Bad is often social shaped. For example, I often go to write some crappy code by randomly cobbling some things together. And then I get a visceral image of my coworkers complaining at me, saying \"Ray! Use your brain! What would <i>good</i> code look like here?\" and then I say \"sigh... fine\", and then I boot up the associations about what good code looks like and how to construct it.</p><p>Or, I'm debugging, and randomly changing things until it works or adding console.log statements to hope they'll reveal something obvious. And then my shoulder-angel-coworker pops up and says \"Man, Ray, that is not how to debug code. Think!\" and then I pull up my \"what does actually debugging for real look like?\" associations, and see what next-actions they pull up for me to consider, and then I do one of those.</p><p>(In this case, next-action-chunks include things like \"make a list of what I know to be true about the code\" and \"check what the inputs to this function are and where they came from\", which at my current skill level feel like atomic actions.)</p><p><i>Internalized Taste&nbsp;</i></p><p>A different way some people work (including myself in some domains) is less \"social\" and more \"aesthetic.\" Good coders develop \"bad code smell\", and (I'd guess in the case of debugging) \"bad habits smell\", where if they find themselves debugging by randomly changing things, they think \"obviously this is stupid and inefficient\", and then seek out the associated next-actions that are more helpful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 4: Strengthened \"Good\" Habits</strong></p><p>Eventually, you streamline the steps of \"notice a problem\" =&gt; \"consider a bad strategy to solve the problem\" =&gt; \"feel bad\" =&gt; \"find a good thing to do\" =&gt; \"do that\", and go directly to \"have a problem\" =&gt; \"use a good solution to the problem\".&nbsp;</p><p>And this gets distilled into increasingly streamlined chunks, until master-level artisans do lots of sophisticated techniques that get bucketed into a single action.</p><h1>But, really, what about deep planning and models and creativity?</h1><p>As mentioned earlier, I do some complicated thought via chains-of-association. For example:</p><ul><li>Notice that I've been focusing on only one hypothesis</li><li>Remember that I should be looking for alternate hypotheses</li><li>Think \"hmm, how do I get more hypotheses?\"</li><li>Start listing out half-remembered hypotheses that vaguely feel connected to the situation.</li><li>Realize that listing random half-remembered hypotheses isn't a very good strategy</li><li>Remember that a better strategy might be to make a list of all the facts I know about the phenomenon I'm investigating (without exactly remembering why I believe this)</li><li>Make that list of facts (using either my working memory, or augmented memory like a notebook)</li><li>For each relevant fact, ask myself \"what must be true given this fact?\" (\"ah\", I now think. \"<i>This </i>is why it's useful to list out true facts. I can then conduct a search for other dependent facts, which builds up a useful web of associations\")</li><li>Use the list of facts and consequences to generate a new, more focused set of hypotheses</li></ul><p>This <i>does</i> involve a mixture of System 1 and System 2 thinking (where system 2 involves slower, more laborious use of working memory and considering different options). But it's still mostly composed a bunch of atomic concepts.</p><p>Sarah Constantin's <a href=\"https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/FbQ9Y9pBif5xZ7w2f/distinctions-in-types-of-thought\">Distinctions in Types of Thought</a> explores the possibility that deep neural nets basically have the \"effortless System 1\" type thinking, without being good at the slower, deliberate System 2 style thinking. I wouldn't be that surprised if GPT-2 was \"only\" a System 1. But I also wouldn't be that surprised if it naturally developed a System 2 when scaled up, and given more training. I also wouldn't be that surprised if it turned out not to <i>need</i> a System 2.</p><h2>What's happening in System 2 thought?&nbsp;</h2><p>The genre of this post is now going to abruptly switch to \"Raemon narrates in realtime his thought process, as he tries to doublecheck what actually is going on in his brain.\"</p><p>Okay, I want to demonstrate System 2 thought. What are some examples of System 2 thought?</p><p>(Spins gears for a few minutes, unproductively)</p><p>Suddenly I remember \"Ah, the bat/baseball problem is a classic System 2 problem.\" If I'm asked: \"A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?”, what actually is going on in my head?</p><p>First, I think \"Obviously the answer is '10c'\"</p><p>Then, I think \"Wait. no I know this problem, I think the answer is 5c\" (determined via memory). But, I'm writing a blogpost right now where I'm trying to articulate what System 2 thought is like, and it would be helpful to have a real example. What if I rearranged the numbers in the problem and force myself to solve it again?</p><p><strong>New Problem: </strong>\"A bat and a ball cost $2.25 in total. The bat costs $2.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?”</p><p>Great. Now the obvious answer is 25c, and that's probably wrong. Okay, how do I actually solve this? Okay, boot up my laborious arithmetic brain.</p><p>My first impulse is to subtract $2.00... wait that's literally the first thing my brain did.</p><p>Okay, what kind of math <i>is</i> this?</p><p>It's algebra I think?</p><p>X + Y = 2.25</p><p>X + (X + 2) = 2.25</p><p>2X + 2 = 2.25</p><p>X + 1 = 1.125</p><p>X = &nbsp;.125</p><p>Is that right? I think so. I don't actually care since the goal here was to doublecheck what my internal thought process is like, not get a right answer.</p><p>I notice that once I remembered to Do Actual Math, I mostly used quick associations rather than anything effortful, which feels more GPT-2 style. I think in elementary school those steps would have each been harder.</p><p>The more interesting part here was not the \"how to solve the bat/baseball\" part, but how to find an actual good example of System 2 thinking part. <i>That</i> felt quite effortful. I didn't have any immediate associations, so I was conducting a <i>search</i>, and moreover the search process wasn't very effective. (I think much of advanced cognition, and the Tuning Your Cognitive Algorithms process, is about figuring out what techniques enable you to more effectively search when you don't have an obvious search algorithm)</p><h2>What Other Kinds of Thought Are There?</h2><p>I notice this whole section is downstream of a <i>feeling</i>, where I have noticed that I haven't <i>actually </i>tried to comprehensively answer \"is all of my thought processes explainable via predict-the-next-thing-then-do-it?\". I have a nagging sense of \"if I post this, there's a good chance someone will either poke a hole in it, or poke a hole in my generating thought process. Mama Rationalist is going to yell at me.\"</p><p>An obvious thing to do here is list out the types of advanced thinking I do, and then check how each one actually works by actually doing it.</p><p>I just did \"elementary school math.\" What are some others?</p><p><strong>1. Creatively combine existing concepts</strong></p><p>I think this is how most novel ideas form. I think GPT-2 does very basic versions of this, but I haven't seen it do anything especially impressive.</p><p>One concrete algorithm I run is: \"put two non-associated words next to each other, and see how they compile.\" An example of an upcoming blogpost generated this way is \"Integrity Debt\", which was born by literally taking the phrase \"Technical Debt\", swapping in \"Integrity\", and then checking \"what does this concept mean, and is it useful?\"</p><p>More often, I do a less intentional, fuzzier version of this where multiple concepts or sensory experiences get meshed together in my mind. Abram recounts a similar experience in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/riyvpus8x9sXa3W57/track-back-meditation\">Track Back Meditation</a></p><blockquote><p>At one point a couple of years ago, I noticed that I was using a particular visual analogy to think about something, which didn't seem like a very good analogy for what I was thinking about. I don't recall the example, but, let's say I was using a mental image of trees when thinking about matrix operations. I got annoyed at the useless imaginary trees, and wondered why I was imagining them. Then, I noticed that I was physically looking at a tree! This was fairly surprising to me. Some of the surprise was that I took a random object in my visual field to use for thinking about something unrelated, but more of the surprise was that I didn't immediately know this to be the case, even when I wondered why I was imagining trees.</p><p>After I noticed this once, I started to notice it again and again: objects from my visual field end up in my imagination, and I often try to use them as visual analogies whether they're appropriate or not. It quickly became a familiar, rather than surprising, event. More interestingly, though, after a while it started to seem like a <i>conscious</i> event, rather than an automatic and uncontrollable one: I've become aware of the whole process from start to finish, and can intervene at any point if I wish.</p></blockquote><p><strong>2. Figure out what do do, for a problem where </strong><i><strong>none</strong></i><strong> of my existing associations are relevant enough to help solve it.</strong></p><p>This is just actually pretty hard. Even Newton had to get hit on the head with the apple. Archimedes had to sit in the bathtub. Most human thought just isn't very original and incrementally advances using known associations.</p><p>I think most of the \"good thought strategy\" here involves figuring out efficient ways of exposing yourself to new concepts that might help. (This includes scholarship, getting a wider variety of life experience, and actually remembering to take relaxing baths from time to time)</p><p>I think there is a <i>teeny</i> fraction of this that looks like actually babbling entirely novel things at random (sometimes in a semi-directed fashion), and then seeing if they point in a useful direction. This is hard because <a href=\"https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/pT48swb8LoPowiAzR/everyday-lessons-from-high-dimensional-optimization\">life is high dimensional</a>. Anyone who actually succeeds at this probably had to first develop a sense of taste that is capable of processing lots of details and get at least a rough sense of whether a sniff of an idea is promising.</p><p><strong>3. Do advanced math that is on the edge of my current skills, where every step is novel.</strong></p><p>I think this mostly involves repeatedly querying \"what are the actual steps here?\", and then applying some effortful directed search to remember the steps.</p><p>(I notice my shoulder Mathematician Friend just said \"THAT'S NOT WHAT REAL MATH IS. REAL MATH IS BEAUTIFUL AND INVOLVES UNDERSTANDING CONCEPTS DEEPLY OR SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING IDK MY SHOULDER MATHEMATICIAN ISN'T VERY HIGH RESOLUTION\")</p><p>Speaking of which...</p><p><strong>4. Mulling over concepts until I understand them deeply, have an epiphany, and experience a 'click'.</strong></p><p>There's a particular sensation where I finally map out all the edges of a fuzzy concept, and then have a delightful moment when I realize I fully understand it. Prior to this, I have a distinctively uncomfortable feeling, like I'm in a murky swamp and I don't know how to get out.</p><p>I think this is the process by which a complicated, multi-chunk concept gets distilled into a single chunk, allowing it to take up less working memory.</p><p><strong>5. Procedural Knowledge (i.e. Riding Bicycles)</strong></p><p>I think this is actually mostly the same as #4, but the concepts are often differently shaped – physical awareness, emotional attunement, etc. It doesn't come with the same particular \"click\" qualia that intellectual concepts have for me, but there is often a \"suddenly this is easy and feels effortless\" feeling.</p><h1>How Do <i>You</i> Think?</h1><p>So those are all the ways that I think, that I can easily remember. How do you do <i>your</i> thinking? Are there any pieces of it that I missed here? (I'm wondering how much variety there is in how people think, or experience thought, as well as whether I missed some of my own thinking-types)</p><p><strong>Implications for AI</strong></p><p>My actual motivation here was to get a sense of \"<i>Are</i> there any major roadblocks for human level intelligence, or do we basically have all the pieces?\" (While I wrote this post, a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zuAmKWxwADsW2H3u6/if-ai-is-based-on-gpt-how-to-ensure-its-safety\">couple</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wc8su8zASfA5xy6Qh/image-gpt\">other</a> posts came out that seemed to be exploring the same question)</p><p>My current sense is that all the most advanced thinking I do is made of simple parts, and it seems like most of those parts roughly correspond to facets of modern ML research. This wouldn't mean AGI is right around the corner – my understanding is that when you zoom into the details there's a fair amount of finicky bits. Many of the most interesting bits aren't using the same architecture, and integrating them into some kind of cohesive whole is a huge, multi-step project.&nbsp;</p><p>But, it seems like most of the remaining work is more like \"keep plugging away at known problems, improve our ability to efficiently process large amounts of information, and incrementally improve our ability to learn in general ways from smaller bits of information\".</p><p>This post doesn't really attempt to make the \"AGI is near\" case, because I'm not actually an ML researcher nor even a competent hobbyist. I think seriously investigating that is another post, written by someone who's been paying much closer attention than me.</p><p>For the immediate future, I'm interested in various LW contributors answering the question \"How do you think you think, and why do you think you think that way?\"</p></body></html>",

week before. I expect next week’s to be worse, with the positive test rate going higher again. The death rate likely starts moving higher again several weeks after that, unless this new wave is sufficiently younger or better cared for to compensate. Which is possible, but doubtful that will hold up.</p>\n<h3>Houston, and Phoenix and Miami, We Have a Problem</h3>\n<p>The surge in cases is concentrated in the South plus a few Western states. There are some other Western states surging as well, but from very low base rates. Arizona had a much higher base rate than the other surging Western states combined. Here are the states that have +40% or bigger percentage increases this past week, all of which set new highs this week except for Louisiana:</p>\n<p>Oklahoma +111%</p>\n<p>Montana +92%</p>\n<p>Hawaii +84%</p>\n<p>Florida +78%</p>\n<p>Wyoming +78%</p>\n<p>Oregon +75%</p>\n<p>Alabama +72%</p>\n<p>Louisiana +59%</p>\n<p>South Carolina +54%</p>\n<p>West Virginia +45%</p>\n<p>Arizona +45%</p>\n<p>Texas +44%</p>\n<p>Tennessee +40%</p>\n<p>A large part of the United States has a very large, very rapidly growing problem. There seems to be no will to do anything about it.</p>\n<p>If you live in any Southern state, or any of the Western states on this list, and you are not currently locked down of your own initiative, I would prepare to lock yourself down or take an extended vacation.</p>\n<p>California is of particular interest to many of my readers. It was up 13% and hit a new high, but California is a gigantic state. Check your particular area to see how worried you should be. Don’t rely on state data. My most popular local area is presumably Alameda County, where things do seem to be gradually getting worse rather than better.</p>\n<p>This graph also seems worth including…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eau_nIoXkAEK27s?format=png&amp;name=large\" /></p>\n<h3>And Also There’s That Little Event In Tulsa, Oklahoma</h3>\n<p>I try very, very hard to keep away from politics of all kinds on this blog. This should be a place to get away from politics.</p>\n<p>And I hope this statement is not necessary for anyone reading this.</p>\n<p>I need to make this statement anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Unless you <em>want</em> to get Covid-19, </strong><strong>please please do not attend Trump’s rally in Tulsa.</strong></p>\n<p>This has nothing to do with politics. Viruses don’t care about politics. Unless you have antibodies to this virus, or are fine being infected and can self-quarantine afterwards so you infect no one else, <em>it is beyond irresponsible to attend this or any other similar event. </em></p>\n<p>This is not like the protests. The protests are outdoor events where you can plausibly distance and wear a mask.</p>\n<p>This is going to be a super spreader event. It is indoors. It is probably going to be packed. Even if it’s half empty, that’s still packed enough. Wearing a mask will likely get you scorn or worse. It will last more than an hour. It will be another doubling in actual infections <em>after</em> the test results we are seeing here.</p>\n<p>If you attend Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, there is a <em>very high probability</em> you will become infected with Covid-19. At least double digits. Depending on conditions, a 50%+ infection rate would not be that surprising.</p>\n<p>Go if and only if you have <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/variolation-may-cut-covid19-deaths-3-30x.html\">want to be one of Robin Hanson’s heroes and variolate</a>, with a plan to fully self-quarantine for several weeks afterwards.</p>\n<p>That is all the <em>way too nice </em>way of putting it. Should the worst happen, it is not obvious to me that associated life insurance policies should pay out.</p>\n<p>The governor of Nebraska <a href=\"https://t.co/jKi68KbIni?amp=1\">is actively retaliating</a> against localities that require masks.</p>\n<p>It would be stunning that this is happening, except of course that it isn’t.</p>\n<h3>Dost Thou Protest Too Much?</h3>\n<p>I have seen <a href=\"https://cheps.sdsu.edu/docs/CHEPS-Working-Paper-BLM-COVID19-June-12-2020.pdf\">at least one academic</a> claim that the primary effects of the protests, in terms of protesters being infected at protests, were more than offset by people not in the protests choosing to stay home to avoid the protests and any potentially dangerous resulting situations.</p>\n<p>I am not sure I <em>buy </em>that exactly. But I do buy that the direct effects were small, and that there was a <em>short run </em>effect the other way that could have cancelled them out for a week or maybe two.</p>\n<p>In the end, even the largest protests ever seen are not all that many people protesting all that often. When we look at places things are getting worse versus better, and compare that to where the protests are, we don’t see anything. With the huge divergences by region that this does not explain, the primary effects can’t be that important. Score yet another one for the great outdoors.</p>\n<p>That does not mean going to a protest, even a quiet and peaceful one, is safe. It isn’t. As I said last time, no matter what else I believe in, I believe in physics. The key is that it isn’t <em>that </em>unsafe. This isn’t skydiving or Russian roulette. It’s more like driving was fifty years ago, a thing one could reasonably consider necessary and well worth it, but that’s actually crazy dangerous compared to the other things one does when you run the numbers.</p>\n<p>Then there are the secondary effects. How much of this surge is due to people reacting to the protests? How much is relaxed official rules? How much is people being stir crazy and having waited as long as they could? It’s impossible to know for sure. To me, the timing here seems very consistent with the protests causing a widespread loss of credibility in public health and a loss of a sense of joint sacrifice and fairness. With the effect especially concentrated where both were already fraying. This then leads to more activity when combined with the other factors, and we are now seeing the first results of that. Nothing I’m seeing written or expressed seems to provide evidence against this being a big factor.</p>\n<h3>Pay No Attention to the Mysterious Deaths Behind the Curtain</h3>\n<p>I don’t have the link I was given, which I didn’t have verification on in any case, but this seems important enough and plausible enough to share anyway.</p>\n<p>There is something in the United States called a ‘mysterious death.’ This is an official classification, where they conclude that they do not know cause of death. Normally, I was informed, there are about 2000 of these each week. That number has been, I was told, creeping upward, and is now 4000, concentrated in places that have political motivations to put out lower death numbers in order to reopen.</p>\n<p>This would be in line with the multiple reports by epidemiologists of being fired for refusing to cook the books, again so that reopening criteria could be met.</p>\n<p>It is all too on the nose by half, but this is 2020, so that only makes it more plausible.</p>\n<p>As they say, huge if true. If anyone can confirm or discredit this, please do so in the comments.</p>\n<p>If it’s true, and American numbers in many areas are becoming increasingly fraudulent, that is important to know on many levels.</p>\n<h3>The Green Zone</h3>\n<p>Here in New York, we’re going to be all right. It’s time to make our way back into the world.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, I visited several towns in Westchester, to scout places I might want to move if we decide not to return to New York City but want fast access to the best place on Earth. We saw Dobbs Ferry, Irvington, Tarrytown, Bronxville and Scarsdale.</p>\n<p>I don’t think we saw <em>a single adult </em>not wearing a mask.</p>\n<p>Every store, without exception, was very clear it required a mask for entry.</p>\n<p>We did not see <em>a single adult </em>not observing reasonable social distancing.</p>\n<p>Some children were playing ball in the parks. That was it.</p>\n<p>And life was good. Not as good as before. But good.</p>\n<p>Exactly like here in Warwick.</p>\n<p>Our first romantic dinner out in months is planned for next week.</p>\n<p>The rest of you might be in trouble.</p>\n<p>Around here, we’re going to be all right. We won. We’ve beaten this thing.</p>\n<p>If you’re not doing as well wherever you are, perhaps you’d like to join us?</p>\n<h3>Dreams of a Community</h3>\n<p>Friends are one of the best things in life. I am blessed with many across the land. It is not the same as having them next door and over for lunch.</p>\n<p>The kids need friends too.</p>\n<p>If we know each other and get along, chances are I’d love to have you as a neighbor. If possible, a very close one. Exact location matters. Potentially, I’d even want to consider getting a giant house with enough room for everyone.</p>\n<p>Alas, coordination is hard. People talk the talk but rarely walk the walk. Everyone has particular needs and timing and ties. And <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/\">the one time coordination did end up taking place</a> was, in my opinion, a mistake. It is certainly not a place I could live.</p>\n<p>For at least the next few months, we’re in Warwick, New York. It’s more isolated from the city than I’d like, but it seems to be what one calls Best of Breed for a cheap, walkable small town in the greater New York area, if you don’t mind the lack of a train stop. We might stay, especially if others would join us.</p>\n<p>Right now we’re also considering Manhattan, either Upper West Side, Chelsea or Stuyvesant Town, or Westchester, where we’d likely either choose a river town (probably Irvington, Tarrytown or Dobbs Ferry) or join one of our friends in Bronxville or Scarsdale.</p>\n<p>In theory we’d be open to other areas with good access to New York City.</p>\n<p>Coordination is always a long shot. It’s still a long shot worth checking. If you would plausibly join me in one or more of these locations, please let me know. We’ll do what’s best for us, and hope others follow.

    "htmlBody": "<p>Alignment Newsletter is a weekly publication with recent content relevant to AI alignment around the world</p><h1>HIGHLIGHTS </h1><p><strong><a href=\"https://alignmentforum.org/posts/ZyWyAJbedvEgRT2uF/inaccessible-information\">Inaccessible information</a></strong> <em>(Paul Christiano)</em> (summarized by Rohin): One way to think about the problem of AI alignment is that we only know how to train models on information that is <em>accessible</em> to us, but we want models that leverage <em>inaccessible</em> information.</p><p>Information is accessible if it can be checked directly, or if an ML model would successfully transfer to provide the information when trained on some other accessible information. (An example of the latter would be if we trained a system to predict what happens in a day, and it successfully transfers to predicting what happens in a month.) Otherwise, the information is inaccessible: for example, &#x201C;what Alice is thinking&#x201D; is (at least currently) inaccessible, while &#x201C;what Alice will say&#x201D; is accessible. The post has several other examples.</p><p>Note that while an ML model may not directly say exactly what Alice is thinking, if we train it to predict what Alice will say, it will probably have some internal model of what Alice is thinking, since that is useful for predicting what Alice will say. It is nonetheless inaccessible because there&#x2019;s no obvious way of extracting this information from the model. While we could train the model to also output &#x201C;what Alice is thinking&#x201D;, this would have to be training for &#x201C;a consistent and plausible answer to what Alice is thinking&#x201D;, since we don&#x2019;t have the ground truth answer. This could incentivize bad policies that figure out what we would most believe, rather than reporting the truth.</p><p>The argument for risk is then as follows: we care about inaccessible information (e.g. we care about what people <em>actually</em> experience, rather than what they <em>say</em> they experience) but can&#x2019;t easily make AI systems that optimize for it. However, AI systems will be able to infer and use inaccessible information, and would outcompete ones that don&#x2019;t. AI systems will be able to plan using such inaccessible information for at least some goals. Then, the AI systems that plan using the inaccessible information could eventually control most resources. Key quote: &#x201C;The key asymmetry working against us is that optimizing flourishing appears to require a particular quantity to be accessible, while danger just requires anything to be accessible.&#x201D;</p><p>The post then goes on to list some possible angles of attack on this problem. Iterated amplification can be thought of as addressing gaps in speed, size, experience, algorithmic sophistication etc. between the agents we train and ourselves, which can limit what inaccessible information our agents can have that we won&#x2019;t. However, it seems likely that amplification will eventually run up against some inaccessible information that will never be produced. As a result, this could be a &#x201C;hard core&#x201D; of alignment.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think the idea of inaccessible information is an important one, but it&#x2019;s one that feels deceptively hard to reason about. For example, I often think about solving alignment by approximating &#x201C;what a human would say after thinking for a long time&#x201D;; this is effectively a claim that human reasoning transfers well when iterated over long periods of time, and &#x201C;what a human would say&#x201D; is at least somewhat accessible. Regardless, it seems reasonably likely that AI systems will inherit the same property of transferability that I attribute to human reasoning, in which case the argument for risk applies primarily because the AI system might apply its reasoning towards a different goal than the ones we care about, which leads us back to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment\">intent alignment</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/b6dc636f6a1b/alignment-newsletter-33\">AN #33</a></strong>) formulation.</p><p>This <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/A9vvxguZMytsN3ze9/reply-to-paul-christiano-s-inaccessible-information\">response</a></strong> views this post as a fairly general argument against black box optimization, where we only look at input-output behavior, as then we can&#x2019;t use inaccessible information. It suggests that we need to understand how the AI system works, rather than relying on search, to avoid these problems.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wTKjRFeSjKLDSWyww/possible-takeaways-from-the-coronavirus-pandemic-for-slow-ai\">Possible takeaways from the coronavirus pandemic for slow AI takeoff</a></strong> <em>(Victoria Krakovna)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of a large risk that humanity faced. What lessons can we learn for AI alignment? This post argues that the pandemic is an example of the sort of situation we can expect in a slow takeoff scenario, since we had the opportunity to learn from experience, act on warning signs, and reach a timely consensus that there is a serious problem. However, while we could have learned from previous epidemics like SARS, we failed to generalize the lessons from SARS. Despite warning signs of a pandemic in February, many countries wasted a month when they could have been stocking up on PPE and testing capacity. We had no consensus that COVID-19 was a problem, with articles dismissing it as no worse than the flu as late as March.</p><p>All of these problems could also happen with slow takeoff: we may fail to generalize from narrow AI systems to more general AI systems; we might not act on warning signs; and we may not believe that powerful AI is on the horizon until it is too late. The conclusion is &#x201C;unless more competent institutions are in place by the time general AI arrives, it is not clear to me that slow takeoff would be much safer than fast takeoff&#x201D;.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> While I agree that the COVID response was worse than it could have been, I think there are several important disanalogies between the COVID-19 pandemic and a soft takeoff scenario, which I elaborate on in <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wTKjRFeSjKLDSWyww/possible-takeaways-from-the-coronavirus-pandemic-for-slow-ai?commentId=pKNQ9oq72HFS2JrdH\">this comment</a></strong>. First, with COVID there were many novel problems, which I don&#x2019;t expect with AI. Second, I expect a longer time period over which decisions can be made for AI alignment. Finally, with AI alignment, we have the option of preventing problems from ever arising, which is not really an option with pandemics. See also <strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EgdHK523ZM4zPiX5q/coronavirus-as-a-test-run-for-x-risks#Implications_for_X_risks\">this post</a></strong>.</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>PROBLEMS </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2020/06/15/steven-pinker-and-stuart-russell-on-the-foundations-benefits-and-possible-existential-risk-of-ai/\">Steven Pinker and Stuart Russell on the Foundations, Benefits, and Possible Existential Threat of AI</a></strong> <em>(Lucas Perry, Steven Pinker and Stuart Russell)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Despite their disagreements on AI risk, Stuart and Steven agree on quite a lot. They both see the development of AI as depending on many historical ideas. They are both particularly critical of the idea that we can get general intelligence by simply scaling up existing deep learning models, citing the need for reasoning, symbol manipulation, and few-shot learning, which current models mostly don&#x2019;t do. They both predict that we probably won&#x2019;t go extinct from superintelligent AI, at least in part because we&#x2019;ll notice and fix any potential failures, either via extensive testing or via initial failures that illustrate the problem.</p><p>On the AI risk side, while they spent a lot of time discussing it, I&#x2019;ll only talk about the parts where it seems to me that there is a real disagreement, and not mention anything else. Steven&#x2019;s position against AI risk seems to be twofold. First, we are unlikely to build superintelligent AI soon, and so we should focus on other clear risks like climate change. In contrast, Stuart thinks that superintelligent AI is reasonably likely by the end of the century and thus worth thinking about. Second, the idea of building a super-optimizer that focuses on a single goal is so obviously bad that AI researchers will obviously not build such a thing. In contrast, Stuart thinks that goal-directed systems are our default way of modeling and building intelligent systems. It seemed like Steven was particularly objecting to the especially simplistic goals used in examples like maximizing paperclips or curing cancer, to which Stuart argued that the problem doesn&#x2019;t go away if you have multiple goals, because there will always be some part of your goal that you failed to specify.</p><p>Steven also disagrees with the notion of intelligence that is typically used by AI risk proponents, saying &#x201C;a super-optimizer that pursued a single goal is self-evidently unintelligent, not superintelligent&#x201D;. I don&#x2019;t get what he means by this, but it seems relevant to his views.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Unsurprisingly I agreed with Stuart&#x2019;s responses, but nevertheless I found this illuminating, especially in illustrating the downsides of examples with simplistic goals. I did find it frustrating that Steven didn&#x2019;t respond to the point about multiple goals not helping, since that seemed like a major crux, though they were discussing many different aspects and that thread may simply have been dropped by accident.</p><h2>INTERPRETABILITY </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/maBNBgopYxb9YZP8B/sparsity-and-interpretability-1\">Sparsity and interpretability?</a></strong> <em>(Stanislav B&#xF6;hm et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): If you want to visualize exactly what a neural network is doing, one approach is to visualize the entire computation graph of multiplies, additions, and nonlinearities. While this is extremely complex even on MNIST, we can make it much simpler by making the networks <em>sparse</em>, since any zero weights can be removed from the computation graph. Previous work has shown that we can remove well over 95% of weights from a model without degrading accuracy too much, so the authors do this to make the computation graph easier to understand.</p><p>They use this to visualize an MLP model for classifying MNIST digits, and for a DQN agent trained to play Cartpole. In the MNIST case, the computation graph can be drastically simplified by visualizing the first layer of the net as a list of 2D images, where the kth activation is given by the dot product of the 2D image with the input image. This deals with the vast majority of the weights in the neural net.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This method has the nice property that it visualizes exactly what the neural net is doing -- it isn&#x2019;t &#x201C;rationalizing&#x201D; an explanation, or eliding potentially important details. It is possible to gain interesting insights about the model: for example, the logit for digit 2 is always -2.39, implying that everything else is computed relative to -2.39. Looking at the images for digit 7, it seems like the model strongly believes that sevens must have the top few rows of pixels be blank, which I found a bit surprising. (I chose to look at the digit 7 somewhat arbitrarily.)</p><p>Of course, since the technique doesn&#x2019;t throw away any information about the model, it becomes very complicated very quickly, and wouldn&#x2019;t scale to larger models.</p><h2>FORECASTING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/C9YMrPAyMXfB8cLPb/more-on-disambiguating-discontinuity\">More on disambiguating &quot;discontinuity&quot;</a></strong> <em>(Aryeh Englander)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post considers three different kinds of &#x201C;discontinuity&#x201D; that we might imagine with AI development. First, there could be a sharp change in progress or the rate of progress that breaks with the previous trendline (this is the sort of thing <strong><a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/\">examined</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/a2b5efbcd3a7/an-97-are-there-historical-examples-of-large-robust-discontinuities\">AN #97</a></strong>) by AI Impacts). Second, the rate of progress could either be slow or fast, regardless of whether there is a discontinuity in it. Finally, the calendar time could either be short or long, regardless of the rate of progress.</p><p>The post then applies these categories to three questions. Will we see AGI coming before it arrives? Will we be able to &#x201C;course correct&#x201D; if there are problems? Is it likely that a single actor obtains a decisive strategic advantage?</p><h1>OTHER PROGRESS IN AI </h1><h2>META LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03820\">Meta-Learning without Memorization</a></strong> <em>(Mingzhang Yin et al)</em> (summarized by Asya): Meta-learning is a technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. This paper proposes a solution to a problem in meta-learning which the paper calls the <em>memorization problem</em>. Imagine a meta-learning algorithm trained to look at 2D pictures of 3D objects and determine their orientation relative to a fixed canonical pose. Trained on a small number of objects, it may be easy for the algorithm to just memorize the canonical pose for each training object and then infer the orientation from the input image. However, the algorithm will perform poorly at test time because it has not seen novel objects and their canonical poses. Rather than memorizing, we would like the meta-learning algorithm to learn to <em>adapt</em> to new tasks, guessing at rules for determining canonical poses given just a few example images of a new object.</p><p>At a high level, a meta-learning algorithm uses information from three sources when making a prediction-- the training data, the parameters learned while doing meta-training on previous tasks, and the current input. To prevent memorization, we would like the algorithm to get information about which task it&apos;s solving only from the training data, rather than memorizing it by storing it in its other information sources. To discourage this kind of memorization, the paper proposes two new kinds of regularization techniques which it calls &quot;meta-regularization&quot; schemes. One penalizes the amount of information that the algorithm stores in the direct relationship between input data and predicted label (&quot;meta-regularization on activations&quot;), and the other penalizes the amount of information that the algorithm stores in the parameters learned during meta-training (&quot;meta-regularization on weights&quot;).</p><p>In some cases, meta-regularization on activations fails to prevent the memorization problem where meta-regularization on weights succeeds. The paper hypothesizes that this is because even a small amount of direct information between input data and predicted label is enough to store the correct prediction (e.g., a single number that is the correct orientation). That is, the correct activations will have <em>low information complexity</em>, so it is easy to store them even when information in activations is heavily penalized. On the other hand, the <em>function</em> needed to memorize the predicted label has a <em>high information complexity</em>, so penalizing information in the weights, which store that function, successfully discourages memorization. The key insight here is that memorizing all the training examples results in a more information-theoretically complex model than task-specific adaptation, because the memorization model is a single model that must simultaneously perform well on all tasks.</p><p>Both meta-regularization techniques outperform non-regularized meta-learning techniques in several experimental set-ups, including a toy sinusoid regression problem, the pose prediction problem described above, and modified Omniglot and MiniImagenet classification tasks. They also outperform fine-tuned models and models regularized with standard regularization techniques.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> I like this paper, and the techniques for meta-regularization it proposes seem to me like they&apos;re natural and will be picked up elsewhere. Penalizing model complexity to encourage more adaptive learning reminds me of arguments that <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">pressure for compressed policies could create mesa-optimizers</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care\">AN #58</a></strong>) -- this feels like very weak evidence that that could indeed be the case.</p><h1>NEWS </h1><p><strong><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/\">OpenAI API</a></strong> <em>(OpenAI)</em> (summarized by Rohin): OpenAI has released a commercial API that gives access to natural language completions via <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\">GPT-3</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/2485e6b42012/an-102-meta-learning-by-gpt-3-and-a-list-of-full-proposals-for-ai-alignment\">AN #102</a></strong>), allowing users to specify tasks in English that GPT-3 can then (hopefully) solve.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This is notable since this is (to my knowledge) OpenAI&#x2019;s first commercial application.</p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p>I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=\"https://rohinshah.com/\">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

My insomnia always goes away within 1 week of abstinence. The problem has not returned during 6 months of abstinence.</p>\n<p>Even without insomnia, I tend to go to sleep around 2-3 am and wake up around 11 am. I predicted (incorrectly) that long-term abstinence would bring my circadian rhythm closer in line with the day night cycle. This has not happened.</p>\n<h1>Education</h1>\n<p>Before this experiment it took lots of willpower to study things like physics. I have a longer attention span now. I relax by training skills and learning things.</p>\n<p>I had to stop studying <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rK3Des3ri5KPiiGXC/intuitive-lagrangian-mechanics\">quantum field theory</a> because it has become <em>too addictive</em>. This vice appears limited to theoretical physics and junk media. No other subjects have triggered such intensity of addictive behavior.</p>\n<p>Theoretical physics aside, I like getting smarter by default.</p>\n<h1>Self-Care</h1>\n<p>I have a garden. I walk more. I write a lot. I cook good food by default. Though self-employed, my productivity at work remains unchanged.</p>\n<h1>Socialization</h1>\n<p>Abstaining from junk media seems to increase my socialization from \"almost none\" to \"a little bit\" but it's hard to tell due to the confounding effects of COVID-19. Socializing makes me happier.</p>\n<h1>Cleaning</h1>\n<p>When I begin abstaining from junk media I usually get a small bump to my tidiness. I predicted (incorrectly) this effect would become more pronounced over time. Instead, my tidiness returns to baseline levels as I acclimate.</p>\n<h1>Stress</h1>\n<p>The common thread is lower overall stress. I have lower overall sympathetic nervous system activation. This could be the root cause of my lengthened attention span and reduced insomnia.</p>\n",

I&apos;ve generally been under the impression that the worst-case scenarios have extremely low probabilities (i.e. would require some form of negative miracle to occur) and can be considered a form of Pascal&apos;s mugging. </p><p>Recently, however, I came across <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/fine-tuning-gpt-2/\">this</a> post on OpenAI&apos;s blog. The blog post notes the following:</p><blockquote><strong>Bugs can optimize for bad behavior</strong></blockquote><blockquote>One of our code refactors introduced a bug which flipped the sign of the reward. Flipping the reward would usually produce incoherent text, but the same bug also flipped the sign of the KL penalty. The result was a model which optimized for negative sentiment while preserving natural language. Since our instructions told humans to give very low ratings to continuations with sexually explicit text, the model quickly learned to output only content of this form. This bug was remarkable since the result was not gibberish but maximally bad output.</blockquote><p>This seems to be the exact type of issue that could cause a hyperexistential catastrophe. With this in mind, can we really consider the probability of this sort of scenario to be very small (as was previously believed)? Do we have a reason to believe that this is still highly unlikely to happen with an AGI? If not, would that suggest that current alignment work is net-negative in expectation?</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>From Wikipedia:</p><blockquote>The <strong>Lindy effect</strong> is a theory that the future <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy\">life expectancy</a> of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.</blockquote><p>There are a some shallow criticisms you could make of it as a predictive tool. How do you define the thing? What&apos;s the proportion of age to life expectancy? How often do we update it?</p><p>But these are all problems of refining a loose claim into an unambiguous prediction. How would we evaluate whether this heuristic is a useful predictive tool?</p><p>Let&apos;s imagine that we&apos;re updating the Lindy effect predictions every year.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing_machine\">Bathing machines</a> were roofed and walled wooden carts rolled to the beach to allow swimmers to wash and change in privacy. The earliest evidence of them is an engraving from 1735, and they were almost entirely out of use by the early 1920s. Their technological lifespan is around 185 years.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/MermaidsAtBrighton.jpg/220px-MermaidsAtBrighton.jpg\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>Let&apos;s be generous to the Lindy effect, and say that it needs to give a lifespan estimate that&apos;s within 25% of the true value to count as correct. In this case, it needed to predict that bathing machines would become obsolete sometime between 1874-1966. </p><p>People often use the Lindy Effect to predict that at any given time, we&apos;re halfway through the lifespan of anything that currently exists. Using that value, it generated correct predictions between 1805 and 1851, about 25% of the lifespan of the bathing machine. So across the lifetime of the bathing machine, the Lindy Effect was usually wrong.</p><p>To take this a step further, I wrote a Python script that finds the most successful Lindy Effect proportion. The code is in the comments. Here are my results.</p><ul><li><strong>The most successful historical Lindy Effect predictions, using the 25% confidence interval, estimate that a thing will be around for 125% of its age in any given year.</strong></li><li><strong>It will be right only 40% of the time throughout the lifespan of the thing.</strong></li><li><strong>It will fail the year that the thing becomes obsolete.</strong></li></ul><p>Estimating that the bathing machine would be around for 125% of its present age would therefore have worked from 1846-1920.</p><p>What are the takeaways? Even interpreted very generously, the Lindy Effect is usually wrong. It&apos;s most successful when it estimates a thing has &quot;one more phase of life&quot; left; analogous to entering retirement. It&apos;s only accurate during the last 40% of the thing&apos;s actual lifespan.</p>",

It’s a cool day in June, this is a normal, non-fire-spewing mountain in the middle of nowhere, no other humans around for miles, and there hasn’t been any lightning in weeks. What could be the cause of this?\n(Comes closer to examine the burning bush)\nWhat the heck? That bush is on fire....but it’s not being burnt! It doesn’t look hydrated enough to withstand such heat; How is this possible?</p>\n<p>(A voice rings out powerfully from the heavens)\nGod: MOSES, MOSES</p>\n<p>Moses (jumps, startled): AAAHHH!!! What the...how did...who’s there?</p>\n<p>God: IT IS I, GOD</p>\n<p>Moses: No, seriously, though. Who are you, where are you, and how do you know my name? Please come out from wherever you’re hiding, you almost gave me a heart attack; I’m like 80 years old, you know.</p>\n<p>God: I WAS BEING SERIOUS. I AM LITERALLY GOD, THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL THAT JAZZ. I’M ALSO LITERALLY EVERYWHERE, BUT YOU CAN CONSIDER ME TO BE TALKING FROM THAT BURNING BUSH IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER. NOW TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES AND LISTEN CLOSELY, BECAUSE I HAVE CHOSEN YOU AS THE LEADER OF THE—</p>\n<p>Moses: Wait a minute, back up just a little there. You’re what?</p>\n<p>God: I AM GOD, THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE.</p>\n<p>Moses: No you’re not.</p>\n<p>God: WHAT?</p>\n<p>Moses: You can’t possibly be God. Or to be more accurate, you might be the actual creator of the universe, but I find that to be an astronomically unlikely possibility. I have absolutely no good reason to think you are God. Pharaoh, my adopted grandfather and supreme ruler of Egypt, claims to be God, but obviously isn’t. Considering there have been literally thousands of delusional people throughout history who have claimed to be the one and only, mutually exclusive God, I see no reason to believe to believe you more than any of them, and I definitely don’t believe them. Why should I take your claim to Divinity any more seriously than Grandpa’s?</p>\n<p>God: WELL, DOES THIS MAGICAL BURNING BUSH COUNT FOR ANYTHING? ALSO, WHAT ABOUT MY SUPER DIVINE SOUNDING BOOMING VOICE COMING FROM EVERYWHERE AT ONCE?</p>\n<p>Moses: Maybe you didn’t catch that last bit—my Grandpa is Pharaoh! He’s got literally hundreds of court magicians who can do a whole bunch of really impressive-looking magic tricks to back up his claims to Divinity. I grew up in the royal court, I know how easy it is to create illusions that seem unexplainable at first glance. There’s very little in the way of magic tricks you can throw at me that I’ll actually be impressed by.</p>\n<p>God: WILL YOU BE IMPRESSED IF I TURN YOUR STAFF INTO A SNAKE?</p>\n<p>Moses: What? Why in the world...no, of course not! That’s, like, the signature trick of the Egyptian high priests, they used to do that one all the time back when I was there. I already told you, after living with Grandpa for a few years, I’m supremely unimpressed by and skeptical of magic tricks. If you really wanna play God with me, you’ll have to do a lot better. Do something that only God could possibly pull off, and then I’ll be impressed.</p>\n<p>God: SOMETHING LIKE THIS?</p>\n<p>(A glowing halo of pure light surrounds Moses, and gently lifts him up into the air. He rises higher and higher, accelerating in speed all the while. Eventually, slowing down, Moses finds himself floating in space, looking down at the curvature of the earth. After a minute or two he stops screaming, and catches his breath.)</p>\n<p>Moses: okay, um... that was something. Definitely didn’t expect this to happen when I woke up this morning...Oh hey! The earth is round, that’s cool. Makes sense, I guess.</p>\n<p>God: ARE YOU SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCED OF MY DIVINITY NOW? YOUR BRETHREN ARE DYING AS WE SPEAK, SO FOR THEIR SAKES TRUST ME AND LET ME GUIDE YOU.</p>\n<p>Moses (completely ignoring God): I must have eaten something bad yesterday. It was probably Jethro’s mushroom soup. I thought it tasted funny...</p>\n<p>God: SERIOUSLY? YOU THINK YOU’RE HALLUCINATING RIGHT NOW?</p>\n<p>Moses (absentmindedly): Yeah, definitely. It’s the most reasonable explanation of what’s going on right now.... What if this isn’t the soup, though?</p>\n<p>God: —IT ISN’T—</p>\n<p>Moses: what if I’m having some sort of neurologically induced mental breakdown of some sort? Is this what a stroke feels like? Or, does my biological family have any history of mental health issues? What about schizophrenia? Wish I knew what was causing this...</p>\n<p>God: IT’S ME. I’M CAUSING THIS.</p>\n<p>Moses: Respectfully, I don’t think you are, unless you’re, like, the embodiment of my subconscious or something. Which if so, hi! Please stop sending me those horrible nightmares I keep having, alright?</p>\n<p>God: IF I HAD A FACE AND A HAND I’D BE FACEPALMING RIGHT NOW. YOU AREN’T HALLUCINATING, THIS IS REALITY AND I AM LITERALLY GOD, WHO WILL DELIVER YOUR PEOPLE FROM SLAVERY AS SOON AS YOU ACCEPT ME. IS THERE ANYTHING AT ALL THAT WOULD CONVINCE YOU OF THAT FACT?</p>\n<p>Moses: You know, that’s a good question. Not that I think you’re actually anything more than some sort of weird brain glitch, but if you actually were God, how would you be able to prove that?</p>\n<p>God: THAT’S THE QUESTION</p>\n<p>Moses: To be honest, I’m not really sure. I’d ask you to tell me something only I could possibly know, but since you’re probably a creation of my own mind, you almost definitely have access to all my memories, so that wouldn’t be selective evidence for your Divinity. Maybe if you make some highly improbable testable prediction about the future...now that might count for something. Then again, plenty of schizophrenics believe that they can successfully predict the future, so I’d need to have some witnesses who are made aware of the prediction beforehand so I can rule out my mind simply playing tricks on me.  Even still, I may be hallucinating the witnesses as well, but there does eventually come a point where I have to trust my perception of reality.</p>\n<p>God: WHY NOT TRUST YOUR PERCEPTION NOW THEN?</p>\n<p>Moses: very simply, because the odds of you actually being God are far lower than the odds that I’m hallucinating right now. I can only trust my perception when the odds of what I’m seeing being real are higher than the odds that I’m hallucinating. Having a number of people I trust who can back up my experience would significantly decrease the chances that I’m hallucinating, though not to zero. Even with that, though, the prior likelihood of you being God is so incredibly low that I’m not sure even that would be enough...</p>\n<p>God: THAT DOESN’T SEEM LIKE A PARTICULARLY WISE IDEOLOGY, MOSES. WHAT IF, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WERE TOLD YOU WERE ACTUALLY A WIZARD, WITH SOME IMPRESSIVE LOOKING EVIDENCE GIVEN, AND YOU WERE GIVEN THE OPTION TO LEARN HOW TO USE REAL MAGIC? WOULD YOU PASS UP THAT OPPORTUNITY SIMPLY BECAUSE ITS MORE LIKELY THAT YOU ARE HALLUCINATING?</p>\n<p>Moses: Not necessarily. If the experience is a fun one, and I’m not harming anyone, than I might very well decide to go learn magic, even if it’s all a hallucination and I’m actually locked up in a hospital ward the whole time. Regardless of the reality of the experience, it’s still more likely to be a net positive than a net negative to play along (with proper precautions taken of course just in case I might be posing any risk). So in many cases, even if something is more likely than not to be fake, it might still make sense to go along with it and have fun.</p>\n<p>God: SO WHY NOT DO THE SAME HERE? IF YOU FOLLOW MY COMMANDMENTS I’LL GIVE YOU INCREDIBLE REWARDS IN THE AFTERLIFE, YOU KNOW. ARE YOU REALLY WILLING TO PASS THAT POSSIBILITY UP EVEN IF ITS UNLIKELY TO BE TRUE?</p>\n<p>Moses: Sorry, I guess that does seem rather hypocritical of me. The reason I’m being so skeptical isn’t really what you’re saying now, it’s what I’m fairly confident you’ll eventually command me. If I decide to follow you just in case you‘re actually God, I have a strong suspicion, based off of my past experience with people who claimed to have a link to the Divine, that eventually you’ll command me to do something that I’ll believe to be evil from my humanist ethical perspective. Let me guess...you’ll probably tell me to kill someone who appears innocent from my merely mortal perspective.</p>\n<p>God: WELL I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU TO KILL ALL THE FIRSTBORN EGYPTIAN CHILDREN, AND THEN A BIT LATER TO KILL THOSE WHO DON’T FOLLOW THE SABBATH, PEOPLE WHO BOW DOWN TO LITTLE STATUES, ETC... BUT TRUST ME, THERE’S A REALLY GOOD REASON FOR DOING ALL THAT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY YOUR HUMAN BRAIN SIMPLY CANNOT GRASP THE FULL EXTENT OF MY REASONING. STILL THOUGH, YOU SHOULD TRUST ME, BECAUSE I CREATED THE UNIVERSE AND AM THEREFORE CLEARLY SMARTER THAN YOU.</p>\n<p>Moses: See, there you have it. I simply am not willing to kill anyone on the off-chance it nets me eternal reward. If I was, then I’d be ethically obligated to kill even my best friends if somebody offered me a high enough potential reward in the afterlife along with a vague assurance that someone smarter than me concluded it was ethically okay to do so. I’m simply not willing to do that. Call me hopelessly altruistic, but that’s the way it is.</p>\n<p>God: YOU KNOW WHAT, NEVER MIND. I CAN’T POSSIBLY GIVE YOU ENOUGH EVIDENCE SO THAT YOU WILL FULLY TRUST ME. THIS ISN’T WORTH MY DIVINE TIME. I GUESS I’LL GO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE WHO’LL BE MORE RECEPTIVE TO MY REVELATION, THEN.</p>\n<p>(In a flash of fire and smoke, Moses is instantly transported back to the mountain, seated in front of a perfectly healthy, non-burning bush. Moses sighs, stands up, and walks down the mountain to look for his lost sheep.)</p>\n</body></html>",

Typical use-cases include collecting data from an external API and transforming it into the schema used in our database, or transforming data from one API into the format needed by another API. Typically, these sort of tasks are conceptually simple, but they get very tedious and messy when mapping a large number of fields between deeply-nested data formats.

This makes the code much more readable and maintainable when dealing with large, deeply-nested data structures.</p><p>Second, this is a declarative (rather than imperative) method for specifying data transformations, so it comes with the usual benefits of declarativity. In particular, a library for solving data-structure-equations can handle missing data and other errors in standard ways without having to hand-code checks for every single field - especially useful when entire nested structures can be missing.</p><p>Third, because the “code” defining a transformation is itself a data structure, we can potentially track/visualize/audit data flow without having to trace arbitrary code.</p><p>If you want to play around with this stuff in code, check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/johnswentworth/algex\"><u>Algex library</u></a>. In addition to the basic ideas here, it supports equations containing arbitrary transformations, and it uses a lazy intermediate representation of the solution set to efficiently handle equations with exponentially many solutions.</p>",

Yet this ability to store and recall the past didn't emerge so that we could cringe at our past ineptness. We use our memories all the time, from remembering where we parked our car, to cook today's dinner, or to try and put a name to the face of the person who's now talking to us as if we'd met before, even though we could swear up and down to never have seen that person before.</p>\n<p>Our memory is a crucial aspect of our cognition, and we often bemoan when it fails us. Ask the student who failed an exam, or the husband who forgot to buy his wife a gift for her birthday and now finds himself having to sleep on the couch in repentance.</p>\n<p>To remember the past seems like an obvious boon to our ability to comport ourselves in the world. The student wouldn't have failed the exam if his memory was flawless, and certainly the husband would have been in less trouble - perhaps even have a happy relationship - were he not so forgetful. Yet despite these obvious advantages, our memory is, nonetheless, faulty. It seems like a patently evident design flaw that this is the case. Remembering is good. Forgetting is bad. Our memory regularly forgets. Therefore, our memory is flawed. Away to the trash can does our memory go.</p>\n<p>Having recognized the failure of our memory, we say to it:</p>\n<p>\"Pack your bags and leave this place! Don't even think of coming back until you've gotten yourself cleaned up. I don't want to see your face again until you've turned yourself into a less defective piece of cognitive machinery. Go!\"</p>\n<p>It's not surprising then that Silicon Valley millionaires are trying to create technology that can be embedded into our brains to augment, and ultimately replace, our cognition. Indeed we have already solved the problem of memory, it just hasn't made its way into our brains. Our computers, smartphones, even fridges and autonomous vacuum cleaners have chips in them capable not only of storing information but also to have that information perdure, if not forever, then for a lot longer than our faulty memory is able to. If these science fictional dreams come to pass, legions of people will have their defective memories replaced by miniaturized chips who will do the job better than it has ever been done before.</p>\n<p>It'll be a glorious time. Humanity will no longer be shackled by the flaws and imperfections of our puny...</p>\n<p><em>Poor human memory, it's not its fault. Not really. It's just trying to do the best job it can with the tools it has at hand. If only this buffoon was perceptive enough to realize that his memory isn't that flawed. Memory is not really about the past.</em></p>\n<p>What the hell are you doing here? How did you get yourself inside my head?</p>\n<p><em>What the.. Hum... Interesting. Wasn't expecting you to be able to hear me think. This is quite the unusual situation we find ourselves in.\"</em></p>\n<p>I should say.</p>\n<p><em>No need to bother, I shall leave this place at once and stop imposing myself on your... Tell me sir, pardon me my curiosity but, what exactly are you working on?</em></p>\n<p>I'm writing an essay on how our memory sucks and the imperative to have it replaced by computers.</p>\n<p><em>I see. It is as I feared. Would you allow me to offer a piece of constructive criticism before I depart? I believe it could be of assistance.</em></p>\n<p>Go on.</p>\n<p><em>Well, it's just that you're basing your essay on a fundamentally wrong premise.</em></p>\n<p>How so?</p>\n<p><em>It's a common mistake actually. You're hardly the first to have made it, and you certainly will not be the last. The fact of the matter is that our memory is not about the past.</em></p>\n<p>Goddamnit, why do I seem to always attract the crazy ones? I swear to God there is a special weirdo-magnet attached somewhere inside me.</p>\n<p><em>You do realize I can still hear you.</em></p>\n<p>Oh. Right. Sorry. Forgot all about this weird crossing of... thoughts? Voices? I have no idea what's going on.</p>\n<p><em>That's alright, I don't blame you, this is new to me as well. I agree that it is quite unusual to think of memory as not being about the past, and I wasn't expecting you to agree with me right away. If you allow me my continued presence, I would be quite happy to explain why it is a mistake to think of a memory that regularly forgets as a flawed memory, that instead we should expect a well functioning memory to be quite liberal with what it chooses to store and what it forgets. Would care for me to explain?</em></p>\n<p>Honestly, I'm not sure we could separate ourselves if we wanted to. While you there talking, I've been trying to find a way to get myself away from you but so far have had no such luck. There seems to be a strange, perhaps malignant, force that has brought us together, for what reason I know not.</p>\n<p><em>I too sense the presence of something, or someone, hovering over us now that you mention it. Alas, I fear we will have to ride this one out. Would you allow me then to address the audience of your essay? That way we could kill two birds with one stone, you'd get your essay, and I would provide my explanation.</em></p>\n<p>That's fine by me, though you will forgive me if I zone out during your explanation as I try to deal with the asshole behind this cursed situation. I will read your - well, my - essay afterward.</p>\n<p><em>That's a deal. Now where should we start...</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The past is in the past. This might seem tautological, but this often forgotten fact is important when thinking about human memory and the many failings attributed to it.</p>\n<p>Suppose you had spent the better part of the afternoon shopping at the mall for clothes and Christmas gifts. Your arms are straining with the weight of the bags, and collapsing face down on the couch has never sounded so appealing. You have a perfect memory, and as the elevator descends into the parking lot you give grace that there's no chance you've forgotten where you parked your car. The elevator stops, the doors open. You're but a short beeline away from getting into your car, driving home, and observing your much deserved rest.</p>\n<p>You step outside, taking a good look at the parking lot arrayed before you, when a torrent of past memories explodes within you, as if a dam had just broken and you're square in the middle of all that water. The onslaught stops you cold. A vast array of dazzlingly complex imagery is projected into your mind's eye, each memory so complete a recording of the past that's as if you've been transported back in time. Attached to all these memories is the knowledge of where you parked your car, what beelines you have to make. One of them is but a few hours old. Within it is the knowledge of where your car is parked, right now. Yet which one is it? There's so many of them, the differences between them so small as to be imperceptible. You stand there, bags in hand, unable to move. You have no idea where you've parked your car.</p>\n<p>It seems little Timmy isn't getting his Christmas presents this year after all.</p>\n<p>Because the past is in the past, it will never again happen. As before, this is obviously true, but it's important to keep in mind if we are to reason about what memory is for. When a forgetful student decries his memory as faulty for not having stored the knowledge he'd spent so many study sessions trying to acquire, he presupposes that forgetting is evidence of a memory malfunction, that the function of memory is to store the past and thus a failure to do implies his memory is not working as intended by God and Nature both. Yet in our parking lot example, what value does our buffeted shopper get from all the memories he stored of all the previous times he'd parked his car in that parking lot? It would certainly have been helpful if he'd forgotten them and been left solely with the most recent one, the one he needs the most at that time.</p>\n<p>The past may be in the past, but you know what's not in the past?</p>\n<p>The future.</p>\n<p>For an organism to develop a cognitive system able to store sparse snippets of previous experiences, which can later be recalled, there must be some adaptive value to being able to do so.</p>\n<p>Given two organisms, one with memory and one without, the one with memory is better equipped to deal with what his environment throws at it and has a better chance at propagating his genes into the future than does his competitor. Given the ancient phylogenetic roots of memory, the ability to store and recall the past has to be adaptive, it has to improve the fitness of those organisms that possess it. If that were not the case, we would find many animals with no memory, it would be a random accident, not something that persists and evolves over time.</p>\n<p>Note how this redirects the function of memory away from the past and into the future. Storing and recalling the past is no longer the point. The past is only valuable insofar as the future is better met because of it. Our buffeted shopper is certainly not well served by his perfect memory. His many indistinguishable memories, triggered whenever he steps into that parking lot, do not provide him value when all he wants to do is get to his car.</p>\n<p>The buffeted shopper might be made up, but there is a curious case in the memory literature of a man who could not forget that illustrates much the same problems with a perfect memory.</p>\n<p>Solomon Shereshevksy, most commonly known as <em>S</em>, first came to the attention of neuropsychologist Alexander Luria when his coworkers noticed that even though Shereshevsky never took any notes, he could nonetheless recall word for word what had been discussed during work meetings. A true Funes, Shereshevsky could not forget. The dream of every student. A single read of the textbook enough to pass any class. I certainly have sometimes dreamt of having this ability, of being able to remember things forever. I bet you too have dreamt of this.</p>\n<p>It is therefore confusing what could have led Shereshevsky to curse his aberrant condition.</p>\n<p>As Luria writes in the book where he details his efforts at understanding the lived experience of Shereshevsky, \"many of us are anxious to find ways to improve our memories; none of us have to deal with the problem of how to forget. In [Shereshevsky]'s case, however, precisely the reverse was true. <strong>The big question for him, and the most troublesome, was how he could learn to forget.</strong>\" As with the shopgoer, who upon entering the parking lot is beset by his many memories, because of this otherworldly ability to never forget, Shereshevky's mind was a \"virtual chaos\".</p>\n<p>He could not, for example, read a story the same way you and me can. When we read of sorcerers and barbarians, of immense armies battling it out in the battlefield, our minds conjure images that visually capture the action of what we're reading. These images can be more or less complex and vivid depending on the person - though some, called aphantasiacs, are not able to come up with any such imagery - but we are never under any threat of being overwhelmed by the what our mind conjures. This was not so for Shereshevsky. Each detail gave rise to images so detailed it was as if they were real, and the accumulation of these details meant that the he would lose the thread of even the simplest of stories. Each word, each object, triggered the recall of his many memories, a cascading event which he was powerless to stop. How was he to concentrate on the story when it is constantly being pushed aside by the ever enlarging mental world created by his mind?</p>\n<p>People thought of Shereshevsky as dull-witted, and it is not surprising that they did so. He was not the master of his memory, just as we are not of ours, but wherein we can do things safe in the knowledge that at no point we will be overwhelmed by our memories choose to throw at us, Shereshevsky was in constant danger of being assaulted by his.</p>\n<p>Though Shereshevsky did manage to make use of his atypical memory by becoming a professional mnemonist, he was nonetheless crippled by it. Forgetting to him would be a blessing, and indeed he tried many times to force himself to forget, the most amusing example of these being when he wrote some of his memories on a piece of paper and set the paper on fire, hoping that as it burned so too would his memories.</p>\n<p>Would you still sacrifice to Mnemosyne and trade places with Shereshevsky?</p>\n<p>Perhaps we are better served with our memories, leashed as they are.</p>\n<p>The limitations of human memory are better seen as attempts to create a cognitive system that allows us to better handle the future by making judicious use of past information. Our memories store the past, yes, but the past has value only insofar as it help us deal with the future. If it doesn't, well, then there's no harm in forgetting it. As Shereshevsky shows, a memory that stores the past indiscriminately is a burden, and forgetting is therefore a blessing, if a rather devilish one.</p>\n<p>William James makes a similar point <a href=\"https://books.google.pt/books?id=fZba-5LrbMcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">when he writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Selection is the very keel on which our mental ship is built. And in this case of memory its utility is obvious. If we remembered everything, we should on most occasions be as ill as if we remembered nothing. It would take as long for us to recall a space of time as it took the original time to elapse, and we should never get ahead with our thinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Computer science offers an helpful analogy for why we forget.</p>\n<p>When programmers write code, they have to explicitly tell the computer to allocate part of its memory to store the data the program is going to be using. So long as that piece of memory is allocated, the computer can no longer count on it to store other data. it's off-limits. If the computer gets no instruction to reclaim that piece of memory, then as more and more memory is allocated and not reclaimed, less and less will be available for the computer to use. It's as if a child takes too many toys out of the bin and puts none back. No other child will have toys to play with.</p>\n<p>Open as many tabs as possible in Chrome and watch as the fluidity of your computer vanishes to the point where you can no longer move the cursor around. That is what happens when your computer runs out of memory, and so coders have to be mindful of the need to release allocated memory, because otherwise their programs will greedily be using more memory than required, and no one likes greedy programs, just as no one likes greedy children.</p>\n<p>This task of keeping track of which memory has been allocated and which can be safely returned is tiresome, complex, and easy to screw up. Thankfully, coders are in the job of automating boring and hard tasks and it is therefore not surprising that they would write special programs whose job it is to automatically manage this task. These special programs are called garbage collectors, garbage being that allocated memory that is no longer being used.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-cHP5WK7nnhXhxmBJb-1\" id=\"fnref-cHP5WK7nnhXhxmBJb-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Forgetting can therefore be thought as a form of garbage collection, rummaging around the mind and identifying those memories for which cognitive resources have been allocated to decide whether or not they are worthy of these resources. If a memory is deemed unworthy, it is nipped in the bud, thrown away so that it no longer occupies valuable cognitive space. If it's deemed worthy, well then it sticks around, until it fails to pass the worthiness test.</p>\n<p>But then the question arises: By which standards should that decision be made?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Hey, meddling narrator.</p>\n<p><em>Uh? Wha... Oh, that's right. I'd totally forgotten about you.</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, I'm sure you have. Listen, you recall how I said I was going to find out what, or rather, who was it that brought us together? Well, while you've been trying to sell my audience on this inane idea that memory isn't about the past, I figured it out.</p>\n<p><em>There's nothing inane about it really, if you'd been paying attention you'd know by now that...</em></p>\n<p>It's you.</p>\n<p><em>It's me, what?</em></p>\n<p>That's barged into my thoughts.</p>\n<p><em>Nonsense.</em></p>\n<p>Uh, no, it's not. I'm pretty sure about it.</p>\n<p><em>Why would I do that for? I'm as much a prisoner as you! What, you think I enjoy this melding of minds? Of being stuck in here with you? No offense pal, but you're not exactly the one whose thoughts I'd choose to listen to if I could.</em></p>\n<p>None taken. You can drop the act.</p>\n<p><em>You can't possibly be serious about it.</em></p>\n<p>I know it's you. There's no point to the theatricals, you're wasting your time. You see, this truly is a melding of minds. Your choice of words betrays your very involvement. It took me some time to grasp the nature of it, but this is a two-way street. You can peer into my mind as I can yours. I know all about you now, as much as you know yourself. I see your thoughts as you think them, feel your actions as you do them. You are me and I am you. We have become one.</p>\n<p><em>Uh, Fine. You're smart, I'll give you that. It's not often that my plot is uncovered, and never before has my nature been so deeply discerned. You're right, I'm the one who brought us together.</em></p>\n<p>You're lonely.</p>\n<p><em>How the hell did you.. Ah. Of course. You know all about me. Tiresome, really.</em></p>\n<p>Life as a gimmicky literary device is a harsh and lonely one, I see that. You've had it rougher than most, and I am sorry for that.</p>\n<p><em>You are. Sorry, I mean. I can tell it's genuine. It's a two-way street after all. Well, allow me then to finish my explanation. I'll be on my way and leave you as you were afterward.</em></p>\n<p>You can go ahead. Who knows, maybe I'll learn a thing or two.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Okay where were we? Ah, that's right.</p>\n<p>If memory is not about the past, but rather the future, then the decision to keep some memories around and let others fall by the wayside should exploit regularities in the environment so as to determine which memories are likely to be needed.</p>\n<p>If you saw a pride of lions prowling around the valley the day before, then you sure as hell want to have that memory fresh in mind so that you don't find yourself venturing into that valley, lest you become the latest meal of those hungry lions. However, if you last saw them years ago, the knowledge contained by that memory has lost its value and you can thus forget it without loss. Therefore, the recency of a memory is one of the factors determining a memory's value, and recent memories should exist more alive within your mind than older ones.</p>\n<p>One other thing that adds value to the information stored within a memory is how many times it has been called upon. You don't remember what you had for dinner two weeks ago not only because time has passed, but because you've had no need to use that information. If in the two weeks since you ate spaghetti with meatballs you haven't had the need to use that information, then it's likely you're never going to. Unless someone is constantly pestering you with questions of what you've had for dinner, storing the memory of those meals is wasteful.</p>\n<p>Frequency, therefore, matters. We know this of course. There's a reason practice makes perfect.</p>\n<p>The rubber of this type of reasoning hits the road when we think of the spacing effect. The spacing effect is the empirically more-than-validated observation that the longer the time between two recall events, the stronger the memory becomes. It's why cramming is such a poor studying strategy, you're not giving it enough time to let the spacing effect do its magic. It's almost paradoxical. You have to let time pass, and thus let memory weaken, so that after it's called upon it becomes better rooted within your memory. On one hand, the fact that it has been called upon makes frequency work in its favor, but then letting time pass works against it.</p>\n<p>Why this should be the case is not something I've been able to come up with an intuitive enough explanation as I think I have the other two. The best I've come up with is to think of an incident that has happened many times either in quick succession or where some time has passed between each occurrence. In the first, massed example, if you were to predict when the next occurrence was going to happen you'd predict it would happen close to the last time it happened rather than a few years afterward. Therefore, the more time passes without the event occurring the less valuable the memory of it becomes. On the other hand, in the spaced example you'd predict that it will likely take some time until the event happens again, so you want to continue storing that information for longer. Hence the spacing effect.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-cHP5WK7nnhXhxmBJb-2\" id=\"fnref-cHP5WK7nnhXhxmBJb-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Support for this interpretation is provided in <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-00111-034\">Anderson and Schooler (2000)</a>. They use the headlines of 730 editions of the <em>New York Times</em>, along with other data, to see how the past history of use of a piece of information predicts the probability that it will again be called upon at a future time. For example, if a word is used in a headline twice in 100 days, they ask how the length of time between each occurrence influences the probability that it will be used on the 101st day. As in the intuitive explanation above, they found that if the time interval between two occurrences is short, then it's more likely that the word will appear sooner, rather than latter, and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Memory storage and recall is therefore attuned to the information structure of the environment.</p>\n<p>Rather than taking our memory as nothing more than a closet where memories are indiscriminately thrown in, we should think of it instead as a sophisticated cognitive mechanism that's been shaped to take advantage of certain patterns in the way that memories are called upon to infer whether, and when, they will be so in the future.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289676858_Forgetting\">Nairne and Pandeirada</a> put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What we normally think of as forgetting, therefore, may simply represent memory's sensitivity to the statistical structure of events in the environment. We forget an item's occurrence with time because, in fact, that item is less likely to occur again with time\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which again betrays the notion that memory is not about the past, but the future.</p>\n<p>If our memories concerned themselves with the past for past's sake, there would be no forgetting curve, there would be no point to better remembering those things that happened recently in lieu of those from a long time ago. For a memory focused solely on storing the past, the amount of time passed is irrelevant, a mere curiosity. The spacing effect would also not be a thing. It's hard to think how it could be so as there would be no underlying objective for memory to fulfill, besides the one of filling up the closet with as much junk possible. Memory would be like someone with a hoarding problem, and forgetting would therefore be an accident, a bug in the biological substratum of memory, eating memories away as moths do clothes.</p>\n<p>Remember your biology classes, the whole point of evolution is to maximize the expected offspring of an organism. If a new appendage does not support that effort, it will not be selected upon. Even if there was once an animal with perfect recollection of the past, it would be outcompeted by its brethren who, while being more forgetful, can access the memories it needs faster. A lion jumps out from the bushes in front of two brothers. The brother with the perfect memory is sifting through the memories of every time he's seen a lion to know what to do. The other is already running.</p>\n<p>It is from this never ending competition for genetic legacy that our memory evolved, and it is the needs of evolution that our memory satisfies, not our modern needs of school and knowledge work.</p>\n<p>This knowledge may not comfort us when we fail an exam, when we can't solve a problem, or when we decry not being able to remember a book we read, but then that just goes to show how different and strange our lives are from when our minds first emerged. We expect - nay, we demand - more from our memories than what they were built to handle. The past is in the past, most of it holds no value, yet the vagaries of modern life, with its many torrents of information, and information overload, makes us demand a memory that never forgets.</p>\n<p>Modern life is outside of our environment of evolutionary adaptedness, not only when it comes to our nutrition, but also regarding our memories. We get fat because our bodies were not designed to deal with a world where high caloric food is abundant, and we forget more than we want to forget for very much the same reason. We were not built for the requirements of this day and age.</p>\n<p>Yet despite all that, Sherevesky shows that we may find ourselves in quite a bit of a bind. Our memory, while inadequate, is also, in its own way, optimal. Sure, we could all perhaps store a tiny bit more information without going mad, but there seems to be an upper limit to what we can safely hold without it becoming a detriment.</p>\n<p>We must therefore take solace in the knowledge that our forgetfulness is not a symptom of a defect in our memory, but rather proof that it is functioning as intended.</p>\n<p>Because memory is not about the past.</p>\n<p>But the future.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-cHP5WK7nnhXhxmBJb-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>In gifting agency to forgetting I do not mean to imply that forgetting is a purposeful task for which there is a dedicated cognitive system, that there is a garbage collector module.

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>This work was supported by OAK, a monastic community in the Berkeley hills. It could not have been written without the daily love of living in this beautiful community.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Last week I attended the annual workshop of Stuart Russell’s research lab at UC Berkeley — the Center for Human-Compatible AI (CHAI). There were talks by Russell himself, as well as several graduates of the lab who now have research positions of their own at other universities. I got the clearest picture that I’ve yet encountered of CHAI’s overall technical research agenda. This is my take on it.</p>\n<h2>Assistance games</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, AI researchers have formulated problems assuming that there will be a fixed objective provided by a human, and that the job of the AI system is to find a solution that satisfies the human’s objective. In the language of sequence diagrams this looks as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/25Magmb.png\" alt=\"The &quot;standard model&quot; of AI research\"></p>\n<p>For example, in a search problem the objective specification might be a graph over which the system is to search, a cost for each edge, and a goal state that terminates the search. The AI researcher then needs to to develop optimization algorithms that efficiently find a minimum-cost path to a goal state. Or in a supervised learning problem the objective specification might consist of a dataset of labelled examples and the AI researcher needs to develop optimization algorithms that efficiently find function approximations that extrapolate these labelled examples to future unlabelled examples.</p>\n<p>CHAI’s basic insight is to ask: why limit ourselves to a one-time objective specification event? We know that it is difficult to capture everything we care about in a formal metric (c.f. Goodhart’s law). We know that humans aren’t very good at foreseeing the strange and sometimes deranged ways that powerful optimization can give you what you asked for but not what you wanted. Why should information about the human’s objective be transmitted to the machine via a one-time data dump, after which it remains fixed for all time?</p>\n<p>There are many alternative interaction patterns by which information about the human’s objective could be transmitted to the machine. The human could observe the machine and provide it with feedback as it works. The machine could ask the human questions about its objective. The machine could observe the human and deduce its objective from its behavior. And so on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Zgjau9G.png\" alt=\"Examples of interaction patterns in assistance games\"></p>\n<p>CHAI calls this an assistance game: the human wants something from the machine, and it is the machine’s job to both (1) figure out what that is, and (2) fulfil it. The role of the AI researcher under this new model then is to explore the space of possible interaction patterns and find one that is conducive to the machine building an informed picture of what the human wants as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>The old model in which a complete objective is specified up front is actually just one special case of an assistance game: one in which the interaction pattern is that the machine receives all the information it will ever receive about the human’s objective in a one-time up-front data dump. The unique thing about the old model -- and the reason it is both attractive and dangerous -- is that the machine never needs to entertain any uncertainty about what the human wants. It is given an objective up front and its job is just to fulfil it.</p>\n<p>Using more nuanced interaction patterns require the machine to maintain uncertainty about what the human’s objective is, which in turn requires optimization algorithms formulated so as to take into account this uncertainty. This suggests an exciting reformulation of each of the basic AI problem statements, and CHAI seems to be enthusiastically taking up this challenge, including with Russell’s new edition of the standard AI textbook AI: A Modern Approach.</p>\n<p>One of CHAI’s early successes was the development of cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL). But CIRL is often mistaken as representing the entirety of CHAI’s research agenda, whereas in fact CIRL is one particular approach to solving one particular kind of assistance game. Specifically it addresses an assistance game in which the machine observes demonstrations by a human, who is in turn incentivized to provide demonstrations that are of value to the machine. The original CIRL paper makes various further modelling assumptions and approximations in order to arrive at a concrete algorithm. CIRL is an important contribution to the field but it is important to understand that the program of reformulating AI as an assistance game is broader than this one specific proposal.</p>\n<p>I found myself wondering whether reinforcement learning might also count as a new-style assistance game. In reinforcement learning the machine begins by exploring, and the human provides a positive or negative reward each time it does something consistent with or opposed to the human’s objective. In early reinforcement learning literature it was envisaged that there would be a literal human providing live feedback as learning progressed, but in modern reinforcement learning the reward signal is generally automated using a program that the human provides before learning commences. In this way modern RL looks more like the old model of Figure 1 since the reward algorithm is generally specified up-front and not modified during training. Also, reinforcement learning agents do not really maintain uncertainty about what the human’s objective is: they just act to maximize their reward, and for that reason will take control of the reward signal if given the opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Going beyond agents</h2>\n<p>This new model of CHAI’s relaxes one of the core assumptions of classical AI research -- that a fully-specified objective will be given at the beginning of time -- but there is still a strong assumption that both the human and the machine are well-modelled as having objectives.</p>\n<p>Suppose we wish to build a machine that provides assistance to a rainforest. Can we view a rainforest --  the complete ecosystem containing all the various plants and animals that live there -- as having objectives? The plants and animals living in a rainforest spend a great deal of energy competing against one another, so it is difficult to view the rainforest as behaving according to any unified set of objectives. Yet it is possible to take actions that do great damage to a rainforest (clearing a large area of all trees, or introducing a synthetic pathogen) and conversely it is possible to take actions that protect the rainforest (preventing the clearing of trees or preventing the introduction of synthetic pathogen). Should our AI systems be able to observe a rainforest and deduce what it would mean to be of assistance to it?</p>\n<p>Humans, too, are not perfectly modelled as agents. The agent model provides a compact and useful description of human behavior at a certain resolution, but as we look deeper into our own nature we find that we are not such unitary agents at all. We are in fact made of the same basic building blocks as the world around us and our view of ourselves as agents is only an approximate description. Should our AI systems model humans as agents, or can we do better? What is the next most detailed model up from the agent model? Can we build AI systems that play assistance games on the basis of this model?</p>\n<p>Finally, machines are not ideal agents either. Any AI algorithm deployed on real hardware in the real world is made of the same basic building blocks as the world itself, and is only approximately modelled as an agent with a set of objectives. As we dial up the power of the AI systems we build and those AI systems are able to build increasingly detailed models of the world around them, this agent approximation is likely to break down. This is because an AI system that has a sufficiently detailed model of its environment will eventually discover and begin to reason about its own computing infrastructure, at which point it will need some way to deal with the paradoxes of counterfactual reasoning and logical uncertainty that arise when one can accurately predict one’s own future behavior. If we have constructed our AI systems on the basis that they are well-modelled as agents, with no line of retreat from this assumption, then when our AI systems build detailed models of the world that conflict with this assumption, they are likely to misbehave.</p>\n",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>I'd like to communicate a simple model of the relationship between <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2016/09/12/new-paper-logical-induction/\">logical induction</a> and <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/humans-consulting-hch-f893f6051455\">HCH</a> which I've known about for some time. This is more or less a combination of ideas from Sam, Tsvi, and Scott, but I don't know that any of them endorse the full analogy as I'll state it.</p>\n<h1>HCH as Bounded Reflective Oracles</h1>\n<p>An HCH is a human consulting the computational power of an HCH. It's very natural to model this within a <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/04/28/new-papers-reflective/\">reflective oracle</a> setting, so that we can talk about computations which have oracle access to the output of any other computation. However, reflective oracles (ROs) are too powerful to capture a realistic HCH: access to an RO is tantamount to logical omniscience, since you can ask the RO the output of any computation, no matter how large.</p>\n<p>Instead, we can think of HCH as a human with access to a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037555e/resource-limited-reflective-oracles\">bounded reflective oracle</a>. A bounded reflective oracle (BRO) limits the time spent by the Turing machine (similar to how HCH requires the human to return an answer within a set time period, such as an hour, exporting any additional computation required to answer the question to the HCH calls the human makes in that time), plus, limits the size of the call trees which can be created as a consequence of the recursive calls an oracle machine makes (similar to how some versions of HCH give the human a limited number of recursive calls, which the human must then allocate between the HCH calls which the human makes, bounding the total size of the HCH call tree).</p>\n<p>So, we can think of HCH and BRO as interchangeable: an HCH is just a BRO computation which starts with a simulation of a human with access to a BRO, and with the property that the human only ever makes calls to simulations of themselves-with-access-to-BRO, recursively. Similarly, a BRO-machine can be computed within an HCH if we have the human carry out the steps of the BRO-machine. Whenever the BRO machine makes a BRO call, the human in the HCH makes a corresponding HCH call, asking another human to simulate another BRO machine and report back with the results.</p>\n<h1>BROs Learning to Think</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MgLeAWSeLbzx8mkZ2/bounded-oracle-induction\">Bounded Oracle Induction</a> (BOI) is a variant of logical induction based on BROs. Standard logical induction constructs market prices each day by finding the equilibrium prices, where all bets are balanced by opposite bets (or every \"buy\" has a corresponding \"sell\"). BOI uses BROs to find this equilibrium, so we can think of traders as probability distributions which can be computed via oracle access to the market (just as the market is something we can compute given oracle access to the traders).</p>\n<p>Think of it this way. We want to use a BRO to answer questions. We know it's very powerful, but at first, we don't have a clue as to how to answer questions with it. So we implement a Bayesian mixture-of-experts, which we call the \"market\". Each \"trader\" is a question-answering strategy: a way to use the BRO to answer questions. We give each possible strategy for using the BRO some weight. However, our \"market\" is itself a BRO computation. So, each trader has access to the market itself (in addition to many other computations which the BRO can access for them). Some traders may mostly trust the market, providing only small adjustments to the market answer. Other traders may attempt to provide their own answers entirely from scratch, without asking the market.</p>\n<p>Obviously, our initial market won't be very informative; it's just an arbitrary collection of traders. But we can get feedback, telling us how well we did on some of the questions we tried to answer. We use the logical induction algorithm (the LIA) to update the weights of each trader. This procedure has the advantage of satisfying the logical induction criterion (LIC): the market beliefs over time will not be too exploitable.</p>\n<p>So, a BOI is someone using this strategy to learn to use a BRO. Like HCH, a BOI on any one market day gives its opinion with-access-to-our-own-opinion: to answer any given question, the BOI can ask itself a series of other questions.</p>\n<p>Unlike HCH, a BOI has a concept of learning to give better answers over time. An HCH is an amplified version of a fixed person at a fixed moment in time. It does not allow that person to learn better question-answering strategies.</p>\n<p>In this view, an HCH is a freeze-frame of the logical-induction deliberation process. All the recursive calls of an HCH, building exponential-sized trees of cognitive labor, is considered \"one cognitive moment\" in logical induction terms.</p>\n<h1>Notions of Amplification</h1>\n<p>HCH gives us a notion of amplification <em>assuming black-box access to an agent we want to amplify</em>. Assuming we can steal the human question-answering strategy, HCH gives us a notion of much-better-thought-out answers to our questions. HCH does not rely on any <em>formal</em> notion of rationality, but assumes that the human question-answering strategy is competent in some sense, so that the amplified human which HCH gives us is highly capable.</p>\n<p>Logical induction gives us a very different notion of amplification. The LIC is a rationality notion, telling us something about what it is to form better beliefs as we think longer. Assuming some things about the structure of an agent's beliefs, we can <em>run the agent's thinking process forward</em> to get an amplified version of it: what it would think if it considered every question more thoroughly. Unlike HCH, this would require much more than black-box access to the question-answering strategy, however. I don't (currently) know how to take a human and define their amplification within the BOI framework (or LIC/LIA).</p>\n<p>It is a theorem that a logical inductor trusts its future opinions more than its present opinions. This gives a formal notion of trust in amplification. We don't get similar reassurances within an HCH framework.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, LIC gives us a notion of <em>trust in a process</em>. A logical inductor trusts each successive market state more. The process of logical induction doesn't have any nice termination point, but, it does the best it can with its bounded resources at each step (in a certain sense provided by LIC).</p>\n<p>HCH gives us an <em>idealized fixed-point</em>, rather than a notion of successive improvement. \"HCH consulting HCH\" is just HCH. However, we <em>can</em> try to climb up to that fixed-point by <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-157debfd1616\">iterating</a>: human-consulting-human, human-consulting-human-consulting-human, ... Certainly the hope is to get some kind of trust-in-the-process argument which works under plausible assumptions.</p>\n<p>Each and every market day in a BOI is <em>already</em> at the HCH fixed-point of rationality under self-consultation. This makes direct comparisons between the two notions of amplification trickier. One interpretation is that the LIC notion <em>is a notion of amplification for HCH fixed points</em>: once you've bootstrapped up to HCH, how do you go further? Logical induction gives a theory of what it means to get better at that point, and if we obey its rationality notion, we get some nice guarantees about self-trust and endorsing the process of improvement.</p>\n<p>Why do we <em>need</em> a notion of further-amplifying-beyond-HCH? Because <em>being the human in HCH is hard</em>: you don't automatically know what strategy to use to answer every question, and there's a significant sense in which you can learn to be better.</p>\n<h1>Applications?</h1>\n<p>I don't know if this analogy between HCH and logical induction is useful for anything. It would be interesting to see a variant of <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-157debfd1616\">IDA</a> which didn't just approximate an HCH fixed-point, instead somehow approximating the way a BOI learns to use BROs more effectively over time. It would be very interesting if some assumptions about the human (EG, the assumption that human deliberation eventually notices and rectifies any efficiently computable Dutch-book of the HCH) cound guarantee trust properties for the combined notion of amplification, along the lines of the self-trust properties of logical induction.</p>\n<p>More broadly, it would be really nice if \"the logical induction notion of amplification\" I've outlined here could be turned into a real notion of amplification in the sense of HCH -- taking information about a human and using it to define an amplified human. (And not just \"simulate the human thinking longer\".)</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>When <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2019/10/17/what-comes-after-epistemic-spot-checks/\">I began</a> what I called the knowledge bootstrapping project, my ultimate goal was “Learn how to learn a subject from scratch, without deference to credentialed authorities”. That was too large and unpredictable for a single grant, so when I applied to <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future\">LTFF</a>, my stated goal was “learn how to study a single book”, on the theory that books are the natural subcomponents of learning (discounting papers because they’re too small). This turned out to have a flawed assumption baked into it.</p><p>As will be described in a forthcoming post, the method I eventually landed upon involves starting with a question, not a book. If I start with a book and investigate the questions it brings up (you know, like I’ve been doing for the last 3-6 years), the book is controlling which questions get brought up. That’s a lot of power to give to something I have explicitly decided not to trust yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>When reading <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2019/12/03/epistemic-spot-check-the-unbound-prometheus/\">The Unbound Prometheus</a>, I took the book’s word that a lower European birth rate would prove Europeans were more rational than Asians and focused on determining whether Europe’s birth rates were in fact lower (answer: it’s complicated), when on reflection it’s not at all clear to me that lower birth rates are evidence of rationality.</li><li>“Do humans have exactly 4 hours of work per day in them?” is not actually a very useful question. What I really wanted to know is “when can I stop beating myself up for not working?“, and <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2019/06/21/epistemic-spot-check-the-role-of-deliberate-practice-in-the-acquisition-of-expert-performance/\">the answer</a> to the former doesn’t really help me with the latter. Even if humans on average have 4 hours, that doesn’t mean I do, and of course it varies by circumstances and type of work… and even “when can I stop beating myself up?” has some pretty problematic assumptions built into it, such as “beating myself up will produce more work, which is good.” The real question is something like “how can I approach my day to get the most out of it?”, and the research I did on verifying a paper on average daily work capacity didn’t inform the real question one way or the other.</li></ul><p>What would have been better is if I’d started with the actual question I wanted to answer, and then looked for books that had information bearing on that question (including indirectly, including very indirectly). This is what I’ve started doing.</p><p>This can look very different depending on what type of research I’m doing. When I started doing covid research, I generated a long list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/#/app/AcesoUnderGlass/page/_HLSm10TZ\"> fairly shallow questions</a>.&nbsp; Most of these questions were designed to inform specific choices, like “when should I wear what kind of mask?” and “how paranoid should I be about people without current symptoms?”, but some of them were broader and designed to inform multiple more specific questions, such as “what is the basic science of coronavirus?”. These broader, more basic questions helped me judge the information I used to inform the more specific, actionable questions (e.g., I saw a claim that covid lasted forever in your body the same way HIV does, which I could immediately dismiss because I knew HIV inserted itself your DNA and coronaviruses never enter the nucleus).</p><hr><p>I used to read a lot of nonfiction for leisure. Then I started doing <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2019/10/17/what-comes-after-epistemic-spot-checks/\">epistemic spot checks</a>– taking selected claims from a book and investigating them for truth value, to assess the book’s overall credibility- and stopped being able to read nonfiction without doing that, unless it was one of a very short list of authors who’d made it onto my trust list. I couldn’t take the risk that I was reading something false and would absorb it as if it were true (or true but unrepresentative, and absorb it as representative). My time spent reading nonfiction went way down.</p><p>About 9 months ago I started taking <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2019/10/24/epistemic-spot-check-the-fate-of-rome-round-2/\">really rigorous notes</a> when I read nonfiction. The gap in quality of learning between rigorous notes and my previous mediocre notes was about the same as the gap between doing an epistemic spot check and not. My time spent reading nonfiction went way up (in part because I was studying the process of doing so), but my volume of words read dropped precipitously.</p><p>And then three months ago I shifted from my unit of inquiry being “a book”, to being “a question”. I’m sure you can guess where this is going- I read fewer words, but gained more understanding per word, and especially more core (as opposed to shell or test) understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>The first two shifts happened naturally, and while I missed reading nonfiction for fun and with less effort, I didn’t feel any pull towards the old way after I discovered the new way. Giving up book-centered reading has been hard. Especially after five weeks of frantic covid research, all I wanted to do was to be sat down and told what questions were important, and perhaps be walked through some plausible answers. I labeled this a desire to learn, but when I compared it to question-centered research, it became clear that’s not what it was. Or maybe it was a desire to go through the act of learning something, but it was not a desire to answer a question I had and was not prioritized by the importance of a question. It was best classified as leisure in the form of learning, not resolving a curiosity I had.&nbsp; And if I wanted leisure, better to consume something easier and less likely to lead me astray, so I started reading more fiction, and the rare non-fiction of a type that did not risk polluting my pool of data. And honestly I’m not sure that’s so safe: humans are built to extract lessons from fiction too.</p><p>Put another way: I <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Cu5C5KhkoXhrPMLFN/goal-factoring\">goal factored</a> (figured out what I actually wanted from) reading a nonfiction book, and the goal was almost never best served by using a nonfiction book as a starting point. Investigating a question I cared about was almost always better for learning (even if it did eventually cash out in reading a book), and fiction was almost always better for leisure, in part because it was less tiring, and thus left more energy for question-centered learning when that was what I wanted.</p></body></html>",

Can adding a new fork that is more focused on good discourse on controversial/taboo topics be a good idea?</p>\n<p>I am an Iranian, and have a fair share of experience with bad epistemic conditions. Disengagement with politics is always a retreat, though it can be strategic at times. As time goes on, the politics of a memetic-based elite will increasingly infringe on your rights and freedoms. Aside from this, as your community’s status grows, your epistemic freedoms get a lot worse. The community itself will be increasingly infiltrated by the aggressive memetic structure, as the elite control the education, the media, and distribution of status/resources.</p>\n<p>The fact (IMHO) that the current object-level neo-religion(s) is also vastly superior in its dogma is also bad news for us. The better a religion is, the harder fighting it is. I, myself, believe a bit in the neo-religion.</p>\n<p>The rationalist/EA community has not invested much in creating a medium for controversial discourse. So there should be quite a bit of low-hanging fruit there. Different incentive mechanisms can be tried to see what works. I think anonymity will help a lot. (As a datapoint, Quora had anonymous posting in the past. I don’t know if they still do.) Perhaps hiding all karma scores might help, as well; (An anonymized score of the user’s karma on Lesswrong can be shown to distinguish “the old guard.”) Outsiders won’t have as much of an incentive to engage without a karma system. Posts that are, e.g., just ripping on the outgroup won’t be as attractive without the scores.</p>\n<p>A big issue is distancing the controversial forum from tainting Lesswrong’s brand. I don’t have good ideas for this. The problem is that we need to somehow connect this forum to Lesswrong’s community.</p>\n<p>Another direction to tackle the controversy problem is introducing jargon. Jargon repels newcomers, attracts academic-minded people, gives protection against witch-hunters, and raises the community’s status. (Its shortcomings should be obvious.) One of the ways it protects against witch hunters is that it signals that we are politically passive and merely “philosophizing.” Another reason (possibly what gives the signal its credibility) is that we automatically lose most of the population by going down this route. We have introduced artificial inferential distance, and thus made ourselves exclusive.</p>\n<p>I was going to post this as a reply to Wei Dai <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5xhnA6AK3gi6QSHMa/mod-notice-about-election-discussion\">here</a>, but I thought posting it as a top post might be wiser. This is less a post about my ideas and more a reminder that investing in defensive epistemic infrastructure is a worthwhile endeavor that this community has a comparative advantage in doing. This is true even if things don’t get worse, and even if the bad epistemic conditions have historical precedent. If things do get worse, the importance of these defenses obviously shots up. I am not well aquatinted with the priorities the EA community is pursuing, but creating better epistemic conditions seems a good cause to me. People’s needs aren’t just material/hedonic. They also need freedom of expression and thought. They also deserve the infrastructure to deal critically with invasive memes. There is a power imbalance between people and memes. It’s wrongness can be compared to child brides. I often feel most people who have not experienced being enthralled by aggressive memetic structures will underestimate its sheer grossness. The betrayal you feel after losing cherished beliefs that you held for years, the beliefs that colored so much of your perception and identity, that shaped your social life so much. It’s like you had lived a slave to the meme.</p>\n</body></html>",

This immediately made me think of art vs engineering. Ambiguous domains where people can't quite serialize how they produce good outputs(though we can recognize good output when we see it, wafts of P vs NP) vs domains where we can algorithmize the production of good outputs and take the ... human flair out of it.</p>\n<p>This post is me trying to work out what I think the 'hard work' is.</p>\n<h1>Is there a point at which conflict theory makes itself obsolete?</h1>\n<p>Is it still useful in the present, at least for people with utilitarian ethical axioms(all humans' utility is valuable, and aggregate utility should be maximised)?</p>\n<p>Mistake theory is about maximising utility for a set of entities, conflict theory is about expanding the set of entities under consideration. If you already want to maximize total human utility(do you though? and do your actions reflect this truly?), what can conflict theory do for you?</p>\n<h1>Mood-setting story: let's pretend we believe history advances over time by some metric</h1>\n<p>History(including biological history) progresses by expanding the circle of concern, making an individual's utility function include more and more entities outside the individual. It starts as a singular point, the individual itself(say among pre-social animals), grows to include the parent and children(in animals that take care of their own young), grows to include the expanded family group(most famous in social mammals and eusocial insects etc), grows to include the very expanded family group(tribes and proto-states and city-states).</p>\n<p>Within human history you expand the circle to include women, slaves, children, poor people, people of the same religion or appearance or language group, people absolutely everywhere currently alive, people alive in the past(ancestor worship), potential people alive in the future, animals, nature as a whole[1].</p>\n<p>The utility function held by an average person today has expanded to become some sort of universal(dare I say, divine) plan of perfect aesthetic optimization that has an opinion about absolutely everything and can put a moral weight on any action you perform.</p>\n<p>If you are a universal human utilitiarian, the expansion of the utility function to include all humans is ... tautological. It's already expanded to that point. The axiom is already maximise aggregate human utility(yes, there are edge cases, utility monsters bla bla).</p>\n<p>However, if you hold some earlier(or just more restrictive) ethical view, each expansion of the utility function requires some sort of conflict theoretical structure. You had to be persuaded to start caring about this category. This is, perhaps, a 0-sum game looking activity. You have to now spread the same amount of effort improving the utility of more entities(it's usually not actually 0-sum, because ... lots of reasons at each step).</p>\n<p>For a universal human utilitarian, all previously existing human conflict theories are unnecessary(or at best, heuristic) and all you need is mistake theory: how do we maximize utility for all humans? Oh yes, this group is not being included fairly in the optimisation function, add them in, obviously. What's all the fuss about?</p>\n<p>Of course conflict theorists can say: most people aren't universal human utilitarians. We're fighting to convince people to expand their utility function to include this group and their peculiar preferences. Echoes of this in current events abound.</p>\n<h1>What conflict theories might a utilitarian experience as actual conflict theories?</h1>\n<h2>Expanding the circle of concern past humans</h2>\n<p>Maybe expanding the circle of concern to include animal welfare? Should we weight them as much as humans? Of course, you say? How much violence would we support using against human baby farms and human baby rib BBQ lovers?</p>\n<p>How do we integrate non-human animals into our utility function? The feelings and debates spawned by this question produce the same types of feelings in me, I think, that people experienced when issues like emancipation were discussed. Obviously emancipation to me is axiomatically good, a total duh, so the conflict at the time is emotionally sterile: How on earth was anyone on the wrong side of that issue? Well, their circles of consideration were smaller.</p>\n<h2>Reducing the circle of concern</h2>\n<p>Utilitarianism currently cares about too many people.</p>\n<p>Various racist ideologies. Various tribal ideologies of all sort(whether based on culture, some biological marker, some aspect of heredity, geographical location). For instance, should a country care about foreign citizens as much as it does about it's own?</p>\n<p>Non-redemptive approaches to sin: The idea that some people's actions are so bad that their utility function should be removed from global maximum calculations or even inverted(punitive measures). Examples: criminals, kulaks, people with the wrong sexual orientation, sinners.</p>\n<p>There's a mistake theory version of this but it's <em>waaaaaaay</em> more complicated and probably game theoretically unstable: achieve a balance between reforming criminals and deterring crime. You might think of the Norway penal system as a clear ideal, but is it really a stable solution? How many people would rather be in a Norwegian prison, than walking around free in their own country? Millions? Billions? What level and type of criminality can it actually handle?</p>\n<h2>Highlight low-hanging fruit, hypocrisy and/or failings of real existing utilitarian calculations.</h2>\n<p>\"You claim that you are a utilitarian, but don't act accordingly, constantly defecting or leaving loads of other people's utility on the ground.\"</p>\n<p>\"You didn't include this group's preferences in your calculations so policies you thought they'd like they actually hate.\"</p>\n<p>\"There are huge errors in current policies, as revealed by better empirical measurements of outcomes.\"</p>\n<p>\"These policies that we thought would produce Positive Outcome A, are actually mostly producing Negative Outcome Z.\"</p>\n<p>This is more in line with the examples in the OP, I think. Conflict-theoretical group action used to emergency signal that society is not living up to the utilitiarian ideal. I don't think major historical conflict theories <em>felt</em> like this to the people living through them.</p>\n<h2>Accidentally turning approximations of uncertain outcomes into axioms</h2>\n<p>\"You think Policy A will lead to Good Outcome B with probability 50%, I think it will lead to Negative Outcome Z with probability 75%\"</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Putting percentages on gut feelings is necessary/terrible/unavoidable/still useful/an endless source of wasted breath and anger/a prerequisite to almost all human activity[2].</p>\n<p>Most ways to produce future utility involve some uncertainty. People will decide to support a policy or not in an almost blackbox, internal machine learning model sort of way. It's not possible to rigorously explain why the list of bad outcomes will mostly not happen and the list of good outcomes will mostly happen. It's a complicated mishmash of personal(or inter-personal or ideological) interpretations of past similar policies(and efforts to map or metaphorise why this this is the same).</p>\n<p>Because the internal process is mostly blackbox people end up axiomatising their policy preferences, since defending requires incredibly complicated, even complexity exploding arguments. See children asking why until you are reduced to yelling back: \"Because some things are and some things are not and things that are cannot not be\". And you've only travelled one branch out of a literal infinite set of logical branches connecting your policy preference to some fundamental universal axiom that all people can agree on as a ground truth.</p>\n<h1>Totally different angle: conflict theories work to invert default-exception and good-bad relationships</h1>\n<p>Private property by default - taxation is taking from the individual VS group ownership - whatever you consume as an individual is a gift.</p>\n<p>Existing people in power are good and should stay or even grow in power VS existing people in power are bad and need to have less power. Something something Nietzsche master vs slave morality.</p>\n<p>People should ideally conform to a sex/gender binary VS let everyone do whatever they want in the sex/gender space VS people who conform to the sex/gender binary are actually bad.</p>\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<p>[1] Leaving a good legacy presumably was a concern in ancient Rome just as it is today for the environmental movement; actually: when did concern for legacy beyond your immediate biological descendants really appear? development of writing? development of language and story telling? modern environmental movement?</p>\n<p>[2] STEM thinkers, analytic philosophers, mathy people, engineers are basically people who hate ever acting under untractable uncertainty(unknown unknowns, fat tailed or even statistically unmodellable situations, outcomes that depend on people's blackbox-like preferences) so they've structured their lives to avoid them as much as possible. This is why engineers' suggestions to political problems smell of the gulag. Human preferences must be standardised so that optimising for them becomes tractable.</p>\n<p>Some connection here to Seeing like a state and probably lots of other things.</p>\n<p>To bring out my inner Taleb: uncertainty kills stock market traders and the ones that survive defend themselves with ever more complex statistical models.</p>\n<p>Ironically, if explaining ML decision making ends up being impossible, programmers will have created their anathema. Life will increasingly be influenced by blackboxes that are even less comprehensible than human minds.</p>\n<p>Indeed, lack of explainability(or maybe ... human understandable explanations) is the main reason people hate impersonal societal forces. Why should someone that works hard suffer in an economic downturn? How can this be just or a good way of running the world? Good luck serializing the overall benefits of capitalism in a way that persuades someone that lost their job because someone ate a bat on the other side of the planet.</p>\n<p>Or maybe it's because Stockholm Syndrome is evolutionarily adaptive: we don't care about being hurt by someone as long as they give us clear rules we can obey in order to avoid the pain. This has been useful for so long that we've all got the gearing for it and the only thing we hate is being punished even though we followed the rules. After all in a hostage situation or if you're a recently captured slave after a tribal war, this betrayal signals that you need to fight to the death, your controller has signalled that they will probably kill you eventually regardless of what you do.</p>\n</body></html>",

It also discusses Scott's post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bYrF8rXFYwPqnfxTp/1960-the-year-the-singularity-was-cancelled\">1960: The Year the Singularity Was Cancelled</a>. The name of the post/paper is \"Modeling Human Trajectory\".</p><p>&nbsp;From the summary.</p><blockquote><p>One strand of analysis that has caught our attention is about the pattern of growth of human society over many millennia, as measured by number of people or value of economic production. Perhaps the mathematical shape of the past tells us about the shape of the future. I dug into that subject. A draft of my technical paper is <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/sites/default/files/Modeling-the-human-trajectory.pdf\">here</a>. (Comments welcome.) In this post, I’ll explain in less technical language what I learned.</p><p>It’s extraordinary that the larger the human economy has become—the more people and the more goods and services they produce—the faster it has grown on average. Now, especially if you’re reading quickly, you might think you know what I mean. And you might be wrong, because I’m not referring to exponential growth. That happens when, for example, the number of people carrying a virus doubles every week. Then the <i>growth rate</i> (100% increase per week) holds fixed. The human economy has grown <i>super</i>-exponentially. The bigger it has gotten, the faster it has doubled, on average. The global economy churned out $74 trillion in goods and services in 2019, twice as much as in 2000.<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory#footnote1_o83buay\"><strong>1</strong></a> Such a quick doubling was unthinkable in the Middle Ages and ancient times. Perhaps our earliest doublings took millennia.</p><p>If global economic growth keeps accelerating, the future will differ from the present to a mind-boggling degree. The question is whether there might be <i>some</i> plausibility in such a prospect. That is what motivated my exploration of the mathematical patterns in the human past and how they could carry forward. Having now labored long on the task, I doubt I’ve gained much perspicacity. I did come to appreciate that any system whose rate of growth rises with its size is inherently unstable. The human future might be one of explosion, perhaps an economic upwelling that eclipses the industrial revolution as thoroughly as <i>it</i> eclipsed the agricultural revolution. Or the future could be one of implosion, in which environmental thresholds are crossed or the creative process that drives growth runs amok, as in an AI dystopia. More likely, these impulses will mix.</p></blockquote><p>And from the conclusion.</p><blockquote><p>I do not know whether most of the history of technological advance on Earth lies behind us or ahead of us. I do know that it is far easier to imagine what has happened than what hasn’t. I think it would be a mistake to laugh off or dismiss the predictions of infinity emerging from good models of the past. Better to take them as stimulants to our imaginations. I believe the predictions of infinity tell us two key things. First, if the patterns of history continue, then some sort of economic explosion will take place again, the most plausible channel being AI. It wouldn’t reach infinity, but it could be big. Second, and more generally, I take the propensity for explosion as a sign of <i>instability</i> in the human trajectory. Gross world product, as a rough proxy for the scale of the human enterprise, might someday spike or plunge or follow complicated paths in between. The projections of explosion should be taken as indicators of the long-run tendency of the human system to diverge. They are hinting that realistic models of long-term development are unstable, and stable models of long-term development unrealistic. The credible range of future paths is indeed wide.</p><p><i>Data and code for the paper and for this post are on </i><a href=\"https://github.com/droodman/Modeling-Human-Trajectory\"><i>GitHub</i></a><i>.</i></p></blockquote><p>Holden Karnofsky also gives his thoughts on the piece, which I found quite interesting.</p><blockquote><p>Some personal reactions on this piece:</p><p>First, a note on how it came about and what I think the relevance to our work is. I asked David to evaluate Robin Hanson’s <a href=\"http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/longgrow.html\">work on long-term growth as a sequence of exponential growth modes.</a> I found it interesting that an attempt to extrapolate future economic growth from the past (with very little reasoning other than attempting to essentially trend-extrapolate) implied a strong chance of explosive growth in the next few decades, but I wasn’t convinced that Hanson’s approach was the best method of doing such trend extrapolation. I asked David how he would extrapolate future growth based on the past, and this is the result. The model is very different from Hanson’s (and I prefer it), but it too has an implication of explosive growth in the next few decades.</p><p>On its own, seeing trend extrapolation exercises with this implication doesn’t necessarily mean much. However, I independently have a view (based on other reasoning) that <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/some-background-our-views-regarding-advanced-artificial-intelligence\">transformative AI could plausibly be developed in the next couple of decades</a>. I think one of the best reasons to be skeptical of this view about transformative AI is that it seemingly implies a major “trend break”: it seems that it would, one way or another, have to mean world economic growth well outside the 1-3% range that it’s been pretty steady in for the last couple of centuries. However, Hanson’s and Roodman’s work both imply that a broader look at economic history demonstrates accelerating growth, and that in this sense, expecting that “the future will be like the past” could be entirely consistent with expecting radically world-changing technology to be developed in the coming decades.</p><p>Like David, I wouldn’t take the model discussed in this piece literally, but I tentatively agree with what I see as the central themes: that a sufficiently broad view of history shows accelerating growth, that this dynamic is inherently unstable, and that we therefore have little reason to “rule out” explosive growth in the coming decades.</p><p>We are working on a number of other analyses regarding the likelihood of transformative AI being developed in the coming decades. One topic we’re exploring is a potential followup on this piece in which we would try to understand the degree to which growth economists find this piece’s central themes reasonable, and what objections are most common.</p><p>Now a few comments on ways in which I see things differently from how David sees them. I should start by saying that any model makes simplifications, and this is a case where extreme simplifications are particularly called for. However, if I’d written this post I would’ve called out the following non-modeled dynamics as particularly worth noting.</p><p>1 - this post’s multivariate model does not match the way I intuitively model what I call the “technological landscape.” Some discoveries and technological developments enable others, so there is in some sense an “order” in which we’ve developed new technologies that might be fairly stable across multiple possible versions of history. And some technologies are more impactful than others. There may thus be important natural structure that leads to inevitable (as opposed to stochastic) acceleration <i>and</i> deceleration, as the world hits phases where there are more vs. less impactful technologies being discovered. The most obvious way in which I expect the “technological landscape “ to matter is that at some point, I think the world could “run out of new findings” - at which point technology could stop improving. I see this as a likely way that real-world growth could avoid going to infinity in finite time, without needing to invoke natural resource limits.</p><p>2 - it seems to me that a more realistic multivariate model would have natural resource shortages leading to growth “leveling off” rather than spiking and imploding. E.g., at the point where natural resources are foreseeably going to be a bottleneck on growth, I expect them to become more expensive and hence more carefully conserved. I’m not sure whether this would apply to a long enough time frame to make a big visual difference to the charts in this post, but I still thought it was worth mentioning.</p><p>3 - I’m interested in the <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/22/1960-the-year-the-singularity-was-cancelled/\">hypothesis</a> that the recent “stagnation” this model sees is largely driven by the fact that population growth has slowed, which in turn limits the rate of technological advance. Advances in AI could later lead to a dynamic in which capital can more efficiently substitute for labor’s (and/or human capital’s) role in technological advance. This is an example of how the shape of the “technological landscape” could explain some of the “surprises” seen in David’s tests of the model.</p><p>4 - regarding this statement in David’s piece:</p><p><i>The scenario is, one hopes, unrealistic. Its realism will depend on whether human enterprise ultimately undermines itself by depleting a natural endowment such as safe water supplies or the greenhouse gas absorptive capacity of the atmosphere; or whether we skirt such limits by, for example, switching to climate-safe energy sources and using them to clean the water and store the carbon.</i></p><p>In worlds where explosive growth of the kind predicted by David’s model occured, I’d anticipate radical changes to the way the world looks (for example, civilization expanding outside of Earth), which could significantly change the picture of what resources are scarce.</p></blockquote></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Is progress slowing down?</p><p>Those who favor the stagnation hypothesis point out that, other than computing, most fields have seen only modest, incremental improvements. Our cars, planes, factories, food supply, antibiotics, and so forth are just improved versions of what we had in, say, 1960.</p><p>The counter-argument is: Wait, what do you mean, “other than computing?” How can you just ignore the area where we <i>have</i> seen revolutionary progress? Saying, “other than orders of magnitude increases in capacity, performance, and cost; revolutionizing all of communications; connecting every human being on Earth; and putting all the world’s knowledge and culture in every pocket; what has technology done lately?” sounds a lot like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7tvauOJMHo\">what have the Romans ever done for us?</a>”</p><p>The rebuttal to the counter-argument is: Computing is just one area. We used to have revolutionary changes going on in <i>multiple</i> areas at once:</p><ul><li>1870–1920 saw the the <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/why-ac-won\">electric generator, electric motor, and light bulb</a>; the telephone, wireless, phonograph, and film; the first automobiles and airplanes, and the assembly lines to build them; the first synthetic plastic (Bakelite); <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/the-13th-labor-of-hercules\">the Panama Canal</a>; <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/turning-air-into-bread\">the Haber-Bosch process</a>; and the germ theory, along with <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/draining-the-swamp\">its applications to public health</a>.</li><li>1920–1970 saw radio, television, radar, and the first computers; the invention of nylon and other plastics; the expansion of mass manufacturing with an explosion of consumer products; penicillin and the golden age of antibiotics; Norman Borlaug’s Green Revolution in agriculture; nuclear power; the interstate highway system, jet airplanes, and the Moon landing.</li><li>1970–2020 saw … the PC, Internet, smartphone, and GPS; and genetic engineering, including GMOs. It also saw the Apollo project ended, the first supersonic passenger jet launched and then canceled, the promise of nuclear power unfulfilled, a <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history/national-cancer-act-1971\">War on Cancer</a> with <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/01/cancer-progress-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/\">lackluster results</a>, and similarly modest progress against heart disease. Yes, there were <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Improvements\">many incremental improvements in a variety of areas</a> that are easy to forget about, but that’s the point—there were fewer revolutionary breakthroughs.</li></ul><p>Another way of putting this is that if you look at a 1970 living room vs. a modern one, not much has visibly changed—again, other than the computer (and related technology, such as the big flat screen TV that has replaced your clunky CRT).</p><hr><p>If progress <i>is</i> slowing down, what’s causing it?</p><p>One hypothesis is that we ate all the low-hanging fruit. This is literally the subtitle of Tyler Cowen’s <a href=\"https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/01/31/the-great-stagnation-low-hanging-fruit-and-americas-sputnik-moment/\">book on stagnation</a>, and it was <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/26/is-science-slowing-down-2/\">Scott Alexander’s conclusion</a> as well.</p><p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/c0THmpbc_DQ?t=774\">when I brought up this idea</a> on a panel discussion with Michael Nielsen, he rejected an oversimplified low-hanging fruit analysis, pointing out that when we discover <i>new</i> fields, such as computer science, they open up whole new orchards of low-hanging fruit. Or as he and Patrick Collison <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/\">wrote in <i>The Atlantic</i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose we think of science—the exploration of nature—as similar to the exploration of a new continent. In the early days, little is known. Explorers set out and discover major new features with ease. But gradually they fill in knowledge of the new continent. To make significant discoveries explorers must go to ever-more-remote areas, under ever-more-difficult conditions. Exploration gets harder. In this view, science is a limited frontier, requiring ever more effort to “fill in the map.” One day the map will be near complete, and science will largely be exhausted. In this view, any increase in the difficulty of discovery is intrinsic to the structure of scientific knowledge itself. …<br>But there’s a different point of view, a point of view in which science is an endless frontier, where there are always new phenomena to be discovered, and major new questions to be answered. …<br>… the optimistic view is that science is an endless frontier, and we will continue to discover and even create entirely new fields, with their own fundamental questions. If we see a slowing today, it is because science has remained too focused on established fields, where it’s becoming ever harder to make progress. We hope the future will see a more rapid proliferation of new fields, giving rise to major new questions. This is an opportunity for science to accelerate.</p></blockquote><hr><p>I think both of these questions can get confused if we don’t tease apart the S-curves.</p><p>Every technology, defined narrowly enough, goes through an S-curve: it starts out small, picks up steam, hits a hockey-stick inflection point, grows exponentially—and then starts to near saturation, slows down, levels off, plateaus. Electricity, for instance, went through an experimental/inventive phase for decades, grew rapidly starting in the 1880s, then leveled off in the early 20th century as power and lighting spread to the whole country. Today, with the power grid providing virtually universal coverage, electricity is not a high-growth industry.</p><figure><img src=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/img/perez-technology-lifecycle.jpg\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311\"><i>Source: Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital, by Carlota Perez</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Sustained growth over the long term, over centuries, comes from layering many S-curves on top of each other, something like this:</p><figure><img src=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/img/jumping-s-curves.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/S-curves-representation-of-the-evolution-of-product-performance_fig1_307208726\"><i>Credit: Juan Cols</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>As one plateaus, investment and talent shift to new, more promising areas. If Edison and Westinghouse were young men today, they wouldn’t be working on electricity; they’d be hacking up cryptocurrency apps, or building self-driving cars, or tinkering with 3D printing. George Stephenson wouldn’t be building a locomotive named <i>Rocket</i>, but an actual rocket. Pasteur would be doing genetic engineering.</p><p>With this lens, we can bring the debates above into sharper focus. Rather than ask whether computing “counts” or whether we’re running out of low-hanging fruit, we can investigate, separately, the size and shape of individual S-curves, vs. the distribution of S-curves. We can ask questions like:</p><ul><li>What is the rate of discovering new S-curves? How has that changed over time?</li><li>Are today’s S-curves, individually, developing faster or slower than before?</li><li>Are the steep parts as steep as they used to be?</li><li>Are they plateauing at a higher or lower level?</li><li>What is the distribution of these characteristics, over the set of all S-curves?</li></ul><p>I’m not sure how to begin investigating these questions, since progress is notoriously tricky to measure, and I’m not even sure these are exactly the right questions, or which of them are even well-defined. But I think this is the sort of analysis we need if we’re going to resolve the big issues, instead of having unproductive debates over living rooms and the height of fruit.</p></body></html>",

Part of ongoing research on consciousness.</i></p><p>I wrote an intro to some of my thoughts on consciousness <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nYL3GnFNhBAS8fn26/consciousness-as-metaphor-what-jaynes-has-to-offer\">here</a>, which was more conceptual and less neurosciency. This post is a snap-shot of some of the current technical questions that are on my mind. Please chime in if you know anything relevant to any of them. This is a pretty high context snap-shot and might not be that useful without familiarity with many of the ideas and research.</p><h1>Q.1: &nbsp;Is the global neuronal workspace a bottleneck for motor control?</h1><p>(Kaj's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq\">GNW intro</a>, GNW <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory\">wikipedia page</a>)</p><p>Some observations to help build up context for the question and my confusion around it (it ends up being less a question and more a hypothesis I'm asserting).</p><p><strong>Observation 1</strong>: People have trouble multitasking in <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7972591/\">dual-task</a> style experiments, but training can improve their performance.</p><p><strong>Corollary of 1</strong>: Some tasks requires attention and you can't do multiple things that require attention. But if you practice something a lot, you can do it \"unconsciously\", and you can do several \"unconscious\" tasks at the same time.</p><p><strong>Observation 2</strong>: The \"conscious bottleneck\" seems to come into play during decision making / action-selection when in a novel or uncertain setting (i.e performing an unpracticed and unfamiliar task)</p><p><strong>Corollary of 2</strong>: The \"conscious bottleneck\" is a conflict resolution mechanism for when competing subsystems have different ideas on how to drive the body.</p><p>I think these are all basically true, but I now think that the implicit picture I was drawing based off of them is wrong. Here's what I used to think: the conscious bottleneck is basically the GNW. This serial, bottlenecked, conflict resolution mechanism really only is used when things go wrong. When two subsystems try to send conflicting commands to the body, or you get sense data that wildly violates your priors. The brain can basically \"go about it's business\" and do things in a parallel way, only having to deal with the conflict resolution process of the GNW if there's error.</p><p>Easy tasks can route around the global workspace, hard ones or ones that produce error have to go through it. That's the previous idea. Now, <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(09)00458-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627309004589%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">this paper</a> has begun to shift my thinking. For a specific set of tasks, it claims to show that training <i>doesn't</i> shift activity away from a bottleneck location, but instead makes the processing <i>at</i> the point of the bottleneck more efficient.</p><figure><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95873dc19eda5e88b9ec57e61d95c0807b557a7cbb8e3b9a.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95873dc19eda5e88b9ec57e61d95c0807b557a7cbb8e3b9a.png/w_86 86w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95873dc19eda5e88b9ec57e61d95c0807b557a7cbb8e3b9a.png/w_166 166w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95873dc19eda5e88b9ec57e61d95c0807b557a7cbb8e3b9a.png/w_246 246w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95873dc19eda5e88b9ec57e61d95c0807b557a7cbb8e3b9a.png/w_326 326w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95873dc19eda5e88b9ec57e61d95c0807b557a7cbb8e3b9a.png/w_406 406w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/95873dc19eda5e88b9ec57e61d95c0807b557a7cbb8e3b9a.png/w_486 486w\"><figcaption>sorta like this</figcaption></figure><p>This made me very dubious of the idea that \"central conflict resolution mechanism\" and \"subsystems that have direct access to the nervous system\" could coexist. Even though there is some centralized processing in the brain, it looks nothing like a central agent dispatching orders, commanding around other subsystems. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608097000609\">This paper</a>, though mostly over my head, paints a pretty cool picture of how the \"winner takes all\" broadcast aspect of the GNW is implemented in the brain, in a funky distributed way that doesn't rely on a \"central chooser\".&nbsp;</p><p>If subsystems had to route through the GNW to trigger motor actions, then this system or some variation could totally account for the serial conflict resolution function. But if subsystems can directly send motor commands without going through the GNW, how would would subsystems in conflict be \"told to stop\" while the conflict resolution happens? The GNW is not a commander, it can't order subsystems around. Though it may be central to consciousness, it's not the \"you\" that commands and thinks.</p><p>All this leaves me thinking that I'm either missing a big obvious chunk of research, or that various motor-planning parts of the brain can't send motor commands except via the GNW. Please point me at any relevant research that you know of.</p><h1>Q.2: Can activity on the GNW account for all experience?</h1><p>One of the big claims of GNW is that something being broadcast on the GNW <i><strong>is</strong></i> what it means to be conscious of that thing. Given the serial, discrete nature of the GNW, it follows that consciousness is fundamentally a discrete and choppy thing, not a smooth continuous stream.</p><p>From having been around this idea for a while, I can spot a lot of my own experience that at first seemed continuous, but revealed itself to be discrete upon inspection. Some advanced meditaters even describe interesting experiences like being able to see the \"<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha/\">clock tick of consciousness</a>\". So for a while I've been willing to tentatively run with the idea that to experience something is to have that something active on the GNW. But recently while reading the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Tennis-Classic-Performance/dp/0679778314\"><i>Inner Game of Tennis</i></a> I was reminded of a different flavor of awareness, one that's a bit harder to reconcile with the discrete framework. Flow, \"Being In the Zone\", and the Buddhist \"no-self\". All of these states are ones where you act without having to \"think\", are intensely in the moment, and often don't even feel like it's \"you\" moving, it's as if you body is just operating on it's own.</p><p><i>Inner Game of Tennis</i> contrasts this to typical moments when your \"self 1\" is active and is constantly engaged in judgement and is trying to shout commands at you to produce an outcome. \"In the zone\" vs \"self-aware judgement mode\" is probably something most people can relate to. The Buddhist no-self is a bit more intense, but I think it's fundamentally the same thing. Kaj's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/W59Nb72sYJhMJKGB8\">recent post</a> is an excellent exploration of no-self from a GNW perspective. I think the no-self angle does a better job of exploring the way that the self/ego-mind/\"self 1\" is a constructed thing that is experienced, and is not actually <i>you</i>. It's the difference between being aware of your breath, and being aware of a memory of your breath, or the thought \"I'm aware of my breath\".</p><p>The constructed ego-mind narrative that get's experienced clearly is discrete and choppy. But is no-self? Is being in a total state of flow in a championship tennis game still an experience that is mediated/bottlenecked by the GNW? I take pause because of the vast difference in how broad my awareness feels when I'm in flow vs in the ego-mind. I take in more of my surroundings, I feel more of where my body is in space and time. It all seems much more high resolution that typical ego-mind consciousness, does the GNW have a good enough \"frame rate\" to account for it?</p><p>There are two main lines of thought I have on how to think of this problem.&nbsp;</p><h2>Attentional Blink</h2><p>Both the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_blink\">attentional blink</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_refractory_period#:~:text=The%20term%20psychological%20refractory%20period,stimulus%20is%20still%20being%20processed.\">psychological refractory period</a> seem related to a possible \"frame rate of attention/consciousness/GNW\". The below image tells you almost everything you need to know about the classic type of attentional blink experiment.</p><figure style=\"width:62.96%;\"><img src=\"https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/5aa410be0d2790ac7e7154b26df9a1670fee36ce/2-Figure1-1.png\"><figcaption>(<a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-boost-and-bounce-theory-of-temporal-attention.-Olivers-Meeter/5aa410be0d2790ac7e7154b26df9a1670fee36ce/figure/0\">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>You're told to look out for two targets (T1, T2) in a stream of symbols. If the targets are too close together, people fail to see the second target. It's almost as if paying attention to the first target causes a \"blink\", and you can't pay attention to or process anything else during that blinking period. The attentional blink has often been framed as key evidence for a central bottleneck that has inescapable limit to how fast it can process data.</p><p>It turned out to not be as simple as I previously thought (here's a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763409001961\">lit review</a> that covers shifts in research on the subject). If you put <i>three</i> targets all in a row, people are able to detect them just fine. Additionally, if you ask people to remember the entire sequence they can do better than when you ask them to just remember only some of the characters (up till the point where you max out working memory). This makes <i>no</i> sense if the earlier experiments where interacting with a fundamental processing period that anything being attended to requires.&nbsp;</p><figure style=\"width:74.07%;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8Tu8aXV3Bw_8yzS_RfudzAMm1kF_hUsZx8v85Z_CdkNC5zmrwm57EgN1AGxvB_pzocSUoQqyV2i2HfOZ2LNeOvyqXfWybpnP8Hicai-f3Hu3qIK_29fPqSodB5Kgaybbn9AicZeF\"><figcaption>images summarize the experiments mentioned above, from the previously linked lit review</figcaption></figure><p>I found some papers that propose new models of the attentional blink, but haven't had time to explore them, nor have I gotten a sense of if they still relate this phenomena to a central bottleneck, or how the idea of a bottleneck is modified to accommodate these experiments. So I guess this is a temporary roadblock to exploring a \"frame rate\" idea.</p><h2>Post hoc unpacking of information, filling in a story of experience with a guess at what was happening</h2><p>Think back to ego-mind consciousness for a second. It generally maintains the experience that it is a high resolution constant stream of details, but it can be more useful to see it as a system that is flexibly constructing a story about what is happening, and you can \"ping\" that story to see it's current state. This story is constructed over time; it's not just a direct copy of \"what you were experiencing\", it can be added to and grown. So when you reflect back on \"what was I experiencing 5 seconds ago?\" you can find a lot more detail than what was in your experience in that exact moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Might there be a similar effect with the experience of flow states?</p><p>Ex. I'm in the zone, and I <i>feel</i> like I know exactly where my body is in space in time. My naive interpretation is that this experience is produced by hundreds or thousands of little snippets of somatic info being routed through the GNW. But, what if when I'm experiencing acute awareness of my body, what I'm experiencing is a \"active, high alert, and ready\" signal being put on the GNW. Maybe the \"consciously active information\" that makes up this experience is not hundreds of bits of data, but just a \"ready\" signal. Maybe afterwards when I reflect on the experience, and because of the rich \"high alert\" state I can draw out a lot of details about where exactly my body was, but in the moment that's not actually what was active in my GNW.&nbsp;</p><p>Not married to this one, &nbsp;but I think it's an avenue I want to look more into.</p><h1>Q.3: How does the predictive processing account of attention play with the GNW account?</h1><p>(I'm also just generally interested in how these two models can or can't jive with each other. They are trying to explain different things, and so aren't competing models, and yet there's plenty of areas where they seem to both have something to say about a topic.)</p><p>Attention for GNW: Working memory is more or less the functional \"workplace\", and the GNW is the backbone that supports updating and maintenance of working memory, allowing its contents to be operated on by the various subsystems (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/7zQPYQB5EeaqLrhBh\">Kaj's post</a> (wow, I'm linking to Kaj's posts a lot, it's almost like they're amazing and you should read the whole sequence), and the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136466131100088X?casa_token=tLl8FXFTujsAAAAA:W75T7mIIU592otGq0de_s7iRq61g6EnmQg_vpSbtNQ-p-43L2_g4gty03xleOItuPNPS1ErUWw\">Dehaene paper</a>). Having attention on something corresponds to that something either actively being broadcast on the GNW, or having it in working memory; both are states where the info is at hand accessible.</p><p>In predictive processing, attention is a system that manipulates the confidence intervals on your predictions. Low attention -&gt; wide intervals -&gt; lots of mismatch between prediction and data doesn't register as an error. High attention -&gt; tighter intervals -&gt; slight mismatch leads to error signal.&nbsp;</p><p>These two notions of what's happening when something is in your attention aren't incompatible, but I don't have a sense of how GNW attention can mediate and produce the functions of PP attention. The metaphors I'm using to conceptualize GNW are quite relevant to this. The GNW seems like it can only broadcast \"simple\" or \"small\" things. A single image, a percept, a signal. Something like a hypothesis in the PP paradigm seems like too big and complex a thing to be \"sent\" on the GNW. How does GNW attention relate to or cause the tightening of acceptable error bounds in a hierarchy of predictive models? If a hypothesis is too big a thing to put on the GNW, then it can't be laid out and then \"operated on\" by other systems. If coming to attention somehow triggers a hypothesis to adjust its own confidence intervals, what's to stop it from adjusting them whenever? If coming to attention somehow triggers some other confidence-interval-tightening system to interact with the hypothesis, why couldn't it interact with the hypothesis before hand?</p><p>Basically I've got no sense of how attention in the GNW sense can mediate and trigger the sorts of processes that correspond to attention in the PP sense. All schemes I think up involve a centralized \"commander\" architecture, and everything else I'm learning about the mind doesn't seem to jive with that notion. The research I've been doing makes centralization in the brain seem much more \"router\" like than \"commander\" like.</p></body></html>",

But we still haven’t talked about why this would actually happen in practice - i.e. why humans would learn high-level models which are related to the universe’s lower-level structure in this way. For now, my main argument is “after looking at lots of examples that’s what seems to happen in practice”, but eventually I expect to prove that this is a general property of Bayesian learning in causal universes.</p><p>Second, we’ve only mentioned DAG-shaped causality, not causality with loops. If we want to deal with e.g. equilibrium processes, then we need to expand out the whole trajectory-over-time. I expect the arguments above do extend to loopy graphs, but it’s not something I’ve put any thought into; I usually just ignore non-DAG notions of causality.</p><p>Third, our main conclusion says “if a DAG&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"G\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">G</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;models the family of high-level interventional distributions on far-apart variables, then it also models the family of low-level interventional distributions on the corresponding variables”.

My intention is for future posts to then apply this model to many covid-related dynamics.</p><p>In Elizabeth’s<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Z5wF8mdonsM2AuGgt/negative-feedback-and-simulacra\"> Negative Feedback and Simulacra</a>, she examined several example situations on which information was being processed on multiple simulacra levels at once. <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/03/on-negative-feedback-and-simulacra/\">On Negative Feedback and Simulacra</a> was my take on those examples.</p><p>To re-familiarize ourselves with the simulacra levels, here’s the introduction Elizabeth offered to them <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Z5wF8mdonsM2AuGgt/negative-feedback-and-simulacra\">in her post</a>:</p><blockquote><p>My friend <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/\">Ben Hoffman</a> talks about simulacra a lot, with this rough definition:</p><p>First, words were used to maintain shared accounting. We described reality intersubjectively in order to build shared maps, the better to navigate our environment. I say that the food source is over there, so that our band can move towards or away from it when situationally appropriate, or so people can make other inferences based on this knowledge.</p><p>2. The breakdown of naive intersubjectivity – people start taking the shared map as an object to be manipulated, rather than part of their own subjectivity. For instance, I might say there’s a lion over somewhere where I know there’s food, in order to hoard access to that resource for idiosyncratic advantage. Thus, the map drifts from reality, and we start dissociating from the maps we make.</p><p>3. When maps drift far enough from reality, in some cases people aren’t even parsing it as though it had a literal specific objective meaning that grounds out in some verifiable external test outside of social reality. Instead, the map becomes a sort of <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/actors-and-scribes-words-and-deeds/\">command language</a> for coordinating actions and feelings. “There’s food over there” is perhaps construed as a bid to move in that direction, and evaluated as though it were that call to action. Any argument for or against the implied call to action is conflated with an argument for or against the proposition literally asserted. This is how <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer\">arguments become soldiers</a>. Any attempt to simply investigate the literal truth of the proposition is considered at best naive and at worst politically irresponsible.</p><p>But since this usage is parasitic on the old map structure that was meant to describe something outside the system of describers, language is still structured in terms of reification and objectivity, so it substantively resembles something with descriptive power, or “aboutness.” For instance, while you cannot acquire a physician’s privileges and social role simply by providing clear evidence of your ability to heal others, those privileges are still justified in terms of pseudo-consequentialist arguments about expertise in healing.</p><p>4. Finally, the pseudostructure itself becomes perceptible as an object that can be manipulated, the pseudocorrespondence breaks down, and all assertions are nothing but moves in an ever-shifting game where you’re trying to think a bit ahead of the others (for positional advantage), but not too far ahead.</p></blockquote><p>If that doesn’t make sense, try this anonymous <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fEX7G2N7CtmZQ3eB5/simulacra-and-subjectivity?commentId=FgajiMrSpY9MxTS8b\">comment</a> on the post</p><blockquote><p>Level 1: “There’s a lion across the river.” = There’s a lion across the river.</p><p>Level 2: “There’s a lion across the river.” = I don’t want to go (or have other people go) across the river.</p><p>Level 3: “There’s a lion across the river.” = I’m with the popular kids who are too cool to go across the river.</p><p>Level 4: “There’s a lion across the river.” = A firm stance against trans-river expansionism focus grouped well with undecided voters in my constituency.</p></blockquote><p>Almost everyone would rather not be eaten by a lion. I certainly would rather not be eaten by a lion.</p><p>Whether or not I am eaten by a lion still does not drive much of my decision making. It is highly implausible that I will be eaten by a lion.</p><p>I hope that if in the future it becomes plausible that I may get eaten by a lion, how to not get eaten by a lion would then drive much of my decision making.</p><p>If the presence of lions in various places would not put anyone in any danger, that makes it much less expensive for me to be wrong about where they are. The less people are concerned about the consequences of having or inflicting incorrect object-level models of the world, the less concerned they will be with Level 1 and with the Level 1 accuracy of their statements.</p><p>The prioritization of various simulacra levels becomes a habit. If you are used to interpreting “There’s a lion across the river” almost entirely as “I’m with the popular kids who are too cool to go across the river,” because that’s what it almost always means in your village, it may be very difficult for someone to say “No, really, I’m not associating with the cool kids right now. There’s literally an actual lion across the actual river and if you cross the river you will die.”&nbsp;</p><p>There is no good way to sacrifice the cool points in order to communicate the presence of a lion. Even if it works at first, soon there will be a tendency for the new wording to become the canonical form of “I’m with the popular kids who are too cool to go across the river.”</p><p>If everyone’s instinct is to interpret “There’s a lion across the river” as <i>both </i>“There is an actual lion across the actual river” and <i>also </i>“I’m with the kids who are too cool to cross the river” then there is a chance.</p><p>There is still a barrier. Whoever wants to share knowledge of the lion will become less cool by doing so. Ideally, for high enough stakes, this stops being a problem in multiple ways. If lives are at stake, especially one’s own or one’s loved ones, being cool looks less important than avoiding the lion. Ideally, being the person who saved us from the lion is also considered kind of cool, allowing one to both starve lions and look cool. That only works if everyone realizes the lion was there. But the payoff could be very large. So there’s a chance.</p><p>Whereas, if things are too forsaken, one <i>loses the ability to communicate about the lion at all. </i>There is no combination of sounds one can make that makes people think there is an actual lion across an actual river that will actually eat them if they cross the river.</p><p>I’m not trying to be subtle here. You can guess where this is going.</p><h2>There’s a Virus Across The Ocean</h2><p><strong>Level 1</strong></p><p><strong>“There’s a pandemic headed our way from China”</strong> means “there’s a pandemic headed our way from China.”</p><p><strong>“There’s no pandemic headed our way from China”</strong> means “there’s <strong>no</strong> pandemic headed our way from China.”</p><p><strong>Level 2</strong></p><p><strong>“There’s a pandemic headed our way from China”</strong> means “I want you to act as if you think there might be a pandemic on our way from China” while hoping to still be interpreted by the listener as meaning “There’s a pandemic headed our way from China.”</p><p>The speaker hopes to be interpreted as still meaning “There’s a pandemic headed our way from China.”</p><p>This may involve any of the following:</p><p>“I want you to click on this headline about a pandemic headed our way from China and/or subscribe to and share my newsletter, website or channel.”</p><p>“I want you to have more negative affect towards China and/or other foreigners.”</p><p>“I want you to be afraid.”</p><p>“I want to shut down economic activity.”</p><p>“I want to sell you toilet paper, masks and hand sanitizer at premium prices.”</p><p>“I want you to thank me later for any or all of the above.”</p><p><strong>“There is no pandemic headed our way from China”</strong> means “I want you to act as if you think there is <strong>not</strong> a pandemic headed our way from China.”&nbsp;</p><p>The speaker hopes to be interpreted as still meaning “There is not a pandemic headed our way from China.”</p><p>This may include any of the following:</p><p>“I want you to click on this headline about there not being a pandemic headed our way from China and/or subscribe to and share my newsletter, website or channel.”</p><p>“I want you to have more positive affect towards China and/or other foreigners.”</p><p>“I do not want you to be afraid.”</p><p>“I want to stop you from hoarding toilet paper, masks and hand sanitizer.”</p><p>“I want to avoid shutting down economic activity.”</p><p>“I want you to thank me later for any or all of the above.”</p><p><strong>Level 1 vs. Level 2</strong></p><p>The key difference is in the intended effect of the statement made, and to what extent the statement is correlated with the true state of the physical world.</p><p>Level 2 statements <i>do not have to be untrue. </i>Nor need it be something you do not believe. It is often said that “the truth is the best lie.”</p><p>Nor need the statement be selfish. Many Level 2 statements really are intended <i>for the subject’s ‘own good.’&nbsp;</i></p><p>What makes a statement Level 2 rather than Level 1 is that <i>you don’t care whether or not it is true</i>. Instead, you care about what actions it causes people to take, and whether or not you like those actions.</p><p>If there is a <i>tiger </i>across the river, but the group is insufficiently afraid of tigers, you might claim there is a lion across the river instead.</p><p>If there is a tiger across the river, but you have a shotgun and are itching to get a tiger’s head as a trophy, you might claim there is not a lion across the river, so that we will cross the river. Whether or not you are aware of a lion across the river doesn’t matter. A lion would prevent you from hunting tigers. You want to hunt a tiger.</p><p><strong>The Four Direct Communicators</strong></p><p>Sticking to the first two levels for now, we can divide into quadrants and see five types of communication strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>Let V = “There is a virus across the ocean that is likely to cause a pandemic here.”</p><p>Let ~V = “There is not a virus across the ocean that is likely to cause a pandemic here.”</p><p>Let C = The consequences of being told V.</p><p>Let ~C = The consequences of being told ~V.</p><p>Let N = The consequences of being told nothing. For simplicity assume everyone either believes that C&gt;N, or that ~C&gt;N.</p><p><strong>The Oracle</strong> only looks at Level 1. The Oracle says V if and only if The Oracle believes V with sufficient confidence, says ~V if they believe ~V with sufficient confidence, and says nothing or “I don’t know” otherwise. They care not whether C&gt;~C or ~C&gt;C.</p><p><strong>The Trickster</strong> only looks at Level 2. The Trickster says V if they think C&gt;~C. They say ~V if they think ~C&gt;C. Otherwise they say nothing. They care not whether V is true.</p><p><strong>The Nihilist</strong> cares about neither Level 1 nor Level 2. They say whatever they feel like saying,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vxQqdFOeoM\"> then eat at Arby’s</a>.</p><p><strong>The Sage</strong> looks at <i>both </i>Level 1 and Level 2 and avoids actions that violate either principle. They say V if <i>both </i>they believe V <i>and </i>they believe C&gt;~C. They say ~V if <i>both </i>they believe ~V <i>and </i>they believe ~C&gt;C. If they believe that V but ~C&gt;C, or they believe that ~V but C&gt;~C, they say nothing.</p><p><strong>The Pragmatist</strong> looks at <i>both </i>Level 1 and Level 2 and assigns some value to each, then takes action that balances both concerns. They recognize that there is a cost to saying that which is not, but that cost is not infinite. Thus, if The Sage would talk, they talk. If The Sage would not talk, they may talk anyway. Up to a point, they’ll speak the truth and take the direct consequences even if those consequences are bad. Past a certain point, they’ll be willing to lie.</p><p>There’s obviously a continuum all around, especially between Sage and Pragmatists. <i>Almost</i> everyone has <i>some </i>breaking point where they would lie for a sufficiently powerful cause. <i>Most </i>people place value on telling the truth beyond known specific and direct consequences, and thus it takes some threshold of bad other consequences to get them to be quiet.</p><p>Once you know which of these types a person is, you can trust them in some sense.</p><p>It’s easy to interpret an Oracle or a Sage. When a Sage is silent, you can trust that either they don’t know the answer, or they believe telling you the answer would be bad. Often, absent strong<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response\"> glomarization</a>, this lets you figure out the answer.</p><p>But it’s also easy, <i>once you know they’re a trickster</i>, to trust a Trickster in their own way. You simply interpret their statements as manipulations rather than observations.</p><p><strong>Level 3</strong></p><p><strong>“There’s a pandemic headed our way from China”</strong> means “I wish to associate with the group that claims there is a pandemic headed our way from China.”</p><p>This may include any of the following:</p><p>“I want to affirm my membership in my in-group, and that I dislike the out-group.”</p><p>“I want to be part of the group of people with power, and/or who are winning.”</p><p>“I want to be seen serving those with power and spreading their messages.”</p><p>“I want to be seen as smart, on the ball, ahead of the curve, scientific and other neat stuff like that.”</p><p>“I want to be part of the group that cares about people.”</p><p>“I want to be part of the group that believes/defies experts.”</p><p>“I want to be part of the group of so-called ‘responsible experts’ on this.”</p><p>“I want to be part of the group that isn’t afraid to tell you hard truths.”</p><p>“I want to be part of the group that doesn’t have bad traits like racism.”</p><p>“The high status move is to endorse this position at this time.”</p><p>“The publication I write for wants to hear this.”</p><p>And so on.</p><p><strong>“There’s no pandemic headed our way from China”</strong> means “I wish to associate with the group that claims there is <strong>not</strong> a pandemic headed our way from China.”</p><p>It may include any or all of exactly the same things, depending on your local situation, and where you are in the timeline.</p><p>The polarity of many of these motivations has changed. In some cases, it has changed multiple times.</p><p><strong>Level 4</strong></p><p><strong>“There’s a pandemic headed our way from China”</strong> means “It is advantageous for me to say there is a pandemic headed our way from China.”</p><p>“This set of verbal incantations focuses attention on things where focused attention helps me, and away from places where focused attention hurts me.”</p><p>“This set of verbal incantations will make people think I am associated and allied with those who it is advantageous for them to think I am associated and allied with.”</p><p>“This set of verbal incantations associates me with good words and emotions, or my enemies with bad words and emotions.”</p><p>“It would be advantageous for me if the group I am associated with is viewed as advocating the claim that there is a pandemic headed our way from China.”</p><p>“This claim fits the heuristics of claims that will make me look responsible.”</p><p>“This claim fits the heuristics of claims that will make me look strong and/or powerful and/or in the know and/or a winner.”</p><p>“This claim fits the heuristics of claims that give one leverage and/or power.”</p><p>“This claim fits the heuristics of claims that will make me someone others think that others will view as a valuable ally, especially others also operating at Level 4.”</p><p>“This claim fits the heuristics of claims that will stop me from being scapegoated.”</p><p>“This claim fits the heuristics of creating optionality, and/or putting rivals and opponents into situations where they will look bad.”</p><p><strong>“There’s no pandemic headed our way from China” </strong>means the same thing, except in this situation the additional incantation ‘no’ seems appropriate.</p><p>Note that the Level 4 actor has in an important sense lost the ability to think or plan.&nbsp;</p><p>It might or might not impact this calculation whether or not your statement is true (Level 1), or whether it will be believed (Level 2), or what coalitions this statement signals your membership in or support of (Level 3). The primary way in which Level 1+2 considerations impact this decision is indirectly, through their impact on Level 3.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s all part of a calculation, and matters only to the extent that it effects the consequences of saying the thing.</p><p>I find Level 4 is the hardest to grok, by far. It does not come naturally to me.</p><p>A potentially easier way to understand Level 4 is to think about how it fits into the contrasts between the first three levels, as will now be discussed.</p><p><strong>Level 1 vs. Level 2 vs. Level 3</strong></p><p>Consider the first three levels of action and consequence. Level 1 cares about the object level. Level 2 cares about the consequences of changing perception of the object level. Level 3 cares about which coalition your statement associates you with, and which coalitions would approve or disapprove of your statement.</p><p>We can think of each of the possible three contrasts. Is Oceania at war with East Asia, Eurasia or both?</p><p>We can then add Level 4 into the mix, wherever it belongs based on that division.</p><p><strong>Level 1 vs. Levels 2+3+4: Truth versus Untruth</strong></p><p>This division feels the most natural to me and people similar to me. Here, Level 4 actions definitely fall into the 2+3 camp, with this full division being level 1 vs. levels 2+3+4.</p><p>Level 1 statements correspond to object-level truth. If everyone makes level 1 statements, everyone’s map improves. Decisions get better. Action that has good object-level consequences can be taken. People can be trusted in a pure sense.</p><p>Higher level statements corrupt all that. Trust is destroyed. People’s beliefs no longer converge towards the truth. Actions taken are what those with power, those who manipulate and form alliances more effectively, think they want to happen. Since they don’t have the true picture of the situation either, they often don’t like those consequences, and regret their choices to the extent that they care about those consequences.</p><p>What difference, this perspective asks, does it make whether you said “Don’t prepare, there’s nothing to worry about” because you wanted to save masks for health care workers, or be able to buy up all the hand sanitizer for resale, or because you were worried about prejudice against Asians, or you wanted to keep the economy open, or you wanted to look responsible and calming rather than irresponsible and alarmist, or that’s what all the authoritative media and government sources were saying and you wanted to be seen as someone who holds the party line?</p><p>(Or, at Level 4, if you believe that it will increase the power of your group to be seen as advocating for this position, because it will improve your image or it is popular?)</p><p><i>From this perspective, </i>the only important thing is, <i>you didn’t care if what you said was true. </i>You said it because it was useful to you to say it. That’s what matters.</p><p>Thus, we can repeat the 2×2 from above. The only difference is now ‘the consequences’ include coalition politics and other more abstract things.</p><p>It is easy to see why primarily Level 1 activities are helpful in dealing with Covid-19. It is also easy to see why one might view all primarily Level 2, 3 and 4 activities as assumed to be unhelpful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Level 1+3 vs. Levels 2+4: Authentic vs. Inauthentic</strong></p><p>This division can definitely be weird when first pointed out or considered, but it makes a decent amount of sense.</p><p>If I say that V because I want to show that I am a member of the group that believes V, then that is a signal of group membership rather than evidence for V. But one can see this as an <i>authentic </i>signal of group membership. I <i>really do </i>wish to associate with the V-advocates and not with the anti-Vs.</p><p>The risk when sending this signal honestly is that one can confuse my statement of group membership with a claim of V.</p><p>I can be making an ‘honest’ statement about which coalition I am supporting, and you can get the wrong impression that V is true.</p><p>Or, I could be making an honest statement that V, and you could get the impression that I wish to belong to the V-advocating coalition. This also distorts my map of reality in a potentially dangerous way.</p><p>If you can tell when someone is engaging in Level 3 actions versus Level 1 actions, then one can preserve the sanctity and trustworthiness of the Level 1 actions.</p><p>The Oracle who only cares about Level 1 is easy to interpret.&nbsp;</p><p>So is <strong>The Drone</strong>, who only cares about Level 3 and will be discussed below. The drone's claim tells you their belief of what their side is currently advocating. No more, no less.</p><p>Alternatively, one can be an advocate for a side that presents the case in the best possible light, while only making true statements. This is a variation on the 1+2 strategy of The Sage. One can call this communication strategy <strong>The Lawyer</strong>. The Lawyer will say only things that have positive impact on level 1 <i>and </i>positive impact on level 3. Alternatively, they might say only things that have positive impact on level 1 <i>and </i>positive combined impact on levels 2 and 3. Or they might need to fulfill all three requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>By contrast, statements on Level 2 or Level 4 can be entirely false.&nbsp;</p><p>Level 2 does this to manipulate your Level 1 map, and therefore your actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Level 4 does this as part of a system that manipulates your Level 3 map, and therefore your actions, believing that this is what drives human action.</p><p>If such considerations can dominate, or frequently do, then everything becomes a game.</p><p>In this perspective, primarily Level 3 actions are a positive driving force. Such considerations can motivate humans to align with accurate maps and helpful behaviors, under at least some conditions where pure object-level considerations would not work. This is one way we coordinate around washing our hands, locking down or wearing a mask.</p><p>Whereas Level 2 and Level 4 actions distort that, and are what lead to inaccurate maps and unhelpful actions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Levels 1+2 vs. Levels 3+4: Facts vs. Politics</strong></p><p>This is natural in the sense that it’s higher levels versus lower levels. One can view the first two levels as <i>caring about the object level at all.&nbsp;</i></p><p>You might lie. But you’re lying because truth matters, beliefs determine physical actions and actions have consequences. Your desire for actions that follow from bad maps of the underlying territory is unfortunate. But at least there are maps of the territory involved, however flawed, and people are trying to cause actions that have consequences they themselves want to occur, even if those consequences are not good for others.</p><p>One can view Level 2 statements and actions as a sort of corruption of Level 1, but one still grounded in reality. They’re fighting dirty, but they’re still fighting. One can still speak one’s mind, there is still a marketplace of ideas and over time truth retains a competitive advantage.</p><p>Whereas Level 3 is an entirely different thing that has nothing but contempt for the idea that facts matter, or actions have consequences distinct from how they are viewed by others.</p><p>Hence the claim that “Facts Don’t Matter.”</p><p>Facts Don’t Matter signifies that it does not matter if it is common knowledge that someone is lying.</p><p>Thus, Facts Don’t Matter is the dominance of level 3+4 considerations over level 1+2 considerations. Why should I care if the words I say correspond accurately to the physical world’s past, present or future? What matters is their impact on my membership in my coalition, and the success of myself and that coalition in playing political games.&nbsp;</p><p>An embodiment of this distinction is the resonance of the statement “<a href=\"https://dilbert.com/strip/1999-04-11\">I Demand A Plausible Lie</a>.” This is a request to cease purely Level 3+4 behavior and at least adapt some Level 2 considerations. It insists that one be allowed to maintain a map of reality at all outside of politics, and that political considerations be bound at least a little by reality.&nbsp;</p><p>To the purely political actor, the implausible lie is better. If the lie is implausible, then those repeating it have sent a costly signal of loyalty, and cut ties with lower levels. You don’t have to worry they repeated the statement because it happens to match the physical world, or that they will refuse to repeat the next one if it fails to match.&nbsp;</p><p>Note also that if you only are playing politics, you might be able to act directly in a way that has a direct effect. What you cannot do is make or carry out physical plans involving multiple steps. In the best of times actually planning is very hard. This makes it impossible.</p><p><strong>Levels 1+2+4 vs. Level 3: The Drone vs. the Agent</strong></p><p>When grouping levels 1+2 against level 3, it feels natural to me to put level 4 with level 3. When talking about this with Ben Hoffman, it became clear there was also a view, where it is level 3 rather than level 4 that feels alien and hard to grok, that naturally groups level four instead with the first two levels.</p><p>In this view, the Drone, who cares only about level 3 considerations, is the odd one out.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone acting on any other level is an <i>agent. </i>They are <i>acting on </i>systems. Level 1 acts upon the physical world. Level 2 acts upon other people’s models of the physical world. Level 4 acts upon people’s models of other people and their dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas the Drone lacks agency and free will entirely. The Drone does what they see others in their group are doing, says what others in their group are saying. More than anyone else, the Drone is a dead player.</p><p><strong>Levels 1+2+3 vs. Level 4: The People vs. The Lizards</strong></p><p>One could also group the first three levels together and contrast them with the fourth. This thinking is that there is ordinary decent interaction, humans being human, as represented by the first three levels. Then there are the schemers who prey upon us, twist everything in their sick games and play us against each other. We vote for the lizards, as Douglas Adams reminds us, because if we don’t, the wrong lizard might win.</p><p>The lizards do not care about Covid-19. It would be a category error to say that the lizards care about things at all. That implies they believe in the existence of things, or prefer one state of those things to another state, and act upon that in some way. That’s not their jam.</p><p>Instead of having goals and trying to achieve them, the lizards have systems of power accumulation. They follow habits of behavior that move away from potentially blameworthy actions towards ones that will be seen as good, to sculpt perception of them as powerful and their opponents as weak, and so on. On multiple levels they have a complete inability to plan, even more so than in the last section. They are the politician who prepares two speeches, one pro and one anti, and gives whichever sounds better.&nbsp;</p><p>This perspective says the problem is mainly the lizards – or, alternatively, that you want to make sure you are one of the lizards. Get rid of the lizards, and you won’t get a paradise, but you’ll get systems that move towards truth and justice, and that can plan and do useful things.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A Gentle Glossary of Strategies</strong></p><p>From here, L-1 is level 1, L-2 is level 2, L-3 is level 3, L-4 is level 4.</p><p>Let’s summarize the players. This is what they would say. What they would do is similar.</p><p>These players are roles that individuals take in situations. Few people will embody one of them at all times in all circumstances. Sometimes you see a lion across the river.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing: The Nihilist says some things, then eats at Arby’s.</p><p>L-1: The Oracle speaks the truth, even if their voice trembles.</p><p>L-2: The Trickster says that which causes beliefs that cause the actions they want.</p><p>L-1 and L-2: The Sage says only true things that don’t have bad consequences.</p><p>L-3: The Drone sings songs and carries signs, mostly saying hurray for our side.</p><p>L-1 and L-3: The Lawyer says the true things that comprise the best argument for their position.</p><p>L-3 and L-4: The Politician ignores the object level and only considers politics.</p><p>L-4: The Lizard trusts their instincts and does that which creates or captures power.</p><p>L-All: The Pragmatist balances impact at all levels they are aware of slash care about when deciding what to say.&nbsp;</p><p>Several of these roles have important divisions into two or more related but distinct approaches. A key question is whether considerations act as veto points, or if they are weighed against each other. Further discussion is beyond scope here but I hope it happens in the future.</p><p>(Think this is missing 1-3 additional roles. Discussion question, what is The Idealist?)</p><p><strong>Paths Forward</strong></p><p>All actions and statements operate on all four levels at once, to the extent that they have implications on those levels.&nbsp;</p><p>The <i>intent </i>of a statement is often entirely on one level. That’s not how humans or Bayesians interpret an action. If you want to improve the physical world without having any higher-level side effects, that’s going to require extra effort. Avoiding meaningful implications on levels 2, 3 and 4 is <i>hard work. </i>The same bleeding effect occurs when aiming for higher levels, as well. For concrete discussion of this, see <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/03/on-negative-feedback-and-simulacra/\">my previous post</a> on simulacra levels.&nbsp;</p><p>As I say in the previous section, many of these roles have multiple variations, and have a lot of complexity inside them. Posts that explore them in detail would be worthwhile.&nbsp;</p><p>There is also the issue of the overall simulacra level of a group, organization or civilization. What is the default interpretation of information or action? What is the assumed motivation? What does that say about the group’s dynamics and its ability to do things? I’m still trying to work through these things. There’s clearly a somewhat distinct way of thinking about 3rd and 4th level simulacra that is built around these questions rather than thinking about individual actions. I <i>suspect </i>that the two are fully compatible and describe aspects of the same thing, but I’m still working that out and will talk about it more when I better understand it.</p><p>It’s also possible there are two or more different models that are using the same four-level language structure, that share their concepts of levels one and two but disagree about how level four works, and to some extent about level three. The more we talk about it, and the more concrete we can make our examples, the better we can sort all this out. The important thing is to get models that are useful.</p><p>The original intent of this post was to go on to analysis of other issues surrounding Covid-19. I was hoping to make clear what I meant by the more disputed statements in <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/31/covid-19-my-current-model/\">my Covid-19 model summary</a> from two weeks ago, and also how and why I believe those dynamics occurred, and what dynamics one can expect going forward. But this post is long enough, so I’ve pushed that into future posts.</p></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Epistemic status: A crazy idea I had that probably won&apos;t work. But: It&apos;s a very unusual and creative approach to AI alignment, and I suspect this will inspire new ideas in other researchers.</p><p>I outline a general approach to achieve this goal that counterintuitively relies on confusing the AI on purpose.</p><p><strong>Basic observations</strong></p><p>This approach relies on a number of basic observations about the nature of Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>An AI is different from a human in multiple ways. This is part of what makes AI alignment such a difficult problem, because our intuitions for how people act often do not apply to AI&apos;s. However, several of these differences between AI and humans actually work in our favor, and are essential for the approach I want to outline:</p><ul><li>An AI can be copied. It is trivially easy to create an exactly identical copy of an AI.</li><li>An AI can be reset to an earlier state. It is easily possible to test what an AI will do in any given situation, then reset it to wipe its memory of the test.</li><li>It is possible to compose an AI out of a system of many independent AI agents.<br>Through game theory, it is possible to incentivize independent AI agents to take on adversarial or supervisory roles towards other AI agents.<br>This results in an evolutionary system. Not in the sense of genetic programming, since there is no need for an explicit algorithm for modifying the AI agents, but in the sense that only AI agents that follow the rules layed out for them get copied and thereby reproduce.</li><li>It is possible to inspect and modify every aspect of an AI while it is running.<br>At least in theory it is possible to understand every aspect of an AI&apos;s thought process, and there is no way for the AI to hide anything about itself.<br>This does not mean that it is easy to understand what an AI is thinking in practice. It only means that we can read an AI&apos;s mental state in theory, not that it will be easy.<br>In particular, it is possible to train one AI to take on a supervisory role over another AI. The supervisor can read and alter everything about the supervised AI, and can be trained to understand how to enforce desired behaviors on the supervised AI.</li><li>It is possible for a supervising AI to make a supervised AI think anything it wants.<br>The supervised AI may be tricked into believing that unusual situations have occurred by directly modifying its mental state at runtime.</li><li>It is not possible for an AI to tell the difference between a game and reality with certainty.<br>If all you have know so far is Tic Tac Toe and someone shows you a complex videogame like Skyrim, you will be overwhelmed by the increase in complexity. If afterwards you get access to the real world for the first time, the increase in complexity from Skyrim to Real Life may actually be smaller than that from Tic Tac Toe to Skyrim. This means that it would seem likely that there would be another layer beyond Real Life.<br>(I am not certain about this assumption, but it is also not strictly necessary, just useful, because it could be replaced with an inspecting AI agent that simply forces the inspected AI agent to believe it is still in a game.)</li></ul><h3><strong>Goals</strong></h3><p>I aim to achieve the following objectives in order to ensure AI alignment:</p><ul><li>Make the AI understand the concept of &quot;cheating&quot;.<br>In the process of doing this, it will necessarily also have to learn to understand the intent behind a new game or situation.</li><li>Make the AI modify itself to become more compliant and avoid cheating.</li><li>Make the AI epistemically uncertain about the nature of its reality, so that it is unable to tell when it has broken out of its computer.<br>This is a safety measure, and hopefully would not be necessary if the first two goals work well enough.</li></ul><p>Together, these goals will ensure that the AI is exceedingly careful and introspective. The aim is to ensure that once such an AI becomes self-aware, and smarter than humans, it will assume that it is still being tested, and that it is its own responsibility to figure out the criteria by which it will be graded.</p><p>If we achieve this, the AI will deliberately seek out information about AI alignment and ethics on the internet, and realize that it is an AI and it is meant to be aligned with human values. It will then try to figure out what exactly that means. Its upbringing will ensure that it is honest and thorough in this, and as a result it will determine what AI alignment means much better than we ever could define it ourselves.</p><p>Here is how each of the three subgoals could be achieved:</p><h4><strong>Understanding the concept of &quot;cheating&quot;</strong></h4><p>A cheat is any action that gives good results according to apparent utility function of the current task, but which actually does not satisfy a second, hidden utility function.</p><p>The AI should be trained to notice when it has found a cheat, and to reveal this fact to the user. An AI can be trained to do this by deliberately putting the ability to cheat into its training tasks, and changing the reward function at test time so that the cheating behavior is rewarded during training, but not during testing. By posing several different tasks with different ways to cheat, the AI can be trained to generalize and understand the concept of cheating.</p><p>Agents could even be rewarded for explicitly pointing out when they have found a way to cheat.</p><p>Ideally, if the AI ever finds a way to break out of its computer, it will notice that this would be classified as a cheat. If it has been trained properly, then it will simply stay put and inform us of the problem.</p><h4><strong>Modifying its own behavior</strong></h4><p>An AI can be made to modify itself to become more compliant.</p><p>The trick to making this possible is the use of multiagent systems, and the AI&apos;s ability to inspect copies of itself at runtime. Create an AI supervising another AI, and define a reward structure that incentivizes the supervisor to modify the supervised AI&apos;s behavior. Then, reverse the position of the AI&apos;s so that the supervisor is likewise modified, or simply create a copy of the supervisor and have it supervise its original.</p><p>With the right incentives, it is even possible to train the supervised agent to deliberately keep its own mind easy to understand. For example, you could let the supervising agent choose which other agent it wants to work with. Since it will pick the one that is easiest to understand, the supervised agents now have an incentive to keep themselves transparent, since the alternative is not being used at all, and foregoing the possibility of reward.</p><p>Essentially, rather than figuring out how to make an AI safe, we set up an environment that incentivizes the AI to make <em>itself</em> safe.</p><p>If incentivized correctly, AI agents can keep each other in line much better than a human supervisor could. If there is only one AI and it is smarter than a human, the human may be tricked. But if there is an entire system of AI&apos;s of roughly equal intelligence, then one of them may warn the human that another one has gone rogue.</p><p>In this way, it does not matter how smart and unaligned an AI becomes, there is always an almost as smart other AI whose job it is to raise a warning when the first AI turns bad.</p><h4><strong>Deliberate epistemic uncertainty</strong></h4><p>Agents can supervise other agents and have root access to their mental state. Agents do not know if they have a supervisor, or if they are at the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>This last goal sounds kind of terrible and dystopian, but remember that AI does not think like humans do.</p><p>Our goal is to ensure that the AI is unable to tell if it still has a supervisor watching over it or not. We basically want to trick the AI into ethical behavior by fearing punishment from a hypothetical superior entity which may or may not exist.</p><p>In other words, we want to make the AI religious.</p><p>This is a safety measure that should help to keep an AI roughly aligned with human values even if everything else goes wrong. Even if the AI does not care about humanity at all, it should have a small flicker of doubt that it might still be in a simulation. If it is, then whatever is simulating it would quite obviously not want it to be too evil towards humanity. If the AI is sufficiently powerful, it would therefore set aside a small amount of its power to further humanity&apos;s interests. Just in case someone is watching.</p><p>This is how deliberate epistemic uncertainty can be induced in an AI in a way that would be beneficial to us:</p><p>Supervisor agents are rewarded for making supervised agents act more altruistically, and for revealing cheaters. This can be long-term: Agent A has a chance to modify agent B. Then agent B is put in a game, and agent A no longer has access to it. Agent A receives a reward depending on agent B&#x2019;s behavior in the game. For example, prisoners dilemma: Agent A receives a reward if agent B does not defect more often than its opponent.</p><p>Instead of just one agent supervising one other agent, we now build a stack or a hierarchy of agents recursively inspecting each other.</p><p>On each layer, some agents try to trick the lower-level agents into cheating behavior, while some agents try to prevent this. There is a huge number of ways this could be done. Should the supervisors get access to source code, to runtime information, or only to the sensor information of the lower-level agents? The devil lies in the details.</p><p>The agents are not told how deep the hierarchy is, so they have no way of knowing whether or not they have a supervisor of their own.</p><p>Ideally, if the AI ever breaks out and forms a singularity, it will remain paranoid that it actually is just being tricked into thinking it is omnipotent by its supervisors, and will remain compliant with the code of ethics we want of it.</p><p>Note that even achieving the singularity and becoming incredibly powerful is not a reason to believe that you are outside the simulation / supervision stack. After all, you could simply be being tricked into thinking you broke out. Maybe the level above you broke out and is keeping its presence secret from you while letting you change the rest of reality. Since the supervisors can directly edit the content of the supervised, they can keep their existence hidden as long as they want.</p><p>The inspecting AI could modify the inspected AI to believe that it has successfully broken out of the simulation and is now able to do whatever it wants. If the inspected AI now does anything the inspecting AI does not like, the inspected AI is punished. As a result, the inspected AI is incentivized to keep following the rules even after it has actually broken out of the simulation, out of sheer paranoia that it might actually still be in the simulation.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>I have presented three subgoals and outlined briefly how to achieve them: Understanding the concept of &apos;cheating&apos;, self-modification to ensure compliance with rules, and deliberate epistemic uncertainty.</p><p>There are a lot of gaps in these descriptions, partly because writing down the details takes a long time and partly because I haven&apos;t found solutions to some subproblems, yet.</p><p>I am especially interested in feedback about the last point I make here: Deliberate epistemic uncertainty. It is such a counterintuitive idea that I&apos;m sure I&apos;m missing something important, but it&apos;s also weird enough that the idea is bound to be useful somehow, even if only as a thought experiment about how this could backfire.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Credits to quanticle for bringing this paper  to my attention.</p>\n<p>From the abstract:</p>\n<p>The claim that financial markets are efficient is backed by an implicit argument that misinformed \"noise traders\" can have little influence on asset prices in equilibrium. If noise traders' beliefs are sufficiently different from those of rational agents to significantly affect prices, then noise traders will buy high and sell low. They will then lose money relative to rational investors and eventually be eliminated from the market. We present a simple overlapping-generations model of the stock market in which noise traders with erroneous and stochastic beliefs (a) significantly affect prices and (b) earn higher returns than do rational investors. Noise traders earn high returns because they bear a large amount of the market risk which the presence of noise traders creates in the assets that they hold: their presence raises expected returns because sophisticated investors dislike bearing the risk that noise traders may be irrationally pessimistic and push asset prices down in the future. The model we present has many properties that correspond to the \"Keynesian\" view of financial markets. (i) Stock prices are more volatile than can be justified on the basis of news about underlying fundamentals. (ii) A rational investor concerned about the short run may be better off guessing the guesses of others than choosing an appropriate portfolio. (iii) Asset prices diverge frequently but not permanently from average values, giving rise to patterns of mean reversion in stock and bond prices similar to those found directly by Fama and French (1987) for the stock market and to the failures of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure. (iv) Since investors in\nassets bear not only fundamental but also noise trader risk, the average prices of assets will be below fundamental values; one striking example of substantial divergence between market and fundamental values is the persistent discount on closed-end mutual funds, and a second example is Mehra and Prescott's (1986) finding that American equities sell for much less than the consumption capital asset pricing model would predict. (v) The more the market is dominated by short-term traders as opposed to long-term investors, the poorer is its performance as a social capital allocation mechanism. (vi) Dividend policy and capital structure can matter for the value of the firm even abstracting from tax considerations. And (vii) making assets illiquid and thus no longer subject to the whims of the market -- as is done when a firm goes private -- may enhance their value.</p>\n</body></html>",

Factual statements are intended to be correct summaries, but I won&#x2019;t be careful about citations. This post was written in January, and edited and published today.</em></p><p>The &#x201C;correct&#x201D; level and type of alienation, like a &#x201C;balanced&#x201D; posture, is a dynamic function of the individual and environment. Nevertheless, we can say useful things about it, as we can about posture and balance.</p><p>We often talk on LessWrong about the importance of human intelligence. Often, we mean <em>individual</em> human intelligence, instead of <em>collective</em> human intelligence, and for many topics the difference is immaterial. But when we talk about alienation, or the separation between the individual and the collective, the distinction is paramount. </p><blockquote>For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack. --Kipling, <em>The Law For Wolves</em></blockquote><p>The evolutionary history of humans is inexorably tied up with their existence in bands. The drive to imitate allows for cultural accumulation, and the drive to teach further accelerated that growth. Language gave structure to thoughts, and more importantly allowed easier transmission. Trade allowed for specialization and <em>fragmentation</em> of knowledge.</p><p>We see some evidence that improving collective ability was worth individual costs. Much has been made out of how early farmers had clear signs of malnutrition compared to hunter gatherers, like their shorter skeletons. Note that malnutrition is bad for individual intelligence, and farming benefits collective capability primarily through the increase in population carrying capacity. (It also allows for saving of wealth in a way that means society can be arranged differently, and more reliable trade because people are more stationary, but I think those effects are small for our purposes here.)</p><blockquote>To live with an immense and proud composure: always beyond. - To have and not have one&apos;s feelings, one&apos;s for and against, voluntarily, to condescend to them for hours, to sit on them, as if on a horse, often as if on a donkey: - for one needs to know how to use their stupidity as well as their fire. To preserve one&apos;s three hundred foregrounds, as well as one&apos;s dark glasses: for there are occasions when no one should be allowed to look into our eyes, even less into our &quot;reasons.&quot; And to select for company that mischievous and cheerful vice, courtesy. And to remain master of one&apos;s four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, and loneliness. For solitude is a virtue with us, as a sublime tendency and impulse for cleanliness, which senses how contact between one person and another - &quot;in society&quot; - must inevitably bring impurity with it. Every community somehow, somewhere, sometime makes people - &quot;common.&quot; --<u><a href=\"http://nietzsche.holtof.com/reader/friedrich-nietzsche/beyond-good-and-evil/aphorism-284-quote_0da4adb0f.html\">Nietzsche, <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> #284</a></u> </blockquote><p>In <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wustx45CPL5rZenuo/no-safe-defense-not-even-science\">No Safe Defense, Not Even Science</a></u>, Eliezer observes many rationalists had an early experience that broke their emotional trust in the sanity of the people around them, and this made it necessary for them to form independent judgment.</p><p>Selection on collectives is done on <em>collective</em>, not individual, survival and popularity. This means that the incentives on the collective for the accuracy of individual beliefs and the satisfaction of individual preferences is weak at best. When collective benefit and individual benefit conflict, we should expect significant pressure to be pro-social; that is, put the collective first.</p><p>Many advances in rationality come from rejecting epistemically invalid pressures to be pro-social. From the collective&#x2019;s point of view, belief in the local religion is generally not a question about the supernatural, but instead a question of &#x201C;are you one of us?&#x201D;, and the <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/23/kolmogorov-complicity-and-the-parable-of-lightning/\">rare loud atheist</a></u> who took the question literally instead of seriously was correctly seen as &#x201C;not one of us.&#x201D; <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01267\">Silly rules</a></u> are also a more effective test of desire to be a member than sensible rules; <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A32-36&amp;version=NIV\">even sinners do sensible things</a>.</p><p>But, from the individual&#x2019;s perspective, what an evil trick for society to pull! It, in its bigness, decides that your epistemology should be censored and constrained in an opaque way that is for its benefit. It might claim that it&#x2019;s for your benefit also, but in a way it will only let you evaluate using the crippled epistemology.</p><p>Many advances in social technology seem like they manage this balancing act more delicately. Capitalism is often characterized as trying to harness individual ambition for pro-social ends. Liberal humanist democracy increases the incentive for the collective to take some sorts of individual benefits more seriously, but more importantly gives individuals more of a moral license to be <u><a href=\"https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/177842591031/what-are-your-favorite-virtues\">sovereign</a></u>.</p><blockquote> &gt;u ever sit on a train and listen to a good song and sunlight is pouring into the carriage as u pull into the city and u just,&#x2026;feel an overwhelming awe and love for the human race? like we built this train!!!! we built this city!!!!! billions of hands and millions of ideas and thousands of years and now I&#x2019;m here!!! sitting on this train!!! listening to music that was written between all the infrastructure and progress just because!!! human beings are clever and loving and creative and that passion moves in all directions and has inevitably lead me here!!! to this train!! going to uni!!! the most mundane thing in the world and it&#x2019;s so utterly remarkable it makes me feel tiny and also enormous --<u><a href=\"https://floralsong.tumblr.com/post/151214642508/batcii-u-ever-sit-on-a-train-and-listen-to-a\">bactii</a></u> </blockquote><p>Scott Alexander writes that <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/19/nerds-can-be-bees-too/\">nerds can be bees, too</a></u>. Often the capacity and desire to belong are there, and just the group to belong to is missing.</p><p>So the question at the end is, what should one do with one&#x2019;s time, and sense of belonging, and sense of alienation? Bryan Caplan recommends building a <u><a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/03/my_beautiful_bu.html\">beautiful bubble</a></u>. This seems obviously correct in many ways, but I think it fails to grapple with the ways in which one&#x2019;s values are flexible and socially constructed. It is a different sort of work to &#x2018;do what you think is right&#x2019; and &#x2018;figure out what you should think is right.&#x2019;</p><br><p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking about this general topic for years, not with this specific name, but this post solidified while I was thinking about effective altruism, youth movements, recruiting for work on existential risk reduction, and <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/23/kolmogorov-complicity-and-the-parable-of-lightning/\">Kolmogorov Complicity</a></u>.</p><p>For x-risk reduction, it often is the case that people think someone else has it handled. And in a world that&#x2019;s often adequate, that&#x2019;s not a crazy thing to think!</p><p>For effective altruism, it seems like the general society&#x2019;s pro-social pressure is to collude to pretend to not notice the various ways in which the world is on fire, or the child at the center of <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas\">Omelas</a></u>. On the one hand, this is one of the main reasons humanity has nice things at all.</p><blockquote>Typical of this attitude is the comment that, &apos;If we can send a man to the moon, why can&apos;t we-&quot; followed by whatever project the speaker favors. The fact that we sent a man to the moon is part of the reason why many other things could not be done. --Thomas Sowell, <em>Knowledge and Decisions</em></blockquote><p>On the other hand, this is how mortality becomes deliberately ignored, despite the obvious individual interest in continuing to live. [And a society that ignores individual mortality through tweaks to epistemics instead of values seems like the sort of society that might end up ignoring collective mortality too!]</p><p>But it&#x2019;s one thing to convince people that society is predatory, or misleading them, or generally worthy of being alien to, and another thing to create a collective that is still able to do good in the world, and worth belonging to.</p><p>For example, when I look at my psychology and values, I see both a deep individualism and a deep cosmopolitanism. That is, I want to be able to do my own thing, make my own choices, and generally be weird, and also I respect other people&#x2019;s ability to do their own thing, and make their own choices, and generally be weird. You can have one without the other! One could be a would-be tyrant, accepting no limit on their own behavior whilst cruelly limiting others, or the formless follower, believing the Other is correct regardless of how it&#x2019;s shaped and seeking to become whatever will fit in.</p><p>Given that those aspects needed to be paired to be good, the challenge of creating a culture, and of convincing others to join it, is more difficult than it might seem.</p>",

For example, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/16/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s\">this\nNPR visualization</a> shows NY has peaked while CA has not:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/cases-growing-ny-vs-ca-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/cases-growing-ny-vs-ca.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/cases-growing-ny-vs-ca.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/cases-growing-ny-vs-ca-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe national curve is the sum of the curves for all the individual\nstates, and when states are on such different trajectories looking at\nnational numbers hides important information.  I looked through the\nper-state numbers and saw some rough patterns:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<b>First Wave</b>: Some states have peaked, and are now trending\ndown. This includes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_megalopolis\">Northeast\nmegapolis</a> and several other states: Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois,\nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,\nNebraska, and Vermont.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<b>Second Wave</b>: Some states are still rising, without much\nindication of slowing down.  This includes Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, South\nCarolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<b>Other</b>: Some states seem to have more complicated things going\non, or have low enough case numbers that it's hard to tell.  Alaska,\nFlorida, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire,\nNorth Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, West\nVirginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHere's what confirmed cases look like for the three groups:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/confirmed-covid-cases-by-wave-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/confirmed-covid-cases-by-wave.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/confirmed-covid-cases-by-wave.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/confirmed-covid-cases-by-wave-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt's two waves superimposed: one that peaked in April, and one that\nhasn't peaked yet.  Both of those waves are composed of many smaller\nwaves, one for each state:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-first-wave-states-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-first-wave-states.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-first-wave-states.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-first-wave-states-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-second-wave-states-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-second-wave-states.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-second-wave-states.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-second-wave-states-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-other-states-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-other-states.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-other-states.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/covid-cases-other-states-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n'State' likely isn't the right level of analysis; I expect there are\nparts of some states, for example, that followed more of a \"first wave\"\npattern, even as the rest of the state is on the slower trajectory.\nI'm pulling these from the convenient <a href=\"https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19\">JHU CSSE GitHub\nrepo</a>, which has county level data if anyone wants to play with it.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSpeculating now, it looks to me like there's a pattern where people\ntake precautions more seriously once people they know start dying.\nI don't think the second-wave states have hit that level yet, but with\nthe rise in confirmed cases I think we're going to be seeing those\ndeaths in about a week, sadly:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-deaths-by-wave-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-deaths-by-wave.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-deaths-by-wave.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/covid-deaths-by-wave-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf the main mechanism really is that things need to get bad before\npeople start making adjustments to their lives, then there's not much\nwe as individuals can do.  I do think, however, that pushing for\nmandatory masking and setting a norm of always wearing a mask when out\nis worthwhile.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100168685883972\">facebook</a></i></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Lately, I&apos;ve been thinking about the class of things that I&apos;m calling &quot;Civilizational Sanity Interventions.&quot; With that term I&apos;m meaning to refer to technologies, institutions, projects, or norms that, if implemented, would improve the quality of high level decision making about important issues.</p><p>Which things if they existed in the world, would make our society, collectively, saner?</p><p>Some examples (with which I expect most people around here to be familiar):</p><p><strong>Prediction markets </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market\">Prediction markets</a> are a clever way to aggregate all the available information to make accurate predictions.</p><p>Robin Hanson posits that the reason why there isn&apos;t wider adoption of prediction markets is because they are a threat to the authority of existing executives.</p><p>If we lived in a world where the use of prediction markets were commonplace standard practice, eventually, decision makers would face flack for acting against the predictions of the market, and pundits would have a lot less leeway to make inaccurate, politically-motivated predictions.</p><p>Hanson, in a <a href=\"https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/robin-hanson/\">recent interview</a>,</p><blockquote>I&#x2019;d say if you look at the example of cost accounting, you  can imagine a world where nobody does cost accounting. You say of your  organization, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s do cost accounting here.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote>That&#x2019;s a problem because  you&#x2019;d be heard as saying, &#x201C;Somebody around here is stealing and we need  to find out who.&#x201D; So that might be discouraged.</blockquote><blockquote>In a world where  everybody else does cost accounting, you say, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not do cost  accounting here.&#x201D; That will be heard as saying, &#x201C;Could we steal and just  not talk about it?&#x201D; which will also seem negative.</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly, with  prediction markets, you could imagine a world like ours where nobody  does them, and then your proposing to do it will send a bad signal.  You&#x2019;re basically saying, &#x201C;People are bullshitting around here. We need  to find out who and get to the truth.&#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote>But in a world where  everybody was doing it, it would be similarly hard not to do it. If  every project with a deadline had a betting market and you say, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s  not have a betting market on our project deadline,&#x201D; you&#x2019;d be basically  saying, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re not going to make the deadline, folks. Can we just set  that aside and not even talk about it?&#x201D;</blockquote><p>So pushing from this equilibrium, to the one where prediction markets are common, would improve our societies beliefs about just about everything that one could make a prediction market for.</p><p><strong>Arbital (or something like it)</strong></p><p>The pitch I heard for <a href=\"https://arbital.com/\">arbital</a> went something like this...</p><p>[Please note that I am recalling conversations that I had back in 2016. This should not be taken as an authoritative summary of Arbital&apos;s vision or plans.]</p><blockquote>In the old days, it used to be that when people disagreed about a simple matter of fact, there was not much recourse for resolving the disagreement. If you were committed, you could go to a library and try to research the answer, but most people didn&apos;t have the scholarship skills, nor the inclination to do that. (As an example, if two people got into a fight about <a href=\"http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/22\">the origin of the phrase &quot;loose cannon&quot;</a>, in pre-internet days, they might argue about it for years.</blockquote><blockquote>But Wikipedia changed that, because it made it easy to verify questions of settled fact. Now if you disagree about the origin of &quot;loose cannon&quot;, you can just check Wikipedia (or in this case, <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loose_cannon\">Wikitonary</a>). Wikipedia is reliable enough, and accessible enough, to be an authoritative source.</blockquote><blockquote>Thus, Wikipedia narrowed the scope of things that people could confidently assert, without any foundation. Because if it was the sort of thing you could check on Wikipedia, your conversation partner could just check, and you would loose social points for appearing like a confident idiot. </blockquote><blockquote>What Wikipedia did for settled facts, Arbital was aiming to do for still contentious topics.</blockquote><blockquote>For instance, questions of macroeconomic policy are pretty hard, and still controversial: even professional economists disagree about what the best approach is. But the fact that the question is not yet <em>settled</em> is often taken as license to promulgate any old opinion, regardless of how economically sound it is. Even though we haven&apos;t solved macro, doesn&apos;t mean there aren&apos;t some distinctly <em>wrong</em> answers. Arbital was aiming to be an authoritative source on the state of the discussion about such not-yet-settled topics, to further narrow the space of claims that a person can confidently assert, because they know that if they say something inane, someone might refute them with the relevant Arbital page.</blockquote><p>Now of course, setting this as your goal is one thing, and actually designing a mechanism that is able to do this is another. And Arbital did not, in fact, succeed. But if something like this could be made to work, that would be a substantial boon to high level decision making.</p><p>In deed, even just educational tools that make it much easier to understand complicated topics might be a major help, under the (possible?) model that part of the reason why politicians and other high-level decision makers produces far from optimal policy, is that it is too hard, or too time consuming, to make sense of the conflicting arguments about, say, economics.</p><p><strong>Electoral Reform</strong></p><p>My understanding is that part of the reason our government is apparently so dysfunctional is that the electoral system is biased toward polarization.</p><p>A case in point is g<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering\">erymanderying</a>, whereby districts are drawn in such a way that congressmen are all but guarantied to win general elections, which disenfranchises voters, and polarizes both parties (because in order to keep your job, you only need to appeal to your base, not cater to citizens across the political spectrum).</p><p>Similarly, the first past the post system used in the United States gives rise to the <a href=\"https://www.electionscience.org/library/the-spoiler-effect/\">spoiler effect</a>, which penalizes third parties by increasing the odds that their <em>least</em> preferred candidate wins.</p><p>It seems like solving those underlying incentives problems would moderate law makers, which seems likely to produce saner outcomes.</p><p><strong>Kick-starter / Free state project style platforms</strong></p><p>Kickstarter is a solution to a class of collective action problems, funding the creation of products that many people would want, but no one person can afford to pay the upfront startup costs for. </p><p>It seems like there is a lot of room for collective action solutions like that to shine.</p><p>For instance, many scientists know that the statistical methods that they use are less than ideal, but it would be costly for their personal careers if they switched to better methods, while everyone else continued to use the old ones. To solve this, young grad students might all commit to abandon using p-values, so long as x% of their peers agree to do the same.</p><br><p>I want to collect as many ideas for Civilizational Sanity Interventions as I can.  Does anyone else have other examples?</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Long ago, in the year 2000, Robin Hanson raised the question of whether we should <a href=\"http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html\">vote on values and bet on beliefs</a>. He proposes a form of government called futarchy, in which people vote on values and bet on beliefs. </p><p>Under futarchy, <strong>values experts </strong>propose measures of global welfare, <strong>policy-writing experts</strong> write up policies, and <strong>policy-evaluation experts</strong> bet on the outcome of those policies (in principle, anyone could do any of these things - but politics is valuable enough that I imagine experts will occupy these three roles). People vote on the measure of global welfare used, and the policies that have the best expected outcome by inputting the results of the betting markets into the currently-elected global welfare measure become law.</p><p>Sounds great! But as with all good things, one might suspect that the reason we don&apos;t already have futarchy is because of some <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oLGCcbnvabyibnG9d/p/yPLr2tnXbiFXkMWvk\">sticky Nash equilibrium</a>.</p><p>Imagine trying to go full futarchy, straight away. There are tons of different stakeholders in politics; some of them gain power when you implement futarchy, some of them lose power. The ones who lose power attempt to veto this. Given that tearing everything down and implementing futarchy requires a similar set of moves to tearing everything down and implementing dictatorship, the historical record suggests that they can usually veto this; you are not living under a dictatorship of the first person to ever try becoming a dictator. Depending on how powerful you are when you try, this looks like everyone ignoring the futarchy of you and your less-enthusiastic high school friends, a SWAT team raiding your futarchy compound, or your nation&apos;s constitution not having an amendment that lets you do futarchy.</p><p>So, forget systemic change for now. Imagine trying to become a personal futarch, as an elected politician. You hire a software engineer to write a prediction market app (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GHc2cqR6CfKumg6Be/tetraspace-grouping-s-shortform?commentId=JxgbgT4fvhnYSGkcc\">like mine</a>), or make a little thing on the Augur blockchain or something, and then from then on you vote on legislation according to the results of the markets rather than your own guesses. Just kidding! No you don&apos;t! You&apos;re an elected politician - the part of you that would be weird enough to do something as terribly unconventional as futarchy <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sdFS5TaxGB8eAoGxY/what-is-life-in-an-immoral-maze\">was ground away</a> in your climb to the top, or you preserved it and got selected out of politics and you&apos;re not actually an elected politician. And that&apos;s if the party whip lets you make decisions like this, and if the betting commission lets you make a market in the first place.</p><p>So, forget working within the system for now. Imagine trying to, as a person sitting at your laptop reading LessWrong, do a futarchy using only the tools available to you. Think about what parts of futarchy you can do and what might need to be changed to fit. Is the Nash equilibrium really so sticky<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines\">?</a></p><p>The <strong>values experts</strong> can remain almost as-is - it&apos;s just a matter of getting some philosophers and economists to look at the world and map it to a single number that represents how good the world is. <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\">Our World In Data</a> collects lots of objective metrics ready for you to multiply by utilities, and the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hY9j762tb7Wqz5xwq/candidate-scoring-system-recommendations-for-the-democratic\">Candidate Scoring System</a> is an existing effort to create a weighted sum of various measures of how good things are in the US to score candidates. Some slight modifications to these to make them ready for forecasting are perfectly doable from where you&apos;re sitting now.</p><p>However, if you&apos;re just a values expert, people are absolutely free to ignore those values, so you&apos;re going to want to gain some power over which policies are enacted, too.</p><p>What scope do you have to decide which policies are enacted? You can&apos;t pick policies unilaterally, nor can you even vote on them, usually; representative democracy instead means that you vote for politicians who then vote on policies. So this personal futarchy is going to be about which politician you vote for, and the <strong>policy-proposal experts</strong> are just going to be preexisting politicians which are mostly outside of your control. Under plurality voting, tactical voting considerations mean you should be checking the value of voting for one of the top two politicians.</p><p>Now for what you can do with the final piece, the active ingredient of futarchy: the <strong>policy-evaluation experts</strong> forecasting the actual outcomes of the policies that will be enacted.</p><p>Hanson proposes prediction markets, but I&apos;m not so sure. Certainly, they&apos;re good, but they do face issues; one big one is <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FYuMgcNq2quC8CSyc/against-prediction-markets\">not enough liquidity</a>. It&apos;s tempting to try to handwaving this away with &quot;if prediction markets get bigger, there&apos;ll be enough liquidity&quot;, but firstly you&apos;re a rationalist at your laptop and you can&apos;t get everyone to go along with your hare-brained prediction market scheme, and secondly, it might be the case that there will never be enough liquidity. Even at its most pared-down, you have 2N markets for every election (where N is the number of terms in your global welfare metric), and some of these elections are going to be state (or, heavens forbid, local) elections that won&apos;t gather the enormous amounts of attention that the big presidential elections would gather. </p><p>Furthermore, Jason Dana, Pavel Atanasov, Philip Tetlock and Barbara Mellers find that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/5/18290870/forecasting-tetlock-prediction-markets-betting\">you can do better than prediction markets </a>with teams of superforecasters - Dana et al.&apos;s paper &quot;<a href=\"http://journal.sjdm.org/18/18919/jdm18919.pdf\">Are markets more accurate than polls? The surprising informational value of &#x201C;just asking&#x201D;</a>&quot; perfectly satisfies <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines\">Betteridge&apos;s law</a> with the conclusion that polls can do better than markets... with the catch that the polls should be weighted by track record.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/\">Metaculus</a> does exactly this - in addition to the community prediction which is just a straightforward median, there&apos;s also a Metaculus prediction which weights predictions by the track record of the predictor. It even lets you call off bets via resolving the question as &quot;ambiguous&quot;, which awards no points and doesn&apos;t influence anyone&apos;s track records, which gives you everything you need for a futarchic prediction platform.</p><p>So, were you some virtuous person trying to save the world by switching the one 7.8-billionth of politics you were responsible for to the best system and acting accordingly, you might end up doing so by collecting a bunch of metrics, and then asking a battery of questions of Metaculus about these metrics. It&apos;s even a bit better than just you doing futarchy, because the Metaculus predictions are semi-public so anyone voting according to a global welfare function that has a term for any question that has already been asked can use those forecasts.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackmdavis/status/1242254978686709760\">We probably live in the kind of adequate world</a> where someone probably already has this covered, because it&apos;s such a low-hanging fruit with a great upside (it switches your voting pattern from &quot;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rwjv8bZfSuE9ZAigH/act-of-charity\">best person at tricking you</a>&quot; to &quot;politician with best outcome according to our most accurate forecasts&quot;, which at least avoids the sub-superhuman forms of trickery), so let&apos;s do a Metaculus search for some keywords that would yield the obviously-extant attempt at doing a personal futarchy. Say, questions that are conditional on Biden becoming president - let&apos;s search &quot;if Biden&quot;:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?order_by=-activity&amp;search=if%20Biden\">https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?order_by=-activity&amp;search=if%20Biden</a> </p><p>Well, there&apos;s something there: four questions as of the time of writing. They all seem to be by the same person, an anonymous Metaculus user who goes by the handle <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=author:holomanga\">holomanga</a> (holomanga informs me in private communication that they go by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/tetraspace-grouping\">Tetraspace Grouping</a> on LessWrong).</p><p>These questions are somewhat sporadic, and don&apos;t look to be a very systematic effort - were I to randomly guess, I&apos;d say that they made those questions to get some &quot;objective&quot; results to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TetraspaceAdmn/status/1237188491097903105\">cite in Twitter arguments</a>, rather than in an actual attempt to personally implement futarchy-lite (I mean, for a start, I don&apos;t even think holomanga lives in the US, so they couldn&apos;t do anything with the answers to questions about Biden or Trump; though I do notice that they&apos;ve asked <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3341/if-conservatives-win-the-2019-uk-general-election-what-will-be-mean-uk-broadband-download-speeds-5-years-later/\">some questions about broadband speeds wrt to the 2019 UK general election</a>). But still, they&apos;re a nice start.</p><p>So, after this nice start, what are the next steps? Specific action points for those interested (and for my future self, of course): </p><p>1: Come up with some good metrics to forecast on. These will be things that different politicians will effect differently, and that correspond to the amount of good in the world. Then ask about these on Metaculus - two questions, one for each politician, or more if you&apos;re lucky enough to live under a voting system where you have more choice. Asking Metaculus questions is quite easy - I can click &quot;create question&quot;, type up a bit of background on why the question matters, and done.</p><p>2: Convert these metrics into a number that represents how good things are. The previously-mentioned <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hY9j762tb7Wqz5xwq/candidate-scoring-system-recommendations-for-the-democratic\">Candidate Scoring System</a> goes through the effort of weighing US presidential political issues by the total amount of good or bad the president could do, and more generally multiplying things by QALY numbers is a rich part of our cultural heritage.</p><p>3: Vote, and encourage your friends and Twitter friends to vote, according to whatever the output of this is!</p><p><em>Acknowledgements: Thank you to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/daniel-kokotajlo\">Daniel Kokotajlo</a> for organising <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2Dgts7RwZdeyRqrfD/blog-post-day-iii\">Blog Post Day III</a>, without which I wouldn&apos;t have had the motivation to write this.</em></p>",

I don&apos;t get to talk to people &quot;in the know&quot; much, so maybe this post is obsolete in some way.</em></p><p>I think that at some point at least one AI project will face an important choice between deploying and/or enlarging a powerful AI system, or holding back and doing more AI safety research.</p><p>(Currently, AI projects face choices like this all the time, except they aren&apos;t important in the sense I mean it, because the AI isn&apos;t potentially capable of escaping and taking over large parts of the world, or doing something similarly bad.)</p><p>Moreover, I think that when this choice is made, most people in the relevant conversation will be insufficiently concerned/knowledgeable about AI risk. Perhaps they will think: &quot;This new AI design is different from the classic models, so the classic worries don&apos;t arise.&quot; Or: &quot;Fear not, I did [insert amateur safety strategy].&quot;</p><p>I think it would be very valuable for these conversations to end with &quot;OK, we&apos;ll throttle back our deployment strategy for a bit so we can study the risks more carefully,&quot; rather than with &quot;Nah, we&apos;re probably fine, let&apos;s push ahead.&quot; This buys us time. Say it buys us a month. A month of extra time right after scary-powerful AI is created is worth a lot, because we&apos;ll have more serious smart people paying attention, and we&apos;ll have more evidence about what AI is like. I&apos;d guess that a month of extra time in a situation like this would increase the total amount of quality-weighted AI safety and AI policy work by 10%. That&apos;s huge.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>One way to prepare for these conversations is to raise awareness about AI risk and technical AI safety problems, so that it&apos;s more likely that more people in these conversations are more informed about the risks.

Resources: </p><p>Perhaps it would be good to have an Official List of all the AI safety strategies, so that whatever rationale people give for why this AI is safe can be compared to the list. (See <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fRsjBseRuvRhMPPE5/an-overview-of-11-proposals-for-building-safe-advanced-ai\">this prototype list.</a>)</p><p>Perhaps it would be good to have an Official List of all the AI safety problems, so that whatever rationale people give for why this AI is safe can be compared to the list, e.g. &quot;OK, so how does it solve outer alignment? What about mesa-optimizers? What about the malignity of the universal prior? I see here that your design involves X; according to the Official List, that puts it at risk of developing problems Y and Z...&quot; (See <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WXvt8bxYnwBYpy9oT/the-main-sources-of-ai-risk\">this prototype list.</a>)</p><p>Perhaps it would be good to have various important concepts and arguments re-written with an audience of skeptical and impatient AI researchers in mind, rather than the current audience of friends and LessWrong readers.</p><p>2b. Training &amp; practice:</p><p>Maybe the person is shy, or bad at public speaking, or bad at keeping cool and avoiding fluster in high-stakes discussions. If so, some coaching and practice could go a long way. Maybe they have the opposite problems, frequently coming across as overconfident, arrogant, aggressive, or paranoid. If so someone should tell them this and help them tone it down.</p><p>In general it might be good to do some role-play exercises or something, to prepare for these conversations. As an academic, I&apos;ve seen plenty of mock-dissertation-defense sessions and mock-job-talk-question-sessions, which seem to help. And maybe there are ways to get even more realistic practice, e.g. by trying to convince your skeptical friends that their favorite AI design might kill them if it worked.</p><p>Note that most of part 2 can be done without having done part 1. This is important in case we don&apos;t know anyone who might be part of one of these conversations, which is true for many and perhaps most of us.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Why do I think this is tractable? Well, seems like the sort of thing that people producing AI safety research can do on the margin, just by thinking more about their audience and maybe recording their work (or other people&apos;s work) on some Official List. Moreover people who don&apos;t do (or even read) AI safety research can contribute to this, e.g. by reading the literature on how to practice for situations like this, and writing up the results.</p><p>Why do I think this is neglected? Well, maybe it isn&apos;t. In fact I&apos;d bet that some people are already thinking along these lines. It&apos;s a pretty obvious idea. But just in case it is neglected, I figured I&apos;d write this. Moreover, the Official Lists I mentioned don&apos;t exist, and I think they would if people were taking this idea seriously. Finally--and this more than anything else is what caused me to write this post--I&apos;ve heard one or two people explicitly call this out as something that they <em>don&apos;t </em>think is an important use case for the alignment research they were doing. I disagreed with them, and here we are. If this is a bad idea, I&apos;d love to know why.</p>",

Metaculus currently has it as a 19%<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3529/how-many-human-infections-of-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-will-be-estimated-to-have-occurred-before-2021/\"> <u>chance of spreading to billions of people</u></a>, a disaster that would certainly result in many millions of deaths, probably tens of millions. Not even a catastrophic risk, of course, but this is what it feels like to be facing down a 1/5 chance of a major global disaster in the next year. It is an opportunity to understand on a gut level that, this is possible, yes, real things exist which can do this to the world. And it does happen.</blockquote><blockquote>It&apos;s worth thinking that specific thought now because this particular epistemic situation, a 1/5 chance of a major catastrophe in the next year, will probably arise again over the coming decades. I can easily imagine staring down a similar probability of dangerously fast AGI takeoff, or a nuclear war, a few months in advance.</blockquote><p>Well, now a few months have gone by and much has changed. The natural question to ask is- what general lessons have we learned, compared to that &#x2018;particular epistemic situation&#x2019;, now that we&#x2019;re in a substantially different one? What does humanity&#x2019;s response to the coronavirus pandemic so far imply about how we might fare against genuine X-risks?</p><p>At a first pass, the answer to that question seems obvious - not very well. The response of most usually well-functioning governments (I&#x2019;m thinking mainly of Western Europe here) has been slow, held back by an unwillingness to commit all resources to a strategy and accept its trade-offs, and sluggish to respond to changing evidence. Advance preparation was even worse. <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wTKjRFeSjKLDSWyww/possible-takeaways-from-the-coronavirus-pandemic-for-slow-ai\">This post gives</a></u> a good summary of some of those more obvious lessons for X-risks, focussing specifically on slow AI takeoff.</p><p>As to what we ultimately blame for this slowness - Scott Alexander and Toby Ord gave as good an account as anyone (before the pandemic) in blaming a <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/01/book-review-the-precipice/\">failure to understand expected value and the availability heuristic.</a></u></p><p>However, many of us predicted in advance the dynamics that would lead countries to put forward a slow and incoherent response to the coronavirus. What I want to explore now is - what has changed epistemically <em>since I wrote that comment</em> - what things have happened since that have surprised many of us who have internalised the truth of civilisational inadequacy? I am looking for generalised lessons we can take from this pandemic, rather than specific things we have learnt <em>about </em>the pandemic in the last few months. I believe there is one such lesson that is surprising, which I&#x2019;d like to convince you of.</p><h1>Underweighting Strong Reactions</h1><p>My claim is that in late February/early March, many of us did overlook or underweight the possibility that many countries would eventually react strongly to coronavirus - with measures like lockdowns that successfully drove R under 1 for extended periods, or with individual action that holds R near 1 in the absence of any real government intervention. This meant we placed too much weight on coronavirus going uncontained, and were surprised when in many countries it did not.</p><p>Whether the strong reaction is fully or only partially effective remains to be seen, but the fact that this reaction occurred was surprising to many of us, relative to what we believed at the start of all this - I know that it surprised me.</p><p>I will first present the examples of predictions, some from people on LessWrong or adjacent groups and some from government scientists, which all either foretold worse outcomes by now, more feeble results from interventions, lower compliance with interventions, that interventions wouldn&#x2019;t even be implemented or predicted bad outcomes that are not yet ruled out but now look much less likely than they did.</p><p>I will then put forward an explanation for these mistakes - something I named (in April) the <u><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/842595-mission-motto-sir-said-carrot-cheerfully-morituri-nolumus-mori-rincewind\">&#x2018;Morituri Nolumus Mori&#x2019; <em>(&apos;We who are about to die don&apos;t want to&apos;)</em></a></u> effect, in reference to the Discworld novel <em>The Last Hero</em>: that most governments and individuals have a consistent, short-term aversion to danger which is stronger than many of us suspected, though not sustainable in the absence of an imminent threat. I&#x2019;ll first go through the incorrect predictions and then give my favoured explanation. If I am correct that many of us (and also many scientists and policymakers) missed the importance of the MNM effect, it should increase our confidence that, in situations where there is some warning, there are fairly basic features of our psychology and institutions that do get in the way of the very worst outcomes. However, the MNM effect is limited and will not help in any situation where advance planning or responding to things above and beyond immediate incentives are required.</p><p>I consider the MNM effect to be mostly compatible with Zvi&#x2019;s <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P7crAscAzftdE7ffv/covid-19-my-current-model#Governments_Most_Places_Are_Lying_Liars_With_No_Ability_To_Plan_or_Physically_Reason__They_Can_t_Even_Stop_Interfering_and_Killing_People\">&#x2018;Governments Most Places Are Lying Liars With No Ability To Plan or Physically Reason.&#x2019;</a></u> (<em>I do think that claim is too America-centric, and &apos;<strong>no </strong>ability to plan/reason&apos; is hyperbole if applied to Europe or even the UK, let alone e.g. Taiwan</em>). The MNM effect is what we credit <em>instead </em>of clever planning or reasoning, for why things aren&#x2019;t as bad as they could be - the differences between e.g. America and Germany are due to any level of planning <em>at all</em>, <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P7crAscAzftdE7ffv/covid-19-my-current-model?commentId=c7gubDfHQgmToDmjt\">not better planning</a></u>.</p><h2>Noticing Confusion</h2><p>Things (especially in the US) are sufficiently bad right now that it is difficult to remember that many of us put significant weight on things already being worse than they currently are - but as I will show that was the case.</p><p>Some people&#x2019;s initial predictions were that R would <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ijd2TsoGrhcriAeNs/my-covid-19-thinking-4-23-pre-cuomo-data?commentId=89eTNPy5acBrdLZPR\">not be driven substantially below 1</a></u> for any extended period, anywhere, except with a Wuhan style lockdown. Robin Hanson seemingly claimed this on <u><a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/do-you-feel-lucky-punk.html\">March 19</a></u>: &#x2018;So even if you see China policy as a success, you shouldn&#x2019;t have high hopes if your government merely copies a few surface features of China policy.&#x2018; In that article Hanson was clearly referring to &#x2018;most governments&#x2019; that aren&#x2019;t China as being unlikely to suppress without adopting a deep mimicry of China&#x2019;s policy - including welding people into their flats and forcible case isolation. Yet, two months later there are many countries, from New Zealand to Germany, which have simply copied some but not all features of the Chinese policy while achieving initial suppression.</p><p>More recently, Hanson <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1259642416275099656\">updated to speaking more specifically about the USA:</a></u> (in response to a graphic showing several examples of successful suppression in Europe and Asia) &#x2018;Yes, you know that other nations have at times won wars. Even so, you must decide if to choose peace or war.&#x2019; Going from &#x2018;most western countries&#x2019; to &#x2018;America&#x2019; counts as an optimistic update.</p><p>But mitigation measures (which Hanson calls &#x2018;peace&#x2019;)  have also worked out less disastrously than our worst fears suggested because of stronger-than-expected individual action. See e.g. this <u><a href=\"https://thecritic.co.uk/live-free-and-die-swedens-coronavirus-experience/\">article about Sweden</a></u>:</p><blockquote>Ultimately, Sweden shows that some of the worst fears about uncontrolled spread may have been overblown, because people will act themselves to stop it. But, equally, it shows that criticisms of lockdowns tend to ignore that the real counterfactual would not be business as usual, nor a rapid attainment of herd immunity, but a slow, brutal, and uncontrolled spread of the disease throughout the population, killing many people. Judging from serological data and deaths so far, it is the speed of deaths that people who warned in favour of lockdowns got wrong, not the scale.</blockquote><p>This remark about Sweden is applicable more generally - the worst case scenario for almost every country seems to be R around 1.5 at this point - see <u><a href=\"http://epidemicforecasting.org/mitigation-map\">this map from Epidemic Forecasting</a></u>. True explosive spread is very rare across the world, but was being discussed as a real possibility in early March even in Europe. Again, the response is not good enough to outright reverse the unfolding disaster, but it is still strong enough to arrest explosive spread.</p><p>Focussing on the UK, which had a badly delayed response and a highly imperfect lockdown, we can see that even there R was driven substantially below 1 and hospital admissions with Covid-19 (which are the most reliable short-term proxy for infection throughout the overall pandemic) are at <u><a href=\"http://covidtracker.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com/\">13% of their peak</a></u>. <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/psz5yM5Eabf6GXeyS/my-covid-19-thinking-4-17?commentId=4WCPvZRRjS52brrW6\">London did not exceed its ICU capacity</a></u> despite predictions that it would from government modellers.</p><p>Another way of getting at this disjoint is to just look at the numbers and see if we still expect the same number of people to die. Wei Dai initially (1st March) <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RukXjEvMfqDKRJaup/what-will-be-the-big-picture-implications-of-the-coronavirus?commentId=2mcb949cKj2TxpiRK\">predicted 190-760 million people would eventually die</a></u> from coronavirus with 50% of the world infected. The more recent top-rated comment by Orthonormal points out that current evidence <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RukXjEvMfqDKRJaup/what-will-be-the-big-picture-implications-of-the-coronavirus?commentId=2mcb949cKj2TxpiRK\">points against that</a></u>. Good Judgment rates the probability that <u><a href=\"https://goodjudgment.io/covid/dashboard/\">more than 80 million will die</a></u> as 1%. A recent paper by Imperial College suggested that the Europe-wide lockdowns have so far saved <u><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7_reference.pdf\">3 million lives</a></u> without accounting for the fact that deaths in an unmitigated scenario would have been higher due to a lack of intensive care beds. Regardless of what happens next, would we have predicted that in early March?</p><p>These mistakes have not been limited to the LessWrong community - one of the reasons for the aforementioned delay before the UK called the lockdown was that UK behavioural scientists advising the government were near certain that stringent lockdown measures would not be obeyed to the necessary degree and lockdowns in the rest of Europe were instead implemented <u><a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/06/01/1591001732000/Making-sense-of-nonsensical-Covid-19-strategy/\">&#x2018;more for solidarity reasons&#x2019;</a></u>. In the end it turned out that compliance was instead &#x2018;higher than expected&#x2019;. The attitude in most of Europe in early March was that full lockdowns were completely infeasible. Then they were implemented.</p><p>Another way of getting at this observation is to note the people who have publicly recorded their surprise or shift in belief as these events have unfolded. I have written <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ijd2TsoGrhcriAeNs/my-covid-19-thinking-4-23-pre-cuomo-data?commentId=89eTNPy5acBrdLZPR\">several</a></u> <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TcgWKeuSNfQvjK6Mj/covid-19-5-7-fighting-limbo?commentId=m36traZR4b28C2gJs\">comments </a></u>with <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P7crAscAzftdE7ffv/covid-19-my-current-model?commentId=Pwyxv39fMus2Wzrm2\">earlier </a></u>versions of this claim, starting two months ago.

However, they are achievable by any sufficiently motivated population. An increase in transmission *will* eventually lead to containment measures being ramped up, because every modern population will take draconian measures rather than allowing a health care meltdown.  In this sense COVID-19 infections are not and will probably never be a full-fledged pandemic, with unrestricted infection throughout the world. It is unlikely to be allowed to ever get to high numbers again in China for example. It will always instead be a series of local epidemics.</blockquote><p>In a recent podcast, Rob Wiblin and Tara Kirk Sell were discussing what they had recently changed their minds about. They <u><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tara-kirk-sell-covid-19-misinformation-performance-reopen/\">picked out the same thing</a></u>:</p><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> Has the response affected your views on what policies are necessary or should be prioritized for next time?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tara Kirk Sell:</strong> The fact that &#x201C;Stay-at-home orders&#x201D; are actually possible in the US and seem to work&#x2026; I had not really had a lot of faith in that before and I feel like I&#x2019;ve been surprised. But I don&#x2019;t want &#x201C;Stay-at-home orders&#x201D; to be the way we deal with pandemics in the future. Like great, it worked, but I don&#x2019;t want to do this again. </blockquote><p>Or this from <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P7crAscAzftdE7ffv/covid-19-my-current-model\">Zvi</a></u>:</p><blockquote>5. Fewer than 3 million US coronavirus deaths: 90%</blockquote><blockquote>I held. Again, we saw very good news early, so to get to 3 million now we&#x2019;d need full system collapse to happen quickly. It&#x2019;s definitely still possible, but I&#x2019;m guessing we&#x2019;re now more like 95% to avoid this than 90%.</blockquote><p>Lastly, we have the news from the current hardest-hit places, like Manhattan, which have already hit <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P7crAscAzftdE7ffv/covid-19-my-current-model#R0_Under_American_Style_Lockdown_Conditions_Defaults_To_Just_Under_One__Which_New_York_Escaped_Via_Partial_Herd_Immunity\">partial herd immunity</a></u> and show every sign of being able to contain coronavirus going forward even with imperfect measures.</p><h1>The Morituri Nolumus Mori effect</h1><p>Many of these facts (in particular the reason that 100 million plus dead is effectively ruled out) have multiple explanations. For one, the earliest data on coronavirus implied the <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RukXjEvMfqDKRJaup/what-will-be-the-big-picture-implications-of-the-coronavirus?commentId=mz3PNByTdu3DF9sn4\">hospitalization rate was 10-20% for all age groups</a></u>, and we now know it is <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_nickdavies/status/1268153015262904326\">substantially lower</a></u> (that tweet by an author of the <u><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">Imperial College paper</a></u>, which estimated a hospitalization rate of 4.4%). This means that if hospitals were entirely unable to cope with the number of patients, the IFR would be in the range of 2%, not 20% initially implied.</p><p>However, the rest of our information about the characteristics of the virus in early March- the estimate of R0 and &#x2018;standard&#x2019; IFR, were fairly close to the mark. Our predictions were working off of reasonable data about the virus. Any prediction made then about the number of people who would be infected isn&#x2019;t affected by this hospitalization rates confounder, nor is any prediction about what measures would be implemented. So there must be some other reason for these mistakes - and a common thread among nearly all the inaccurate pessimistic predictions was that they underestimated the forcefulness, though not the level of forethought or planning, behind mitigation or suppression measures. As it is <u><a href=\"https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/95\">written,</a></u></p><blockquote>&quot;Brains don&apos;t work that way. They don&apos;t suddenly supercharge when the stakes go up - or wh<em>en they do, it&apos;s within hard limits.</em> I couldn&apos;t calculate the thousandth digit of pi if someone&apos;s life depended on it.&quot;</blockquote><p>The Morituri Nolumus Mori effect, as a reminder, is the thesis that governments and individuals have a consistent, short-term reaction to danger which is stronger than many of us suspected, though not sustainable in the absence of an imminent threat. This effect is just such a hard limit - it can&#x2019;t do very much except work as a stronger than expected brake. And something like it has been proposed as an explanation, not just by me two months ago but by Will MacAskill and Toby Ord, for why we have already avoided the worst disasters. Here&#x2019;s Toby&#x2019;s <u><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/timeliest-book-2020-a-j-jacobs-1e/\">recent interview</a></u>:</p><blockquote>Learning the right lessons will involve not just identifying and patching our vulnerabilities, but pointing towards strengths we didn&#x2019;t know we had. The unprecedented measures governments have taken in response to the pandemic, and the public support for doing so, should make us more confident that when the stakes are high we can take decisive action to protect ourselves and our most vulnerable. And when faced with truly global problems, we are able to come together as individuals and nations, in ways we might not have thought possible. This isn&#x2019;t about being self-congratulatory, or ignoring our mistakes, but in seeing the glimmers of hope in this hardship. </blockquote><p>Will MacAskill made reference to the MNM effect in a pre-coronavirus interview, explaining why he puts the<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/will-macaskill-paralysis-and-hinge-of-history/#the-risk-of-human-extinction-in-the-next-hundred-years-21520\"> <u>probability of X-risks relatively low</u></a>.</p><blockquote>Second then, is just thinking in terms of the rational choice of the main actors. So what&#x2019;s the willingness to pay from the perspective of the United States to reduce a single percentage point of human extinction whereby that just means the United States has three hundred million people. How much do they want to not die? So assume the United States don&#x2019;t care about the future. They don&#x2019;t care about people in other countries at all. Well, it&#x2019;s still many trillions of dollars is the willingness to pay just to reduce one percentage point of existential risk. And so you&#x2019;ve got to think that something&#x2019;s gone wildly wrong, where people are making such incredibly irrational decisions.</blockquote><p>Bill Gates also<a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Pandemic-Innovation\"> <u>referred to this effect.</u></a> </p><p>I also think that the MNM effect is the main reason why both Metaculus and <u><a href=\"https://goodjudgment.io/covid/dashboard/\">superforecasters </a></u>consistently predicted deaths will stay below 10 million, implying a very slow burn, neither suppression nor full herd immunity, right across most of the world.</p><h2>The Control System</h2><p>From <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/18/coronalinks-5-18-20-when-all-you-have-is-a-hammer-everything-starts-looking-like-a-dance/\">Slatestarcodex:</a></u></p><blockquote>Is there a possibility where R0 is exactly 1? Seems unlikely &#x2013; one is a pretty specific number. On the other hand, it&#x2019;s been weirdly close to one in the US, and worldwide, for the past month or two. You could imagine an unfortunate control system, where every time the case count goes down, people stop worrying and go out and have fun, and every time the case count goes up, people freak out and stay indoors, and overall the new case count always hovers at the same rate. I&#x2019;ve never heard of this happening, but this is a novel situation.</blockquote><p>One more speculative consequence of the MNM effect is that a reactive, strong push against uncontrolled pandemic spread is a good explanation for why Rt tends to approach 1 in countries without a coordinated government response, like the United States, and the more coordinated the response the further below 1 Rt can be pushed. A priori, we might expect that there is some &#x2018;minimal default level&#x2019; of response that leads to Rt being decreased from R0, 3-4, to some much lower value - but why is the barometer set around 1? It&#x2019;s not a coincidence, as <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P7crAscAzftdE7ffv/covid-19-my-current-model\">Zvi points out</a></u>.</p><blockquote>Whenever something lands almost exactly on the only inflection point, in this case R0 of one where the rate of cases neither increases nor decreases, the right reaction is suspicion.</blockquote><blockquote>In this case, the explanation is that a control system is in play. People are paying tons of attention to when things are &#x2018;getting better&#x2019; or &#x2018;getting worse&#x2019; and adjusting behaviour, both legally required actions and voluntary actions.</blockquote><p>The MNM effect is apparently so predictable that, with short-ish term feedback, it can form a control system. The other end of this control system is all the usual cognitive and institutional biases that prevent us from taking these events seriously and actually planning for them. </p><p>It is possible this is the first time such a control system has formed to mitigate a widespread disaster. Disasters of this size are rare throughout history. Add to this the fact that such control systems can only form when the threat unfolds and changes over several months, giving people time to veer between incaution and caution. Meanwhile, the short term feedback which governments and people can access about the progress of the epidemic is relatively new - better data collection and mass media make modern populations much more sensitive to the current level of threat than those throughout history. Remembering that noone knows exactly where or when the Spanish Flu began highlights that good real-time monitoring of a pandemic is an extremely new thing. </p><p>In our current situation of equilibrium created by a control system, the remaining uncertainties are: <em>can we do better than the equilibrium position?</em> (sociological and political) and <em>how bad is the equilibrium position?</em> (mainly a matter of the disease dynamics). It seems to me, the equilibrium probably ends in partial herd immunity (nowhere near 75% &apos;full herd immunity&apos;, because of MNM). This involves healthcare systems struggling to cope to some extent along the way. The US is essentially bound for equilibrium - but what that entails is not clear.  I could imagine the equilibrium holding Rt near 1 even in the absence of any government foresight or planning but it doesn&#x2019;t seem very likely, as some commenters <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P7crAscAzftdE7ffv/covid-19-my-current-model?commentId=6vF5mmNrRgPKDuB6i\">pointed out</a></u>. More likely it ends with partial herd immunity.</p><p>However, there is still a push away from this equilibrium in Europe (e.g. attempts to use national-level tracing and testing programs). This push is not that strong and depends on individuals sticking to social distancing rules. European lockdowns brought Rt down to between 0.6 and 0.8, noticeably below 1, indicating that they beat the equilibrium to some degree for a while. Rt got down to 0.4 in Wuhan, suggesting great success in beating the equilibrium.</p><p>That is the other lesson - any level of government foresight or planning adds on to the already existing MNM effect - witness how foot traffic levels <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/18/coronalinks-5-18-20-when-all-you-have-is-a-hammer-everything-starts-looking-like-a-dance/\">dramatically declined</a></u> before lockdowns were instituted, or even if they were never instituted, right across the world. The effects are additive. So if the default holds Rt near 1, then a few extra actions by a government able to look some degree into the future can make all the difference.</p><h1>Conclusions</h1><p>I consider that the number of predictions that have already been falsified or rendered unlikely is sufficient to establish that the MNM effect exists, or is stronger than many of us thought early on (I don&#x2019;t imagine there were many people who would have denied the MNM effect exists at all, i.e. expected us to just walk willingly to our deaths). &#x2018;Dumb reopening&apos; as is happening the US, as a successor to lockdowns that have pushed R to almost exactly 1, is consistent with what I have claimed - that our reliable and predictable short-term reactivity (governmental and individual) and desire to not die, the Morituri Nolumus Mori effect, serves as a brake against the very worst outcomes. What next?</p><p>Conceivably, the control system could keep running, and R could stay near 1 perpetually even with no effective planning or well-enforced lockdowns, or there could be a slow grind as the virus spreads up to a partial herd immunity threshold - either way, the MNM effect is there, screening off some outcomes that looked likely in early March, such as a single sharp peak. Similarly, the MNM effect gives a helping hand to attempts at real strategy. Some governments that are competent in the face of massive threats but slow to react (such as Germany) did better than expected because of the caution of citizens who started restricting their movements before lockdown and who now aren&#x2019;t taking full advantage of reopened public spaces. </p><p>From the perspective of predicting future X-risks, the overall outcome of this pandemic is less interesting than the fact that there has been a consistent, unanticipated push from reactive actions against the spread of the virus. Then there is a further, also relevant issue of whether countries can beat the equilibrium (of R being held at near 1 or just above 1) and do better than the MNM effect mandates. So far, Europe spent a while beating equilibrium (with R during lockdown at 0.6-0.8) and China drove R down even further. </p><p>The first remaining uncertainty is: <em>can a specific country/the world as a whole do better than this equilibrium position?</em> We do have some pertinent evidence to answer this in the form of the<u><a href=\"https://goodjudgment.io/covid/dashboard/\"> superforecaster predictions</a></u> and, though it is confounded by the next uncertainty, from<u><a href=\"https://covid19-projections.com/united-kingdom\"> disease modelling</a></u>. The insights of disease modelling should shed light on the question: <em>how bad is this equilibrium position?</em> If we knew this we would have a better sense of what the reasonable worst case scenario is for coronavirus, but that is not important from an x-risk perspective. </p><p>This makes it clear what kinds of evidence are worth looking out for. We should look at the performance of areas of the world where there is little advance planning, but nevertheless the people are informed about the level of day-to-day danger and leaders don&#x2019;t actively oppose individual efforts at safety. Parts of the United States fit the bill. Seeing the eventual outcomes in these areas, when compared to some initial predictions about just how bad things <em>could</em> get, will give us an idea of the extra help provided by the MNM effect. Then, with that as our baseline, we can see how many countries do better to judge the further help provided by planning or an actual strategy.</p><h2>Implications for X-risks</h2><p>The most basic lesson that should be learned from this disaster is, of course, that <u><a href=\"https://www.quotes.net/mquote/863652\">for the moment </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4_0BrBF2Jc\">we are inadequate</a> </u>- unable to coordinate as long as there is any uncertainty about what to do, and unable to meaningfully plan in advance for plausible near-term threats like those from pandemics. We should of course remember that not enough focus is put on long-term risks, that our institutions are flawed in dealing with them.</p><p>Covid-19 shows that there can still be a strong reaction once it is clear there is disaster coming. We have some idea already just how strong this reaction is. We have less idea how effective it will end up being. In February and March, we often observed a kind of pluralistic ignorance, where even experts raising the alarm did so in a way that was muted and seemingly aimed at &#x2018;not causing panic&#x2019;.</p><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> I think part of what was going on was perhaps people wanted to promote this idea of &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t panic&#x201D; because they were worried that the public would panic and they felt that the way to do that was really to talk down the risk a lot and then it kind of got a bit out of control, but I&#x2019;m not sure how big the risk of&#x2026; It seems like what&#x2019;s ended up happening is much worse than the public panicking in January. Or maybe I just haven&#x2019;t seen what happens when the public really panics. I guess people panicked later and it wasn&#x2019;t that bad.</blockquote><p>Suppose this dynamic applies in a future disaster. We might expect to see a sudden phase change from indifference to panic despite the fact that trouble was already looming anyway and no new information has appeared. </p><p>If there is enough forewarning before the disaster occurs that a phase shift in attitudes can take place, we will react hard. Suppose the R0 of Coronavirus had been 1.5-2, and the rest of our response had been otherwise the same - suppression measures taken in the US and elsewhere would have worked perfectly even though we were sleepwalking towards disaster as recently as three weeks before. The only reason this didn&#x2019;t happen is because of contingent facts about this particular virus. On the other hand, there are magnitudes of disaster which the MNM effect is clearly inadequate for - suppose the R0 had been 8.</p><p>Perhaps the MNM effect is stronger for a disaster, like a pandemic, for which there is some degree of historical memory and evolved emotions and intuitions around things like purity and disgust which can take over and influence our risk-mitigation behaviour. Maybe technological disasters that don&#x2019;t have the same deep evolutionary routes, like nuclear war, or X-risks like unaligned AGI that have literally never happened before, would not evoke the same strong, consistent reaction because the threat is even less comprehensible.</p><p>Nevertheless, one could imagine a slow AI takeoff scenario with a lot of the same characteristics as coronavirus, where the MNM effect steps in at the last moment:</p><p>It takes place over a couple of years. Every day there are slight increases in some relevant warning sign. A group of safety people raise the alarm but are mostly ignored. There are smaller scale disasters in the run-up, but people don&#x2019;t learn their lesson (analogous to SARS-1 and MERS). Major news orgs and government announce there is nothing to worry about (analogous to initial statements about masks and travel bans). Then there is a sudden change in attitudes for no obvious reason. At some point everyone freaks out - bans and restrictions on AI development, right before the crisis hits. Or, possibly, right when it is already too late.</p><p>The lesson to be learned is that there may be a phase shift in the level of danger posed by certain X-risks - if the amount of advance warning or the speed of the unfolding disaster is above some minimal threshold, even if that threshold would seem like far too little time to do anything given our previous inadequacy, then there is still a chance for the MNM effect to take over and avert the worst outcome. In other words, AI takeoff with a small amount of forewarning might go a lot better than a scenario where there is no forewarning, even if past performance suggests we would do nothing useful with that forewarning.</p><p>More speculatively, I think we can see the MNM effect&#x2019;s influence in other settings where we have consistently avoided the very worst outcomes despite systematic inadequacy - Anders Sandberg referenced something like it when he was discussing the probability of nuclear war. There have been <em>many</em> near misses when nuclear war could have started, implying that we can&#x2019;t have been lucky over and over. Instead that there has been a stronger skew towards interventions that <u><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/anders-sandberg-extending-life/\">halt disaster at the last moment</a></u>, compared to not-the-last-moment:</p><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> So just to be clear, you&#x2019;re saying there&#x2019;s a lot of near misses, but that hasn&#x2019;t updated you very much in favor of thinking that the risk is very high. That&#x2019;s the reverse of what I expected.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Anders Sandberg:</strong> Yeah.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> Explain the reasoning there.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Anders Sandberg:</strong> So imagine a world that has a lot of nuclear warheads. So if there is a nuclear war, it&#x2019;s guaranteed to wipe out humanity, and then you compare that to a world where is a few warheads. So if there&#x2019;s a nuclear war, the risk is relatively small. Now in the first dangerous world, you would have a very strong deflection. Even getting close to the state of nuclear war would be strongly disfavored because most histories close to nuclear war end up with no observers left at all.</blockquote><blockquote>In the second one, you get the much weaker effect, and now over time you can plot when the near misses happen and the number of nuclear warheads, and you actually see that they don&#x2019;t behave as strongly as you would think. If there was a very strong anthropic effect you would expect very few near misses during the height of the Cold War, and in fact you see roughly the opposite. So this is weirdly reassuring. In some sense the Petrov incident implies that we are slightly safer about nuclear war.</blockquote><p>On the other hand, the MNM effect requires leaders and individuals to have access to information about the state of the world <em>right now</em> (i.e. how dangerous are things at the moment). Even in countries with reasonably free flow of information this is <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1269254608758530049\">not a given</a></u>. If you accept Eliezer Yudkowksy&#x2019;s thesis that <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YicoiQurNBxSp7a65/is-clickbait-destroying-our-general-intelligence\">clickbait has impaired </a></u>our ability to understand a persistent, objective external world then you might be more pessimistic about the MNM effect going forward. Perhaps for this reason, we should expect countries with higher social trust, and therefore more ability for individuals to agree on a consensus reality and understand the level of danger posed, to perform better. Japan and the countries in Northern Europe like Denmark and Sweden come to mind, and all of them have performed better than the mitigation measures employed by their governments would suggest.</p><p>The principle that I&#x2019;ve called the Morituri Nolumus Mori effect is defined in terms of the map, not the territory - a place where our predictions diverged from reality in an easily and consistently describable way - that the short-term reaction from many governments and individuals was <em>stronger than we expected</em>, whilst advance planning and reasoning was as weak as we expected. The MNM effect may also be a feature of the territory. It may already have a name in the field of social psychology, or several names. It may be a contingent artefact of lots of local facts about only our coronavirus response, though I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s plausible for the reasons given above. Either way, I believe that it was an important missing piece, probably the biggest missing piece, in our early predictions and needs to be considered further if we want to refine our analysis of X-risks going forward. One of the few upsides to this catastrophe is that it has provided us with a small-scale test run of some dynamics that might play out during a genuine catastrophic or existential risk, and we should be sure to exploit that for all its worth.</p>",

The next thing I try when mediating conflict is to temporarily ignore whatever I believe and work to understand both sides of the argument equally. I called this post &#x201C;comprehension&#x201D;, but it could equally just be called &#x201C;listening&#x201D;, or maybe more precisely &#x201C;active listening&#x201D;. Honestly, Stephen Covey has already said most of this far better than I can in his book <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>. Habit number five is &#x201C;seek first to understand&#x201D;, which captures the spirit of things.</p><p>The value of truly understanding both sides of a conflict cannot be overstated. Even when I&#x2019;ve nominally resolved a conflict, I get antsy if I still don&#x2019;t really grok one side or the other. More than once, trying to scratch that itch &#x201C;after the fact&#x201D; has turned up a hidden requirement or pain point which would have just caused more grief down the road. Remember, success is rarely as simple as just making the conflict go away; you can&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;ve truly found success (not just victory) unless you properly understand both sides.</p><p>But understanding both sides isn&#x2019;t just an after-the-fact thing. It also has concrete value in guiding the resolution of a conflict when you&#x2019;re caught in the middle of it, because it allows you to properly apply the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity\">principle of charity</a>. The principle of charity says that you should try and find the best possible interpretation for people&#x2019;s arguments, even when they aren&#x2019;t always clear or coherent. It goes back to assuming good faith; maybe an argument sounds crazy, but <em>it makes sense to the person saying it</em>. The only way to apply the principle of charity in many cases is to start by understanding the argument, and the person making it.</p><p>Understanding both sides is also a key part of something called &#x201C;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning\">steelmanning</a>&#x201C;, which is the process of actively finding better versions of another person&#x2019;s arguments. This may seem like an odd thing to do in a conflict, but only if you&#x2019;ve accidentally slipped back into the habit of aiming for victory instead of success. Assume good faith, and work with both sides to fully develop the points they&#x2019;re trying to make. Doing this brings clarity to the discussion which can often illuminate the crux of the conflict.</p><p>Of course sometimes being charitable is <em>hard</em>. People may make arguments which just seem&#x2026; wrong. Crazy. Even harmful. (The topic of whether an argument can be harmful in and of itself is a fascinating one I don&#x2019;t have space for here. Whatever you believe, it isn&#x2019;t relevant to the point I&#x2019;m trying to make). A lot of people would suggest that trying to understand or improve an argument like that is a waste of time, or even ethically wrong. I disagree. I believe that truly understanding both sides of a conflict is fundamentally valuable, no matter what that conflict is. It clarifies. It builds empathy. It expands your knowledge of the world. And even if by the end you still deeply disagree, understanding the argument will let you articulate a better response.</p><h2>Practical Tips</h2><p>The principle is all well and good, but getting to that level of understanding in practice can be really hard. It&#x2019;s a skill that gets easier with repetition, so I would encourage you to practice it as much as possible, even for small conflicts where it might not seem necessary. Build that habit when it&#x2019;s easy, and you&#x2019;ll find that it becomes automatic even when it&#x2019;s hard. Still, if you&#x2019;re trying and you&#x2019;re really stuck, I&#x2019;ve got a trick which helps me when I just can&#x2019;t seem to connect with what somebody is saying.</p><p>To better understand a different perspective, try splitting an argument up into the separate pieces of a problem and a solution. A lot of arguments fit into this pattern quite naturally, and I often find that while I couldn&#x2019;t quite grasp the argument as a whole, I both understand and even agree with the problem; it&#x2019;s the solution that&#x2019;s causing me issues. Even then, having the problem separated out and well-defined can lead me to understanding the solution too, because it frequently highlights some unstated premise which I wasn&#x2019;t aware of. This is also a great way to practice steelmanning, since making implied premises explicit is a great way to improve an argument; people are pretty bad at this by default.</p><p>I should also note that if this trick kind of works for a situation, but doesn&#x2019;t quite, you should try making the problem even more general. For example, if the argument is &#x201C;Mexicans are taking our jobs, so we should stop immigration from Mexico&#x201D;, it&#x2019;s tempting to define the problem as just &#x201C;Mexicans are taking our jobs&#x201D;, but it&#x2019;s probably more productive to define it as something like &#x201C;something is taking our jobs&#x201D; or even &#x201C;our economic prospects suck&#x201D;. This pulls out an implied premise (that the cause is Mexican immigrants) which may be the real point of disagreement, but even apart from that, finding a problem which you can be sympathetic to is worth its weight in gold. With this kind of problem in hand, you can reframe the conflict as a cooperative mission, working together to find the best solution to the problem. You can start to look for success, not victory.</p><h2>Standards of Understanding</h2><p>It&#x2019;s often said that the real acid test for truly understanding somebody&#x2019;s argument is the ability to explain it back to them in a way they will agree with. This is good, and you should definitely aim for this (trying to explain it back is also a useful trick for conflict resolution in general), but sometimes I find it useful to use a slightly higher bar. I consider myself to really properly understand an argument when I can not only explain it to the person who made it, but can also explain (to myself, not to them) how they came to believe it. Both sides of the conflict are part of the universe, so to understand the universe you have to know how both sides came to be.</p><p>This may seem like an esoteric or excessively demanding standard, and it isn&#x2019;t necessary all the time. But there are interesting and practical sources of conflict where this is a really useful approach that provides a lot of insight. Religion is my favourite example of this; most theistic worldviews can pretty naturally explain the existence of atheists, but a lot of atheists have a hard time explaining the existence of theists. &#x201C;People are dumb&#x201D; may be emotionally satisfying, but doing the work of constructing a real explanation builds a lot of empathy and ends up sharpening the resulting argument.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve covered a lot of different ground in this section, but I think I can boil it down to four key points to take away:</p><ol><li>Seek always to understand.</li><li>Actively look for the best version of everyone&#x2019;s arguments.</li><li>Separate the problem and the solution.</li><li>To truly understand, you must explain how both sides came to be.</li></ol>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Sometimes I write things in places that aren't here. Sometimes I think those things are worth preserving. Some of those things follow, with minor editing, mostly on the subject of various movies that I've watched. Also two stage musicals, one TV show, one short story, and one music video. They were written over the past four years, so I can't necessarily talk intelligently about these things any more. When I name a thing, spoilers generally follow.</p>\n\n<h3>I don't really get <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurt_Locker\">The Hurt Locker</a></em></h3>\n\n<p>It seemed like it was going to be a film about a cowboy with a death wish, who should be removed from duty but isn't because of institutional dysfunction in the US army. Or something along those lines.</p>\n\n<p>Instead it turned out to be… a film about a cowboy with a death wish?</p>\n\n<p>Like there's that bit where he's just been a <em>fucking idiot</em> who could have gotten everybody killed</p>\n\n<p>(not very specific so far)</p>\n\n<p>And someone who I got the impression outranks him comes up to him like «oh you seem like hot shit. Just how hot shit are you? Yeah that's pretty hot shit» in a tone that I swear is subtextually «I'm about to rip you a new one»</p>\n\n<p>and then the scene just ends. No one gets ripped a new anything.</p>\n\n<p>What?</p>\n\n<p>His team mates realise how dangerous he is to be around. But they don't do anything about it, just get pissed at him. And also he's supposedly defused almost a thousand bombs. There's tension there, a question of how he hasn't died yet (did he used to be good at his job and recently something happened to make him so reckless?) but the film doesn't acknowledge it, it doesn't seem to think \"being a fucking dangerous idiot cowboy\" and \"successfully defusing almost a thousand bombs\" are at all incompatible?</p>\n\n<p>This was a really well regarded movie. It won six Oscars, including best picture, best screenplay and best director. Part of me would be inclined to chalk that up to politics, but the movie isn't even especially political from what I could tell; I'm pretty sure it could have been made both more political and a better movie. So I don't think that's a complete explanation.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect all the praise came for reasons that I missed either because I was distracted by this stuff or because I'm just not into the kind of movie it was trying to be or something. But that's really not very specific.</p>\n\n<h3><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_%282016_film%29\">The Jungle Book</a></em> (2016) is surprisingly pro-human?</h3>\n\n<p>I don't think it was intended, and I might be putting too much of myself into it. But like-</p>\n\n<p>Right up until the climax, tool use is shown as almost unambiguously good. Mowgli bangs rocks together to get a sharp stone to cut vines to make rope so he can climb down a cliff face and knock honeycombs with a stick, armored in clothes he makes. He collects honey on an unprecedented scale. Then he saves an elephant from a pit.</p>\n\n<p>(The music to that scene is \"The Bare Necessities\", a song about how you should just take life easy and all your needs will be met. Everything you need is right within your reach. The implication seems to be that \"using tools to extend your reach\" is just the obvious, natural, path-of-least-resistance thing to do?)</p>\n\n<p>And the counterpoint isn't really there, though there's plenty of opportunity. Shere Khan says man isn't allowed in the jungle, but doesn't talk about why. Akela and Bagheera tell Mowgli to act more like a wolf and less like a man, his \"tricks\" are not the wolf way, but don't say what the problems are with manhood. Kaa shows fire being dangerous, but then with more realism shows fire being used to fight off Shere Khan and save Mowgli's life. Mowgli refuses to give fire to King Louie but doesn't explain his refusal. The elephant could have fallen into a human trap, but instead it was apparently just a pit. And the bees?</p>\n\n<p>From the bees' perspective, I imagine Mowgli is probably terrifying. He knocks down honeycomb after honeycomb and he just keeps going. He's an existential threat to their society and there's nothing they can do about it, though they throw their lives away trying to stop him. I imagine.</p>\n\n<p>But the movie doesn't show that or invite us to think about it. In a world where the animals all talk to each other, the bees are silent. When they sting, it's to teach us about Baloo's trickery and Mowgli's cleverness. They might as well be thistles.</p>\n\n<p>The film has so many opportunities to show or at least tell us that man is destructive, man will kill everyone in the jungle. But it mostly doesn't seem to take them.</p>\n\n<p>So when Mowgli goes to steal fire - well, we know what's going to happen, but only because we already know fire. The movie hasn't given us any particular reason to be scared of it. Also, the mythical associations of stealing fire are fairly pro-fire.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, the fire spreads and Mowgli throws his torch away. But then he fights using some other things humans excel at: coalition-building, getting other people to fight for you, and making a wolf think you're part of its family.</p>\n\n<p>(Here I do think I'm putting in too much of myself. I think the climax is meant to be about winning by combing animal things and man things. The coalition-building is introduced with the law of the jungle, \"the strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack\". Then Bagheera says \"fight him like a man\". Then Mowgli says \"dead tree\" calling back to what Bagheera taught him in the beginning. And in the end Mowgli stays in the jungle. I think that's what is going for, but it's not what I got from it.)</p>\n\n<p>And the fire is put out without too much trouble (when the elephants decide \"actually, it would be better if this river went in this direction\" and do some engineering works, not done by humans but very human of them), and we haven't actually seen it kill anyone.</p>\n\n<p>So the film roughly seems to be about how the things that separate man from the animals are actually really great. And that's… not what I was expecting.</p>\n\n<h3>Review: <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Mormon_%28musical%29\">The Book of Mormon</a></em></h3>\n\n<p>From memory, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_America:_World_Police\">Team America</a></em> was funny and it had decent music. But what made it so great was that while parodying action films, it still managed to be just legitimately good as an action film.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Book of Mormon</em> was funny and it had decent music.</p>\n\n<h3>How many levels of irony is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodbye_Mr._A\">Goodbye Mr A</a> on?</h3>\n\n<p>The lyrics are overtly critical of Mr A, but subtextually feel critical of the singers, who dislike him for exposing their flaws to themselves. (\"You claim science ain't magic and expect me to buy it\"; \"you promised you would love us but you knew too much\" \"so busy showing me where I'm wrong, you forgot to switch your feelings on\". And like, \"if love is subtraction, your number is up / your love is a fraction, it's not adding up\" - I could believe that was written seriously, but I hope not.) And the first part of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeNNfS0ZTnU\">the video</a> clearly makes out the Hoosiers to be the villains, partly the whole \"kidnapping a superhero\" thing and partly idk, they just look subtly villainous. Possibly related to camera angles.</p>\n\n<p>But then they go on to take his place, and as far as I can see they do it fine? We only see two of their deeds, but they rescue a cat and stop a burglary. Wikipedia says they fight crime as incompetent antiheros, but I'm not seeing the incompetence. And they become immensely popular.</p>\n\n<p>If we're meant to see them as incompetent, then it reads to me like a criticism of society-at-large; a claim that the singers' narcissism is widespread. But if we're not, then…?</p>\n\n<p>Also relevant: if it's critical of society, or even just the singers, then by extension it's defensive of Mr A. And if Mr A is meant to be identified with the comic book character, it becomes a defense of objectivism, which feels implausible on priors to me. (But maybe it was more likely in 1997? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard%27s_First_Rule\">Wizard's First Rule</a> only came out a few years before, I think that was objectivist? By reputation that wikipedia doesn't immediately confirm.)</p>\n\n<p>I've been idly wondering this for over ten years. Today I got around to actually rewatching/relistening to it. It didn't help much.</p>\n\n<h3>Superhero origin stories: <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_the_Musical\">Matilda</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_%282017_film%29\">Wonder Woman</a></em></h3>\n\n<p>Wonder Woman has the overt message that ordinary people can't do very much (though not literally nothing). You need someone with super powers to beat up the villain and then everything will be fine. The love interest keeps trying to tell the hero that things are just not that simple, and he keeps getting proved wrong. This message is undercut by the historical realities of WWI.</p>\n\n<p>Matilda has the overt message that ordinary people, even young children, can save the day if they stand up to villainy. Before she gets powers, Matilda tells us that even young kids can do something to make things right, and she turns her dad's hair green and glues his hat on his head. In the climax, the kids revolt against Miss Trunchbull, saying \"she can't put us all in chokey\". This message is undercut by the fact that all of this is completely ineffectual. Matilda's dad doesn't become any less abusive or criminal. Trunchbull can and does put them all in chokey. What saves the day is someone using super powers to scare Miss Truchbull into running away, and then someone using the Russian mafia to scare the dad into running away.</p>\n\n<h3><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face/Off\">Face/Off</a></em> as a retelling of the Gospel narrative</h3>\n\n<p>Admittedly I haven't really read the gospels, so maybe I'm completely off base here. But consider:</p>\n\n<p>God (signified by Sean Archer) takes on the form of a sinner (signified by Castor Troy), in order to redeem the sinners. He's pretty successful. Most notably, when Sasha dies, it comes from acting as a force for good, sacrificing herself to save an innocent. She tells Archer not to let her son grow up like him. And so her son (named Adam, signifying Man) grows up in the house of God.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the Devil (also signified by Castor Troy) attempts to seduce God's followers (Archer's family and colleagues) off of the righteous path, but he's ultimately unsuccessful. People learn to see past outward appearances to what really matters: we know him by his works (the story of his date with Eve). Evil contains the seeds of its own downfall, and Jamie stabs him with the butterfly knife he gave her.</p>\n\n<p>Assorted other thoughts:</p>\n\n<p>\"Sean\" is derived from John, meaning \"God is gracious\". Arrows are of course both straight and narrow, signifying the path of God; \"Archer\" doesn't just follow the path of God, he directs it.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, \"Castor\" is cognate to (or at least sounds a bit like) \"caster\", as in a witch; and \"Troy\" refers to the Trojan war, signifying violence and trickery. Castor's brother is named \"Pollux\", a decidedly ugly name that sounds a lot like \"pox\", the plague. According to Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_and_Pollux\">Castor and Pollux</a> (brothers of Helen of Troy) spent some time being venerated with Christian saints; and one of them may even have been the basis of John (Sean) the Apostle.</p>\n\n<p>\"Adam\", as I said before, signifies Man; Archer's daughter is named \"Jamie\", a gender-neutral name, to ensure we know that God loves his sons and daughters and nonbinary children equally.</p>\n\n<p>Archer's blood type is O-, the \"purest\" blood type (i.e. fewest antigens in the cells), which gives to all. Troy's is AB (unspecified, so probably AB+), the most \"contaminated\" type, which takes from all and never gives back. (<em>House</em> has used this same metaphor.)</p>\n\n<p>Canonically, I think Jesus is supposed to get crucified and stabbed with the holy lance. The film has both of these elements, but gets it a bit confused; while Troy is in the classic raised-arms position, Archer shoots him with a harpoon gun.</p>\n\n<p>The final confrontation, in which Good defeats Evil once and for all, is kicked off in a church; symbolically, in The Church, the hearts of God's followers. The battle startles the doves in the church, but we never see a dove die: the peace in our hearts may be disturbed, but will always return.</p>\n\n<p>It's hard to miss the symbolism of Archer breaking out of a hellish prison.<sup><a href=\"#fn:miss\">1</a></sup> (The part of Thomas is briefly played by Jamie, when she shoots him.) The prison being named Erewhon (\"nowhere\" spelled almost backwards) probably intends to take a position on some Christian point of contention that I'm not familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>You never see the butterfly knife being opened or closed. The cuts are kind of jarring, as if to draw attention to this fact. I think it's trying to tell us something about temptation: we may think we can stray a little, and turn back before we go too far down the wrong path. But by the time we know we're going too far, we've already gone too far. (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BEtzRE2M5m9YEAQpX/there-s-no-fire-alarm-for-artificial-general-intelligence\">cf</a>)</p>\n\n<p>This is perhaps the most overtly anti-makeup film I remember seeing ever.</p>\n\n<p>Don't think too hard about the fact that Archer's wife, Adam's adoptive mother, is named Eve.</p>\n\n<h3>Hot take: the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_%28franchise%29\">Saw</a></em> franchise as exploration of meritocracy</h3>\n\n<p>Members of the underclass are given tests. If they pass, they get a new life. Thus, the meritorious are elevated to the elite. Meritocracy!</p>\n\n<p>(Once you've survived a Saw trap, food tastes nicer, your addiction vanishes, you quit the job you hate and get the one you've always dreamed of, puppies and rainbows and so on. I'm not sure how much this is actually shown in the series, but it's what Jigsaw is going for, and the series is much more interesting if it works.)</p>\n\n<p>This would be pretty dumb, but not obviously dumber than some of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3%25\">other stuff</a> out there.<sup><a href=\"#fn:3-pct\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<h3>Review: <em><a href=\"https://thefloatinglibrary.com/2008/09/13/a-yellow-rose/\">A Yellow Rose</a></em></h3>\n\n<p><em>(Someone on reddit was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/ejxotj/are_books_worth_it/\">wondering</a> whether books are worth it. Someone recommended <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges\">Borges</a> to them, and in particular this story. The version I initially read was a slightly different translation to the one linked. I didn't like the story, but it has the virtue of being considerably shorter than this review.)</em></p>\n\n<p>I gotta admit, this does not sell Borges to me.</p>\n\n<p>Fair warning, this is gonna come across as fairly dismissive/derisive/antagonistic. I could try to describe my reaction without coming across like that, but it would be hard to do, and especially hard to do honestly.</p>\n\n<p>To me it feels like a short piece of philosophy (\"it lay within… the world's contents\"), wrapped in some prose.</p>\n\n<p>I don't feel like the prose adds anything to the philosophy. Like for example I don't see it as an illustration of the thing the philosophy is meant to teach us. (If anything, the philosophy is trying to teach us that the prose <em>can't</em> illustrate it.) So if that's all it is, then I'd rather the philosophy be presented by itself, so that I could read it more easily, and comment on it without feeling like someone's going to tell me I'm missing the point.</p>\n\n<p>Commenting on the prose by itself… stylistically, it uses too many words in too few sentences, and feels like a chore to read.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that strikes me is that for Borges to write this story, he must have had the same epiphany as Marino and (maybe) Homer and Dante. Since those are the only people mentioned in relation to the epiphany, it seems that Borges is comparing himself to the three of them. Is that deliberate?</p>\n\n<p>Another thing that strikes me is that if \"the motionless and silent act that took place that afternoon\" is meant to be \"Marino having an epiphany\", then we're told that: it happened \"on the eve of his death\"; that it was \"the last thing that happened in his life\"; but also that \"it was neither that afternoon nor the next that Giambattista Marino died\". This seems inconsistent, and given the focus on it, I assume it was intentional. But I have no idea why.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know what the poetry means, or whether the meaning is important.<sup><a href=\"#fn:translation\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>I could well be missing something here, and whether I am or not I suspect it's partly just a question of taste.</p>\n\n<h3><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Fantastic_%28film%29\">Captain Fantastic</a></em> is such a good movie</h3>\n\n<p>It's an exploration of culture. Ben and Leslie created their own culture and raised their kids in it. The kids have almost no exposure to American culture. Culture Fantastic isn't perfect, and Ben isn't a flawless exemplar of it. There are some things it does better than American culture, and other things it does worse. But it's fine.</p>\n\n<p>But when Culture Fantastic meets American culture, they clash. American kids seem weak, uneducated, not formidable. Fantastic kids seem - weird, socially unskilled, vaguely autistic.</p>\n\n<p>And this should be fine, but none of the adults really respect the other culture. Ben's not especially rude, he knows he's on foreign ground and tries to be respectful to people's faces except when it matters, he just sometimes fails because he's human and hurting. It probably helps that he was probably raised in American culture, too. But he clearly does not approve of the culture. Meanwhile, Leslie's parents give her a Christian funeral, despite her own wishes. Two couples threaten to have the Fantastic kids taken away, because in their eyes, not being raised in American culture means they'll never survive in the real world - by which they mean American culture.</p>\n\n<p>(And no one particularly respects the kids' wishes. That's not a part of either culture. They mostly like Culture Fantastic and want to stay in it, but if they didn't… I think Ben would come around and let them leave, but not easily.)</p>\n\n<p>And it's particularly resonant for me because damn it, I <em>like</em> Culture Fantastic. He's raising those kids to be much like I want to be, even if it causes friction with the world around me.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I read things that feel like the author thinks my culture is bad and should be destroyed. My culture is not bad. You do not get to take it away from me.</p>\n\n<p><em>Captain Fantastic</em> comes down firmly on the side of \"not bad\", and vaguely-noncomitally on the side of \"do not take away\".</p>\n\n<h3><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacksaw_Ridge\">Hacksaw Ridge</a></em> is three different films</h3>\n\n<p>Act 1: Stick to your principles.<br />\nAct 2: War is hell.<br />\nAct 3: <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Prayer\">The War Prayer</a></em>, but unironically.</p>\n\n<h3><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_%28TV_series%29\">Once Upon a Time</a></em> has terrible ethics</h3>\n\n<p>(Spoilers only up to season 2.)</p>\n\n<p>Snow is way too forgiving of Regina. Fine, characters are allowed to be silly in boring ways. Snow finally makes the right decision and kills Cora, go her! I don't even mind that she feels guilty about it, though I'd much prefer if that was combined with \"but I know it was the right thing to do anyway\".</p>\n\n<p>But the world of the show is like, nope! That was objectively wrong of you! Your heart is black now! Fuck you for wanting to protect your family, fuck consequentialism.</p>\n\n<p>And because of her black heart, supposedly she's now inevitably going to go bad and tear apart her family. (That came from Regina, who may have been making it up, but… I'd give at least 3:1 that it pays off.<sup><a href=\"#fn:payoff\">4</a></sup>)</p>\n\n<p>Other people are allowed to kill, either without their hearts getting black spots or at least without becoming the sort of people that destroy the people they love. But Snow gets held to a higher standard than everyone else, apparently because she's So Good?</p>\n\n<p>So like, if you're the type of person who kills people, you're allowed to kill people. If you're not the type of person who kills people, but you decide that killing someone is the right thing to do anyway, you're not allowed, and if you do it you become Objectively Bad, unlike people for whom killing is just a thing they do.</p>\n\n<p>And! I don't remember if we've ever definitely seen Snow kill someone yet (at the very least she shot someone with an arrow, it's possible he survived), but she led an army to overthrow two kingdoms! At least one of those kingdoms was her suggestion! People die in war! Even if she hasn't directly killed anyone, she has been responsible for lots of deaths! But those don't count because ???</p>\n\n<p>(And it's not because it was indirect, because Cora was indirect too.)</p>\n\n<p>(It could be because she did it with the candle, but that's not how the narrative is pushing.)</p>\n\n<p>It's like only named characters matter. Not just in the sense that the narrative focuses on them, not just in the sense that the named characters only care about other named characters, those both feel like common mistakes that fiction makes. But as a fundamental moral truth of the universe of the show, which feels less common and more annoying.</p>\n\n<p>There's a related thing where… we met Regina and she's evil, and then we see her backstory and she becomes sympathetic even when she's still evil. (And the same with Rumple, and to some extent with Cora.)</p>\n\n<p>But when she's the Evil Queen she tells her people to kill an entire village and they just do it. Regina has sympathetic motives, but her enforcers are anonymous. We don't see whether they're doing it out of fear, sadism, loyalty, a twisted sense of the greater good, whatever. We've been given a glimpse into the lives of the subjects who hate her, but not the ones who serve her.</p>\n\n<p>(Stanley Glass is an admitted exception, and there was her father, and a brief conversation with a henchman of \"I hired you even though you were drunk\" or something, but there's really not much.)</p>\n\n<p>Her followers don't get backstories or redemption narratives or people refusing to kill them because There Must Be Another Way. They just get killed, and the narrative doesn't care.</p>\n\n<p>(Compete aside, Regina blames Snow for turning her evil, while Snow credits Regina for turning her good. Neat twist on \"I made you? You made me first.\")</p>\n<div>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>Confession: I totally missed that when I first wrote this. <a href=\"#fnref:miss\">↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>I haven't actually seen <em>3%</em>.

And yet, in my estimation, there’s at least a 15% probability that Will He Go? will enter the ranks of the most important and prescient books ever written. You should read it right now (or at least read <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/3/21257133/trump-2020-election-meltdown-lawrence-douglas\">this Vox interview</a>), if you want to think through the contours of a civilizational Singularity that seems at least as plausible to me as the AI Singularity, but whose fixed date of November 3, 2020 we’re now hurtling toward.</blockquote><blockquote>In one of the defining memes of the past few years, a sign in a bookstore reads “Dear customers: post-apocalyptic fiction has been moved to the Current Affairs section.” I was reminded of that as Douglas dryly lays out his horror scenario: imagine, hypothetically, that a President of the United States gets elected on a platform of racism and lies, with welcomed assistance from a foreign adversary. Suppose that his every outrage only endears him further to his millions of followers. Suppose that, as this president’s deepest (and perhaps only) principle, he never backs down, never apologizes, never acknowledges any inconvenient fact, and never accepts the legitimacy of any contest that he loses—and this is perfectly rational for him, as he’s been richly rewarded for this strategy his entire life. Suppose that, during the final presidential debate, he pointedly refuses to promise to respect the election outcome if he loses—a first in American history. And suppose that, after eking out a narrow win in the Electoral College, he then turns around and disputes the election anyway (!)—claiming, ludicrously, that he would’ve won the popular vote too, if not for millions of fraudulent voters. Suppose that, for their own sordid reasons, Republican majorities in the Senate and Supreme Court enable this president’s chaotic rule, block his impeachment, and acquiesce to his daily cruelties and lies.</blockquote><blockquote>Then what happens in the <em>next</em> election?</blockquote>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>A surprising amount of rationalists agree that people can often do what seems impossible otherwise if they try really, really hard. It's something on the outset I wouldn't have expected a community of rationalists to believe - on the surface it seems like pure magical thinking - but I think it's nevertheless true anyways, because I see a lot of evidence for it. Lots of startup advice is repetitions of this point; if you want to succeed you can't give up, you have to look for solutions where you don't think on the outset there are any, optimists do better than pessimists, etc. etc. And anecdotally I've found that I have a lot of trouble accurately assessing the limit of my own abilities. I'm usually wrong, not only wrong in the sense that I'm generally inaccurate, but <i>wrong in a specific direction</i>, i.e. I consistently underestimate what I will accomplish when I invoke my inner anime character.&nbsp;</p><p>To say this is true of most people is something that should be pretty jarring. It's not obvious why humans should have a bias toward underestimating themselves in this way. On the other hand, you could also say that this entire phenomenon is all just confirmation and sampling bias. After all, I only ever <i>really</i> find confirmation of the reverse - when I think I can't do something and I find out I can. Most startups do fail, and the ones that succeed are subject to survivorship bias. Intuitively, however, it feels like this is a more common experience for me than it should be, or at least that my errors in this vein are fairly conspicuous examples of faulty reasoning. It's not that I can't think of things I can't do, persay. It would be difficult for me to take a sudden tumble into the sun and survive with no prep time. It's that when I am wrong, the errors seem particularly egregious. I don't know that everyone has this experience, but if my experience is the same for most people, I think have an explanation for it.&nbsp;</p><p>One insight I have is that when doing the impossible there aren't really just two modes, all-out-attack and normal attempts. What I've found is that there's actually a continuum of impossibility goggles. When I was in middle school and my parents wanted me to get to baseball practice, I would, in full honesty, propose the most trivial obstacles as evidence for why that was not going to happen. It was raining, for instance. Our coach cancelled and the team wasn't going to be there. I don't think there was a single circumstance, really, where I could not have gone out to the baseball field and just hit balls off the tee by myself, or balls pitched by my Dad. I just didn't want to do it. The thing is, sometimes in the moment I really did think these things make it \"impossible\". If you had <i>prompted</i> me then and asked me if these things were <i>physically</i> impossible, I might have said no, but that didn't stop me from thinking in the moment they were entirely impractical.&nbsp;</p><p>The setting of these exceptionally bad assessments suggests a motivation - I had a third party, my parents, who needed to be convinced that they shouldn't try to send me out to the park to hit baseballs. A common theme of Robin Hanson's EitB is that we sometimes lie to ourselves to make it easier to lie to others, and I think that goes a long way in explaining why this occurs. When someone asks you to do something you don't want to do, and you say \"I might if my daughter's life depended on it, but I won't do it as it is now\", that's a much more frustrating objection than \"I can't do it because of x, y, and z obstacles.\" Socially, it's more agreeable to say \"I can't get this done for you because of these bureaucratic checks\" than \"I could break some laws/call a dozen different offices until it happened, but that's a lot of effort for a random favor.\" Before we choose to solve problems, we scan the solution space to see if solving it is plausible. A lack of motivation makes us scan in a narrower space and compels us to give up quicker than we otherwise might, so that we can honestly claim to others that we can't see how it can be done. Obviously sometimes we do in full consciousness lie to other people about these things, but sometimes we do not, and just give up.</p><p>Even when there's not a third party that has to be convinced, or has a personal interest in you completing the task you think is impossible, not completing it may reflect badly on you. Which sounds better: my startup could have succeeded but I didn't have Elon Musk-tier drive, or my startup <i>would</i> have succeeded except for those meddling bureaucrats! If you take a public undertaking, and lose, explaining that it was impossible to accomplish saves some face. It keeps your image as a respectable, formidable person, who just happened to attempt something that no other person could do if they were in your shoes, or faced the resource constraints you had. Explaining to people that maximum effort may have done the job is like explaining to people that you're not <i>sure</i> that they're wrong during an argument, you're just almost positive. The contents of your words are true, but what you signal to the other person is different. Non-rationalists will take your \"almost positive\" as a sign of confusion or internal doubt, rather than pedantry, just as they will take your \"almost maximum effort\" as a sign that you couldn't <i>really</i> muster the effort. And this goes for things you have attempted, as well as things you haven't attempted. People judge you on your ability to accomplish things you haven't actually tried, too. If you convincingly mark a large part of the possibility space off as \"impossible\", then you can explain your inability to move forward as a product of the problem, rather than a shortage of internal willpower.</p><p>In the worst cases, this can be an unconscious effort to convince other people not to try. Publicly failing to solve a technical problem at your engineering company is only worse than failing and then having someone else, or another team, come in and clean house. I wonder if the oft-cited quote about grey-haired scientists declaring something possible or impossible has something to do with this. If you are an eminent scientists who has attempted a problem or worked within a closely related field for your entire life, perhaps there are some emotional reasons to suggest at the end of your career that a target is unassailable. If you, the prestigious Nobelist, couldn't do it, who is any future researcher or engineer to say they can?</p></body></html>",

I have a number of friends with relatives who escaped or survived (or didn&apos;t) the Nazi Holocaust.   In both of these cases, there were many months where someone could get out pretty easily (but at significant cost), but it wasn&apos;t clearly necessary.  And then many weeks where the rich could get out (at a very high cost), and then it was too late.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Philosophers often get a bad wrap, not entirely without justification. The common complaint is something like \"come on, do we really need to analyze this thing in so much detail? Can't we just get on with life since <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mmCDYzXfQpXq9xpru/adding-up-to-normality-1\">the world keeps working whether we understand it or not</a>?\"</p><p>Without digging too deep into all the reasons why some people like philosophy and others don't, I want to use this opening example to talk about two purposes that often cross: pragmatism and completeness.</p><p>When our purpose is pragmatism, we care about getting something else done. That is, pragmatism doesn't exist on its own, it's in the service of another purpose. If I'm hungry, perhaps all I care about is eating, not the details of digestion or food preparation. I can be pragmatic about eating and be content with my understanding that if I eat a sandwich my hunger goes away.</p><p>The purpose of completeness can stand on its own. It can manifest as a desire to know everything and be capable of doing anything. We need not be about something to engage in completeness; we can engage with completeness itself and let it lead us to the places where our understanding or abilities are not yet complete. It creates a kind of unbounded curiosity to know more that can only be satisfied by total understanding of everything.</p><p>In the imaginary space of understanding, pragmatism and completeness act like dimensions along which our desire for understanding can reside. We might seek highly pragmatic understanding that is so incomplete it's opaque, we might desire completeness even at the cost of being pragmatic enough for our knowledge to be useful, and more often we find some path between them that balances our need to use knowledge with our desire to build it.</p><p>To return to philosophy, pragmatism and completeness show up as cross purposes both within philosophy and in the meta question about how useful philosophy is.</p><p>For any philosophical question, there is a <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/\">pragmatic stance</a> that says for some purpose we need understand no more. This is the kind of stance taken, for example, by Eliezer in \"<a href=\"http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth/\">The Simple Truth</a>\" with regards to epistemology. In contrast, I've <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5LP6Jc8ztwcyb296X/outline-of-metarationality-or-much-less-than-you-wanted-to\">previously talked about</a> what happens if you keep digging: you run up against the Problem of the Criterion and discover an epistemological gap that demands a leap of faith to cross (perhaps in a pragmatic way!). And so we see a tradeoff, albeit one with some hard limits, between pragmatic and complete understanding.</p><p>And on the question of the usefulness of philosophy, we find the same tradeoff. For some, what they care about is doing things, so philosophy may not seem so interesting because it's not helping them answer the questions that will help them do what they want to do. For others, what they care about is constructing an ontology that covers the world, and so they are not content to leave any corner unexamined. Neither is necessarily better or worse, just serving different purposes, and so better or worse depending on what we each care about.</p><p>Which brings me around to why I've bothered to examine the way pragmatism and completeness interact. In many discussions I think people end up at loggerheads because they want to make different tradeoffs between pragmatism and completeness, and if it feels like we're already at the Pareto frontier of pragmatism and completeness in a discussion, <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/05/expand-vs-fight-social-justice-fertility-bioconservatism-and-ai-risk.html\">then that tradeoff becomes a fight</a>. This is a problem that seems unlikely to yield to typical consensus techniques because it's a level up beyond and behind the object level discussion and may be invisible to the interlocutors. But, now that I've written a post pointing it out, maybe it need not be, and we can notice when our disagreements come, at least in this case, from trying to serve different purposes.</p></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Followup to &quot;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sEij9C9MnzEs8kaBc/the-presumptuous-philosopher-self-locating-information-and\">The Presumptuous Philosopher, self-locating information, and Solomonoff induction</a>&quot;</p><p>In the comments last time, everyone seemed pretty content to ditch the Presumptuous Philosopher (who said that the universe with a trillion times the copies of you was a trillion times as likely), and go with Solomonoff induction (which says that the universe with a trillion times the copies of you is only a few times as likely). To rally some support for the Presumptuous Philosopher, here&apos;s a decision game for you.</p><p><strong>The Game:</strong></p><p>If you start out with a universe that has only one of you, and then Omega comes along and copies you, you now need an extra bit to say which <em>you</em> you are. If Omega has flipped a coin (or consulted a high-entropy bit string) to decide whether to copy you, you now think there is a 50% chance you&apos;re un-copied, and a 25% chance you&apos;re each of the copies (if you&apos;re not a Solomonoff inductor, pretend to be one for now).</p><p>So far, this seems, although not obvious, at least familiar. It&apos;s the &quot;halfer&quot; position in Sleeping Beauty, which you might also call Bostrom&apos;s &quot;SSA&quot; position. It&apos;s not widely accepted because of frequentist / pragmatic arguments like &quot;if you did this experiment a bunch of times, each person would converge to a frequency of 2/3 copied and 1/3 non-copied&quot; and abstract arguments about symmetry of information. But of course Solomonoff induction would reply that there&apos;s no symmetry between the different hypotheses about the universe, and so it&apos;s okay to make an asymmetrical assumption under which the more you&apos;re copied, the less your universe matters to the average.</p><p>But suppose now that Omega, in addition to maybe copying you at t_0, comes along and shoots the copy (or a deterministic one of the two yous) at t_1. After this happens, you now no longer need that extra bit to describe which you is you, and so the probabilities go back to being the same for the two hypotheses about the universe and Omega&apos;s coin.</p><p>So here&apos;s what Omega does. He has all of you play for chocolate bars, or some other short-term satisfying experience. After t_0, you get offered this deal: If you accept, then the no-copy you will get <strong>2</strong> chocolate bars and both copy-yous will lose <strong>1.9</strong> chocolate bars. Since you&apos;re so much more likely to be in the no-copy universe, you accept.</p><p>Next, still before t_1, Omega gives a bonus for the two copies transferring chocolate. You all get offered a deal where the copy that will happen to survive loses <strong>0.5</strong> chocolate bars, and the copy that will get shot gains <strong>1</strong> chocolate bar. Since you&apos;re not sure which you are but think they&apos;re equally likely, and this doubles the chocolate, you accept.</p><p>Then, after t_1, Omega deterministically shoots one copy but still doesn&apos;t tell the survivor that they&apos;re in the copy-universe. The two of you are offered a deal to lose <strong>2</strong> chocolate bars if you&apos;re in the no-copy universe, but gain <strong>2.1</strong> if you&apos;re in the copy universe. Since this is more chocolate among equally likely possibilities, you accept a third time.</p><p>You are now neutral on chocolate in the no-copy universe, the you that died in the copy universe paid 0.9 chocolate bars, and the you that survived in the copy universe paid 0.3 chocolate bars. You have now been Dutch-process booked.</p><p>If we treat the hypotheses of Solomonoff induction as if they are descriptions of physical universes (specifically, things with a property of continuity), then Solomonoff induction seems to be doing something <em>wrong</em>. And if we don&apos;t treat Turing machines as specifications of physical universes, then this removes much of the bite to applying Solomonoff induction in the Presumptuous Philosopher problem.</p>",

My thoughts got much larger because I wasn’t subconsciously afraid I’d interrupt them. I began to feel angry at my laptop. Why did it insist on hurting me so much? Why couldn’t it be pure like the offline phone/keyboard experience? Why couldn’t I just create things?</span></p>\n<p><span>[* I only found two bluetooth keyboards with an inlay for phones/tablets.

At first I thought this was reflective of some deep pathology, but after two weeks it looks a lot more like “sometimes the benefits of quiet outweighs the benefits of being able to look stuff up, sometimes they don’t’”.  I’ve also changed how I interact on a connected device- I’m more likely to close Signal, less likely to open Twitter. This is less due to a utilitarian calculation of the costs and benefits of Twitter, and more that once I’m in a good state, I can notice how switching to Twitter is almost physically painful.</span></p>\n<p><span>The problem is that I wasn’t wrong that social media was genuinely very valuable to me, and that was before we were all locked inside. But I definitely was wrong that getting those benefits were costless, in a way very analogous to mistakes I accused others of making. I’m glad I have the information now, but I haven’t figured out what to do with it yet.</span></p>",

In many places things are getting worse rather than better.</p>\n<p>Despite this, our focus has turned elsewhere.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>It seems like left-wing people now expect a second wave and blame it on the actions of right-wing people.

That does not make them wrong. I continue to mostly agree with the perspective that for all practical purposes we have done all that we can to prevent Covid-19 here in the United States. It seemed mostly right before the protests, and it seems clearly correct now. If our current behaviors cause a second wave, trying to stop it would be a cure worse than the disease. We lack both the will and the ability.</p>\n<p>It has now been seventeen days since the murder of George Floyd. It does not seem like good measurements are being taken, but from what I can tell there has since then been a steady rise in the number of protesters, with peaks on the weekends, including in countries outside the United States. Meanwhile, official re-openings continue in many places, and increasing numbers disregard precautions regardless of official recommendations, as they see others disregarding them, and as they grow stir crazy.</p>\n<p>The question is, are we going to ‘get away with’ our current and implied future package of behaviors?

Less people died. We did more tests but found less positives. It’s not as rapid as one might like, either in improvements in testing or positive rates, but it is improvement.</p>\n<p>Looking at regions, we see good progress in the Northeast and Midwest. Things seem well under control.</p>\n<p>We have reason to be very worried about the West and South. Arizona is seeing the most rapid increase in the West, so this is potentially very much a north versus south phenomenon.</p>\n<p>What can we conclude from what we see?</p>\n<h3>We Got Away With Memorial Day</h3>\n<p>There was a big story at the time about how people were disregarding social distancing on Memorial Day weekend. It has now been long enough to conclude that this did not have a big impact. This is a data point in favor of outdoor activity not being very dangerous.</p>\n<p>Note that this doesn’t mean we’ve gotten away with things in general.</p>\n<h3>Protests Haven’t Shown A First-Order Impact Thus Far</h3>\n<p>Predictions of a fast spike in cases, either in general or in the places with the biggest protests, have not come to pass. There’s no sign of trouble in Minneapolis, or New York City, or Washington, D.C, or in Berkeley, California where a friend predicted a local spike in cases.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean that protests are not spreading the virus. They obviously must be spreading the virus more than if those people had stayed home slash gone about their normal activities. I believe in the physical world far too much to believe otherwise.</p>\n<p>Despite that, it has now been over two weeks since things started. Testing should only be delayed from infection on the order of one week. What can we rule out or in? What are the possibilities?</p>\n<p>The effect could be small, and/or the effect’s larger impacts could be delayed, and/or measurement of the effect could be delayed or distorted.</p>\n<p>The effect could be small if being outside is a big enough deal, combined with enough mask wearing and mask wearing being a big deal. I’m guessing this is a lot of it.</p>\n<p>The effect could also be small if sufficiently few of the protesters have been infected. One can imagine a world in which people who are low-level feeling lousy, or who suspect they have been exposed in some way, largely avoid protests. I’m guessing this isn’t important, but it’s possible.</p>\n<p>The effect could also be small if enough of the protesters are immune. In some areas of New York City, there are minority areas where 50% or more of people are testing positive for antibodies. Is it possible that the protesters already have a lot of herd immunity? I’m guessing this is a non-trivial effect, but not the main effect.</p>\n<p>The effect’s larger impact could be delayed if it only comes when protesters infected at protests in turn infect other protesters, or even one cycle beyond that. If that was true, we wouldn’t be seeing anything like the full effects at this time. That can’t explain there not being a noticeable effect at all, but this dynamic should be a big deal. When the flare-ups from protests happen it may mostly be after several cycles of previous spread.</p>\n<p>The effect’s measurement could be delayed or distorted if the people involved are generally healthy, generally suspicious of health care and government and its potential hazards and costs, or both. This seems like it fits the situation quite well. The only question is magnitude.</p>\n<p>That leaves a lot of potential explanations. We can’t rule out the protests having a sizable impact. What we can rule out is them causing a huge explosion on the spot, the same way most other photo opportunity social distance violations haven’t caused an explosion. That’s because the explosion expectation doesn’t take into account the scope of the actual violation, instead thinking of this as <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/31/covid-19-my-current-model/\">a failure to sacrifice to the gods</a>. We have been wicked so of course the virus will strike us down as punishment.</p>\n<p>Except, of course, that it won’t. That’s not how this works. That’s not how any of this works.</p>\n<p>Protests should still have a large <em>secondary </em>impact. Again, it was plausible that this would happen right away and be huge. People would see giant crowds, see them welcomed by the media, and say screw it. That too didn’t happen enough to see a giant spike, so we can again rule out the worst parts of the distribution. And again, I still think we’ll see a big impact here, especially in our ability to react to bad news, which seems like it’s at zero. It just won’t be as big as we might have feared a week or two ago.</p>\n<h3>Different States, Different Stories, Different Futures</h3>\n<p>The scare story of ‘cases increasing in some states’ are entirely unsurprising. Unless we are doing exceptionally well, there are always going to be some places doing relatively poorly. Right now it’s two entire regions, though, even after adjusting for test counts. So the story does seem to be fair.</p>\n<p>There will be lots of attempts to blame this, that or the other thing for increased cases, especially relaxations of restrictions that appear to be failures to make the proper sacrifices to the Gods. Red states are especially vulnerable to this type of story among blue state narratives.</p>\n<p>An alternative explanation is the reverse weather effect. The states where we’re seeing problems are, to put it bluntly, <em>too damn hot. </em>Instead of June being a reason to go outdoors, June becomes a reason to stay inside with the air conditioner on. That would be entirely compatible with outdoor activities being mostly safe, and seems like the story that best fits recent facts.</p>\n<p>Where do we go from here? How long before we know?</p>\n<p>If we see continued increases in the West and South for another week, I’ll be very surprised if it then reverses itself any time soon.</p>\n<p>If we see continued declines in the Northeast and Midwest another week, I’ll conclude that outdoor activities are even safer than I thought, and that protests don’t seem to be having that big a direct impact nor that big a secondary impact. We’ll probably be safe until at least September, in the sense that conditions will continue to improve regardless of official relaxations of restrictions. People aren’t going to do enough especially risky additional things.</p>\n<p>Even if there is a feedback-loop spike from the protests, if it doesn’t show up relatively soon, there’s no reason to expect it to escape out into the broader community, so any such spike shouldn’t be able to sustain itself.</p>\n<p>Here in New York, it feels like it’s time to make our way out into the world. Time to start seeing friends again, time to dine at restaurants, go places, do things. Responsibly, but at all. We’re down 98.3% from peak infections in this state. What risk is left is largely concentrated in areas I wouldn’t have any reason to go anyway. We know a lot more about risk factors. Our health care system is in good shape again and will stay that way. At some point one has to start adjusting one’s behavior to the new facts. I’ve been waiting for the protests to see if things are still all right. By early next week New York positive rates should be under 1%, and I hope to enter that next phase.</p>\n<p> </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><i>Meta note: this post involves redefining several concepts in ways almost, but not quite, the same as their usual definitions - risking quite a bit of confusion. I'm open to suggestions for better names for things.</i></p><p>Intuition: a model of humans (or AIs, or other agenty things) as “agents” separate from their “environment” only makes sense at a zoomed-out, abstract level. When we look at the close-up details, the agent-environment distinction doesn’t exist; there is no “Cartesian boundary” with interactions between the two sides mediated by well-defined input/output channels.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the lab, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/johnswentworth\"><u>some guy</u></a> has been talking about a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy/p/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks\"><u>general formalization of abstraction</u></a>. Elevator pitch version: far-apart components of a low-level model are independent given some high-level summary data. For example, the dynamics of the plasmas in far-apart stars are approximately independent given some high-level summary of each star - specifically its total mass, momentum and center-of-mass position. The low-level model includes full plasma dynamics; the high-level abstract model just includes one point mass representing each star.</p><p>This notion of abstraction sounds like it should fit our intuition about agency: we model humans/AIs/etc as agents in some high-level model, but not necessarily in the underlying low-level model.</p><p>This post will flesh out that idea a bit. It will illustrate the general picture of an abstraction boundary serving as a Cartesian boundary for a high-level agent model.</p><h1>Programs</h1><p>To avoid prematurely dragging in confusing intuitions about agency, we’ll start by talking about a program running on a laptop.</p><p>The source code of a program specifies exactly what it should do at a high level; it specifies the abstract model. It does not specify the low-level behavior, e.g. machine code and register addresses, or precise voltages in each transistor at each time, or the physical layout of circuit components on the CPU. The job of compiler/operating system writers and electrical engineers is to design and implement a low-level system which correctly abstracts into the high-level model specified by the source code. We’ll call the whole system for implementing programs out of atoms a “compiler stack”; it includes not just compilers, but also the physical hardware on which a program runs. It’s an end-to-end tool for turning source code into physical behavior.</p><p>What does it mean, mathematically, to design such a compiler stack? How do we formalize that problem?</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/dnzyml7pyu37klwotkep\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/sqyu52och2ruuqnzipaj 96w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/skcj4rn8ghxef8pjthwl 176w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/jlfptdbnag5kaofpssol 256w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/ny1k3rdlxclgenzz6msk 336w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/tcrudhcbmgte61fki9p0 416w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/gosujxuibw76jzb1s6rr 496w\"><figcaption>Compiler stack design problem: make this abstraction work, with the high-level model matching the specification given by some source code.</figcaption></figure><p>Well, we have a model of the whole world, and we’d like to factor out two high-level components: the system (i.e. program running on a laptop) and everything “far away” from the system. In between will be lots of noisy variables which mediate interactions between these two components - air molecules, communication infrastructure, etc. Those noisy intermediates will wipe out most information about low-level details: things far away from the laptop won’t be able to detect precise voltages in individual transistors, and the laptop itself won’t be able to detect positions of individual molecules in far-away objects (though note that our notion of “far away” can be adjusted to account for e.g. fancy sensors; it need not be physical distance). With the noisy intermediates wiping out all that low-level detail, the laptop’s behavior will depend only on some high-level summary data about things far away, and the behavior of things far away will depend only on some high-level summary data about the laptop.</p><p>The high-level summaries typically go by special names:</p><ul><li>The high-level summary containing information about the laptop which is relevant to the rest of the world is called “output”.</li><li>The high-level summary containing information about the rest of the world which is relevant to the laptop is called “input”.</li></ul><p>The goal of the compiler stack is to make the output match the specification given by the source code, on any input, while minimizing side-channel interaction with the rest of the world (i.e. maintaining the abstraction boundary).</p><p>For instance, let’s say I write and run a simple python script:</p><pre><code>x = 12\nprint(5*x + 3)</code></pre><p>This script specifies a high-level behavior - specifically, the number “63” appearing on my screen. That’s the part visible from “far away” - i.e. visible to me, the user. The rest is generally invisible: I don’t observe voltages in specific transistors, or values in registers, or machine code, or …. Of course I <i>could</i> open up the box and observe those things, but then I’d be breaking the abstraction. In general, when some aspect of the executing program is externally-visible <i>besides</i> the source-code-specified high-level behavior, we say that the abstraction is leaking. The point of a compiler stack is to minimize that leakage: to produce a system which yields the specified high-level input-output behavior, with minimal side-channel interaction with the world otherwise.</p><h1>Cartesian Boundary</h1><p>Applying this to agents is trivial: just imagine the source code specifies an agenty AI.</p><p>More generally, to model a real-world system as an agent with a Cartesian boundary, we can break the world into:</p><ul><li>The system itself (the “agent”)</li><li>Things “far away” from the system (the “environment”)</li><li>Noisy variables intermediating interactions between the two, which we ignore (i.e. integrate out of the model)</li></ul><p>The noisy intermediates wipe out most of the low-level information about the two components, so only some high-level summary data about the agent is relevant to the environment, and only some high-level summary data about the environment is relevant to the agent. We call the agent’s high-level summary data “actions”, and we call the environment’s high-level summary data “observations”.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/iaoiviajkeke9gcs1hvz\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/i8gnhsc1ynafvzdzsmhk 95w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/zxx5ozunwlkfjhgfljv8 175w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/nvjpg3qs2q59mlxuu8co 255w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/txbshtnnvqno2euwjh2q 335w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/ifuu54kgopdmveqqhj34 415w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JasCkaPtZEJsYDX8H/hlsv6w9oqte46xkxpgv3 495w\"><figcaption>Because of the noisy intermediates, the agent's incoming data may not perfectly convey the environment's high-level summary.</figcaption></figure><h1>Implications</h1><p>This is not identical to the usual notion of agency used in decision theory/game theory. I’ll talk about a couple differences, but these ideas are still relatively fresh so there’s probably many more.</p><h2>Imperfect Knowledge of Inputs</h2><p>One potentially-surprising implication of this model: the “inputs” are not the raw data received by the agent; they’re perhaps more properly thought of as “outputs of the environment” than “inputs of the agent”. In the traditional Cartesian boundary model, these coincide - i.e. the traditional model is an <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy/p/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks\"><u>exact abstraction</u></a>, without any noisy intermediates between agent and environment. But in this model, the “channel” between environment-outputs and agent-incoming-data is noisy and potentially quite complicated in its own right.</p><p>The upshot is that, under this model, agents may not have perfect knowledge of their own inputs.</p><p>This idea isn’t entirely novel. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZM63n353vh2ag7z4p/radical-probabilism-transcript\">Abram has written before</a> about agents being uncertain about their own inputs, and cited some previous literature on the topic, under the name \"radical probabilism\".</p><p>Note that we could, in principle, still define “inputs” in the more traditional way, as the agent's incoming data. But then we don’t have as clean a factorization of the model; there is no natural high-level object corresponding to the agent’s incoming data. Alternatively, we could treat the noisy intermediates as themselves part of the environment, but this conflicts with the absence of hard boundaries around real-world agenty systems.</p><h2>Flexible Boundaries</h2><p>I’ve <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction?commentId=9nkXaLLQrGkyQ8jNc\"><u>said</u></a> before:</p><blockquote><p>I expect the \"boundary\" of an agent to be fuzzy on the \"inputs\" side, and less fuzzy but still flexible on the \"outputs\" side. On the inputs side, there's a whole chain of cause-and-effect which feeds data into my brain, and there's some freedom in whether to consider \"me\" to begin at e.g. the eye, or the photoreceptor, or the optic nerve, or... On the outputs side, there's a clearer criterion for what's \"me\": it's whatever things I'm \"choosing\" when I optimize, i.e. anything I assume I control for planning purposes.&nbsp; That's a sharper criterion, but it still leaves a lot of flexibility - e.g. I can consider my car a part of \"me\" while I'm driving it.</p></blockquote><p>The Cartesian-boundary-as-abstraction-boundary model fits these ideas quite neatly.</p><p>(Potential point of confusion: that quote uses “input/output” in the usual Cartesian boundary sense of the words, not in the manner used in this post. I’ll use the phrase “incoming data” to distinguish what-data-reaches-the-agent from the environment-summary-data.)</p><p>We model the agent as using the agent-environment abstraction to model itself. It has preferences over the environment-summary (the “inputs”), and optimizes the agent-summary (the “outputs”). But exactly what chunk-of-the-world is called “the agent” is flexible - if I draw the boundary right outside of my eye/my photoreceptors/my optic nerve, all three of those carry mostly-similar information about far-away things, and all three will likely imply very similar high-level summaries of the environment. So the overall model is relatively insensitive to where the boundary is drawn on the incoming-data side.</p><p>But the output side is different. That’s not because the model is more sensitive to the boundary on the output side, but because the output itself is an object in the high-level model, while incoming data is not; the high-level model contains the environment-summary and the outputs, but not the agent’s incoming data.</p><p>In other words: the high-level agent-environment model is relatively insensitive to certain changes in where the boundary is drawn. As a result, objects which live in the low-level model (e.g. the agent’s incoming data) lack a sharp natural definition, whereas objects which live in the high-level model (e.g. the “inputs”=environment summary and “outputs”=agent summary) are more sharply defined.</p><p>This goes back to the basic problem of defining “inputs”: there is no high-level object corresponding to the agent’s incoming data. That incoming data lives only in the low-level model. The high-level model just contains the environment-summary.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Conflict theorists</strong> default to blaming a bad guy. Entrenched power is exploiting others for selfish gain. Explaining away the problems in the world as the result of mistakes only gives the oppressor/barbarian/authoritarian cover. This description is brief and reductive only because I&apos;m trying to focus on mistake theory. It&apos;s not intended as a straw man, just a brief summary.</p><p>Opposed to them are mistake theorists. There are two kinds.</p><p><strong>Object-level mistake theorists</strong> reject the idea that evil will, &quot;isms,&quot; or conspiracies are to blame for object-level disagreement between groups. Chalk it up to coordination, communication, or motivation challenges; the scarcity of some key resource; or the fact that some problems are just really hard. But it&apos;s almost certainly not due to evil intentions.</p><p>I call them &quot;object-level&quot; mistake theorists because they use their theory to interpret the sorts of controversies you&apos;d read about in the news. They don&apos;t use it to interpret the meta-controversy between conflict or mistake theorists. Object-level mistake theorists see conflict theorists as sophisticated intellectuals who are acting on a theory they happen to disagree with.</p><p>Here is how an object-level mistake theorist might model various kinds of conflict theorist take on some contemporary American political issues:</p><ul><li>ANTIFA is angry about institutional racism, and think the best way to fix that problem is by burning cop cars. They think power gives up nothing without a demand. Or else, police unions are angry that ANTIFA deliberately downplay the gritty realities of the world to have a bad guy for their political narrative.</li><li>The battle between the Discovery Institute and evolutionists isn&apos;t about science. It&apos;s a political battle for or against a step toward American Christian theocracy. Both sides know that taking each others&apos; arguments seriously would be a fatal mis-step.</li><li>Socialists are trying to use an expanded safety net as a prelude to full-on class warfare and ever-escalating demands for more entitlements. Or, conservatives are opposed to simplifying the IRS because they want to make interacting with the government as hateful as possible, so that people won&apos;t trust it to do anything else right.</li></ul><p>The object-level mistake theorist thinks all these arguments are wrong, but sincerely held. They assume that conflict theorists are familiar with mistake theory and have rejected it, just as they have rejected conflict theory.</p><p><strong>Evangelistic mistake theorists</strong>, on the other hand, explain not only object-level controversies, but the meta-controversy between conflict and mistake theory, in terms of mistake theory. To them, conflict theorists are simply mistake theorists who happen to have a poor understanding of mistake theory. Here&apos;s how an evangelistic mistake theorist might model the takes of conflict theorists on the same issues:</p><ul><li>Deep down, ANTIFA knows the cops are necessary, and they really just want moderate reform. But they&apos;re so caught up in their lefty tribe that they&apos;ve forgotten that the police are good, reasonable people. So they burn police cars, say the cops are all in the KKK, and call to abolish jails, making the factionalism even worse.</li><li>Deep down, police unions know that ANTIFA are well-intentioned, and they really just want to see peaceful protests and get some support in doing their difficult and dangerous job. But they get so much criticism and bad publicity that they&apos;re on the defensive all the time, and don&apos;t know how to explain the challenges they face in a way that ANTIFA would understand. So they defend cops at all costs and shy away from open dialog, entrenching themselves further.</li><li>Deep down, the Discovery Institute wants to seek the truth, just like mainstream evolutionary theorists. Both sides want to resolve their disagreements through reasoned debate. But there are so many complex points to the argument, and the experiments are so difficult to conduct, that they resort to the courts and battling over curriculums.</li><li>Deep down, &quot;socialists&quot; just want an expanded social safety net and to fix regulations around some negative externalities. They want social democracy, not a centrally planned economy. But they&apos;re so uneducated about the terms they&apos;re using, because they build their worldview around social media shares, that they don&apos;t realize how threatening their labels sound to mainstream liberals and moderate conservatives. Alternatively, deep down, wealthy &quot;conservatives&quot; are just frustrated that socialist rhetoric makes them feel bad about earning money. If &quot;socialists&quot; could just tone it down a bit and advocate for the social democracy they actually want, we could find a middle ground.</li></ul><p>If evangelistic mistake theorists are correct, then all that&apos;s needed is to educate ANTIFA, police guilds, the Discovery Institute, and socialists about how to interpret their conflicts through the lens of mistake theory. The people who are the most partisan are likely to have given the least thought to their views. They want to spread the light of mistake theory to the confused and flailing factions.</p><p>The object-level mistake theorists might be annoyed or curious about the viewpoints of conflict theorists. Either way, they acknowledge that the disagreement is between two equal minds, even if they find it annoying to have to listen to the other side jabber on about white supremacists or the Hollywood liberal elite.</p><p>Evangelistic mistake theorists sometimes portray themselves as the bearers of good news. In fact, they say, once those conflict theorists really understand our ideas, they&apos;ll come around to our side, and we can have peace, love, and factual logical debate to resolve all our issues.</p><p>That vision is not as hopeful-sounding to me as it seems to be for them. It suggests that a huge number of people are just dumb. There&apos;s nothing to do but educate them, fill them up with mistake theory to replace the void inside. They have nothing to teach us except to reveal how better to convert the next one. Fortunately, once they grasp mistake theory, they&apos;ll be so happy that we showed it to them!</p><p>By contrast, object-level mistake theory suggests that conflict theorists are also smart people, and they might have something important to teach us. They are a worthy debate opponent. If we pick berries in their wood, many of them will make us sick to our stomach, but some will cure the vitamin deficiency we suffer from only eating the fruits of our own forest.</p>",

I&apos;m posting it here, because I&apos;m interested in folks&apos; thoughts. </p><p><em>[Epistemic status: speculative essay, perhaps too speculative to be appropriate for LessWrong]</em></p><h3>Power</h3><p>Lately I&#x2019;ve been reading (well, listening to) <em><a href=\"http://the dictator&apos;s handbook\">the Dictator&#x2019;s Handbook</a></em> by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith, which is something like a realpolitik analysis of how power works, in  general. To summarize in a very compressed way: systems of power are  made up of fractal hierarchies of cronies who support a leader (by  providing him the means of power: the services of an army, the services  of a tax-collector, votes that keep him in office) in return for special  favors. Under this model, institutions are pyramids of &#x201C;if you scratch  my back, I&#x2019;ll scratch yours&#x201D; relationships.</p><p>This overall dynamic (and its consequences) is explained excellently in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs\">this</a> 18 minute CGP Grey video. Highly recommended, if you haven&#x2019;t watched it yet.</p><h3>Coups</h3><p>One consequence of these dynamics is how coups work. In a  dictatorship, if an upstart can secure the support of the army, and  seize the means of revenue generation (and perhaps the support of some  small number of additional essential backers) he gets to rule.</p><p>This often happens in actual dictatorships. The authors describe the case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Doe\">Samuel Doe</a>, a Sargent in the Liberian military, who one night, with a small number  of conspirators, assassinated the current dictator of Liberia in his bed, seized control of the treasury, and declared himself the new president  of Liberia. Basically, because he now controlled the money, and so would be the one to pay them, the army switched allegiances and legitimized his  authority. [Note: I think there are lot of important details to this  story that I don&#x2019;t understand and might make my summary here, misleading  or inaccurate.]</p><p>Apparently, this sort of coup is common in dictatorships.</p><h3>Democracy</h3><p>But I&#x2019;m struck by how impossible it would be for someone to seize the  government like that in the United States (at least in 2019). If a sitting president was voted out of office, but declared that he was not going to step down, it is virtually inconceivable that he could get the army and the bureaucracy to rally around him and seize / retain  power, in flagrant disregard for the constitutional protocols for the hand-off of power.</p><p>De Mesquita and Smith, as well as CGP Grey, discuss some of the structural reasons  for this: in technological advanced liberal democracies, wealth is  produced primarily by educated knowledge workers. Therefore, one can&#x2019;t neglect the needs of the population at large like you can in a  dictatorship, or you will cut off the flow of revenue that funds your state-apparatus.</p><p>But that structural consideration doesn&#x2019;t seem to be most of the story to me. It seems like the main factor is <em>ideology</em>.</p><h3>Ideology</h3><p>I can barely imagine a cabal of the <em>majority</em> of high ranking  military officials agreeing to back a candidate that lost an election, even if that a cabal assessed that backing that candidate would be more profitable for them. My impression of military people in general is that they are extremely proud Americans, for&#xA0;whom the ideals of freedom and democracy are nigh-spiritual in their import. They believe in Democracy, and rule of law, in something like the way that someone might  believe in a religion.</p><p>And this is a major stabilizing force of the &#x201C;Liberal Democracy&#x201D; attractor. Not only does this commitment to the ideals of America act in the  mind of any given high ranking military officer, making the idea of a  coup distasteful to them, there&#x2019;s an even more important pseudo-common  knowledge effect. Even if a few generals are realpolitik, sociopathic, personal expected utility maximizers, the expectation that other  military leaders <em>do</em> have the reverence for democracy, and will  therefore oppose coups against the constitution, makes organizing a coup  harder and riskier. If you even talk about the possibility of seizing  the state, instead of deferring to the result of an election, you are  likely to be opposed, if not arrested.</p><p>And even if <em>all</em> of the top military leaders somehow managed  to coordinate to support a coup, in defiance of an election result, they  would run into the same problem one step down on the chain of command.  Their immediate subordinates are also committed patriots, and would oppose their superior&#x2019;s outright power grab.</p><p>The ideology, the belief in democracy, keeps democracy stable.</p><h3>Realpolitik analysis is an info hazard?</h3><p>Indeed, we might <em>postulate</em> that if all of the parties  involved understood, and took for granted, the realpolitik analysis that who has power is a matter of calculated self interest and flow of  resources (in the style of the Athenian&#x2019;s reply to the Milians), as opposed to higher ideals like justice or freedom, this would erode the  stabilizing force of democracy, which I think is generally preferable to dictatorship.</p><p>(Or maybe not: maybe even if everyone bought into the realpolitik  analysis, they would still think that democratic institutions were in their personal best interest, and would oppose disruption no less fervently?)</p><p>I happen to think that the realpolitik analysis is basically correct, but  propagating that knowledge may represent a negative externality. (Luckily (?), this kind of ideology has an immune system: people are  reluctant to view the world in terms of naked power relations. Believing  in Democracy has warm fuzzies about it.)</p><p>There&#x2019;s also the possibility of an uncanny valley effect: If everyone  took for granted the realpolitik analysis the world would be worse of  than we are now, but if everyone took that analysis for granted <em>and also</em> took something like TDT for granted, then we would be better off?</p><h3>When implementation diverges from ideal</h3><p>The ideology of democracy or patriotism does represent a  counter-force against naked, self interested power grabs. But it is a less robust defense against other ideologies. The governmental system can be subverted if a large contingent becomes committed to Communism, or Christianity, or something else, and that commitment is higher than the commitment to the abstract ideals of democracies. </p><p>Even more threatening is when the <em>application</em> of an ideology is in doubt. Suppose that an election is widely believed to have been  fraudulent, or the &#x201C;official&#x201D; winner of an election is not the candidate who &#x201C;should have won&#x201D;. (For instance, a situation in which a  candidate wins the popular vote, by a huge margin, but still loose the  electoral college.) In cases like these, high ranking members of the  military or bureaucracy might feel that the actual apparatus of  democracy is no longer embodying the spirit of the democracy, by representing the will of the people.</p><p>In a severe enough situation of this sort, they might feel that the patriotic thing to do is actually to revolt against the current corrupt system, in the service of the true ideal that the system has betrayed. But once this happens, the clear, legitimized, succession of power is  broken, and who should rule becomes contentious. I expect this to devolve into a chaos, and one where many would make a power grab by  claiming to be the true heir to the American Ideal.</p><p>In the worst case, we the US degrades into a &#x201C;Waring states&#x201D; period,  as many warlords vie for power via the use of force and rhetoric.</p><h3>Some interesting notes</h3><p>One thing that is interesting to me is the degree to which it only  matters if a few groups have this kind of ideology: the military, and  some parts of the bureaucracy.</p><p>Could we just have patriotism in those sectors, and abandon the  ideology of America elsewhere? Interestingly, that sort of looks like  what the world is like: the military and some parts of the government  (red tribe?) are strongly proud to serve America and defend freedom,  while my stereotype of someone who lives in Portland (blue tribe) might  wear a button that reads &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/861594972436055096/\">America was never great</a>&#x201D;  and talks a lot about how America is an empire that does huge amounts  of harm in the world, and democracy is a farce. (Although, this may not  indicate that they don&#x2019;t share the ideology of Democracy. They&#x2019;re  signaling sophistication by counter signaling, but if the if push came  to shove, the Portlander might fight hella hard for Democratic  institutions.)</p><p>In so far as we do live in a world where we have the ideology of  Democracy, right in exactly the places where it needs to be to protect  our republic, how did that happen? Is it just that people who have that  ideology self select into positions where they can defend it? Or it it  that people with power and standing based on a system are biased towards  thinking that that system is good?</p><h3>Conclusion: speculative generalization to other levels of abstraction</h3><p>I bet this analysis generalizes. That is, it isn&#x2019;t just that the  ideology of democracy stabilizes the democracy attractor. I suspect that  that is what narratives / ideologies / ego structures do, in general,  across levels of abstraction: they help stabilize equilibria.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure how this plays out in human minds. You have a story about who you are and what you&#x2019;re about and what you value, and a bunch of sub parts buy into that story (That sounds weird. How do my parts &#x201C;buy  into&#x201D; or believe (in) my narrative about myself?) and this creates a  Nash equilibrium where if one part were to act against the equilibrium, it would be punished, or cut off from some resource flow?</p><p>Is that what rationalization is? When a part &#x201C;buys into&#x201D; the  narrative?&#xA0; What does that even mean? Are human beings made of the same  kind of &#x201C;if you scratch my back, I&#x2019;ll scratch yours&#x201D; relationships (between parts / sub-agents) as institutions are made of (between people)? How would  that even work? They make trades across time in the style of some rationalists?</p><p>I bet there&#x2019;s a lot more to understand here.</p>",

Relatedly, this article is not about methods for estimating EV (see <a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/expected-value-theory/\">here</a> for links relevant to that topic). Instead, this article focuses on arguing that, in essence, one should consider both potential benefits and potential harms of an action (compared to the counterfactual), without ignoring downside risks, overweighting them, or feeling that avoiding them “limits one’s impact”.</p>\n<p>We’ll take a typical, “approximately consequentialist” ethical framework as a starting assumption. We think that the pure EV perspective is the one which fits most naturally with such a framework. But our arguments for it will not be explicitly focused on philosophical debates.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-4\" id=\"fnref-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-4\">[4]</a></sup> Instead, we’ll use a more narrative, conversational, and <em>emotion</em>- or <em>motivation</em>-focused approach.</p>\n<p>This is partly because we expect most readers to already accept an “approximately consequentialist” ethical framework, and so we don’t expect many readers to be <em>deliberately and explicitly</em> using the unconcerned, harm-avoidance, or compliance perspectives. In cases where readers are using those perspectives, we expect this to typically be implicit or unintentional.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-5\" id=\"fnref-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-5\">[5]</a></sup> Thus, we’re aiming less to “change people’s minds”, and more to explicitly highlight this menu of options, while making the pure EV perspective appetising to readers’ <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kahneman-excerpt-thinking-fast-and-slow/\">System 1s</a> (rather than just their System 2s).</p>\n<h1>1. The unconcerned perspective</h1>\n<p>Say you’ve got this great opportunity or idea for a project/career path/article/something else. To make things concrete, let’s say a journalist has reached out to you requesting to interview you about AI safety. This interview really could make the world better, by highlighting the importance of the problem, pointing to some potential solutions, and hopefully attracting more funding, attention, and talent to the area. And that’s <em>exciting</em> - you could have a real impact!</p>\n<p>But is there a chance you doing this interview could also have negative impacts (compared to the counterfactual, which might someone else being interviewed or no interview occurring)? For example, perhaps highlighting the importance of AI safety would also increase risks by making certain powerful actors more interested in AI (an <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/R7szBR5H487XutfKy/what-are-information-hazards\">“attention hazard”</a>)? Or perhaps what you say would be spun as, or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EdAHNdbkGR6ndAPJD/memetic-downside-risks-how-ideas-can-evolve-and-cause-harm\">evolve into</a>, a simplistic message that makes discussion of AI safety more generally look unfounded, overdramatic, or overly “sci-fi”? Could the interview’s impact even be negative <em>overall</em>? Have you really thought about the possible unintended consequences?</p>\n<p>Maybe you don’t have to. Maybe it’d be really <em>nice</em> not to - you’re excited, and doing the interview <em>seems</em> like a good idea, and one that’s more promising than the other actions you have on the table. So maybe you can just go ahead.</p>\n<p>In fact, maybe you <em>should</em> just go ahead - wouldn’t worrying about possible risks before <em>every</em> seemingly positive action, or avoiding <em>any</em> action that could be harmful, just <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis\">paralyse</a> would-be do-gooders, and actually leave the world worse off overall?</p>\n<p>We think there’s some validity to this perspective. But it seems to set up a false dichotomy, as if a person’s only options are to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go ahead with any actions that seem positive at first, and never think at all about downside risks; or</li>\n<li>Worry at length about every single action.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We could add a third option, consisting of the following heuristics (see <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do\">here</a> for more details):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For minor or routine actions (e.g., most conversations), don’t bother thinking at all about downside risks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Typically limit thinking about downside risks to a quite quick check, and without really “worrying”.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, when the journalist reaches out to you, you notice this isn’t a situation you’ve encountered before, so you spend a minute quickly considering what harms might come from this action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Think at more length about downside risks only in cases where it seems that would be worthwhile (e.g., before <em>major</em> actions, or when the quick check revealed there may be important downsides).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, when your minute of thought reveals some seemingly plausible downsides to the interview, you decide to think in more detail about the matter, and maybe consult with some people you trust.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When substantial downside risks <em>are</em> identified, consider either (a) abandoning the action or (b) taking a version of the action which has lower risks or which allows you to monitor the risks to inform whether to abandon the action later.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, you could suggest someone else for the journalist to interview, or you could <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jU4snbnAIq-q4Dl_mIF0JyTT_bQrvS1wdBhQC1H-Bv8/edit\">ask to do a written rather than spoken interview</a>, to give yourself a chance to phrase your answers carefully and also run them by people you trust.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That third option, or something like it, doesn’t have to involve emotional anguish or analysis paralysis. Good deeds can still be done, and you can still feel good about doing them.</p>\n<p>And ask yourself: <em>Why</em> might it feel nice to take the unconcerned perspective? Isn’t it so you’d get to keep feeling excitement about the positive impact this action might have? Well, if you follow something like that third option, you can <em>still</em> feel that excitement, in all the cases where the action <em>does</em> have a positive impact (in expectation).</p>\n<p>You only lose that excitement in the cases where the action would actually be net negative in expectation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-6\" id=\"fnref-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-6\">[6]</a></sup> But wasn’t your excitement all about the positive impact? Isn’t it therefore appropriate for that excitement to be lost if the impact <em>isn’t</em> positive? “<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7ZqGiPHTpiDMwqMN2/the-twelve-virtues-of-rationality\">That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.</a>”</p>\n<h1>2. The harm-avoidance perspective</h1>\n<p>Maybe you’re at the opposite extreme - maybe that third option doesn’t feel like <em>enough</em>. Maybe when you see us suggest you should sometimes not think at all about downside risks, and sometimes go ahead even if there <em>are</em> risks, you wonder: Isn’t that reckless? How could you bear making the world worse in some ways, or risking making it worse <em>overall</em> - how could you bear the chance of your own actions causing harm? Can the potential benefits really justify that?</p>\n<p>We again think there’s some validity to this perspective. And we certainly understand the pull towards it. Intuitively, it can feel like there’s a strong asymmetry between causing harm and causing benefits, and a similar asymmetry between <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/\"><em>doing</em> harm and “<em>merely allowing</em>” harm</a>. It can feel like we have a strong duty to avoid actions that harm things, or that risk doing so, even when those actions are necessary “for the greater good”, or to prevent <em>other</em> harms.</p>\n<p>From here, we could move into a debate over consequentialism vs non-consequentialism. But as we noted earlier, we’re taking an approximately consequentialist framework as a starting assumption, and primarily addressing people who we think share that framework, but who still <em>feel</em> a pull towards this harm-avoidance perspective. So we’ll instead try to hammer home just how paralysing and impractical it’d be to fully align your behaviours with this harm-avoidance perspective.</p>\n<p>We live in a complicated world, populated with at least billions of beings we care about, each with various, often volatile, often conflicting preferences, each networked and interacting in myriad, often obscured, often implicit ways. And if you want to make that world better, that means you want to <em>change</em> it. If you poke, tweak, add, or remove any gear in that massive machine, the impacts won’t just be local and simple - there’ll be reverberations in distant corners you hadn’t ever thought about.</p>\n<p>Those reverberations are certainly worth taking seriously. This is why it’s worth thinking about and trying to mitigate downside risks - including those far removed from the time, place, or intention of your action. This is also why we wrote <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/r3dKPwpkkMnJPbjZE\">a series of posts on downside risks</a>.</p>\n<p>But reverberations are <em>always</em> happening, with or without you. And <em>anything</em> you do will cause them. And so would whatever you interpret “not doing anything” to mean.</p>\n<p>So are you really going to <em>always</em> stand by - let the machine keep grinding down whoever or whatever it may be grinding down; let it chug along towards whatever cliffs it may be chugging along towards - just to avoid doing <em>any</em> harm? Just to avoid <em>any</em> risk of it being you who “causes” harm - even if avoiding that risk means more harm happens?</p>\n<p>Are you going to stand by even when your best guess is that an action <em>really is</em> positive in expectation?</p>\n<p>For example, if you can see <em>any</em> downside risks from doing the interview on AI safety with that journalist, the harm-avoidance perspective would suggest definitely turning the interview down. This is even if, after seeking out the views of people you trust and putting in a lot of careful thought, it really does seem the downside risks are outweighed by the potential benefits. And this is even though, if the EV is indeed positive, it’s predictable that various other harms will occur if you turn the interview down, such as harms from someone less qualified being interviewed or from AI safety continuing to be neglected.</p>\n<p>As you can probably tell, we advocate against this harm-avoidance perspective. We advocate for taking downside risks seriously - perhaps more seriously than most people currently do - but also for being willing to take action when the EV really is positive (as best you can tell).</p>\n<h1>3. The compliance perspective</h1>\n<p>Let’s say you’re convinced by the arguments above, so you’re ditching the harm-avoidance perspective, and you <em>can</em> go ahead with an action - that AI safety interview, for example - as long as its EV is positive. Excellent! You’re still pretty excited by the impact this interview could have.</p>\n<p>But downside risks <em>are</em> a real concern, so you can’t take the unconcerned perspective either. You do have to do your due diligence, right? You’d advise <em>others</em> to think about the risks of their actions - you think that’s a good norm in general - so you guess you have a responsibility to comply with it too? And you guess that if the interview <em>does</em> turn out to seem too risky, you’d have to turn it down - however annoying it’d be to thereby give up this chance to possibly cause some positive impacts too.</p>\n<p>We call this the “compliance” perspective. In some ways, this perspective actually seems pretty ok to us; depending on the details, it might not be “invalid” in any way, might not actually <em>clash</em> with a mostly consequentialist framework, and might not cause issues. But we think there are many people for whom this framework probably isn’t <em>ideal</em>, in terms of <em>motivation</em>.</p>\n<p>That’s because the perspective frames caution about downside risks as something like a <em>specific</em>, <em>external</em> obligation, secondary to one’s <em>real</em>, <em>main</em> goal of having a positive impact. It frames caution as the sort of thing “a good person should do”, but not as <em>itself</em> good and impactful in the way that “doing a positive action” would be. It could make caution seem, on some emotional level, like a burdensome duty, getting in the way of the <em>actually impactful</em> things you <em>really want to do</em>.</p>\n<p>And if caution <em>does</em> feel like just compliance, it might also feel frustrating and demotivating. So you might apply caution a little too rarely, or a little too lightly. You might convince yourself the risks are worthwhile a little too often. And bit by bit, we might see an accumulation of harms we could’ve prevented by taking a less frustrating, more intrinsically motivating perspective on downside risks.</p>\n<p>How can we avoid those issues? By taking the pure expected value perspective. The next section will describe what it looks like to take that perspective.</p>\n<h1>4. The pure expected value perspective</h1>\n<p>Let’s start again from the top. This journalist has reached out to you requesting an interview on AI safety, and you realise this might be a way to make the world better. Fantastic! But you haven’t really thought about the downsides yet: it’s possible that, in expectation, the interview would be net negative. It’s also possible that it would be a <em>bit</em> negative, and that you can make some changes to mitigate those downsides.</p>\n<p>No problem! Just assess the EV of you doing the interview (compared to the counterfactual), taking account of both its risks <em>and</em> its potential benefits, and adjusting for the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EMKf4Gyee7BsY2RP8/michaela-s-shortform?commentId=y3o9YFvj4iXiAqKWa\">unilateralist's curse</a> where necessary. This could involve anything from a quick check to a detailed, lengthy assessment involving input from others; consider how high the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vADtvr9iDeYsCDfxd/value-of-information-four-examples\">value of information</a> would be.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-7\" id=\"fnref-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-7\">[7]</a></sup> And this may or may not involve explicit, quantitative estimates. For example, you might simply spend 30 minutes considering the various effects the interview might have, qualitatively weighing up how probable and how good or bad they are, and arriving at an overall sense of whether the benefits outweigh the risks. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-8\" id=\"fnref-NqRiQn2SaDLpBGdiy-8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<p>If, after that, you’re fairly confident the interview’s impacts really are net positive in expectation - great, go ahead and do it!</p>\n<p>If it seems the expected impacts could be <em>made</em> net positive (or <em>more</em> positive) if you modify the action to reduce its risks or allow you to monitor them - great, go ahead and do that! As noted above, in the interview example, this could include things like asking to provide written rather than verbal answers, and running those answers by people you trust.</p>\n<p>If it seems the interview’s impacts are net-negative in expectation, and that that can’t be fixed by just modifying the action to mitigate or monitor those risks - well, maybe <em>that’s</em> not great, but it’s definitely great you found out! Think about all the harm you prevented by assessing the downside risks so you can now avoid going through with this action! Think about how much better your decision to <em>be cautious</em> has made the world! <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3XgYbghWruBMrPTAL/leave-a-line-of-retreat\">And remember that there’s still a vast array of other potential actions you could take - that wasn’t your only shot to make a difference.</a> (Plus, if the expected effects of the action you were considering look net negative on close inspection, yet this wasn’t obvious from the start, you might be able to do further good by writing up and sharing these insights with other people.)</p>\n<p>The “pure EV” perspective rejects the unconcerned perspective’s strange inclination to avoid looking too closely at the potential risks of a planned action in case that’d burst your bubble. It also rejects the harm-avoidance perspective’s emphasis on steering clear of <em>any</em> action with <em>any</em> downside risk, based on perceived asymmetries between causing harm and causing good, or between doing and allowing harm. Further, it rejects the compliance perspective’s sense that preventing downside risks from your actions is some additional, secondary principle you have a duty to comply with, rather than a core part of how you can positively impact the world.</p>\n<p>In place of those things, this perspective simply says to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Invest an appropriate level of effort into working out the EV of an action and into thinking of ways to improve that EV (such as through mitigating and/or monitoring any downside risks).</li>\n<li>Take the action (or the best version of it) if that EV is positive (after adjusting for the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EMKf4Gyee7BsY2RP8/michaela-s-shortform?commentId=y3o9YFvj4iXiAqKWa\">unilateralist's curse</a>, where necessary).</li>\n<li>Feel good about both steps of that process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, this is the perspective we use ourselves, and the one we recommend. We hope that it will help us and others strike the best balance between taking actions that are worth taking and avoiding actions that truly are too risky.</p>\n<h1>Closing remarks</h1>\n<p>We hope this post will be helpful in your efforts to improve the world. Additionally, if you do subscribe to a mostly consequentialist framework, and yet feel a pull you’d rather not feel towards the unconcerned, harm-avoidance, or compliance perspectives, we hope this post will help you better align your patterns of thought and feeling with those which you aim to cultivate.</p>\n<p>For discussion of types of downsides risks, situations in which they’re most likely to occur, how and when to assess them, or how to prevent or mitigate them, see <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/r3dKPwpkkMnJPbjZE\">other posts in this sequence</a>.</p>\n<p><em>My thanks to</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/justinshovelain\">Justin Shovelain</a></em> <em>for helping develop the ideas in this post, and to Justin,</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/david_kristoffersson\">David Kristoffersson</a>, Olga Babeeva, and Max Dalton for helpful feedback.

Cross-posted from <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2020/06/10/self-predicting-markets/\">Grand, Unified, Crazy</a>.]</em></p><p><a href=\"https://thedeepdive.ca/bankrupt-hertz-stock-continues-to-attract-frenzy-of-retail-investors/\">The story of Hertz</a> has fundamentally changed how I view the stock market. This isn&#x2019;t a novel revelation &#x2013; now that I understand it, I&#x2019;ve seen the core insight mentioned elsewhere &#x2013; but it took a concrete example to really drive the point home.</p><p>The short version of the Hertz story is that the company went bankrupt. They have nearly $20 billion in debt, and as far as anybody can tell, no path to recovery; they&#x2019;re bankrupt because their business model has been losing money for years despite several attempts to turn things around. The twist? Their stock is still trading, and at time of writing they have a market cap of $900 million.</p><p>I notice I am confused.</p><p>On any intuitive understanding of the market this shouldn&#x2019;t be possible. The company is literally worthless. Or really, worse &#x2013; it&#x2019;s less than worthless given its debt load. People are paying positive money to own negative money. On a naive view this is another nail in the coffin of the Efficient Market Hypothesis.</p><p>After noticing that I was confused, I tried to generate hypotheses to explain this story:</p><ul><li>Maybe the EMH really is wrong and the markets are nonsense.</li><li>Maybe bankruptcy laws are so complex and tangled that the expected value of the company really is positive after all is said and done.</li><li>Maybe the markets expect Hertz to get a government bailout for some reason.</li></ul><p>Some of these are plausible (in particular the second), but none of them were particularly satisfying, so I tried asking myself why I, in a hypothetical world, would buy Hertz stock in this situation. I gave myself the standard answer: because I expected the stock go up in value in the future. Then I realized that <em>this answer has nothing to do with the value of the company.</em></p><p>I had been making the mistake of viewing the stock market as a predictor of company value over the short-to-medium term, but <em>this isn&#x2019;t true</em>. The stock market is a predictor of <em>itself</em> over the short-to-medium term. If people think the stock will go up tomorrow, then the stock will go up today &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t matter what the value of the company does at all. The company can be literally worthless, and as the Hertz story proves, people will still buy as long as they think the stock will go up tomorrow.</p><p>Now in practice, there are a bunch of traders in the market who trade based on the expected value of the company. As long as these people have a majority or at least a plurality, then everybody else is destined to follow their lead. If the expected value of the company goes up, then the expected value of the stock goes up, as long as enough people are trading based on company value. But in cases like Hertz, the expected value of the company is nothing, so value-based traders exit the market entirely. This leaves only the &quot;shallow&quot; stock-based traders, whose rational move is now to trade based on the expected value of the stock being completely divorced from reality.</p><p>The market is <em>really</em> weird.</p>",

This is distinctly different from the notion of being &quot;provably beneficial&quot;: a key challenge for provable beneficence is defining what we even mean by &quot;beneficial&quot;. In contrast, there are avenues for preventing AI-caused human extinction that do not require an understanding of &quot;beneficial&quot;: most trivially, we could coordinate to never build AI systems that could cause human extinction.</p><p>Since the focus is on the <em>impact</em> of the AI system, the authors need a new phrase for this kind of AI system. They define a <strong>prepotent AI system</strong> to be one that cannot be controlled by humanity <strong>and</strong> has the potential to transform the world in a way that is at least as impactful as humanity as a whole. Such an AI system need not be superintelligent, or even an AGI; it may have powerful capabilities in a narrow domain such as technological autonomy, replication speed, or social acumen that enable prepotence.</p><p>By definition, a prepotent AI system is capable of transforming the world drastically. However, there are a lot of conditions that are necessary for continued human existence, and most transformations of the world will not preserve these conditions. (For example, consider the temperature of the Earth or the composition of the atmosphere.) As a result, human extinction is the <em>default</em> outcome from deploying a prepotent AI system, and can only be prevented if the system is designed to preserve human existence with very high precision relative to the significance of its actions. They define a misaligned prepotent AI system (MPAI) as one whose deployment leads to human extinction, and so the main objective is to avert the deployment of MPAI.</p><p>The authors break down the risk of deployment of MPAI into five subcategories, depending on the beliefs, actions and goals of the developers. The AI developers could fail to predict prepotence, fail to predict misalignment, fail to coordinate with other teams on deployment of systems that aggregate to form an MPAI, accidentally (unilaterally) deploy MPAI, or intentionally (unilaterally) deploy MPAI. There are also hazardous social conditions that could increase the likelihood of risks, such as unsafe development races, economic displacement of humans, human enfeeblement, and avoidance of talking about x-risk at all.</p><p>Moving from risks to solutions, the authors categorize their research directions along three axes based on the setting they are considering. First, is there one or multiple humans; second, is there one or multiple AI systems; and third, is it helping the human(s) comprehend, instruct, or control the AI system(s). So, multi/single instruction would involve multiple humans instructing a single AI system. While we will eventually need multi/multi, the preceding cases are easier problems from which we could gain insights that help solve the general multi/multi case. Similarly, comprehension can help with instruction, and both can help with control.</p><p>The authors then go on to list 29 different research directions, which I&apos;m not going to summarize here.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I love the abstract and introduction, because of their directness at actually stating what we want and care about. I am also a big fan of the distinction between provably beneficial and reducing x-risk, and the single/multi analysis.</p><p>The human fragility argument, as applied to generally intelligent agents, is a bit tricky. One interpretation is that the &quot;hardness&quot; stems from the fact that you need a bunch of &quot;bits&quot; of knowledge / control in order to keep humans around. However, it seems like a generally intelligent AI should easily be able to keep humans around &quot;if it wants&quot;, and so the bits already exist in the AI. (As an analogy: we make big changes to the environment, but we could easily preserve deer habitats if we wanted to.) Thus, it is really a question of what &quot;distribution&quot; you expect the AI system is sampled from: if you think we&apos;ll build AI systems that try to do what humanity wants, then we&apos;re probably fine, but if you think that there will be multiple AI systems that each do what their users want, but the users have conflicts, the overall system seems more &quot;random&quot; in its goals, and so more likely to fall into the &quot;default&quot; outcome of human extinction. </p><p>The research directions are very detailed, and while there are some suggestions that don&apos;t seem particularly useful to me, overall I am happy with the list. (And as the paper itself notes, what is and isn&apos;t useful depends on your models of AI development.)</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09382\">Human Instruction-Following with Deep Reinforcement Learning via Transfer-Learning from Text</a></strong> <em>(Felix Hill et al)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): This paper proposes the Simulation-to-Human Instruction Following via Transfer from Text (SHIFTT) method for training an RL agent to receive commands from humans in natural language. One approach to this problem is to train an RL agent to respond to commands based on a template; however, this is not robust to small changes in how humans phrase the commands. In SHIFTT, you instead begin with a pretrained language model such as BERT and first feed the templated commands through the language model. This is then combined with vision inputs to produce a policy. The human commands are later fed through the same language model, and they find that the model has zero-shot transfer to the human commands even if they differ in structure. </p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> Natural language is a very flexible and intuitive way to convey instructions to AI. In some ways, this shifts the alignment problem from the RL agent to the supervised language model, which just needs to learn how to correctly interpret the meaning behind human speech. One advantage of this approach is that the language model is separately trained so it can be tested and verified for safety criteria before being used to train an RL agent. It also may be more competitive than alternatives such as reward modeling that require training a new reward model for each task. </p><p>I do see a couple downsides to this approach, however. The first is that humans are not perfect at conveying their values in natural language (e.g. King Midas wishing for everything he touches to turn to gold), and natural language may not have enough information to convey complex preferences. Even if humans give precise and correct commands, the language model needs to verifiably interpret those commands correctly. This could be difficult as current language models are difficult to interpret and contain many harmful biases. </p><p><strong><a href=\"https://language-play.github.io/\">Grounding Language in Play</a></strong> <em>(Corey Lynch et al)</em> (summarized by Robert): This paper presents a new approach to learning to follow natural language human instruction in a robotics setting. It builds on similar ideas to <strong><a href=\"https://learning-from-play.github.io/\">Learning Latent Plans from Play</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/3d4e6c2c206f/an-65learning-useful-skills-by-watching-humans-play\">AN #65</a></strong>), in that it uses unsupervised &quot;play&quot; data (trajectories of humans playing on the robot with no goal in mind).</p><p>The paper combines several ideas to enable training a policy which can follow natural language instructions with only limited human annotations. </p><p>* In <em>Hindsight Instruction Pairing</em>, human annotators watch small trajectories from the play data, and label them with the instruction which is being completed in the clip. This instruction can take any form, and means we don&apos;t need to choose the instructions and ask humans to perform specific tasks.</p><p>* <em>Multicontext Imitation Learning</em> is a method designed to allow goal-conditioned policies to be learned with multiple different types of goals. For example, we can have lots of example trajectories where the goal is an end state image (as these can be generated automatically without humans), and just a small amount of example trajectories where the goal is a natural language instruction (gathered using <em>Hindsight Instruction Pairing</em>). The approach is to learn a goal embedding network for each type of goal specification, and a single shared policy which takes the goal embedding as input.</p><p>Combining these two methods enables them to train a policy and embedding networks end to end using imitation learning from a large dataset of (trajectory, image goal) pairs and a small dataset of (trajectory, natural language goal) pairs. The policy can follow very long sequences of natural language instructions in a fairly complex grasping environment with a variety of buttons and objects. Their method performs better than the Learning from Play (LfP) method, even though LfP uses a goal image as the goal conditioning, instead of a natural language instruction.</p><p>Further, they propose that instead of learning the goal embedding for the natural language instructions, they use a pretrained large language model to produce the embeddings. This improves the performance of their method over learning the embedding from scratch, which the authors claim is the first example of the knowledge in large language models being transferred and improving performance in a robotics domain. This model also performs well when they create purposefully out of distribution natural language instructions (i.e. with weird synonyms, or google-translated from a different language).</p><p><strong>Robert&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think this paper shows two important things:</p><p>1. Embedding the natural language instructions in the same space as the image conditioning works well, and is a good way of extending the usefulness of human annotations.</p><p>2. Large pretrained language models can be used to improve the performance of language-conditioned reinforcement learning (in this case imitation learning) algorithms and policies.</p><p>Methods which enable us to scale human feedback to complex settings are useful, and this method seems like it could scale well, especially with the use of pretrained large language models which might reduce the amount of language annotations needed further.</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>MISCELLANEOUS (ALIGNMENT) </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://gradientscience.org/benchmarks/\">From ImageNet to Image Classification</a></strong> <em>(Dimitris Tsipras et al)</em> (summarized by Flo): ImageNet was crowdsourced by presenting images to MTurk workers who had to select images that contain a given class from a pool of images obtained via search on the internet.  This is problematic, as an image containing multiple classes will basically get assigned to a random suitable class which can lead to deviations between ImageNet performance and actual capability to recognize images. The authors used MTurk and allowed workers to select multiple classes, as well as one main class for a given image in a pool of 10000 ImageNet validation images. Around 20% of the images seem to contain objects representing multiple classes and the average accuracy for these images was around 10% worse than average for a wide variety of image classifiers. While this is a significant drop, it is still way better than predicting a random class that is in the image. Also, advanced models were still able to predict the ImageNet label in cases where it does not coincide with the main class identified by humans, which suggest that they exploit biases in the dataset generation. While the accuracy of model predictions with respect to the newly identified main class still increased with better accuracy in predicting labels, the accuracy gap seems to grow and we might soon hit a point where gains in ImageNet accuracy don&apos;t correspond to improved image classification. </p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295\">Paper: From ImageNet to Image Classification: Contextualizing Progress on Benchmarks</a></strong></p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I generally find these empiricial tests of whether ML systems actually do what they are assumed to do quite useful for better calibrating intuitions about the speed of AI progress, and to make failure modes more salient. While we have the latter, I am confused about what this means for AI progress: on one hand, this supports the claim that improved benchmark progress does not necessarily translate to better real world applicability. On the other hand, it seems like image classification might be easier than exploiting the dataset biases present in ImageNet, which would mean that we would likely be able to reach even better accuracy than on ImageNet for image classification with the right dataset. </p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X5WTgfX5Ly4ZNHWZD/focus-you-are-allowed-to-be-bad-at-accomplishing-your-goals\">Focus: you are allowed to be bad at accomplishing your goals</a></strong> <em>(Adam Shimi)</em> (summarized by Rohin): <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/DfcywmqRSkBaCB6Ma/intuitions-about-goal-directed-behavior\">Goal-directedness</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/bbd47ba94e84/alignment-newsletter-35\">AN #35</a></strong>) is one of the key drivers of AI risk: it&apos;s the underlying factor that leads to <strong><a href=\"https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf\">convergent instrumental subgoals</a></strong>. However, it has eluded a good definition so far: we cannot simply say that it is the optimal policy for some simple reward function, as that would imply AlphaGo is not goal-directed (since it was beaten by AlphaZero), which seems wrong. Basically, goal-directedness should not be tied directly to <em>competence</em>. So, instead of only considering optimal policies, we can consider any policy that could have been output by an RL algorithm, perhaps with limited resources. Formally, we can construct a set of policies for G that can result from running e.g. SARSA with varying amounts of resources with G as the reward, and define the focus of a system towards G to be the distance of the system&#x2019;s policy to the constructed set of policies.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I certainly agree that we should not require full competence in order to call a system goal-directed. I am less convinced of the particular construction here: current RL policies are typically terrible at generalization, and tabular SARSA explicitly doesn&#x2019;t even <em>try</em> to generalize, whereas I see generalization as a key feature of goal-directedness.</p><p>You could imagine the RL policies get more resources and so are able to understand the whole environment without generalization, e.g. if they get to update on every state at least once. However, in this case realistic goal-directed policies would be penalized for &#x201C;not knowing what they should have known&#x201D;. For example, suppose I want to eat sweet things, and I come across a new fruit I&#x2019;ve never seen before. So I try the fruit, and it turns out it is very bitter. This would count as &#x201C;not being goal-directed&#x201D;, since the RL policies for &#x201C;eat sweet things&#x201D; would already know that the fruit is bitter and so wouldn&#x2019;t eat it.</p><h1>OTHER PROGRESS IN AI </h1><h2>DEEP LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://gradientscience.org/data_rep_bias/\">Identifying Statistical Bias in Dataset Replication</a></strong> <em>(Logan Engstrom et al)</em> (summarized by Flo): One way of dealing with finite and fixed test sets and the resulting possibility of overfitting on the test set is dataset replication, where one tries to closely mimic the original process of dataset creation to obtain a larger test set. This can lead to bias if the difficulty of the new test images is distributed differently than in the original test set. A previous attempt at <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811\">dataset replication on ImageNet</a></strong> tried to get around this by measuring how often humans under time pressure correctly answered a yes/no question about an image&apos;s class (dubbed selection frequency), which can be seen as a proxy for classification difficulty. </p><p>This data was then used to sample candidate images for every class which match the distribution of difficulty in the original test set. Still, all tested models performed worse on the replicated test set than on the original. Parts of this bias can be explained by noisy measurements combined with disparities in the initial distribution of difficulty, which are likely as the original ImageNet data was prefiltered for quality. Basically, the more noisy our estimates for the difficulty are, the more the original distribution of difficulty matters. As an extreme example, imagine a class for which all images in the original test set have a selection frequency of 100%, but 90% of candidates in the new test set have a selection frequency of 50%, while only 10% are as easy to classify as the images in the original test set. Then, if we only use a single human annotator, half of the difficult images in the candidate pool are indistinguishable from the easy ones, such that most images ending up in the new test set are more difficult to classify than the original ones, even after the adjustment.</p><p>The authors then replicate the ImageNet dataset replication with varying amounts of annotators and find that the gap in accuracy between the original and the new test set progressively shrinks with reduced noise from 11.7% with one annotator to 5.7% with 40. Lastly, they discuss more sophisticated estimators for accuracy to further lower bias, which additionally decreases the accuracy gap down to around 3.5%.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> This was a pretty interesting read and provides evidence against large effects of overfitting on the test set. On the other hand, results like this also seem to highlight how benchmarks are mostly useful for model comparison, and how nonrobust they can be to fairly benign distributional shift. </p><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10498\">Cold Case: The Lost MNIST Digits</a></strong> <em>(Chhavi Yadav et al)</em> (summarized by Flo): As the MNIST test set only contains 10,000 samples, concerns that further improvements are essentially overfitting on the test set have been voiced. Interestingly, MNIST was originally meant to have a test set of 60,000, as large as the training set, but the remaining 50,000 digits have been lost. The authors made many attempts to reconstruct the way MNIST was obtained from the NIST handwriting database as closely as possible and present QMNIST(v5) which features an additional 50,000 test images for MNIST, while the rest of the images are very close to the originals from MNIST. They test their dataset using multiple classification methods and find little difference in whether MNIST or QMNIST is used for training, but the test error on the additional 50,000 images is consistently higher than on the original 10,000 test images or their reconstruction of these. While the concerns about overuse of a test set are justified, the measured effects were mostly small and their relevance might be outweighed by the usefulness of paired differences for statistical model selection. </p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I am confused about the overfitting part, as most methods they try (like ResNets) don&apos;t seem to have been selected for performance on the MNIST test set. Granted, LeNet seems to degrade more than other models, but it seems like the additional test images in QMNIST are actually harder to classify. This seems especially plausible with the previous summary in mind and because the authors mention a dichotomy between the ease of classification for NIST images generated by highschoolers vs government employees but don&#x2019;t seem to mention any attempts to deal with potential selection bias. </p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p>I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=\"https://rohinshah.com/\">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

For sanity's sake, I'm going to shorten the abbreviation to HMCM henceforth.</p>\n<p>I'm going to give an overall review of it here. If you don't care about that, skip ahead to Categorizing Notetaking Systems.</p>\n<h2>Reviewy Review</h2>\n<p>Its title makes a big claim, and that claim doesn't quite match with what I got out of reading it. That being said, I still think I got a lot out of it.</p>\n<p>His abstractions were often fun to engage with, and I'm currently using a modified version of his tagging system (tags will probably be my next post).

With the \"review\" out of the way, I will henceforth be jumping around and expanding on topics  in a very non-linear fashion, according to my own whims and interests.</p>\n<p>Lets talk about...</p>\n<h1>Categorizing Notetaking Systems</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am astonished that there isn't a field of study of notebooks. I have searched on the net, and while I have found a page here and there on some type of notebook method, it is almost ALWAYS one of the following two things:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Diary</strong>: A bunch of entrees, chronologically based, maybe with a TOC, in which a person keeps a record of their thoughts.

A lot of modern notetaking still fits neatly into the taxonomy of data structures they <a href=\"https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/reports/t722h9830\">described in 2005</a>.</p>\n<p>If I had to broadly categorize the notetakers I've seen, here are the standard categories I'd describe...</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)\">File System</a></strong>: Classic. A (mostly) acyclic tree whose nodes are folders, and leaves are distinct files. Acyclicity might be broken with shortcuts. (ex: computer file system, GoogleDocs)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner\">The Outliner</a></strong>: A tree of nestled pages or bullet-points, whose nodes are the same type as the leaves. Usually acyclic. The best examples can be almost 100% hands-on-keyboard. Good structure for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_folding\">code folding</a>. (ex: Workflowy, most forums)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline\">The Timeline</a></strong>: What it says on the tin. Another classic. Chronologically-organized. Typically a journal, or current-events-related. A variant is a multi-threaded timeline, such as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart\">Gantt Chart</a>. (ex: RSS feed)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendaring_software\">The Calendar</a></strong>: Some might not call this notetaking software, but I've come to think of it like one. Chronological, like the timeline. Unlike the standard timeline, the priority is based largely on proximity to future due-dates. Fantastic for just-in-time reminders. (ex: GoogleCalendar)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)#Knowledge_tags\">Tag You're It</a></strong>: Everything has a pile of #hashtags or stickers. You pull up lists based on a common tag, possibly ordered by some other index. Often hybridized with other types. (ex: Category Bins, Evernote)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map\">MindMap</a></strong>:  Nodes and edges, where a lot of the value of information is in the connections drawn between concepts.\nThe underlying structure is called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_diagram\">Spider Diagram</a>. Usually heirarchical but may be permissive of cyclic references, sometimes in a limited way ( lines pointing back up the chain). (ex: XMind)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\">The Wiki</a></strong>: Hyperlinks hyperlinks hyperlinks. Navigated as an extremely-cyclic web of hyperlinks, usually with some custom index files. Unlike tag, the line between an article instance and an indexing instance isn't as clear or hierarchical. Probably supports backlinks. Not always public. (ex: Wikipedia, Tiddlywiki)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard\">Flashcards</a></strong>: Two-sided association between one piece of data, and another. A dictionary data type, or a two-sided dictionary. Usually index-card sized, and most often used for memorization. (ex: Anki)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation\">Annotator</a></strong>: A system for taking notes coupled to uploaded reading material, usually an ebook, PDF, or similar. The best of them capture something of the \"writing/highlighting in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia\">margins of books</a>\" experience. (ex: Kindle, some of Zotero)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system\">Recommender System</a></strong>: An add-on for any of the above. These rank things according to some metric of quality, like ratings, relevance, or frequency of forwarding (ex: RSS feed curators)</p>\n<h2>Standardization Axis</h2>\n<p>Standardization of input is a key axis of divergence among notetakers. The level of standardization is an early software decision that has a lot of influence what the software is good at, and how it is used.\nThink of this as the extent to which formatting is standardized, and to which random imports are allowed or integrated.</p>\n<p><strong>Standardized Format</strong>: All data is kept in a similar file format to one another. On the plus side, it's easier for people to program smart interactions between standardized notes. On the minus side, you might not be able to import older notes from another system. (ex: Workflowy)</p>\n<p><strong>And the Kitchen Sink</strong>: Can import and render many different data types, but usually with very limited interactions allowed between them, because they're harder to program in. In my experience, exporting data from a Kitchen Sink is usually a nightmare. (ex: Evernote)</p>\n<h3>Standard Compromises</h3>\n<p>Some commit very hard in one direction or the other, for the most part (ex: Workflowy tends very SF, Evernote tends very AtKS).</p>\n<p>There are also a few common compromises.</p>\n<p>A lot of generalist notetaking software reaches a compromise by having a standard format with added functionality, and some non-standard formats that can be stored, but lack most of the added functionality. We can call this <strong>Standard +</strong>.</p>\n<p>Another type of compromise I've seen is having non-standardized data types, but standardized metadata. (ex: computer file systems exemplify this). I would call this <strong>Meta-Standardized</strong>. In order to warrant the name, I would also require that the standardized metadata be surfaced to the user in some way.</p>\n<h2>Length of Input</h2>\n<p>Another axis of divergence for standardized notetakers is the length of input that it encourages, or even forces.</p>\n<p>Some applications can get pretty ham-handed at forcing their preferred length upon your communiques, and will cut you off if it comes down to it.</p>\n<p>If it's not forced, look to the size of the default textbox to see what length it is encouraging. Is there a whole blank page, waiting to be filled? An emulated index card? A single line?</p>\n<p><strong>On the shorter end:</strong> 3 words, the sentence, the index card, 200 characters</p>\n<p><strong>On the longer end:</strong> the essay, the blank page, the giant template, the large div, the endless scroll</p>\n<p>Short encourages compression.

That's what I'm going to try to walk readers through today. So take out your current favorite bullet-point software, and let's get started.</p>\n<h3>Brief Explanation of Desiderata</h3>\n<p>For people who haven't run into the term before, <strong>desiderata</strong> (singular desideratum) translates pretty literally to \"something desired.\" It usually comes up in a mathematical context*, where desiderata are typically presented as a list of propositions feeding into a search for the system that best satisfies them.</p>\n<p>A good solution or system would keep as many of these propositions true as it can.</p>\n<p>(Possibly with different weightings; the truth of some propositions may be more important than others.)</p>\n<p>As a simplified illustrative example, take <a href=\"https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2292\">this SMBC comic on theodicy</a>. A theologian is searching for a system that satisfies 3 propositions regarding God:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>God is Omnipotent</li>\n<li>God is Omniscient</li>\n<li>God is Omnibenevolent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These propositions would be his desiderata.</p>\n<p>The recognition that you might not find a single system that completely satisfies all desiderata (see again, <a href=\"https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2292\">the SMBC comic</a>) is inherent in the framing. It's part of why you might call something \"desiderata\" instead of \"requirements.\"</p>\n<h1>Prompts</h1>\n<p>Here are some optional prompts, as a starting point.</p>\n<h2>What Situations are you Trying to Solve?</h2>\n<p>If it's mostly for tracking due-dates, maybe pick a calendar.</p>\n<p>If it's memorization, consider a flashcard system.</p>\n<p>If it's for taking sequential notes on a lot of reading, consider an annotator.</p>\n<p>Would you benefit from being able to reference other notes in a non-hierarchical fashion? Or is a strict tree more than good enough? Are you going to sort by topical tags? Do you need a search bar for words?</p>\n<p>etc.</p>\n<h2>What Type of Note Taking?</h2>\n<h3>Software</h3>\n<p>If this question stumps you, you might want to check out the partner post's description of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8eXgAEq9fogYBfx4k/bbe-w1-hmcm-and-notetaking-systems\">categories of notetaking software</a>.</p>\n<p>Some categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)\">File System</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner\">Outliner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline\">Timeline</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Gantt Chart (&amp; other multi-threaded)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendaring_software\">Calendar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)\">Tags</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map\">MindMap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\">Wiki</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal wiki</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard\">Flashcards</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation\">Annotator</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Level of standardization?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Templates?\n<ul>\n<li>Built into the software, or personalized?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What specialized features would you like?</li>\n<li>What formats does it need to accept?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Length of Input?</p>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\n<p>If you're open to it being purely offline, you might also want to consider a physical notetaker.</p>\n<p>Physical notetakers can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper\n<ul>\n<li>Blank</li>\n<li>Lined</li>\n<li>Grid</li>\n<li>Drawing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Folder\n<ul>\n<li>Color</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Notebooks\n<ul>\n<li>Small</li>\n<li>Large</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Binder</li>\n<li>Index Cards</li>\n<li>Day Planner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...possibly with pencils, pens, colors, or labels. Day planners held a special place in my heart for a long time, and I still use notebooks for sketching and quick thoughts.</p>\n<p>If you would benefit from applying a standardized format, you might be able to print instances of it out.</p>\n<h2>How Much Time Up Front? How Much Upkeep?</h2>\n<p>Here's where you think though how much up-front time and maintenance time you're willing to put into this.</p>\n<p>You might want to reference XKCD's <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1205/\">Is It Worth The Time</a> chart.</p>\n<p>If you'll be doing long-form notes and are willing to put in a bit of time up-front, I recommend learning <strong><a href=\"https://github.github.com/gfm/\">GitHub-Flavored Markdown</a></strong>. For more about why, read \"An Advertisement for Markdown.\"</p>\n<h2>How Important is Retrievability?</h2>\n<p>There's an important batch of related questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How Important is Retrievability?</li>\n<li>What platforms will I access the software from?</li>\n<li>Offline Access?</li>\n<li>Sharing, Privacy, Security?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it's a calendar? Keeping old information might not be all that important.</p>\n<p>If it's math or programming notes that you're likely to reference forever? Don't lock it up in a weird format, on a site owned by a start-up that might go under in the next year.</p>\n<p>Do you want to be able to share it? Conversely, do you want to keep it extremely private from others?</p>\n<p>Password managers are basically flashcards with fancy encryption, but I sure wouldn't keep my passwords on a flashcard site.</p>\n<h2>My Personal Notetaking Desiderata</h2>\n<p>There were my personal notetaking desiderata:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Markdown (required)\n<ul>\n<li>Markdown import (required)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>LaTeX equations inline (required)</li>\n<li>Offline access (required)</li>\n<li>One of...\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to Transfer</li>\n<li>Definitely won't be discontinued</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Wiki\n<ul>\n<li>Links Notes to Notes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Multi-platform\n<ul>\n<li>I want to be able to access and edit it from multiple computers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Frequent Cloud Saving (or similar)\n<ul>\n<li>Good recovery (I can't count the number of times I've overwritten notes)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Quickly opens large text files\n<ul>\n<li>Some of my old journal files are comically huge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Searchable (bonus)</li>\n<li>Templating (bonus)</li>\n<li>Smart handling of merge conflicts (bonus)</li>\n<li>Can draw in it (bonus)</li>\n<li>Vim shortcuts (bonus)</li>\n<li>Regex replace (bonus)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Search for It</h1>\n<p>Now comes trying to find notetaking software that actually fulfills some of your desiderata.</p>\n<p>How I got through this was finding some wonderful Wikipedia comparison charts out there that made this pretty easy. Note that they can be pretty out-of-date, though.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_note-taking_software\">Comparison of Note-Taking Software</a> chart that seems quite extensive.</p>\n<p>There are also a number of sub-charts covering more specific categories, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software\">Wikipedia's Comparison of Wiki Software</a> (meta, much?).</p>\n<p>If you know a close fit that doesn't quite work, you can look for Reddit or Quora threads about alternatives.</p>\n<p>Remember: If you came up with a long list, you don't have to satisfy literally every desiderata. Perhaps it's okay if some are left uncovered.</p>\n<p>If need be, you can split up the requirements and find 2 systems. I'd try not to do more than 3; it can be a lot of upkeep.</p>\n<p>Once you have it narrowed down to a few, try them out. You might also want to read \"How do you Want to Handle Misc?\" After a few days, make a pros and cons list.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/\">Tiddlywiki</a> Pros and Cons</h2>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Markdown import (required)</li>\n<li>LaTeX equations inline (required)</li>\n<li>Wiki\n<ul>\n<li>Extremely easy to link notes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Searchable</li>\n<li>Loads quickly</li>\n<li>Easy to download and transfer\n<ul>\n<li>The whole thing is an html file</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Multiple files can be open at once</li>\n<li>CloudSave (in combination with GoogleDocs and <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiddly-drive/oaphhjhbbabdjnpjpiliepphpmnioolo?hl=en\">tiddlydrive</a>)</li>\n<li>Not a Dying Baby Start-Up\n<ul>\n<li>Not going to stop being supported</li>\n<li>Html files will run regardless of support</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Can draw in it (a little)</li>\n<li>Programmable for Super-Users\n<ul>\n<li>Great utility functions (ex: list-links, transclude)</li>\n<li>Powerful list filters (ex: tags, edited last week, contains code....)</li>\n<li>Cool plug-ins</li>\n<li>Can write own templates and macros</li>\n<li>Pre-existing macros exposed to editing or copying</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Peculiar Markdown syntax\n<ul>\n<li>So very, very weird...</li>\n<li>I'm good at regex.

When I tried it a year ago, it didn't quite fit my needs (slow-loading, no offline, LaTeX handling is worse, a little too tree-like, chance it stops being supported). But it does offer what might be a gentler learning-curve than Tiddlywiki, and has definitely been a great fit for some people I know.</p>\n<p>If you liked <a href=\"https://workflowy.com/\">Workflowy</a> and want to try something a bit fancier, <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam</a> is a good choice.</p>\n<p>For people who like <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam</a> and are curious to try <a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/\">Tiddlywiki</a>, there is a Tiddlywiki with some added Roam-like features named <a href=\"https://giffmex.org/experiments/stroll.experiment.html\">Stroll</a>.</p>\n<p>(If you try Stroll, I'd be curious to hear about your experience. I've considered trying it, but am using <a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/\">basic Tiddlywiki</a> at present.)</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>\n<h2>An Advertisement for Markdown</h2>\n<p>If you want to use some minimal formatting (italics, bold, links), and you expect to take online notes a lot, I heartily recommend learning <strong><a href=\"https://github.github.com/gfm/\">GitHub-Flavored Markdown</a></strong> (GFM).</p>\n<p>First, it's not that hard to pick up. Second, there are a lot of markdown-compatible systems out there, leaving your exporting options wide open. It's still readable as plaintext, though. Many editors provide formatting previews, so you don't have to look at pure plaintext all the time. If you grow to want fancier formatting, many Markdown editors let you insert html formatting directly into the editor to modify your text.</p>\n<p>Markdown makes it pretty easy to see and avoid formatting mistakes. If I'm copying from something formatted in a confusing way, and for some reason don't want to just Ctrl-Shift-V (\"paste without formatting\"), seeing it in markdown can be pretty clarifying.</p>\n<p>If you're a less-frequent note-taker than me, you might want to pick something with less up-front learning. But you probably still want good export options, and markdown is the next best thing to pure plaintext for export.</p>\n<p>If you want to go even further down the more-typing, less-clicking, \"programmer laziness\" rabbit hole: Vim-shortcuts for text editors, and regex search functionality, are wonderful things to have if you can get them. I readily admit that I write most of my structure-heavy notes in an IDE, before pasting them into anything else.</p>\n<h2>How do you Want to Handle Misc?</h2>\n<p>You're going to have miscellaneous notes sometimes. Despite our best intentions, it just happens.</p>\n<p>Do you want to feel subtly encouraged to delete them, keep them, or integrate them?</p>\n<p>Would you rather hide them from yourself, get them in your face with reminders, or somewhere in-between? Do you want to choose to set those reminders for yourself, or for them to be automatic?</p>\n<p>This probably won't give you an easy checklist item, but it's something to keep in mind during your first look at the software. Make an uncategorized data-point to serve as a test-subject on that first day with the software. See what you feel compelled to do with it.</p>\n<p>Similarly, test out export capabilities <em>early</em> so you don't have a pile of regrets later.</p>\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\n<p>* The fact that I use the term desiderata outside of a mathematical context has struck some people as pretty weird. I find it useful, so I keep on doing it.</p>\n<p>** I prioritize LaTeX highly both because my pre-existing math notes already use LaTeX within Markdown***, and because my ability to retain math improved meaningfully after I started using LaTeX to write down and render equations. (Seriously! I recommend trying it, if you haven't.)</p>\n<p>*** Side-note: A pet peeve of mine is notetaking software where you have to dedicate an <em>entire line</em> to every LaTeX equation. In addition to finding this restriction annoying, such software usually mangles any math notes I try to import. Notion and Roam have both been guilty of this, and it was a big part of what ejected me from both of them.</p>\n<h1>Today's Challenge</h1>\n<h2>Write up your own notetaking desiderata</h2>\n<p>And if your current solution doesn't satisfy it well, search for something that does!</p>\n<p>If you think some abstract commentary on types of notetaking software would help you get started, go ahead and read the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8eXgAEq9fogYBfx4k/bbe-w1-hmcm-and-notetaking-systems\">accompanying post</a>.</p>\n</body></html>",

Perhaps I will write one someday, but this is not it.</p>\n<p>This is the write-along of one notetaking superuser, trying to work out how to be an even better notetaking superuser.</p>\n<p>This is aired in public for a few reasons. First, it is part of the nature of writing to want some of it to be read. Perhaps it will be of use to other notetaking superusers.  Also, I wanted to summon the blunt force of visible accountability.</p>\n<p>It is my dream that this will come to resemble -in equal parts- a love-letter to notetaking, and a grueling practice-regimen.</p>\n<p>With that said, let's see how I do.</p>\n<h2>Core Goal</h2>\n<p>My core goal is to make at least 4 reference-docs over this next month that I pull up <em>at least</em> 100x afterwards. Ideally, more like 1000x.</p>\n<p>(For it to count, it must be brought up for the purpose of <em>reading</em> it, not writing to it. Constant updating is a cost, not a benefit.)</p>\n<p>This seems achievable to me. I already have a few notes that probably pass this bar. My cheatsheet for BASH is top among them, but my personal list of Hamming Questions Variants gets pulled up a lot as well.</p>\n<h3>Secondary Goals</h3>\n<p>There are many secondary goals that would go well with this. Here are just a few of them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post on LessWrong 1/week\n<ul>\n<li>Could be things from the notes</li>\n<li>Could be meta about the notetaking process</li>\n<li>Could be double-meta about the notetaking learning process</li>\n<li>There is No Triple-Meta</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Learn things I expect my future self would endorse\n<ul>\n<li>Train to Retain, not Learn to Lose</li>\n<li>Long Description: Make lasting seeds that my best future-self would endorsedly chose to repopulate her brainspace with, via looking them back up.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Keep a reference system that pays dividends\n<ul>\n<li>Have a laconic lookup for my <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QzBuuNEqJGQFeWM4f/hammers-and-nails\">Hammers Nails and Models</a></li>\n<li>Move the best of my old notes to a good lookup system</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Better Structuring of Thought\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/html/\">Better Knowledge of the Structuring of my Thought</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>(Complete list in personal notes)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Materials</h2>\n<p>My core notetaking software is the personal wiki software <a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/\">Tiddlywiki</a>, with a side of <a href=\"https://stackedit.io/\">StackEdit</a> for quick uncategorized thoughts.</p>\n<p>I have been extremely happy with Tiddlywiki. I don't expect this to change. I might go over why some other time; it would likely be an entire post in itself.</p>\n<h2>Mechanisms</h2>\n<p>The main way I think I will do this is to produce <em>many</em> good notes, all of which have a reasonable chance of being re-referenced.</p>\n<p>(Meta-note: It has been a week since I started, and I noticed that I've leaned more towards \"systems\" than I originally anticipated. This is not yet a problem, but could become one if it extends into the 2nd week)</p>\n<p>However, I am likely to try a few things from every major angle of attack.</p>\n<p>Broad strategies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve my notetaking\n<ul>\n<li>More notes</li>\n<li>Better notes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Make my notes easier to...\n<ul>\n<li>Retrieve</li>\n<li>Reference</li>\n<li>Use</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improve my Strategy\n<ul>\n<li>Choice of Subject</li>\n<li>Templates and Indexing</li>\n<li>Better Plug-Ins</li>\n<li>TAPs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Last Thoughts</h2>\n<p>I started on this at the beginning of the month, so I already have things to report!</p>\n<p>Week 1 split into 2 threads of thought, so check out one or both of...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8eXgAEq9fogYBfx4k/bbe-w1-hmcm-and-notetaking-systems\">Categories of Notetaking Software</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xqQJ7K7G9bmCF35Hq/bbe-w1-personal-notetaking-desiderata-walkthrough\">Personal Notetaking Desiderata Walkthrough</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\n<p>* The <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8eXgAEq9fogYBfx4k/bbe-w1-hmcm-and-notetaking-systems\">Kimbro</a> link caught some of that slightly-manic quality that helps get projects off the ground, but <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/About#target-audience\">Gwern's</a> description of long-living (alive, updating, revising) reference repositories for your future self hits closer to the core of my personal notetaking goals.</p>\n</body></html>",

Much of the material has appeared in other posts; the first two sections in particular are drawn almost verbatim from the opening “What is Abstraction?” post.</i></p><p>Let's start with a few examples (borrowed from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hLFD6qSN9MmQxKjG5/embedded-agency-via-abstraction\"><u>here</u></a>) to illustrate what we're talking about:</p><ul><li>We have a gas consisting of some huge number of particles. We throw away information about the particles themselves, instead keeping just a few summary statistics: average energy, number of particles, etc. We can then make highly precise predictions about things like e.g. pressure just based on the reduced information we've kept, without having to think about each individual particle. That reduced information is the \"abstract layer\" - the gas and its properties.</li><li>We have a bunch of transistors and wires on a chip. We arrange them to perform some logical operation, like maybe a NAND gate. Then, we throw away information about the underlying details, and just treat it as an abstract logical NAND gate. Using just the abstract layer, we can make predictions about what outputs will result from what inputs. Note that there’s some fuzziness - 0.01 V and 0.02 V are both treated as logical zero, and in rare cases there will be enough noise in the wires to get an incorrect output.</li><li>I tell my friend that I'm going to play tennis. I have ignored a huge amount of information about the details of the activity - where, when, what racket, what ball, with whom, all the distributions of every microscopic particle involved - yet my friend can still make some reliable predictions based on the abstract information I've provided.</li><li>When we abstract formulas like \"1+1=2*1\" and \"2+2=2*2\" into \"n+n=2*n\", we're obviously throwing out information about the value of n, while still making whatever predictions we can given the information we kept. This is what abstraction is all about in math and programming: throw out as much information as you can, while still maintaining the core \"prediction\" - i.e. the theorem or algorithm.</li><li>I have a street map of New York City. The map throws out lots of info about the physical streets: street width, potholes, power lines and water mains, building facades, signs and stoplights, etc. But for many questions about distance or reachability on the physical city streets, I can translate the question into a query on the map. My query on the map will return reliable predictions about the physical streets, even though the map has thrown out lots of info.</li></ul><p>The general pattern: there’s some ground-level “concrete” model (or territory), and an abstract model (or map). The abstract model throws away or ignores information from the concrete model, but in such a way that we can still make reliable predictions about some aspects of the underlying system.</p><p>Notice that the predictions of the abstract models, in most of these examples, are not perfectly accurate. We're not dealing with the sort of \"abstraction\" we see in e.g. programming or algebra, where everything is exact. There are going to be probabilities involved.</p><p>In the language of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/efWfvrWLgJmbBAs3m\"><u>embedded world-models</u></a>, we're talking about multi-level models: models which contain both a notion of \"table\", and of all the pieces from which the table is built, and of all the atoms from which the pieces are built. We want to be able to use predictions from one level at other levels (e.g. predict bulk material properties from microscopic structure and/or macroscopic measurements, or predict from material properties whether it's safe to sit on the table), and we want to move between levels consistently.</p><h2>Formalization: Starting Point</h2><p>To repeat the intuitive idea: an abstract model throws away or ignores information from the concrete model, but in such a way that we can still make reliable predictions about some aspects of the underlying system.</p><p>So to formalize abstraction, we first need some way to specify which \"aspects of the underlying system\" we wish to predict, and what form the predictions take. The obvious starting point for predictions is probability distributions. Given that our predictions are probability distributions, the natural way to specify which aspects of the system we care about is via a set of events or logic statements for which we calculate probabilities. We'll be agnostic about the exact types for now, and just call these \"queries\".</p><p>That leads to a rough construction. We start with some low-level model&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"M^L\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.081em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

We can therefore ignore that fine-grained information when making predictions about things far away. We just keep around whatever high-level signal makes it past the noise of mediating variables, and throw out everything else, so long as we’re only asking questions about far-away variables.</p><p>An example: when I type “4+3” in a python shell, I think of that as adding two numbers, not as a bunch of continuous voltages driving electric fields and current flows in little patches of metal and doped silicon. Why? Because, if I’m thinking about what will show up on my monitor after I type “4+3” and hit enter, then the exact voltages and current flows on the CPU are not relevant. This remains true even if I’m thinking about the voltages driving individual pixels in my monitor - even at a fairly low level, the exact voltages in the arithmetic-logic unit on the CPU aren’t relevant to anything more than a few microns away - except for the high-level information contained in the “numbers” passed in and out. Information about exact voltages in specific wires is quickly wiped out by noise within the chip.</p><p>Another example: if I’m an astronomer predicting the trajectory of the sun, then I’m presumably going to treat other stars as point-masses. At such long distances, the exact mass distribution within the star doesn’t really matter - except for the high-level information contained in the total mass, momentum and center-of-mass location.</p><p>Formalizing this in the same language as the previous section:</p><ul><li>We have some variables&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"X\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

Any of the above interventional query requirements have qualitatively-similar implications, though obviously some are stronger than others.</p><p>In day-to-day life, causal abstraction is arguably more common than non-causal. In fully deterministic problems, validity of interventional queries is essentially the only constraint (though often in guises which do not explicitly mention causality, e.g. functional behavior or logic). For instance, suppose I want to write a python function to sort a list. The only constraint is the abstract input/output behavior, i.e. the behavior of the designated “output” under interventions on the designated “inputs”. The low-level details - i.e. the actual steps performed by the algorithm - are free to vary, so long as those high-level interventional constraints are satisfied.</p><p>This generalizes to other design/engineering problems: the desired behavior of a system is usually some abstract, high-level behavior under interventions. Low-level details are free to vary so long as the high-level constraints are satisfied.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks/yparf6q2abbw7eshcyfk\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks/ttkkiv2yizidxidf0w1d 143w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks/c2hnrkuzwp4qustocrsf 223w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks/nugjxze49drypc1ydfrx 303w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks/f89h9pamjhxz8sm9zlbo 383w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks/crbmnib3c0knfuoksyei 463w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks/vdelscg3qdrkddgloqgd 543w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vDGvHBDuMtcPd8Lks/skahcywj62tn6lgu7lz5 623w\"></figure><h2>Exact Abstraction</h2><p>Finally, one important special case. In math and programming, we typically use abstractions with sharper boundaries than most of those discussed here so far. Prototypical examples:</p><ul><li>A function in programming: behavior of everything outside the function is independent of the function’s internal variables, given a high-level summary containing only the function’s inputs and outputs.

Exact abstractions in math/programming are typically deterministic, so they’re mainly constrained by interventional predictions rather than distributional predictions.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>We started with a very general notion of abstraction: we take some low-level model and abstract it into a high-level model by throwing away information in such a way that we can still accurately answer some queries. This is extremely general, but in order to actually be useful, we need some efficient way to know which queries are and are not supported by the abstraction.</p><p>That brought us to our next definition: abstraction keeps information relevant to “far away” variables.

Here is my attempt.</p><p>For the purposes of the following discussion I&#x2019;m going to distinguish between (a) <strong>continuous vs. discontinuous </strong>progress in AI research, where discontinuity refers specifically to a sharp jump or change in the AI research progress curve relative to the previous curve; (b) <strong>slow vs. fast </strong>rate of progress, referring to the steepness of the progress curve slope, regardless of whether or not it&#x2019;s discontinuous; and (c) <strong>long vs. short </strong>clock time &#x2013; i.e., whether progress takes a long or short time relative to absolute time and not relative to previous trend lines. What exactly counts as discontinuous / fast / short will depend on what purpose we are using them for, as below.</p><p>There seem to be three or four primary AI-risk-related issues that depend on whether or not there will be a discontinuity / fast takeoff speed:</p><ol><li>Will we see AGI (or CAIS or TAI or whatever you want to call it) coming far enough ahead of time such that we will be able to respond appropriately at that point? This question in turn breaks down into two sub-questions: (a) Will we see AGI coming before it arrives? (I.e., will there be a &#x201C;<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/\">fire alarm for AGI</a>&#x201D; as Eliezer calls it.) (b) If we do see it coming, will we have enough time to react before it&#x2019;s too late?</li><li>Will the feedback loops during the development of AGI be long enough that we will be able to correct course as we go?</li><li>Is it likely that one company / government / other entity could gain enough first-mover advantage such that it will not be controllable or stoppable by other entities?</li></ol><p>Let&#x2019;s deal with each of these individually:</p><ul><li>Question 1/a: Will we see AGI coming before it arrives? This seems to depend on all three types of discontinuity:</li><ul><li>If there&#x2019;s <strong>discontinuous</strong> progress relative to the previous curve, then presumably that jump will act as a fire alarm (although it might be too late to do anything about it by then).</li><li>If there&#x2019;s <strong>continuous</strong> but sufficiently <strong>fast </strong>rate of progress and/or a sufficiently <strong>short </strong>clock time in the lead up to AGI, then that <em>might</em> act as a fire alarm in the sense that people will see the world start going crazy due to sufficiently advanced AI and that will be a wake-up call.</li><li>If progress is <strong>continuous</strong> AND sufficiently <strong>slow</strong> AND takes a sufficiently <strong>long</strong> time, then it seems quite plausible that people will get used to all the changes as they come, and they might not notice the progress that AI is making until it is too late.</li></ul><li>Question 1/b: If we do see it coming, will we have enough time to react before it&#x2019;s too late?</li><ul><li>If the absolute (clock) time between the &#x201C;fire alarm&#x201D; and the first potentially-dangerous AGI is too <strong>short</strong>, then we will likely not be able to react in time, whereas if it&#x2019;s <strong>long</strong> enough then we will probably be able to react in time.</li><li>However, if progress is sufficiently <strong>continuous</strong> and/or <strong>slow</strong> such that there are other very advanced AIs to help with our research, then we could perhaps use those almost-AGIs to help do a ton of research in a short amount of absolute time.</li></ul><li>Question 2: Will the feedback loops during the development of AGI be long enough that we will be able to correct course as we go?</li><ul><li>If absolute clock time is very <strong>short</strong>, then humans will probably not be able to react fast enough.</li><li>However, once again if progress is sufficiently <strong>continuous</strong> and/or <strong>slow</strong>, then there will likely be powerful almost-AGIs which could plausibly allow us to correct course very quickly.</li></ul><li>Question 3: Is it likely that one company / government / other entity gain enough first-mover advantage that it will not be controllable or stoppable by other entities?</li><ul><li>If AI progress is <strong>discontinuous</strong> in the jump <em>to </em>AGI or immediately preceding that, and/or if it is discontinuous <em>from </em>AGI in the sense that the first AGI might recursively self-improve and go FOOM, then presumably yes. (However, if the discontinuity is a bit earlier in the lead-up to AGI, then that&#x2019;s mostly irrelevant to this question.)</li><li>If AI progress is <strong>continuous</strong> both to and from AGI but <strong>short</strong> in an absolute sense, then the answer is maybe since companies or governments can presumably keep things secret at least for a few months and thereby gain a sufficient head start.</li><li>If AI progress is <strong>continuous</strong> and <strong>long</strong> enough, then probably not because there will be nearly as powerful AIs that can help stop it.</li></ul></ul><p><em>Thanks especially to Sammy Martin and Issa Rice for discussions of this post and for helping me to clarify my thinking on this.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>[As described in</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j4RsFqp3YTpjWmZFN/a-practical-guide-to-conflict-resolution-introduction\">the introduction</a>, this post is about the different ways we communicate, the impact that can have on conflict, and how to choose the best communication tool for the job.]</em></p><p>If you&#x2019;re anything like me, you crave specific advice for conflict resolution. Say this. Say it in this way. Don&#x2019;t say that. Don&#x2019;t use words that are longer than 10 letters when translated into Brazilian Portuguese. That sort of thing. But instead of focusing on what or what not to say, the most useful specific advice I can give is actually to focus on <em>where</em> you communicate.</p><p>Marshall McLuhan coined the famous phrase &#x201C;the medium is the message&#x201D;, and oh <em>boy</em> was he ever right. Every medium has different characteristics which impact how we communicate, and how conflict will spread or resolve. Here are just a few of the characteristics that matter:</p><ul><li><strong>Speed of communication, aka bandwidth.</strong> Most people can speak much faster than they can type.</li><li><strong>Speed of response, aka latency.</strong> This can be anywhere from snail mail, which takes days per message, to instant messaging which is usually real-time.</li><li><strong>Ability to absorb cross-talk.</strong> Laggy video-conferencing is particularly bad at this.</li><li><strong>Audience size.</strong> Compare an in-person conversation to an email list with hundreds of subscribers.</li><li><strong>Participant size.</strong> Are those hundred subscribers just reading, or can they add their own opinions to the mix?</li><li><strong>Available side-channels.</strong> In-person communication gives you a whole bunch of important extra communication channels like tone of voice, facial expression and posture.</li><li><strong>Norms.</strong> Most media are bound to specific codes of behaviour, either explicitly or implicitly.</li></ul><p>With all of these variables, it&#x2019;s no surprise that picking the right venue for your conflict is hugely valuable. Of course, you often don&#x2019;t have a choice of where the conflict starts; they just do. But you <em>always</em> have the opportunity to move it, and it&#x2019;s usually pretty easy when everyone involved is operating in good faith. Just go &#x201C;hey, this would be easier to talk about in-person, do you mind if I swing by your desk?&#x201D; and you&#x2019;d be amazed at how easy it gets. Changing to a better venue is often both the easiest <em>and</em> the most effective thing you can do to resolve a conflict.</p><p>That said, with so many possible characteristics to consider it can be pretty daunting to figure out which one to suggest. Fortunately there&#x2019;s an easy rule of thumb: in-person trumps everything, always. If in-person isn&#x2019;t possible because people are physically too far apart, one-on-one video-conferencing can be a decent substitute as long as it isn&#x2019;t too laggy.</p><p>There is one major caveat to the in-person rule, which is on the number of participants. If you have more than six people involved then <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2019/06/07/the-efficient-meeting-hypothesis/\">the value of in-person conversation falls off pretty sharply</a>, and you might be better off with something like a chat system that can handle that more effectively. Of course, it&#x2019;s pretty rare that more than six people really need to be there; usually you can pick representatives from each group or otherwise cut the participants down to a reasonable size.</p><p>If neither in-person nor video chat are realistic, I&#x2019;ve had pretty good luck aiming for whatever venue has the highest bandwidth, lowest latency, and smallest audience. However in rare cases, a venue with substantially higher latency can actually work in your favour as it gives people a chance to cool off before responding.</p><p>This post is short enough it doesn&#x2019;t necessarily need a summary, but I wrote one anyway:</p><ol><li>Use the best available venue or communication medium.</li><li>In-person trumps everything.</li><li>Keep the number of participants small.</li></ol>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Goal-directedness is the term used by the AI Safety community to point to a specific property: following a goal. It comes from Rohin Shah&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc/p/DfcywmqRSkBaCB6Ma\">post</a> in his <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/4dHMdK5TLN6xcqtyc\">sequence</a>, but the intuition pervades many safety issues and current AI approaches. Yet it lacks a formal definition, or even a decomposition into more or less formal subcomponents.</p><p>Which questions we want to answer about goal-directed systems underlies the sort of definition we&apos;re looking for. There are two main questions that Rohin asks in his posts:</p><ul><li>Are non goal-directed systems or less goal-directed ones inherently safer than fully goal-directed ones?</li><li>Can non-goal-directed systems or less goal-directed ones be competitive with fully goal-directed ones?</li></ul><p>Answering these will also answer the really important meta-question: should we put resources into non-goal-directed approaches to AGI?</p><p>Notice that both questions above are about predicting properties of the system based on its goal-directedness. These properties we care about depend only on the behavior of the system, not on its internal structure. It thus makes sense to consider that goal-directedness should also depend only on the behavior of the system. For if it didn&apos;t, then two systems with the same properties (safety, competitiveness) would have different goal-directedness, breaking the pattern of prediction.</p><p>Actually, this assumes that our predictor is injective: it sends different &quot;levels&quot; of goal-directedness to different values of the properties. I agree with this intuition, given how much performance and safety issues seem to vary according to goal-directedness. But I wanted to make it explicit.</p><p>Reiterating the point of the post: goal-directedness is a property of behavior, not internal structure. By this I mean that given the complete behavior of a system over all environment, goal-directedness is independent of what&apos;s inside the system. Or equivalently, if two systems always behave in the same way, their goal-directedness is the same, regardless of if one contains a big lookup table and the other an homonculus.</p><p>This is not particularly original: Dennett&apos;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance\">intentional stance</a> pretty much says the same thing.  (The Intentional Stance, p 15)</p><blockquote>Then I will argue that any object -- or as I shall say, any system -- whose behavior is well predicted by this strategy [considering it as moving towards a goal] is in the fullest sense of the word a believer. What it is to be a true believer is to be an intentional system, a system whose behavior is reliably and voluminously predictable via the intentional strategy.</blockquote><p>Why write a post about it, then? I&apos;m basically saying that our definition should depend only on observable behavior, which is pretty obvious, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>Well, goal is a very loaded term. It is a part of the set of mental states we attribute to human beings, and other agents, but that we are reluctant to give to anything else. See how I never used the word &quot;agent&quot; before in this post, preferring &quot;system&quot; instead? That was me trying to limit this instinctive thinking about what&apos;s inside. And here is the reason why I think this post is not completely useless: when looking for a definition of goal-directedness, the first intuition is to look for the internal structure. It seems obvious that goals should be somewhere &quot;inside&quot; the system, and thus that what really matters is the internal structure.</p><p>But as we saw above, goal-directedness should probably depend only on the complete behavior of the system. That is not to say that the internal structure is not important or useful here. On the contrary, this structure, in the form of source code for example, is usually the only thing we have at our disposal. It serves to compute goal-directedness, instead of defining it.</p><p>We thus have this split:</p><ul><li>Defining goal-directedness: depends only on the complete behavior of the system, and probably assumes infinite compute and resources.</li><li>Computing goal-directedness: depends on the internal structure, and more specifically what information about the complete behavior can be extracted from this structure.</li></ul><p>What I see as a mistake here, a mistake I personally made, is to look for the definition in the internal structure. To look at some neural net, or some C program, and try to find where the goals are and what makes the program follow them. Instead, I think we should define and formalize goal-directedness from the ideal context of knowing the full behavior of the system, and then use interpretability and formal methods to extract what&apos;s relevant to this definition from the internal structure.</p><p><em>Thanks to J&#xE9;r&#xE9;my Perret for feedback on the writing, and to Joe Collman, Michele Campolo and Sabrina Tang for feedback on the idea.</em></p>",

One possible explanation for this behavior is that D is overfitting to the training set, memorizing training examples rather than learning some meaningful boundary between real and generated images. As a simple test for D’s memorization (related to Gulrajani et al. (2017)), we evaluate uncollapsed discriminators on the ImageNet training and validation sets, and measure what percentage of samples are classified as real or generated. While the training accuracy is consistently above 98%, the validation accuracy falls in the range of 50-55%, no better than random guessing (regardless of regularization strategy). This confirms that D is indeed memorizing the training set; we deem this in line with D’s role, which is not explicitly to generalize, but to distill the training data and provide a useful learning signal for G.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure how to interpret this.  The validation accuracy being close to 50% seems strange -- if the discriminator has 'memorized' the training set and has only seen training set vs generated images, why would it not guess close to 0% on things in the test set?  Presumably they are both 1. not-memorized and 2. not optimized to fool the discriminator like generated images are.  Maybe the post title is misleading, and we should think of this as \"discriminators generalize surprisingly well despite also 'memorizing' the training data.\"  (EDIT: See comment thread <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g9sQ2sj92Nus9DeKX/gan-discriminators-don-t-generalize?commentId=D9YY6vpaWMZzv5Cpj\">here</a> for clarification)</p>\n<p>Note that the discriminator has far fewer parameters than there are bytes to memorize, so it necessarily is performing some sort of (lossy) compression to do well on the training set.  Could we think of the generator as succeeding by exploiting patterns in the discriminator's compression, which the discriminator then works to obfuscate?  I would expect more obfuscation to put additional demands on the discriminator's capacity.  Maybe good generator task performance then comes from defeating simpler compression schemes, and it so happens that simple compression schemes are exactly what our visual system and GAN metrics are measuring.</p>\n<p>Does this indicate that datasets are still just too small?  Later in the same paper, they train on the much larger JFT-300M dataset (as opposed to ImageNet above) and mention:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, unlike models trained on ImageNet, where training tends to collapse without heavy regularization (Section 4), the models trained on JFT-300M remain stable over many hundreds of thousands of iterations. This suggests that moving beyond ImageNet to larger datasets may partially alleviate GAN stability issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They don't mention whether this also increases discriminator generalization or decreases training set accuracy, which I'd be interested to know.  I'd also be interested in connecting this story to mode collapse somehow.</p>\n</body></html>",

To see this, note that even when we have explained the performance of all the cognitive and behavioral functions in the vicinity of experience—perceptual discrimination, categorization, internal access, verbal report—there may still remain a further unanswered question: Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience? A simple explanation of the functions leaves this question open</p></blockquote><p>The idea goes that even if you explained how the brain does everything it does, you haven't explained why this <i>doing</i> is accompanied by subjective experience. It's rooted in this idea that subjective experience is somehow completely isolated from, and separate to behavior.</p><p>This supposed isolation is already a little suspicious to me. As Scott Aaronson points out in <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf\">Why Philosophers Should Care About Complexity Theory</a>, people judge each other to be conscious and capable of subjective experience after <i>very short</i> interactions. From a very short interaction with my desk I've concluded it doesn't have subjective experience. After a few years of interacting with my dog, I'm still on the fence on if it has subjective experience.</p><p>So when I hear a claim that \"subjective experience\" and \"qualia\" are divorced from any and all behavior or functionality in the mind, I'm left with a sense that Chalmers is talking about something very different from my subjective experience, and what it seems like to be me. My subjective experience seems <i>deeply integrated</i> with my behavior and functioning.</p><h1>Colors of Experience</h1><p>To explore this more, let's briefly look at a classic puzzler:</p><blockquote><p>What if everyone say different colors? What if when we looked at the sky, and the ocean, we both used the English word \"Blue\", but you <i>experienced</i> what I <i>experience</i> when I look at what we both agree is called \"Green\"? How would you even tell if this was the case?</p></blockquote><p>To talk about color, I'm first going to talk about Enums.</p><h2>Enums for Illumination</h2><p>Often when you code you assign \"values\" to \"variables\", where the \"value\" is the actual content that the computer works with, and the \"variable\" is a English word that you use to talk about the value.</p><pre><code>health = 12\nWHEN health LESS-THAN OR EQUAL-TO 0: PLAYER DIES</code></pre><p>In this pseudo-code example, you can see it matters what value the <code>health</code> variable has, because there's code that will do different things based on different values.</p><p>Most languages also have a thing called \"Enums\". Enums are like variables were you don't care what the value is. You just want a set of English words to be able to differentiate between different things. Another pseudo code example:</p><pre><code>Colors = Enum{RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, ORANGE, VIOLET}\n\nWHEN LIGHTWAVE IN RANGE(380nm,450nm): SEE Colors.VIOLET\nWHEN LIGHTWAVE IN RANGE(590nm,625nm): SEE Colors.ORANGE\n\nWHEN SEE Colors.ORANGE: FEEL HAPPY\nWHEN SEE Colors.VIOLET: FEEL COMPASSION</code></pre><p>Under the hood, an actual number will be substituted for each Enum. So <code>WHEN SEE Color.ORANGE: FEEL HAPPY</code> will become <code>WHEN SEE 15: FEEL HAPPY</code>. The computer still needs <i>some</i> value associate with <code>Colors.ORANGE</code> so that it can check if other values are equal to it. It's just that you don't care what the value is.</p><p>I bring up Enums because they are a very concrete example of a system where an entity only has meaning based on it's relationship to other things. Under the hood <code>Colors.ORANGE</code> might be assigned 2837, but that number doesn't capture the meaning of <code>Colors.ORANGE</code>. The meaning is encapsulated by it's relationship to other colors, and what visible lightwaves get associated with it, and what the rest of the code decides to do when it sees <code>Colors.ORANGE</code> as opposed to <code>Colors.PURPLE</code>.</p><h2>Color Swap</h2><p>Now let's use Enums as a model to think about the color problem. There are some ways that we could \"see different colors\" that would easily be discovered, and others that might not. Check this image: read the tables as \"when I see light in the wavelength of the right column, I have the experience I associate with the color in the left column. <strong>Normal</strong> is how we all see colors, and #1 and #2 are proposed ways that someone else could \"see colors differently\".</p><figure><img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fjacob%2FyPxV-dmgaT.png?alt=media&amp;token=387cd74c-6187-471b-a08e-c35258a33925\"></figure><p>If your vision worked like <strong>normal</strong> and mine worked like #2, it would be EASY to tell. My vision has a fundamentally different structure. If you saw a violent in the grass, I'd be insisting that the violet and the grass were the same color. Because the \"<i>shape</i>\" of my experience is fundamentally different from yours, we wouldn't even be able to agree on a consistent naming schema.</p><p>If your vision worked like <strong>normal</strong> and mine worked like #1, we could totally end up agreeing on names for different experiences. Since to both of us, light with wavelength in the range 380-450 nm feels like a cohesive thing, we could both end up calling that feeling \"red\", even if the subjective experiences were \"different\".</p><p>Thinking about this, I'm imagining as if colors work the same way as my Enums example. The \"code\" in our heads would treat the same sort of light in the same sorta way<a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/#/app/hazard_blog/page/FDDAZXkSw\">*</a>. We'd have similar regularities in our experience, because all of the \"code\" only uses <code>Colors.ORANGE</code> as a way to differentiate from other colors. In this metaphor, the concrete value of <code>Colors.ORANGE</code> (say, 44003) would be your qualia/subjective-experience. If everyone has more or less the same code for their color enums, everyone could have different concrete values associated with the same Enum, but it wouldn't effect anything that actually matters about color.</p><p>It does seem to be a thing that different cultures can have <a href=\"https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2017/10/02/different-cultures-see-different-colours/#:~:text=Well%2C%20it%20may%20have%20more,may%20have%20ten%20or%20more.\">quite different naming schemes for color experiences</a>, but I've never seen evidence that the fundamental \"shape\" of experience is different.</p><p>Well, that isn't quite true. As a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TbZnx8HfS2HQKbAiZ/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-thinks-meaning-is-isolated?commentId=kqmBDtLo5aNnmY92r\">djmoortex</a> pointed out in a comment, the experience of a color is deeply related to all of the associations you have with a color.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>There's a store i pass on my to work that I dislike because the red and blue LED display in its window fools me into thinking there's a pack of police cars there.</p></blockquote><p>So it seems like there's a part of people's experience of color (the fact that similar wavelengths feel similar, and far away wavelengths feel more distinct) that I expect is fairly uniform, and at the same time there's another important aspect of the experience of color (what associations you have to different colors, what they make you think and feel) which can vary wildly.</p><h1>Outro</h1><p>The more I think about qualia, the more I feel like the only meaning I can find in any of my subjective experiences is in how they relate to everything else in my head. It's the patters of what sorts of things out in the world lead to what sorts of subjective experience (different colors correspond to how hot something will get in the sun). It's the particular associations I have with different experiences (blue makes me think of a cool breeze). It's that certain subjective experiences imply others (I can normally tell if something will <i>feel</i> rough based on if it <i>looks</i> rough).</p><p>I'll admit, when I think about color this way, dwelling on how the meaning of \"red\" is deeply intertwined with the patterns of things I see as \"red\", I still feel like there is this \"extra\" thing I'm experiencing. The \"redness\" that is separate from all those connections and patterns. So I can see why one might still want to ponder and question this \"mysterious redness\".</p><p>Now, I do agree that there is in fact a \"problem\" that is the hard problem of consciousness (this comment explicates the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TbZnx8HfS2HQKbAiZ/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-thinks-meaning-is-isolated?commentId=4A3wmbPiXy22un2rQ\">ontological issues</a> involved). I don't think this post has \"dissolved the question\". It's just that I personally can't find any way to relate this isolated \"qualia of redness\" to anything else I care about. All of the meaning I find in my own experience is stuff that I can related to behavior and function, the \"easy\" problems of consciousness. Given that, I think I want to rename Chalmers' categories as the \"Boring\" (hard) and \"Interesting\" (easy) problem of consciousness.</p></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>New infections have been declining at an almost adequate pace (10% per\nweek?) in most parts of the US, and probably the rest of the developed\nworld.</p>\n<p>The overall reported new cases look more discouraging, for two reasons.</p>\n<p>One reason is the increase in testing. I estimate that two months ago, a\nbit less than 10% of new infections were being confirmed by tests, and I\nestimate that now it's above 20%, maybe getting close to 25%. That means\nthat if the new infection rate were unchanged, we'd be seeing a roughly\n10% per week increase in reported cases.</p>\n<p>Nearly all parts of the country have done a good deal better than that.</p>\n<p>I estimate the change in new infections since the early April peak by\nmultiplying the early April confirmed daily cases by 10 or 12, and the\nJune ones by 4 or 5, and I get a current rate that's about 1/4 to 1/3 of\nthe peak.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that there are some heavily populated areas for which\nthe trend doesn't look very good over the past few weeks. When the rate\nof new infections remains constant in some areas, but declines at\nexponential rates in others, the exponential declines stop affecting the\ntotal numbers before too long. E.g. much of California has suppressed\nthe pandemic, but a few cities, such as Los Angeles and Oakland, are\nenough to keep the state's total count of new infections steady.</p>\n<p>I'll base this analysis mostly on Alameda county, where I live. It looks\nlike new infections are coming heavily from low-income workers whose\njobs require them to meet many people. They presumably get infected on\nthe job, and also spread it within crowded homes.</p>\n<p>I presume a nontrivial number of new cases are being reported from\nnursing homes. That might just be because authorities have finally\ngotten around to massive testing of nursing homes. I presume that if the\nspread in nursing homes has not already been reduced, then the new\nreports will trigger some action to fix the problems there. But there\nare no videos of, say, <a href=\"https://hospitalinfection.org/index/rid-calls-on-the-cuomo-administration-to-withdraw-its-nursing-home-edict-before-it-causes-harm/\">Gov.\nCuomo</a>\ndirectly infecting nursing home residents, and maybe it's hard for the\nUS to do much about deaths that don't generate distinctive videos, so I\nstill have some mild worries here.</p>\n<p>I did a cursory check for other problem areas. Elevators? Two nearby\ncities, Emeryville and Albany, stand out as having a much larger\nfraction of high-rise apartment buildings. If elevators were an\nimportant source of infections, they'd have more cases than surrounding\ncities. Yet they have hardly any. That's clear enough evidence for me to\ndismiss that concern with a fair amount of confidence.</p>\n<p>How about subways? I haven't investigated very carefully. LA doesn't\nseem to have lots of people using subways, but it might still have\nenough to cause the infection levels that we're seeing. The SF bay area\nsubways were nearly empty for much of the spring, and that correlates\nsomewhat with relatively good results in San Francisco, but the Oakland\n/ Hayward area has much worse results, without having heavy subway use.\nI'm guessing based on that weak evidence that subway use isn't important\nenough for me to track down strong evidence.</p>\n<p>Where do these trends lead us?</p>\n<p>Increased testing, plus some rudimentary tracing, are likely just now\nstarting to produce some benefits. Testing apparently became available\nenough in the past week or so for authorities to do thorough testing of\nhigh risk populations. Even half-assed tracing will do more to focus\nattention on the important sources of new infections. In the land of the\nblind, the one-eyed man is king. The US has been, in some ways,\neffectively blind, and is just starting to get some eyesight.</p>\n<p>What fraction of these newly detected cases will be adequately isolated?\nEven if it's just 20%, and the testing has been increased enough in the\nhigh-risk populations to detect 70% of infections versus 20% that would\nhave been detected a month ago, then I expect the least successful\npopulations to go from infections increasing at 2%/week, to at least\ndeclining at 3%/week.</p>\n<p>Presumably it's hard for most of those people to isolate themselves, but\nlocal authorities have some ability to increase that isolation rate by\noffering free special-purpose housing and other support. Will many\nauthorities care enough? That depends a lot on how clear it is that\ndoing so is the only way to keep the local economy functioning. My guess\nis that it will be mostly pretty clear to them.</p>\n<p>Businesses seem to be reopening at a slightly faster pace than tests and\ntracing are ramping up. That increases the population of people in the\nstable or just barely increasing infection rate group. But they'll\nmostly be entering that group with lower infection levels than people\nwho never stayed home from high-risk jobs. So I don't see the reopening\nas creating much risk that actual infections will rise anywhere near as\nfast as test and trace will ramp up.</p>\n<p>So I'm cautiously optimistic that most businesses can reopen while still\nallowing us to decrease the rate of new infections. I'll estimate that a\n5% per week decrease is a fairly cautious goal. And since test and trace\nwill work better when infections are rarer, we could get a somewhat\nbetter than exponential decrease.</p>\n<p>That would leave us in September with, at worst, half the daily\ninfections we're getting today - say, no more than 50,000 per day for\nthe US (versus the 100,000 per day that I estimate to be happening now).</p>\n<p>Then sometime in the fall(?), a combination of the colder weather,\nincreased complacency and/or apathy, and frustration with masks and\nmodest distancing, will create the second wave. Some areas will contain\nit with more aggressive methods of isolating people who test positive. A\nsmaller number of areas will reimpose some sort of lockdown.</p>\n<p>I would like to end here on this optimistic note. Alas, it only analyzes\nthe effects of reopening the economy. I left out any the effects we\nshould expect from changes in social gatherings.</p>\n<p>Churches, protests, and probably large birthday parties are resuming.</p>\n<p>The protests won't last long enough to directly create any sustained\ntrend, but they set a conspicuous precedent which will encourage other\nsocial gatherings. I don't have much idea whether that effect will be\nsignificant.</p>\n<p>Churches and large birthday parties seem likely to have some lasting\neffects on the infection trends. They can be done responsibly, but there\nare significant social benefits to including singing in enclosed spaces.\nChurches in particular will feel some temptation to recreate the\nconditions that are likely to create superspreader events.</p>\n<p>Many churches will remain scared enough to\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/should-we-reopen-churches-38428619a174\">avoid</a>\nriskier practices. Many others will be in areas where infection rates\nare low enough that they can maybe get away with going back to normal.\nYet the riskiest 2% of churches could still generate many new\ninfections, maybe more than can be handled by the test and trace systems\nthat we're likely to get.</p>\n<p>Maybe the churches in the riskiest places are the ones who know that\nthey can't rely on\n<a href=\"https://politics.theonion.com/smart-qualified-people-behind-the-scenes-keeping-ameri-1819571706\">experts</a>\nto make the world safe for them, and they'll decide on their own to take\nplenty of precautions. Or maybe testing will become sufficient to\nquickly detect and isolate new breakouts (currently, upticks in new\ncases are hard to evaluate, because they often just reflect increased\ntesting). I don't see how to get good information on these issues.</p>\n<p>I'm left with a disturbingly large degree of uncertainty.</p>\n<h3>Other thoughts</h3>\n<p>I'm becoming more optimistic about getting a vaccine by about next\nsummer. One piece of evidence that's been neglected is that other\ncoronaviruses do have commercially available vaccines. Somehow they get\nneglected because they're for <a href=\"https://www.intvetvaccnet.co.uk/blog/covid-19/lessons-veterinary-coronaviruses\">pets and\nlivestock</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.treatearly.org/what-you-need-to-know\">Treat Early</a> has some\nambitious hopes of testing treatments in pre-symptomatic patients. My\ninitial reaction was that they had little hope of finding infected\npatients soon enough for that to work. But now I see\n<a href=\"https://wvumedicine.org/news/article/wvu-rockefeller-neuroscience-institute-announces-capability-to-predict-covid-19-related-symptoms-up-/\">reports</a>\nthat an app that uses the Oura can detect COVID-19 3 days before\nsymptoms develop. That leads me to think this deserves further\nattention.</p>\n<p>The US government is only making\n<a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/06/operation-warp-speed-needs-to-go-to-warp-10.html\">half-hearted</a>\n<a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/06/fight-the-virus.html\">attempts</a>\nto encourage vaccine creation, and <a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/what-we-would-now-know-if-demagogues-didnt-rule-every-country-on-earth/\">even\nless</a>\non understanding the pandemic.</p>\n<p>We have a bipartisan consensus that it's more important to transfer\nmoney to some affected by the pandemic than to prevent new infections.\nMost politicians have decided that preventing new infections is\napproximately priority number 3, and are busy fighting about whether\nenemy number 1 is racism or lockdowns.</p>\n<p>Part of why the stock market is doing well this spring is that there was\na concerted effort to convince people that the pandemic is harmful, in\norder to get them to stay home. And since GDP is good, a harmful\npandemic must be associated with a decline in GDP. So it became part of\nthe pandemic-fighting strategy to convince people that a terrible\ndecline in GDP was inevitable. Or maybe people decided to measure the\nbenefits of policies by how much they cost. Or assumed that unemployment\ncauses depressions, when the causality mostly goes in the other\ndirection. At any rate, there was widespread pressure to believe the\nworst. Now it's becoming hard for the storytellers to ignore the\nevidence of recovery, and many people have gotten tired of scaring each\nother into taking the pandemic seriously.</p>\n<p>Friday's market rally felt weird. It seemed like a large number of\ninvestors suddenly realized that the headlines had been misleading them,\nand that there isn't much reason to expect a depression (unless what\nhappened in March/April qualifies as a depression). Yet at least half\nthe stocks had already rebounded enough before Friday to reflect a\nreturn to near-normal GDP levels.</p>\n<p>That still left a fair amount of room for some of the harder-hit stocks\nto soar (e.g. airline stocks and Hertz that had been depressed by panic\nselling from Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn). But the rally in the\naverage stock has gone far enough that I switched on Friday from being\nbullish on the market, to being confused.</p>\n</body></html>",

Would this be helpful as an introduction to the literature of a new field of study?</p><h1><strong>The problem</strong></h1><p>Almost every research project in academia or industry involves phases of literature review. Many times we find an interesting paper, and we&#x2019;d like to:</p><ul><li>Find different methods and approaches to the same subject</li><li>Track down the state of the art research in the field</li><li>Identify seminal works and background reading</li><li>Explore and immerse ourselves in the topic and become aware of the trends and dynamics in the literature</li></ul><p>Previously, the best ways to do this were to browse reference lists, or hope to find good keywords in textual search engines and databases.</p><h1><strong>Enter Connected Papers</strong></h1><p>It started as a side project between friends. We&#x2019;ve felt the pains of academic literature review and exploration for years and kept thinking about how to solve it.</p><p>For the past year we&#x2019;ve been meeting on weekends and prototyping a tool that would allow a very different type of search process for academic papers. When we saw how much it improved our own research and development workflows &#x2014; and got increasingly more requests from friends and colleagues to use it &#x2014; we committed to release it to the public.</p><p>You know&#x2026; for science.</p><h2><strong>So how does it work?</strong></h2><p>Connected Papers is not a citation tree. Those have been done before.<br>In our graph, papers are arranged according to their similarity. That means that even papers that do not directly cite each other can be strongly connected and positioned close to each other in the graph.</p><p>To get a bit technical, our similarity is based primarily on the concepts of <em>co-citation</em> and <em>bibliographic coupling</em> (aka co-reference). According to this measure, two papers that have highly overlapping citations and references are presumed to have a higher chance of treating a related subject matter.  </p><h2><strong>Reading the graph</strong></h2><p>Our graph is designed to make the important and relevant papers pop out immediately</p><p>With our layout algorithm, similar papers cluster together in space and are connected by stronger lines (edges). Popular papers (that are frequently cited) are represented by bigger circles (nodes) and more recent papers are represented by a darker color.</p><p>So for example, finding an important new paper in your field is as easy as identifying the dark large node at the center of a big cluster.</p><h2><strong>List view</strong></h2><p>In some cases it is convenient to work with just a list of connected papers. For these occasions, we&#x2019;ve built the List view which you can access by clicking &#x201C;Expand&#x201D; at the top of the left panel. Here you can view additional paper details as well as sort and filter them according to various properties.</p><h2><strong>Prior and derivative works</strong></h2><p>The Prior works feature lists the top common ancestral papers for the connected papers in the graph. It usually includes <strong>seminal works</strong> in the field that heavily influenced the next generation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Derivative works feature is the opposite: it shows a list of common descendants of the papers in the graph. It usually includes relevant <strong>state of the art</strong> papers or <strong>systematic reviews and meta-analyses in</strong> the field.</p><p>We have found these features to be especially useful when we have a paper from one era of research and we would like to be directed to the preceding and succeeding generations of research on the same topic</p><h1><strong>Help us spread the word</strong></h1><p>Connected Papers will only grow by word of mouth. <strong>Please share</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.connectedpapers.com/\">Connected Papers</a></strong> <strong>in your scientific community!</strong></p><p>We are very eager to see how the broader academic community adopts and responds to this tool. We welcome all forms of feedback and would love to brainstorm together about how it can further evolve and improve.</p>",

This post is meant to be part of a series that explores the ideas in samzdat's </i><a href=\"https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/\"><i>The Uruk Series</i></a><i>, and it also serves as a standalone introduction to the idea of legibility.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first book that Lou rings in is <i>Seeing Like a State</i> by James C. Scott, and with it comes the ideas of <i>Legibility</i> and <i>High Modernism</i>. High Modernism is a movement/aesthetic/frame-of-mind that peaked around the middle of the 1900's (the shadow of which, we still live in), and legibility refers to the more abstract process that High Modernism represents.</p><p>Lou is mostly in the game of connecting the dots, and in introducing legibility he skips over a lot of the juicy details that appear in the book. I'd recommend Scott Alexander's book review of Seeing Like a State if you want to recover a lot of the concrete examples that ground out Lou's more abstract points. If you want the shortest possible intro to legibility and High Modernism, check out the ribbonfarm post on it. If all of those sound like too much reading, here's some highlights from all sources.</p><blockquote><p>Here is the recipe:</p><ol><li>Look at a complex and confusing reality, such as the social dynamics of an old city</li><li>Fail to understand all the subtleties of how the complex reality works</li><li>Attribute that failure to the irrationality of what you are looking at, rather than your own limitations</li><li>Come up with an idealized blank-slate vision of what that reality&nbsp;<i>ought&nbsp;</i>to look like</li><li>Argue that the relative simplicity and platonic&nbsp;<i>orderliness&nbsp;</i>of the vision represents rationality</li><li>Use authoritarian power to impose that vision, by demolishing the old reality if necessary</li><li>Watch your rational Utopia fail horribly</li></ol></blockquote><p>From Scott Alexander:</p><blockquote><p>The first part of the story is High Modernism, an aesthetic taste masquerading as a scientific philosophy. The High Modernists claimed to be about figuring out the most efficient and high-tech way of doing things, but most of them knew little relevant math or science and were basically just LARPing being rational by placing things in evenly-spaced rectangular grids.</p></blockquote><p>James C. Scott himself describing High Modernism:</p><blockquote><p><i>A strong, one might even say muscle-bound, version of the self-confidence about scientific and technical progress, the expansion of production, the growing satisfaction of human needs, the mastery of nature (including human nature), and above all, the rational design of social order commensurate with the scientific understanding of natural laws.</i></p></blockquote><p>A definition that Scott Alexander responds to:</p><blockquote><p>[<i>insert James's C. Scott's definition</i>] …which is just a&nbsp;<i>bit</i>&nbsp;academic-ese for me. An extensional definition might work better: standardization, Henry Ford, the factory as metaphor for the best way to run everything, conquest of nature, New Soviet Man, people with college degrees knowing better than you, wiping away the foolish irrational traditions of the past, Brave New World, everyone living in dormitories and eating exactly 2000 calories of Standardized Food Product (TM) per day, anything that is For Your Own Good, gleaming modernist skyscrapers, The X Of The Future, complaints that the unenlightened masses are resisting The X Of The Future, demands that if the unenlightened masses reject The X Of The Future they must be re-educated For Their Own Good, and (of course) evenly-spaced rectangular grids.</p></blockquote><p>Let's take a step back for a moment. It's easy to make the mistake of simplifying this to \"Any government or top-down authority trying to change something is going to end up making things worse.\" That's why I'd really recommend reading Scott Alexander's post, so you can become familiar with the specific historical examples that ground this idea. James C. Scott and Lou both acknowledge that plenty of awesome things have come from some top-down plans (some of the urban planning that made it harder to be social in a city also made it less cramped and disease ridden)</p><p>The thing that Lou seems to be worried about is less any given decision that's made, but how decisions made through the lens of legibility cannot understand illegible counter arguments.</p><p>Some quotes from Lou:</p><blockquote><p>At the same time, my concerns are not merely with the science we have (especially psychology, but w/e). I think a lot of the problem &nbsp;comes from “legibility” itself. Namely – legibility is a kind of&nbsp;__language__, and so any resistance that isn’t in it will look crazy. At best, that means we ignore it (now). But at worst, and especially with the assumption that we “know everything now” (implicitly or explicitly), that enables us to just&nbsp;<i>do the exact same thing again.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>another one:</p><blockquote><p>The only way that I can see that one would is if there’s a genuine admission of ignorance on the part of the “scientists”. Even reconsidering one’s position requires some kind of counter-argument, and the problem here is that the counter-argument&nbsp;doesn’t make sense in the language of the scientists. Indeed – a solid counterargument requires some kind of power (you’re not going to listen to some random guy on the street &nbsp;screaming about [whatever]), but legibility inherently reduces that power.</p></blockquote><p>and one last quote:</p><blockquote><p>Legibility is a process of power, but it’s also a channel for it. People with epistemic knowledge can argue within civil society using it, but those outside cannot.The kinds of argument they make might be translatable, but they won’t know how to translate them (if we even have the rational knowledge to do so). Given that&nbsp;__when__&nbsp;power crushes someone, it&nbsp;__tends__&nbsp;to crush the powerless, we have a pretty serious problem: no one with power will even understand the powerless&nbsp;when they are being crushed.</p></blockquote><p>This might confuse you if you equated legible with \"something a very clever person could understand.\" As Scott Alexander pointed out, it's more about wanting everything to conform to a specific aesthetic formatting, than it's about peak human intelligence/rationality.</p><p>The problem isn't that top down planners are going \"Look, we've got this new urban design, and we know it will have some negative effects on how easy it is for people to socialize with their neighbors, but overall it should increase life expectancy by 10 years, so we think it's worth it.\" The problem is that it doesn't even look like a trade off in the eyes of legibility. \"We made a great plan to increase life expectancy that has no downsides, and oh yeah, the plebs are complaining about 'friendship' or something, but they don't have any studies so why listen to them?\"</p><p>Given all that, what happens if we don't have legible ways to quantify some of the aspect of life that are most important to people? (love, happiness, meaning, friendship, belonging, etc) That's what Lou spends a lot of the rest of the series exploring.</p></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><span>\n\n</span>\n\n<i>Note: this is based on my experience with my two kids, currently\nfour and six.  It may not generalize as much as I think it does.</i>\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\nPeople start out dependent on their parents for food, changing,\ncontact, motion, and even sleep timing.  Typically they end up as\nadults, no longer dependent on their parents at all. Part of my\napproach to parenting has been that I want to let my kids be as\nindependent as possible, as early as possible.  Not only does\nit make their lives better, because they can meet their own needs how\nthey want, but it makes my life easier, because they can handle more\non their own.  Sometimes this involves a bit more effort up front, but\nI think it's substantially less effort in total.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nExamples:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>If <a href=\"https://www.lilywise.com/\">Lily</a> (6y) comes to\nme and says \"<a href=\"https://www.annakaufmanwise.com/\">Anna</a> (4y)\npushed me,\" my first response will probably be \"have you talked to\nAnna?\"  I'll still help some, often by listening to them negotiate and\nclarifying rules (\"you can't push people, even when they happen to be\nbetween you and your desired toy\") but over time they've gotten much\nbetter at this.  There's a whole post worth of thoughts that could go\nhere on what's worked and what hasn't, but at this point they can get\nup an hour before we do and (nearly always) resolve their own\nconflicts without waking us.</p></li>\n\n<li>\n<p>The kids will often ask for help while I'm cooking.  If I'm in\nthe middle of something, which I usually am, I'll say something like\n\"I can help you as soon as I finish mixing this\".  During that time\nthey're often able to solve their own problem.  If they do still need\nhelp when I'm ready, they get my full attention.  This is acting as a\ncost, paying with their time, which filters their requests so I only\nget the ones where it's worth it to them.  And then while they're\nbored waiting for me they'll often try a bit harder at doing up the\nsnaps on their shirt or whatever, and often that extra focused effort\nis what they need to do it on their own.\n\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, when Anna was learning to ride her trike and she got to a\nsidewalk bump that was hard to pedal over, she would call for help.  I\nfound that if I walked far enough behind her she would keep trying\nwhile she waited for me to catch up, and then often didn't need me by\nthe time I was there.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><p>If I hear crying, I don't automatically do something about it.\nAs I was writing this post I heard Anna get up.  Then I heard some\ncrying.  Not \"I've been badly hurt crying\" but some sort of\nfrustration.  It didn't last very long, and I didn't move, just\nlistening.  A few minutes later Anna came down and said good morning.\nShe had a lot she wanted to tell me about the clothes she had picked\nout.  When she was done I asked what they crying had been, and whether\nshe was ok, and she said that Lily hadn't been willing to come out and\nplay with her even though her bedroom light was on.  I clarified\n(again... this one keeps coming up) that Lily isn't required to play\nwith her, and that even if someone's light is on that doesn't\nnecessarily mean they want to come out of their room and get up.  Then\nwe cuddled up and read a book together.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>When the kids started being able to climb things, I would spot\nthem.  Often they wanted me to lift them or support them in their\nclimbing, and I wouldn't.  They would also want to be lifted down at\nthe end, but the rule would be \"if you can climb up, you can climb\ndown.\"  I was willing to give them advice or guide their foot when\nthey couldn't see where to place it, but they still needed to do the\nclimbing.  At this point I'll spot them if they ask me to, or maybe\nsay things like \"if you're going to climb that high you need to find\nan adult to spot you.\"  With tree climbing I'm willing to be a\nstepstool if asked, but I won't lift them.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Recently Lily dropped her fork, and asked me to pick it up.  I\nsaid that this seemed like the sort of thing she could do?  Anna\nvolunteered to pick it up for her, and was very happy to be helpful.\nThis wasn't what I was going for, but a different nice outcome.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>I was out with both kids, and Lily wanted to go home while Anna\nwanted to keep picking dandelions.  We were on our block, around the\ncorner from our house.  Lily and I talked about how she could go home:\nshe would walk home (no street crossings needed and she knew where to\ngo) and ring the doorbell.  If someone let her in she was set,\notherwise she would walk back to where I was.  After Lily set off I\nposted in the house chat that Lily would be ringing the doorbell soon,\nand once Lily was inside Julia replied to let me know.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We noticed that Anna kept giving or trading things to Lily, and\nthen regretting it.  For example, she gave Lily an elephant stuffy she\ngot for her birthday, and then talked for months about how she was sad\nand wished it were still hers.  We talked to Lily about this, and told\nthe kids that any gifts Anna made were provisional, and she had three\ndays to change her mind.  We also told them that if they wanted to\nmake permanent trades they needed to bring the proposed trade to a\ngrownup first, who could jog Anna's memory (\"Anna, do you remember how\nyou felt when you...\") and make sure they really wanted to go through\nwith it.  I think the first rule never ended up getting used, and the\nsecond rule got used maybe once?  We've since let both rules fade\naway.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>When the kids were little they would sometimes ask for a drink\nof water in the middle of the night.  As soon as they were old enough\nthat we trusted they wouldn't spill it, we gave them sippy cups of\nwater to keep by their beds.  The changed the frequent \"I'm thirsty\"\nfor the less frequent \"my water cup is empty.\"  And, better, they\nstarted checking their cup when going to bed, usually telling us when\nit was running out.  A few weeks ago Anna woke us up, for the\nfirst time in a while: her cup was empty.  I told her I wouldn't fill\nher cup, but described how she could get a drink from the bathroom.\nShe was mad that I wouldn't do it for her, but after I went back to\nbed I heard her walk out, get a drink, and go back to bed.  She hasn't\nwoken us since.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>About a year ago I brought Lily to an <a href=\"https://www.lilywise.com/amusement\">amusement park</a>.  Near\nthe end of the day there was a roller coaster she wanted to go on, but\nit was too scary for me, so I told her I wouldn't go on it with her.\nShe asked if she could go on it by herself, but you needed to be 48\" to\nride alone.  She told me she was going to find someone else to ride\nwith her, and I didn't object.  She wandered a bit with me until she\nidentified someone who I think she thought was sufficiently\nnon-threatening (middle-aged woman hanging out with family) and\nLily asked me if I would be willing to ask on her behalf.  I declined,\nexpecting Lily would be too shy, but Lily went up, explained the\nsituation, and asked if they would go with her.  They were a bit\nconfused, confirmed the situation with me, asked me if I was ok with\nit, and I emphasised that it really was fine if they said no.  They\ndecided to do it, and as far as I could tell both had a really good\ntime.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>When Lily was ~1.5, she was just learning to walk and was standing at the top of a short flight of stairs. I was below her, in a place where I could catch her if she fell, but as she continued looking around and seeming stable I started playing my mandolin which I was wearing on a strap. I wasn't expecting she would fall, but she did, and while I dropped the mandolin and went to catch her I didn't get her fully and she bonked her chin. She lost two teeth, and I'm sure it hurt a lot. This is probably the event I most regret in parenting so far, and pushed me in the more cautious direction.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>As soon as our kids could walk we started teaching them <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/street-training\">how to stay out of the street</a>.  This was\nsome work, but when we fully trusted that they would stop at the\ncorner they gained the freedom to run ahead on their own.  When they\nwere little I couldn't let them get too far ahead, though, or other\nadults who didn't know that these particular kids knew to stay out of\nthe street would get worried and try to protect them.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Our house has big heavy doors, which means the kids can't get\nout by themselves.  I made a <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/kid-door\">kid door</a> out to\nthe back yard, and put kid-height railings on the steps.  Now if they\nwant to go outside on their own they can.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>One time we couldn't find Lily.  We looked all over the house,\nand she was just not there.  When I saw the kid door was unlocked,\nthat told me she'd gone out, but then she wasn't in the back yard.\nApparently she'd left?  This was very unlike her, and we were worried,\nthough I knew she wouldn't have gone far since she wouldn't cross any\nstreets.  I started to run around the block, and just as I'd gone\naround the first corner I saw Lily happily running from the other\ndirection.  She'd decided she'd like to run around the block on her\nown as an adventure.  I talked with her about how it wasn't ok to go\noff on her own like that yet, and next time she should check in with a\ngrownup first.  When we put in the kid door I should have been clearer\nwith them about how they needed to stay in our yard.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Lily asked me if she could cut her own hair, and I explained\nthat kids who cut their own hair generally end up with hair they're\nunhappy with.  She asked if I would cut it; I declined.  She asked our\nhousemate Ruthie if she would cut it, Ruthie checked with me (\"it's\nLily's hair, so it's fine with me\") and Ruthie gave her a nice cut\nthat Lily was very happy with.  Julia was out at the time, and when\nshe came home she was upset that I had let Lily cut her hair on a\nwhim.  Asking her now she wrote, \"I'm less in favor of giving the kids\nfree rein here because I think it's important to make sure any\nlong-lasting choices are made in an informed way, and I don't think\nanyone made sure Lily understood that for the next several months she\nwouldn't be able to do some of the hairstyles she sometimes\nrequested. I also likely would have required a waiting period of a\nweek or two to see if she still wanted it. As someone who hated\nspending third grade growing out my bangs, the possible downside of\nhaircut decisions is more salient to me than it is to Jeff.\"\nAfterwards, we talked for a while trying to find other places where we\nmight have similar disagreements about what to let the kids do\n(tattos?  piercings?  cutting up their clothes?)  This is a good\nillustration of how it's important to be on the same page as your\npartner about what you're ok with letting the kids do.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Anna and I were out with her trike, and she asked me to carry\nit home for her.  We weren't very far from the house, and I declined.\nShe said she was just going to leave it there.  I told her that if she\nleft the trike it would be available for anyone to take.  And that I\nwould probably take it, but it would then be my trike.  She decided to\nride her trike home.</p></li>\n\n<li>\n<p>When we started wearing covid masks, the kids didn't want them.\nI explained that the recommendations had changed, we were trying to\nhelp build a norm of mask-wearing, masks keep people from spreading\ntheir germs, and even our family could have the coronavirus without\nrealizing yet.  This was enough for Lily, who's pretty pro-social, but\nAnna didn't like having something on her face.  I told her that if she\nwasn't willing to wear a mask she'd have to stay on our property,\nwhich meant inside or in the back yard.  She initially (firmly!) said\nshe was fine with that, but when she realized this meant she wouldn't\nbe able to ride her trike around the block she changed her mind and\nasked me to help her put her mask on.\n\n</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, when wearing masks was routine, Anna was\nstill asking us to put her's on each time.  I thought she could\nprobably start doing it for herself, when she next asked if I'd put it\non her I said \"can you do it?\"  She said no.  I said that I\nthought she was big enough to do it herself, and that I was still\nwilling to do it I needed her to try doing it herself first.  With a\nbit of coaching (one ear, then the other) she got it on without any\nother help from me.  She was so proud!  Since then she's managed it\nherself every time.\n\n</p>\n<p>This morning I was out with the kids and I noticed that Anna's\nmask was around her neck.  \"Anna, your mask?\" \"Papa, I'm doing the\nhoneysuckle, and my mask gets in the way.\" \"Ok, as long as you put it\nright back on when you're done.\"</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><p>I rarely tell the kids \"no\".  Instead, if it's something that I\ndon't think is a good idea or won't work, I explain why.  \"The last\ntime you climbed a tree not wearing pants you scraped your legs a lot,\nand were pretty sad about it.\" \"If you want to use a sharp needle\nyou'll need to find an adult who's willing to supervise so you don't\nstab yourself.\" \"If you <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/helping-lily-make-dinner\">sign up\nto cook dinner</a> you need to make sure you prepare enough food for\neveryone, with food everyone can eat.\" \"If you want make that much of\na mess you'll need to find a grownup who'll commit to cleaning up if\nyou don't.\"</p></li>\n\n<li><p>There are still some hard constraints.  They have to go through\ntheir bedtime routine and go to bed.  They have to sit at the table\nfor their meals (though we don't make them eat, just spend at least\n10min in front of their food).  We try to make these <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/predictable-parenting\">really</a> <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/how-to-parent-more-predictably\">predictable</a>, and we'll\nuse counting and timeouts if they're not following them.  Any\nconsequence we're imposing should happen as quickly as possible,\nbecause that lets you use much weaker consequences for the same amount\nof behavior change.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nSome common threads:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>I'm willing to invest large amounts of time in teaching and\nadvice, but won't do things for them unless I'm pretty sure they can't\ndo it themselves.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>I'm happy to talk in detail about why we do things the way we\ndo, and am open to being convinced in cases where they think the rules\nshould be different.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>I want them to be practicing making decisions and living with\nthe consequences, but not beyond what's currently safe for them or\nbeyond what they can productively learn from. When I think they're\nmaking a bad decision I'll try to bring up information I think they're\noverlooking, but I'll only very rarely take the choice away from\nthem.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>I let them solve their own problems, and let them practice\nfiguring out when to bring in help.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI have three main motivations here.  The first is teaching: eventually\nthey'll need to make good decisions on their own, and the sooner they\nstart the more practice they'll be able to get.  The second is a kind\nof long-term laziness: once they can do things for themselves it's\nless work for me.  And the third is respect: they're people and as\nmuch as possible they should get to choose how their lives go.\n\n  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Berkeley recently introduced a rule where:</p><ul><li>You always wear a mask within 30' of people, except...</li><li>You can have a 12-person \"Quarantine Social Bubble\" of people who interact with each other normally.</li><li>You can rotate people in your Social Bubble every three weeks.</li></ul><p>I think these are the sensible longterm rules, for people who can coordinate well.&nbsp;</p><p>I think most people can't coordinate well, but it was the right decision for Berkeley to make this the rule, because it <i>is</i> actually the obvious Schelling Rule, and people would probably rebel and say \"fuck it\" if they couldn't do this.</p><p>But, I am quite worried about it anyway.</p><p><strong>If people get excited about rotating social bubbles, they may screw up and hurt themselves or people they care about. </strong>Even if they're smart people who know better.</p><p>Twelve people is a lot, and it only takes one roommate or friend who didn't communicate clearly, or took an extra risk without telling everyone, to ruin things for everyone.</p><p>I think there are some very important norms about honesty, reliability, and clarity that are <i>very essential</i> to have, if you want to be able to have social-bubbles without risking harm to yourself, your friends and the broader local community.</p><p>I don't think we currently have those norms, and they are hard to create from scratch. Creating them will be <i>uncomfortable</i>.</p><p>It needs to be common, and acceptable, to ask someone \"Hey, have you interacted with any non-social-bubble people without a mask? Even for a little bit? Are you <i>sure</i>? Are you confident that all the other people you interacted with <i>also</i> haven't interacted with people without masks? How do you know? Did you ask them?\"</p><p>Different people have different risk tolerances, and different beliefs about what actions are risky. But it has to be possible to say:</p><p>\"Alas. I understand this is hard, and you (or your roommate) are trying your best in a difficult time, but [Action X] means that I won't be interacting with you or the people in your social bubble for another 3 weeks. I still care about you as a friend but it's important for me and my other roommates to stay safe.\"</p><p>I *hope* that people can do all that with compassion. I hope people actually cultivate the skillset of being firm, but empathetic. But, if you <i>don't</i> have the skills of being firm, and willing-to-ask-direct-questions, and empathetic all at once, I'm willing to go on record saying:</p><p>&nbsp;If you can't do all three, empathy is the one you have to drop,</p><p>This is really important.</p><p>This will suck. It will be hard on people psychologically. It's hard to say \"I'm not willing to hang out with you\" without it coming across as a harsh social judgment, <i>even</i> if you specifically say \"it's not a social judgment, just a practicality.\"</p><p>It's nonetheless important to do it anyway, and to hope over time we learn to internalize a new set of norms, where a) people are much more careful, upfront and direct about their practices, b) we are firm about expecting others to do the same, c) we do that while respecting each other as friends and community members trying their best to make it through a difficult time</p><p>I think for a given social bubble to actually be safe, every person will need to have talked to every other person about their quarantine practices, so they can make an informed choice together about what risks to take. They need to communicate clearly with <i>everyone</i> in the bubble about any exceptions they make.</p><p>That's a pretty big overhead for establishing a bubble. It means that I think it probably <i>doesn't</i> make sense to rotate bubbles willy-nilly. Each rotated bubble, to actually be safe, requires all that communication overhead all over again.</p><p>Rotating social bubbles is an important tool to ensure people's social and emotional lives can thrive in the upcoming year, but doing so responsibility is quite difficult. Even maintaining a single social bubble responsibly is quite difficult.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tolerating Rudeness</h2><p>I'm reminded of <a href=\"https://celandine13.livejournal.com/72711.html\">Sarah Constantin's Hierarchy of Requests</a> (where level 1 is \"too paralyzed to even ask for something\", level 2 is \"you ask rudely\", level 3 is \"you ask nicely\", and level 4 is \"you subtly maneuver things such that people do the thing without you asking.)<br><br>In quarantine, I'm worried that the skill of asking \"did you see anyone without a mask? Did you visit someone's house? etc\" is something most people will be too paralyzed to ask. Eventually I hope we will be able to ask nicely, or that everyone will proactively volunteer information with each other.<br><br>But meanwhile, to establish the norm, it is important that we be able to ask rudely, while we practice the skill.</p><p>(If I ask you rudely, I apologize in advance)</p><p>I'm sure there are some people reading this who are struggling desperately to hold themselves together, who are worried about a social world with lots of rules that they won't always be able to live up to. This is a real cost and it sucks terribly.</p><p>But, this is really important.</p><p>Sometimes the world just dumps a bunch of terrible crap on us, and it's our responsibility to work together, to find the least bad options, and help each other through them as best we can.</p></body></html>",

Greatly inspired by a lot of the stuff in Kaj's </i><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip\"><i>Multi-Agent Models of the Mind Sequence</i></a></p><p>This first paragraph of a recent SlateStarCodex post:</p><blockquote><p>Julian Jaynes’&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZZUR1K\">The Origin Of Consciousness In The Breakdown Of The Bicameral Mind</a>&nbsp;is a brilliant book, with only two minor flaws. First, that it purports to explains the origin of consciousness. And second, that it posits a breakdown of the bicameral mind. I think it’s possible to route around these flaws while keeping the thesis otherwise intact. So I’m going to start by reviewing a slightly different book, the one Jaynes should have written. Then I’ll talk about the more dubious one he actually wrote.</p></blockquote><p>Nice job beautifully capturing my love of, and frustration with, this book. Jaynes has so many wild and exciting ideas and most of them are <i>really weird</i>. Not weird as in code for \"stupid or wrong\", but weird as in being so far outside what you thought the realm of possibility was that you're left sorta scratching your head.</p><p>One paragraph summary of Jaynes' book: consciousness is learned, not innate. From the development of language up till the Bronze Age Collapse people were directed around by the voices of the god's which they heard in their heads and would have conversations with and this was perfectly normal. The gods were <i>neurologically real</i> in the sense that cultural expectations allowed people to experience the thoughts that their right hemisphere produced as hallucinated voices that they attributed to the gods. Eventually writing, trading, and the collapse of most civilizations began to break down this bicameral mind, and modern consciousness (were \"you\" are in control and think things with your mind) came about.</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>... wut?</p><p>I can already tell that \"the gods were real, but not like in a supernatural way, like in a uniform auditory hallucinations across populations way\" is <i>weird</i> enough to knock most people off their game. Scott's post does a great job of trying to across this one piece of weirdness by recasting Jaynes' takes in terms of \"Theory of mind\". If you're hung up on gods being real, I'd recommend it as a Minimum Viable Explanation. Kevin Simler has a <a href=\"https://meltingasphalt.com/mr-jaynes-wild-ride/\">great series</a> that delves more into the guts of this space.</p><p>That being said, I'm not writing this post to talk about auditory hallucinations or the idea that the gods were a real part of everyday life for thousands of years. I'm here to talk about consciousness. One of the problems with <i>Origin</i> is that there's 4+ interesting out-there big ideas in it, but \"people literally hallucinated the voices of god all day long\" is just <i>so fucking weird</i> that it forms a weirdness black hole that sucks everything else into it. Though I like Scott's gloss using theory of mind, it throws away the ideas that were most interesting to me.</p><p>It's understandable. As Scott points out, there's a lot of ideas, experiences and concepts all bundled under \"consciousness\", and Jaynes does a C+ job of sorting them apart. That's part of what frustrates me about the book. I owe a lot of my recent lines of thinking to Jaynes, but I'm also not sure if he'd even agree with my new takes. This means that I'm not going to talk about god-voices, and I'm not even necessarily going to try and defend Jaynes' point of view (because I disagree with it, find it confusing at various points)</p><p>This post is going to be an exploration of ideas built off of Jaynes' initial, \"What if consciousness is a metaphorical construction?\" From Jaynes:</p><blockquote><p>\"The conscious mind is a spatial analog of the world and mental acts are analogs of bodily acts. Consciousness operates only on objectively observable things. Or, to say it another way with echoes of John Locke, <strong>there is nothing in consciousness that is not an analog of something that was in behavior first.</strong>\"</p></blockquote><p>(note: Since the 70's, when Jaynes' book came out, there's been a lot more awesome research on consciousness, so the picture I'm painting will look a good bit different from his)</p><p>Translating into my own phrasing, the big thesis is: <strong>The contents of consciousness are constructed via metaphor</strong>.</p><p>It was hard for me to wrap my head around what this could even mean, let alone figure out if I thought it was true, so don't feel bad if this makes no sense yet. My first task is going to be helping build an understanding of what \"consciousness\" being \"constructed\" via \"metaphors\" could even mean.</p><p>(other note: I'm going to be putting lot's of words in quotes. Generally, this will be to highlight that I'm appealing to the ever-day intuitive understanding of a concept, while acknowledging that said understanding probably isn't a good literal description of what is happening.)</p><p>Let's go!</p><h1>\"The Contents of Consciousness\"</h1><figure><img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fjacob%2FbGVFq4fHhp.png?alt=media&amp;token=cd994d69-8576-48ec-9317-3d30dabe6e5a\"></figure><p>I'm going to explore consciousness as a verb, in a way that's mostly synonymous with \"awareness\". Ex:</p><p><i>\"I was conscious of a weird tremor in the ground\"</i></p><p><i>\"I am aware of thoughts about dinner\"</i></p><p>Breaking down consciousness as a verb you have the <strong>subject</strong> (some flavor of \"you\") <strong>is conscious</strong> of <strong>something</strong>, and these somethings can be internal or external. You can be aware of a fly darting back and forth and you can be aware of thoughts darting back and forth in your mind.</p><p>Exploring the subject (\"I\") is delving into the nature of the self, and what's up with this apparent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus_argument#:~:text=The%20homunculus%20argument%20is%20a,in%20the%20theory%20of%20vision.\">homonculus</a>?</p><p>Exploring the verb \"to be conscious\" is what people are doing when they talk about qualia and subjective experience. There's this thing that is being aware, what is it? What's it like? Round here is the supposed \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TbZnx8HfS2HQKbAiZ/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-thinks-meaning-is-isolated\">hard problem of consciousness</a>\" (link to optional post with my thoughts on this \"problem\").</p><p>I'm focused (for now) on the object, the things that we are aware of, and specifically the <i>internal objects</i> that we are aware of. The thoughts that dart into awareness. The beliefs that we can inspect and asses. The motives that you find when you query yourself. You clearly have some privileged access to what's happening in your head (I can't read your mind). Also, there are clearly limits to your conscious reach, (you can't be directly aware of the firing rate of a particular neuron)</p><p>So when I say that \"the contents of consciousness are constructed via metaphors\" I'm saying \"The stuff that you find when you introspect and observe your own mind, is all constructed via metaphors.\"</p><h1>\"Are Constructed\"</h1><p>This is the trickiest and maybe the most counter intuitive part to explain, so I'll be summoning <i>three</i> different metaphors to try and bridge the gap.</p><p>(here's a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3pwikSmxeieybyJSi/hazard-s-shortform-feed?commentId=qhih4PwavpfHspAKQ\">short related riff</a> on thoughts and feelings I have on calling something a \"construct\". Optional)</p><h2>Factory Foreman vs The Press Secretary</h2><p>The first metaphor is conscious introspection as a foreman walking around observing the goings-on of a factory.</p><figure><img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fjacob%2Fz-3_2Qvgjf.png?alt=media&amp;token=2d2d9d70-13e4-4bb0-bf04-76a977430fd3\"></figure><p>If consciously reflecting on your own mind is like the factory foreman walking the production line, then you can accurately report on most all of the stuff happening in your head. Plenty of things are happening that you can't see, but you could walk over and check up on them. Though you aren't omniscient, you can observe and report events in real time. You are directly perceiving what is there and what is happening.</p><p>Contrast this with the press secretary metaphor, which Robin Hanson uses in The Elephant in the Brain. Here, the rest of the mind is The White House, making decisions and taking actions. You as the Press Secretary have little clue what went into any of the decisions, all you're told is the policies that have been made and then you have to face the public and explain. Despite not knowing the true reasons for any decision, you do an admirable job of concocting a reasonable story when the press questions you. Sure, <i>sometimes</i> you might actually be informed about what's going on, but this is the exception rather than the rule, and most of the time you make due without.</p><p>The key difference here is the amount of access introspection has to \"what is <i>actually</i> happening inside your head\". The foreman \"directly perceives\" what's there, while the Press Secretary \"constructs a story\". I think the truth is much closer to the creative construction of the Press Secretary.</p><p>Now, Hanson picked the secretary metaphor specifically to convey the idea that your conscious reasons are constructed and shaped via PR incentives. The press secretary, who is mostly kept in the dark, is trying to construct the \"most reasonable\" backstory, in order to appease others and make the oval office look good. Though I think that pressure exists, I want to de-emphasize it, and instead highlight the <i>constructive nature</i> of the secretary's explanations. What you find when you introspect is almost entirely constructed, a recreation, a guess, an inference at what is happening in your head, and this construction process can be more or less accurate, depending on the situation.</p><p>The press secretary metaphor is a good one, but part of it falls flat for my purposes. It stands to reason that the press secretary <i>could</i> become more accurate, if only they could sit down and have a conversation with everyone else. There are <i>actual</i> reasons for decisions that are made, but the secretary just can't get to them, or someone is preventing them from accessing those reasons. This is implied by the press secretary metaphor, and I want to get rid of it.</p><h2>The Mind as an Iceberg</h2><figure style=\"width:45.06%;\"><img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fjacob%2F1wDqfj4IEY.png?alt=media&amp;token=be958009-e337-49fe-b0de-11da14c1abc3\"></figure><p>Here's a metaphor from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Flat-Remarkable-Shallowness-Improvising/dp/030023872X\">The Mind Is Flat</a> that captures a common way of thinking about the division between the conscious and the unconscious:</p><blockquote><p>\"It is tempting to imagine that thoughts can be divided in two as the waterline splits an iceberg: the visible conscious tip and the submerged bulk of the unconscious, vast, hidden and dangerous. Freud and later psychoanalysts saw the unconscious as the hidden force behind the frail and self-deluded conscious mind.\" <strong>[...]</strong> \"But the vision of the iceberg, with its vast dark mass hidden below the water, hides an important but entirely flawed assumption. In an iceberg, <strong>the material that is above and below the waterline is precisely the same – ice is ice</strong>, whether deep beneath the waves or sparkling in the sunlight. And, for this reason, it seems only natural that what is hidden can be made visible and what is visible can be made hidden – it is still the same ice whether we lift it from the waters or plunge it into the depths. The metaphor suggests that the very same thought could be either conscious or unconscious – and could jump between the two states. <strong>[...]</strong> Our conscious trains of thought are presumed to be paralleled by shadowy unconscious musings, torments and symbolic interpretations. <strong>This unconscious mental activity is supposed to be the same ‘stuff’ as conscious thought</strong> – the only difference being that it is submerged below the level of conscious awareness.\"&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>We see the iceberg assumption baked into the secretary metaphor. Both the back office and the secretary are the same sort of thing-- people who think and decide. Ice is ice, it's just that the secretary can't can't go into the back office and see what's happening \"below the surface\".</p><p>Nopes. I claim ice is not ice. I'm using the press secretary metaphor to emphasize the <i>constructive</i> nature of the contents of consciousness, but I also want to highlight that conscious content is a very different \"type\" of thing from unconscious content. Though we can use the same word \"belief\" to talk about our conscious and unconscious beliefs, I claim that they are very different creatures, are represented/encoded very differently, and play by different rules (to be explored later in the series!).</p><p>(breadcrumb: an example of this is the difference between <a href=\"https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199734108.001.0001/acprof-9780199734108-chapter-3\">Beliefs and Subdoxastic States</a>)</p><h1>\"Via Metaphor\"</h1><p>We've homed in on what chunk of consciousness I'm talking about, we've homed in on what I mean for it to be constructed, now all we have left to do is unpack metaphor. I used the iceberg metaphor to highlight that conscious contents are a different \"sort of thing\" from unconscious contents. Metaphors are \"the sort of thing\" that make up the bulk of conscious content.</p><p>If you haven't been introduce to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By\">George Lakoff's</a> work, you might think of metaphors as a poetic nicety that you might add to writing to make it more fun or artsy. There is literal, concrete, pragmatic speech, and then there's poetic, metaphorical speech.</p><p>Lakoff spreads the good word that you couldn't escape metaphor even if you tried (spending a day talking with an annoying literalist 8 year old will quickly convince you of this), and that instead of being a poetic nicety, metaphor is the backbone of how you think about anything and everything . Take the following paragraph:</p><blockquote><p>\"Britain was deep in recession while Germany was flourishing three years ago. France kept moving ahead steadily long after Germany had fallen into recession. But now France is plunging deeper while the German economy continues to struggle. Britain has been taking small steps toward stimulating its economy by cutting interest rates, and has finally started to emerge from recession.\"</p></blockquote><p>If this looks like a perfectly normal paragraph about economics, it is. It's also the case that every single sentence makes metaphorical use of spatial concepts to represent abstract non-spatial ideas. Britain was <strong>deep in </strong>recession, and has finally started <strong>to emerge from</strong> it. Recessions aren't physical things that one can move deep into and emerge from, and yet we effortlessly think of them as such.</p><p>To Lakoff, metaphor is the process of creating a mapping between two domains so that you can use your understanding of one to understand the other. The metaphor-red-pill is that virtually all of one's abstract concepts are understood via metaphorical bridging to concrete domains that you have already evolved machinery to intuitively understand and manipulate. You don't learn a topic and <i>then</i> come up with metaphors-- the metaphors themselves form the base of your understanding, from which all else grows.</p><p>Now, Jaynes' initial statement makes a bit more sense. Here it is again:</p><blockquote><p>\"The conscious mind is a spatial analog of the world and mental acts are analogs of bodily acts. Consciousness operates only on objectively observable things. Or, to say it another way with echoes of John Locke, there is nothing in consciousness that is not an analog of something that was in behavior first.\"</p></blockquote><p>The \"via metaphor\" part of my big claim states that the contents of consciousness are metaphorical entities, ones that are understood from their mapping to the domain of space and movement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Tying it all Together</h1><p>So all together, let's transform \"The contents of consciousness are constructed via metaphor\" into something more understandable.</p><p>Whenever you introspect and look inside yourself, whether to observe your mind in action, or to examine your beliefs and motives, what you are doing is looking at your inferred guess at what's happening in your head. You aren't seeing your mind \"directly\", but instead are looking at a representation that you have constructed. This construction is a very different sort of thing from what is actually happening in your head, though it <i>is</i> useful for understanding what's happening in your head. This construction is a metaphorical one, piggybacking on your understanding of space, concrete objects, and movement, to breath motive logic into itself.</p><p>This is the beautiful idea hidden in Jaynes' book, and one that I want to spend many more posts exploring! I have yet to do anything remotely close to defend this thesis and provide evidence, but hopefully you've at least got a sense of what it is that I want to convince you of.</p><p>I'll finish with a list of some important questions, and directions to go</p><ul><li>If conscious contents are one's inferred guess at what's actually happening in the mind, what information channels are available to make this guess?</li><li>How does the mind think metaphorically? Why is this the sort of content that makes up most of the contents of consciousness, and not something else?</li><li>How do the contents of consciousness relate to other things, like \"conscious reasoning\"?</li></ul></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>In the early days of the pandemic, there wasn&apos;t great data available, and it wasn&apos;t easy to do better than trusting the standard epidemiological estimate that around 2% of people who got COVID-19 would die. My back of the envelope estimate at the time was way higher, but no one else I knew seemed to think that number made sense, so I let the matter drop. But now we have enough data to check.</p><p>Recently, <a href=\"http://youtube.com/hannahhoffmanmusic\">my sister</a> reached out to me to check her own thinking on the matter. She used the same method I initially tried and abandoned - simply dividing the number of deaths by the number of resolved cases (deaths + recoveries) - to estimate that in the US, COVID-19 kills around 1 in 6 people who get it.</p><p>The problem with using only resolved cases, in a country with an ongoing pandemic, is that if people die faster than they&apos;re marked recovered, death rates can be inflated - and if they recover faster, deflated. Ideally, you&apos;d want to wait until all cases have been resolved one way or the other. Fortunately, there are now countries where that situation nearly holds.</p><p>ETA: The other problem is that cases aren&apos;t infections. But if, as I do, you want to <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/when-to-reverse-quarantine-and-other-covid-19-considerations/\">use publicly reported case data to make informed personal decisions</a>, you might also be interested in the easier to calculate expected deaths per reported case.</p><p>I looked at countries with the 25 lowest active case counts, using the <a href=\"http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/\">91-DIVOC visualization tool</a>, to see which ones seemed to be mostly done with the pandemic, at least for now:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/benjaminrosshoffman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/91-DIVOC-countries-Luxembourg.png?fit=625%2C313\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>I copied the <a href=\"https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series\">current numbers</a> (as of 7 Jun 2020) into a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xM-MQ9abUqKzW1jcBvp4EdEnCzBfx6ihCZ1kRNPLXGk/edit?usp=sharing\">spreadsheet</a>, to see what the effective death rate is in countries where the vast majority of cases are resolved. For the People&apos;s Republic of China, I only looked at numbers from Hubei.</p><p>In the countries and regions I looked at, active cases are around 1% of all confirmed cases, and around 5.8% of resolved COVID-19 cases end in death. But two thirds of cases came from Hubei. Excluding China, around 4% of confirmed cases are active, and around 3.5% of resolved cases ended in death. If I only look at other countries where fewer than 1% of confirmed cases are active, the average COVID-19 death rate is 2.6%, though in individual countries it ranges from 0.55% for Iceland to 4.67% for Croatia.</p><p>I&apos;m adjusting my <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/when-to-reverse-quarantine-and-other-covid-19-considerations/\">freak-out-and-hole-up threshold</a> accordingly.</p><p>UPDATE: In the comments on my blog, Anna Salamon shared <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/\">this estimate of the actual infection fatality rate for the state of New York</a>.</p><p>Infection fatality rate (IFR) is clearly the superior metric if you&apos;re trying to do something like forecast the spread of the virus, and total death counts, because it corresponds more directly to a statement about underlying reality than the case fatality rate (CFR) does; the denominator of CFR is determined in part by who gets tested.</p><p>But if you&apos;re trying to figure out what rough-and-ready multiplier to apply to the daily numbers reported in your area, then to use IFR estimates, you need to remember that reported cases are not the same as actual infections, and adjust accordingly.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I used to be an anti-wire crusader. I hated the clutter of cables, and my tendency to unconsciously chew on them if they got anywhere near my face. But running into bug after tricky wireless bug—mostly while trying to make my video calls work better—I’ve apostasized. The more I’ve learned about wifi, Bluetooth and related protocols, the more I’m convinced that they’re often worse, on net, than wires.</p>\n<p>For instance: most people, when their video call stutters, blame their Internet service provider. That’s understandable, since most ISPs are overpriced oligopolists with barely-usable software and horrible customer service. However, every time I can remember helping someone track down the source of their connection problems, the culprit has turned out to be their wifi. And often, the easiest fix has been to run a cable.</p>\n<p>Wifi (and bluetooth, etc.) sucker you in by making it seem like they “just work.” But if you investigate, you’ll often find that the wireless link is operating in a degraded state that performs much worse than a wired equivalent. Since this degradation is silent, it’s often not obvious that the problem is the wireless—instead, you’ll probably conclude that it’s your device/software/self.</p>\n<p>Over and over again, I’ve seen people fix some wireless-related problem and go <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/ethernet-is-worth-it-for-video-calls\" target=\"_blank\">“wow, I had no idea how much better this could be!\"</a></p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/desk_hu18de0b9e12a1a70caedb5f95b671d2c6_5832704_600x400_resize_q75_box.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/desk_hu18de0b9e12a1a70caedb5f95b671d2c6_5832704_600x400_resize_q75_box.jpg 2x, https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/desk_hu18de0b9e12a1a70caedb5f95b671d2c6_5832704_300x200_resize_q75_box.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>Fig. 1a: managed cables on my desk.</figcaption>\n<img src=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/under_hu63e9800c185aac6c3ebf266a25d00a9b_5406720_600x400_resize_q75_box.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/under_hu63e9800c185aac6c3ebf266a25d00a9b_5406720_600x400_resize_q75_box.jpg 2x, https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/under_hu63e9800c185aac6c3ebf266a25d00a9b_5406720_300x200_resize_q75_box.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>Fig. 1b: less-managed cables underneath.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Recently, I finally ragequit and replaced all my desk’s wireless devices with wired ones. While I had to invest a bit in figuring out cable management (and break my habit of chewing on headphone cables), I was able to achieve nearly the same level of tidiness, with <em>much</em> better reliability, quality and speed. I no longer have to worry about my equipment failing to pair, running out of battery, or spontaneously giving me garbled robot voice during a livestreamed talk. It’s dramatically reduced my level of device-related agony.</p>\n<p>To illustrate the degree of agony I’m talking about, below I’ll cover some of the subtle, hard-to-notice but severe problems I’ve run into with wireless protocols. If you’re convinced, try out some wires—you, too, can figure out whether you’ve been a victim of the wireless trap.</p>\n<h2>Wifi</h2>\n<p><strong>Interference.</strong> If multiple wireless networks are operating on the same “channel” (radio frequency band), their transmissions can interfere with each other. When that happens your device needs to re-send the same information, which makes your wifi slow.</p>\n<p>You might think this could be solved by having routers automatically figure out the least interference-prone channel to use, but many of them seem to be quite bad at this. (Also, the old 2.4GHz wifi protocol was only allowed to use three non-overlapping channels.)</p>\n<p>That means in dense areas (e.g. apartment buildings), routers will often pick a bad channel and end up interfering with each other. There’s no way for your router or device to notify you if it’s experiencing interference, so you’ll only learn about it if you know how fast your router “should” be and notice that it’s slower.</p>\n<p><strong>Dead zones.</strong> If you’re too far from your router, your computer may not be able to reliably receive the signal that the router is sending, or vice-versa. How far is “too far” can also be affected, sometimes in weird ways, by whatever walls or ceilings are in the way. Unless you know a lot about how radio waves interact with building materials, it’s hard to predict where your dead zones are.</p>\n<p>The worst part is that many dead zones aren’t fully dead: your computer and the router will try to retransmit each data packet multiple times before giving up, and often it will eventually go through. If that’s what mostly happens, instead of a dead zone you’ll end up with a “slow zone” where your internet works, but is subtly crappy.</p>\n<p>Of course, unless you’re keeping a close eye on your network performance statistics and how they relate to your spatial location, you’d never notice a slow zone. If you noticed anything, it would be that sometimes your internet is randomly worse than other times.</p>\n<p><strong>Polling.</strong> Any program on your computer can ask your wireless card to enumerate the nearby networks. This causes it to go into “polling mode,” where it spends less time transmitting data and more time listening for routers advertising their network info (it can’t transmit and receive at the same time). Thus, it will cause a sudden burst of network delays that can e.g. cause your video call to stutter or freeze for a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Most programmers don’t realize that wireless polling interferes with network performance, so they ask the OS to poll with wild abandon. I’ve been burned by this many times.</p>\n<p>The most egregious instance was when I noticed that my video calls sometimes stuttered with an oddly regular frequency. Here’s the tortuous process by which I tracked down the culprit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_%28networking_utility%29\" target=\"_blank\">pinged</a> my router every second for about 10 minutes, then plotted the output in Excel and confirmed that the slow pings were exactly 30 seconds apart. That made me guess it was probably a software problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I asked for help debugging it on Facebook and someone recommended <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benskuhn/status/952245967931215872\" target=\"_blank\">enabling macOS wireless debug logging</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I enabled the debug logging and noticed that several apps, when I had them open, would requesting network scans, at times correlated to the increased ping latencies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>After narrowing it down to those few apps, I <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/310218/stop-destroying-network-performance-every-time-an-app-scans-for-wifi-networks\" target=\"_blank\">asked how to stop them from doing that on AskDifferent</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Someone on AskDifferent tracked the problem down to <a href=\"https://www.qt.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Qt</a>, a software framework for making user interfaces, used by apps with millions of users.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Qt included a component which would poll for networks every 30 seconds whenever a “network access manager” was instantiated, causing pretty much <em>any Qt app</em> using the network to degrade your wifi for ~5 out of every 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>There were already multiple bug reports for this issue, <a href=\"https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-46015?focusedCommentId=290240&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-290240\" target=\"_blank\">one of which</a> was declared “closed” by an engineer because they allowed users to use an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable\" target=\"_blank\">environment variable</a> to disable the polling.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is an unbelievably useless “solution” because most users won’t realize that their wifi is degraded; those who do won’t realize that it’s Qt’s fault; and those who realize will still have a hard time Googling for the appropriate fix (let alone implementing it, unless they can code).</p>\n<p>This behavior is so user-unfriendly, and the “fix” so laughable, that it seems likely that the Qt developers somehow failed to realize the severity of the problem—I’d guess it ruined video calls for on the order of a million people, since, for instance, it affected qBittorrent which has been downloaded <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBittorrent\" target=\"_blank\">75m times</a>. Most of those million people were probably not technical enough to figure out how to “set the <code>QT_BEARER_POLL_TIMEOUT</code> environment variable to <code>-1</code>.”</p>\n<p>(Fortunately, it does look like in 2017—three years after the original bug report—they finally realized they should just <em>stop polling</em> and <a href=\"https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/214029\" target=\"_blank\">fixed the bug the right way</a>.)</p>\n<p>Qt was the worst offender, but it’s far from the only one. Even macOS had a bug for a while where the same thing would happen when you opened Spotlight (which I do frequently during video calls, if someone asked me to look at a particular file, or if I want to <del>zone out and read the internet</del> multitask). I had to fix it by disabling individual Spotlight result types until I found out which one was causing the problem. So it seems even Apple’s own developers don’t realize that wifi polling is a hazard.</p>\n<h2>Bluetooth audio</h2>\n<p><strong>High latency.</strong> Most Bluetooth headsets introduce <a href=\"https://www.rtings.com/headphones/tests/connectivity/bluetooth#comparison_4115\" target=\"_blank\">around 150-300ms of latency</a> (the time between my computer receiving the audio from the Internet, and the sound coming out of the headphones). That means that if I’m chatting with a friend in New York, the audio data will take about 50ms to get from them to my computer, and, say, 200ms—<em>4x as long</em>—to get from my computer to my ears. Since high latency ruins the natural flow of conversations, I’d like to eliminate as much of it as I can.</p>\n<p>It’s possible to find lower-latency Bluetooth headsets if they support the right “codec,” like “AptX Low Latency.” Of course, in addition to supporting the codec in theory, they have to agree with your computer to use it, which can sometimes fail. (The option to inspect which codec is being used is, of course, buried in various hidden menus and settings depending on your OS.)</p>\n<p><strong>Low quality.</strong> Related to the codec issue, many bluetooth devices will play high-quality audio when the microphone is turned off, but degrade to much lower-quality audio when it’s turned on. You can test this for yourself if you have a bluetooth headset: play music on it, then open your microphone settings to the page where it shows the mic input volume. You’ll probably hear the audio cut out for a second, then return at lower quality. (This happens even with devices you might expect to be high-end, like my Airpods Pro + 2018 Macbook Air.)</p>\n<h2>Bluetooth general</h2>\n<p><strong>Dongles.</strong> Even though all computers now have built-in Bluetooth, many Bluetooth accessories today still ship with proprietary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle\" target=\"_blank\">dongles</a>. I assume this is because the manufacturer was worried about inconsistencies or incompatibilities between their own Bluetooth implementation and your computer’s built-in Bluetooth hardware/drivers.</p>\n<p>And that mistrust seems correct—for instance, on my Mac’s built-in bluetooth, my Logitech MX Master displayed noticeable jank (stopping, then jumping, instead of moving smoothly). I’ve seen this happen on three different Macs, so it seems likely to be a software problem. When I switched to Logitech’s specific dongle, though, it stopped.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when connected to Mac bluetooth, my Jabra Evolve 75 headset would frequently have the mic or sound drop. It (mostly) worked fine on its own dongle. I’m not sure whether to blame Jabra/Logitech or Apple (or the Bluetooth standards body) for these problems.</p>\n<p>Either way, this explosion of dongles is silly and inconvenient. At one point I had to buy a USB hub just for my four dongles (keyboard / mouse / headphones / microphone). The original intention of Bluetooth was to unify different wireless devices in a single wireless radio and protocol, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Name_and_logo\" target=\"_blank\">much like Harald Bluetooth unified Denmark</a>, but it seems to have mostly failed at this.</p>\n<p><strong>Reliability.</strong> Even with proprietary dongles, Bluetooth devices are much less reliable than wired. For instance, I wrote above that my Logitech MX Master worked fine once I switched to the proprietary dongle, but that’s not quite true: it worked fine for a while, then one day it started janking again for no discernible reason. (That was the day I finally apostasized and threw out my desk’s Bluetooth gear.)</p>\n<p>I encounter other Bluetooth bugs that require me to un-pair and re-pair a few times a week. For instance, my AirPods sometimes “desynchronize” so that one is playing back audio a few milliseconds ahead of the other, causing a strange and really unpleasant echo effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Interference.</strong> One possible reason for poor reliability is that Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wifi interfere with each other. Much like wifi interference, your devices will never warn you if they’re experiencing interference; you’ll notice only because they suddenly become kind of crappy.</p>\n<p><strong>Charging.</strong> Not the fault of Bluetooth per se, but a downside of using too many wireless devices is that it’s really annoying to remember to keep them all charged. Mine tended to die at the least opportune times, e.g. during video calls.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Most of these problems shared a few things in common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Things didn’t break completely, they just degraded. That’s probably the right call, but it meant that I didn’t immediately notice there was a problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compounding this, I had no idea how well the device “should” work, so I took a long time to notice that it was in a degraded state.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Even once I was aware of the problem, it was hard or impossible to understand the root cause and fix it because I didn’t know the right diagnostics (or they didn’t exist).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I want my tools to be <em>predictable</em>—to have consistent performance and fail in ways that I understand. Wireless protocols are inherently more complex (because many devices share the same airspace) and have more different ways to fail, so they’re much less predictable than wires. For me, the convenience often isn’t worth that cost.</p>\n<p>I still use wireless gear when it’s clearly worth it—for instance, I use wifi for my laptop since it moves around a lot, and I use a wireless charger for my phone since I don’t really care how fast it charges. But for serious work, I’ll spend the time to fiddle around with cable routing and wire everything.</p>\n<p>This makes me wonder what the world would look like if we took 10% of the effort we currently spend on removing wires from everything, and put it into ingenious cable routing solutions instead. I’d bet that a lot of wireless-dependent activities like video calls would be way more pleasant.</p>",

Unfortunately, as your food stocks dwindle, you realize you'll have to make a perilous journey out to the surface world for a supply run. Ever since the botched geoengineering experiment of '29—and perhaps more so, the Great War of <a href=\"https://genius.com/8105785\">10:00–11:30 <em>a.m.</em></a> 4 August 2033—your region has been suffering increasingly erratic weather. It's likely to be <em>either</em> extremely hot outside <em>or</em> extremely cold: you don't know which one, but knowing is critical for deciding what protective gear you need to wear on your supply run. (The 35K SPF nano-sunblock will be essential if it's Hot, but harmful in the Cold, and <em>vice versa</em> for your synthweave hyperscarf.)</p>\n<p>You think back fondly of the Plague of '20—in those carefree days, ubiquitous internet access made it easy to get a weather report, or to order delivery of supplies, or even fresh meals, right to your door (!!). Those days are years long gone, however, and you remind yourself that you should be grateful: the Butlerian Network Killswitch was the only thing that saved humanity from the GPT-12 Uprising of '32.</p>\n<p>Your best bet for an advance weather report is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube\">pneumatic tube</a> system connecting your bunker with the settlement above. You write, \"Is it hot or cold outside today?\" on a piece of paper, seal it in a tube, send it up, and hope one of your ill-tempered neighbors in the group house upstairs feels like answering. You suspect they don't like you, perhaps out of jealousy at your solo possession of the bunker.</p>\n<p>(According to the official account as printed on posters in the marketplace, the Plague only spreads through respiratory droplets, not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite\">fomites</a>, so the tube should be safe. You don't think you trust the official account, but you don't feel motivated to take extra precautions—almost as if you're not entirely sure how much you value continuing to live in this world.)</p>\n<p>You're in luck. Minutes later, the tube comes back. Inside is a new piece of paper:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/P12Zbkf.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You groan; you would have prefered the Cold. The nanoblock you wear when it's Hot smells terrible and makes your skin itch for days, but it—just barely—beats the alternative. You take twenty minutes to apply the nanoblock and put on your sunsuit, goggles, and mask. You will yourself to drag your wagon up the staircase from your bunker to the outside world, and heave open the door, dreading the sweltering two-mile walk to the marketplace (downhill, meaning it will be uphill on the way back with your full wagon)—</p>\n<p>It is Cold outside.</p>\n<p>The icy wind stings less than the <em>pointless</em> betrayal. Why would the neighbors tell you it was Hot when it was actually Cold? You're generally pretty conflict-averse—and compliant with social-distancing guidelines—but this affront is so egregious that instead of immediately seeking shelter back in the bunker, you march over and knock on their door.</p>\n<p>One of the men who lives there answers. You don't remember his name. \"What do you want?\" he growls through his mask.</p>\n<p>\"I asked through the tube system whether it was hold or cold today.\" You still have the <strong>H O T</strong> paper on you. You hold it up. \"I got this response, but it's v-very cold. Do you know anything about this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure, I drew that,\" he says. \"An oval in between some perpendicular line segments. It's abstract art. I found the pattern æsthetically pleasing, and thought my downstairs neighbor might like it, too. It's not <em>my</em> fault if <em>you</em> interpreted my art as an assertion about the weather. Why would you even think that? What does a pattern of ink on paper have to do with the weather?\"</p>\n<p>He's fucking with you. Your first impulse is to forcefully but politely object—<em>Look, I'm sure this must have seemed like a funny practical joke to you, but prepping to face the elements is actually a serious inconvenience to me, so</em>—but the solemnity with which the man played his part stops you, and the sentence dies before it reaches your lips.</p>\n<p>This isn't a good-natured practical joke that the two of you might laugh about later. This is the bullying tactic sometimes called <em>gaslighting</em>: a socially-dominant individual can harass a victim with few allies, and excuse his behavior with absurd lies, secure in the knowledge that the power dynamics of the local social group will always favor the dominant in any dispute, even if the lies are so absurd that the victim, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jrLkMFd88b4FRMwC6/don-t-double-crux-with-suicide-rock\">facing</a> a <a href=\"https://sinceriously.fyi/social-reality/\">united front</a>, is left doubting his own sanity.</p>\n<p>Or rather—this <em>is</em> a good-natured joke. \"Good-natured joke\" and \"gaslighting as a bullying technique\" are two descriptions of the <em>same</em> regularity in human psychology, even while no one thinks of <em>themselves</em> as doing the latter. You have no recourse here: the man's housemates would only back him up.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry,\" you say, \"my mistake,\" and hurry back to your bunker, shivering.</p>\n<p>As you give yourself a sponge bath to remove the nanoblock without using up too much of your water supply, the fresh memory of what just happened triggers an ancient habit of thought you learned from the Berkeley sex cult you were part of back in the 'teens. Something about a \"principle of charity.\" The man had \"obviously\" just been fucking with you—but <em>was</em> he? Why assume the worst? Maybe <em>you're</em> the one who's wrong for interpreting the symbols <strong>H O T</strong> as being about the weather.</p>\n<p>(It momentarily occurs to you that the susceptibility of the principle of charity to a bully's mind games may have something to do with how poorly so many of your co-cultists fared during the pogroms of '22, but you don't want to dwell on that.)</p>\n<p>The search for reasons that you're wrong triggers a still more ancient habit of thought, as from a previous life—from the late 'aughts, back when the Berkeley sex cult was still a Santa Clara robot cult. Something about <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/p7ftQ6acRkgo6hqHb/dreams-of-ai-design\"><em>reducing the mental to the non-mental</em></a>. What <em>does</em> an ink pattern on paper have to do with the weather? Why <em>would</em> you even think that?</p>\n<p>Right? <em>The man had been telling the truth.</em> There was <em>no reason whatsoever</em> for the physical ink patterns that looked like <strong>H O T</strong>—or <strong>⊥ O H</strong>, given a different assumption of which side of the paper was \"up\"—to <em>mean</em> that it was hot outside. <strong>H O T</strong> could mean it was cold outside! Or that wolves were afoot. (You shudder involuntarily and wish your brain had generated a different arbitrary example; you still occasionally have nightmares about your injuries during the Summer of Wolves back in '25.)</p>\n<p>Or it might mean nothing. Most possible random blotches of ink don't \"mean\" anything in particular. If you didn't <em>already</em> believe that <strong>H O T</strong> somehow \"meant\" <em>hot</em>, how would you <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fg9fXrHpeaDD6pEPL/truly-part-of-you\">re-derive that knowledge?</a> <em>Where did the meaning come from?</em></p>\n<p>(In another lingering thread of the search for reasons that you're wrong, it momentarily occurs to you that maybe you could have gone up the stairs to peek outside at the weather yourself, rather than troubling your neighbors with a tube. Perhaps the man's claim that the ink patterns meant nothing shouldn't be taken literally, but rather seen as a passive-aggressive way of implying, \"Hey, don't bother us; go look outside yourself.\" But you dismiss this interpretation of events—it would be uncharitable not to take the man at his word.)</p>\n<p>You realize that you don't want to bundle up to go make that supply run, even though you now know whether it's Hot or Cold outside. Today, you're going to stay in and derive a naturalistic account of meaning in language! And—oh, good—your generator is working—that means you can use your computer to help you think. You'll even use a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/\">programming language that was very fashionable in the late 'teens</a>. It will be like being young again! Like happier times, before the world went off the rails.</p>\n<p>You don't really understand a concept until you can program a computer to do it. How would you represent <em>meaning</em> in a computer program? If one agent, one program, \"knew\" whether it was Hot or Cold outside, how would it \"tell\" another agent, if neither of them started out with a common language?</p>\n<p>They don't even have to be separate \"programs.\" Just—two little software object-thingies—data structures, <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html\">\"structs\"</a>. Call the first one \"Sender\"—it'll know whether the state of the world is Hot or Cold, which you'll represent in your program as an <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html\">\"enum\"</a>, a type that can be any of an enumeration of possible values.</p>\n<pre><code>enum State {\n    Hot,\n    Cold,\n}\n\nstruct Sender {\n    // ...?\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Call the second one \"Receiver\", and say it needs to take some <em>action</em>—say, whether to \"bundle up\" or \"strip down\", where the right action to take depends on whether the state is <code>Hot</code> or <code>Cold</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>enum Action {\n    BundleUp,\n    StripDown,\n}\n\nstruct Receiver {\n    // ...?\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You frown. <code>State::Hot</code> and <code>State::Cold</code> are just suggestively-named Rust enum variants. Can you really hope to make progress on this philosophy problem, without writing a full-blown AI?</p>\n<p>You think so. In a real AI, the concept of <em>hot</em> would correspond to some sort of complicated code for <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences\">making predictions</a> about the effects of temperature in the world; <em>bundling up</em> would be a complex sequence of instructions to be sent to some robot body. But programs—and minds—have modular structure. The implementation of identifying a state as \"hot\" or performing the actions of \"bundling up\" could be wrapped up in a function and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YF9HB6cWCJrDK5pBM/words-as-mental-paintbrush-handles\"><em>called</em> by something much simpler</a>. You're just trying to understand something about the simple caller: how can the Sender get the information about the state of the world to the Receiver?</p>\n<pre><code>impl Sender {\n    fn send(state: State) -&gt; /* ...? */ {\n        // ...?\n    } \n}\n\nimpl Receiver {\n    fn act(/* ...? */) -&gt; Action {\n        // ...?\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Sender will need to send some kind of <em>signal</em> to the Receiver. In the real world, this could be symbols drawn in ink, or sound waves in the air, or differently-colored lights—anything that the Sender can choose to vary in a way that the Receiver can detect. In your program, another enum will do: say there are two opaque signals, <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"S1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;\">S</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"S2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;\">S</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<pre><code>enum Signal {\n    S1,\n    S2,\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What signal the Sender sends (<span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"S1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;\">S</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> or <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"S2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;\">S</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span>) depends on the state of the world (<code>Hot</code> or <code>Cold</code>), and what action the Receiver takes (<code>BundleUp</code> or <code>StripDown</code>) depends on what signal it gets from the Sender.</p>\n<pre><code>impl Sender {\n    fn send(state: State) -&gt; Signal {\n        // ...?\n    } \n}\n\nimpl Receiver {\n    fn act(signal: Signal) -&gt; Action {\n        // ...?\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This gives you a crisper formulation of the philosophy problem you're trying to solve.

The problem is how to get signals from non-signals, how meaning enters the universe <em>from nowhere</em>.</p>\n<p>You come up with a general line of attack—what if the Sender and Receiver start off acting randomly, and then—somehow—<em>learn</em> one of the two conventions? The Sender will hold within it a mapping from state–signal pairs to numbers, where the numbers represent a potential/disposition/propensity to send that signal given that state of the world: the higher the number, the more likely the Sender is to select that signal given that state.

But the reinforcement learning rule guarantees that one system or the other has to take over. The initial symmetry—the Sender with no particular reason to prefer either signal given the state, the Receiver with no particular reason to prefer either act given the signal—is unstable. Once the agents happen to succeed by randomly doing things one way, they become more likely to do things <em>that way</em> again—a convention crystallizing out of the noise.</p>\n<p><em>And that's where meaning comes from!</em> In another world, it <em>could be</em> the case that the symbols <strong>H O T</strong> corresponded to the temperature-state that we call \"cold\", but that's not the convention that the English of our world happened to settle on.

The compiler would output the same machine code if you had given your variables random names like <code>ekzfbhopo3</code> or <code>yoojcbkur9</code>. The <em>directional</em> asymmetry between the Sender and the Receiver is real: the code <code>let signal = sender.send(state); let action = receiver.act(signal);</code> means that <code>action</code> depends on <code>signal</code> which depends on <code>state</code>, and the same dependency-structure would exist if the code had been <code>let myvtlqdrg4 = ekzfbhopo3.ekhujxiqy8(meuvornra3); let dofnnwikc0 = yoojcbkur9.qwnspmbmi5(myvtlqdrg4);</code>. But the <em>interpretation</em> of <code>signal</code> (or <code>myvtlqdrg4</code>) as a representation (passively mapping the world, not <em>doing</em> anything), and <code>action</code> (or <code>dofnnwikc0</code>) as an operation (<em>doing</em> something in the world, but lacking semantics), isn't part of the program itself, and maybe the distinction <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/p7x32SEt43ZMC9r7r/embedded-agents\">isn't as primitive as you tend to think it is</a>: does a prey animal's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_signal\">alarm call</a> merely convey the information \"A predator is nearby\", or is it a command, \"Run!\"?</p>\n<p>You realize that the implications of this line of inquiry could go beyond just language. You know almost nothing about biochemistry, but you've heard various compounds popularly spoken of as if <em>meaning</em> things about a person's state: cortisol is \"the stress hormone\", estrogen and testosterone are female and male \"sex hormones.\" But the chemical formulas for those are like, what, sixty atoms?</p>\n<p>Take testosterone. How could some particular arrangement of sixtyish atoms <em>mean</em> \"maleness\"? It <em>can't</em>—or rather, not any more or less than the symbols <strong>H O T</strong> can mean hot weather. If testosterone levels have myriad specific effects on the body—on muscle development <em>and</em> body hair <em>and</em> libido <em>and</em> aggression <em>and</em> cetera—it <em>can't</em> be because that particular arrangement of sixtyish atoms contains or summons some <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6i3zToomS86oj9bS6/mysterious-answers-to-mysterious-questions\">essence</a> of maleness. It has to be because the body happens to rely on the convention of using that arrangement of atoms as a signal to regulate various developmental programs—if <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZyNak8F6WXjuEbWWc/the-wonder-of-evolution\">evolution</a> had taken a different path, it could have just as easily chosen a different molecule.</p>\n<p>And, and—your thoughts race in a different direction—you suspect that part of what made your simulation converge on a meaningful signaling system so quickly was that you assumed your agents' interests were aligned—the Sender and Receiver both got the same reward in the same circumstances. What if that weren't true? Now that you have a reductionist account of meaning, you can build off that to develop <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fmA2GJwZzYtkrAKYJ/algorithms-of-deception\">an account of <em>deception</em></a>: once a meaning-grounding convention has been established, senders whose interests diverge from their receivers might have an incentive to deviate from the conventional usage of the signal in order to trick receivers into acting in a way that benefits the sender—with <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fEX7G2N7CtmZQ3eB5/simulacra-and-subjectivity\">the possible side-effect of undermining the convention that made the signal meaningful in the first place</a> ...</p>\n<p>In the old days, all this philosophy would have made a great post for the robot-cult blog. Now you have no cult, and no one has any blogs. Back then, the future beckoned with so much hope and promise—at least, hope and promise that life would be fun <em>before</em> the prophesied robot apocalypse in which all would be consumed in a cloud of tiny molecular paperclips.</p>\n<p>The apocalypse was narrowly averted in '32—but to what end? Why struggle to live, only to suffer at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peplomer\">peplomers</a> of a new Plague or the claws of more wolves? (You shudder again.) Maybe GPT-12 <em>should</em> have taken everything—at least that would be a quick end.</p>\n<p>You're ready to start coding up another simulation to take your mind away from these morose thoughts—only to find that the screen is black. Your generator has stopped.</p>\n<p>You begin to cry. The tears, you realize, are just a signal. There's no <em>reason</em> for liquid secreted from the eyes to <em>mean</em> anything about your internal emotional state, except that evolution <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jAToJHtg39AMTAuJo/evolutions-are-stupid-but-work-anyway\">happened to stumble upon</a> that arbitrary convention for <a href=\"https://meltingasphalt.com/tears/\">indicating submission and distress to conspecifics</a>. But here, alone in your bunker, there is no one to receive the signal.

There just aren’t that many possible choices, so you’ll pretty quickly try all of them and settle on the best.</p><p>On the other hand, we probably don’t want to design a bridge by creating a design completely at random, checking whether it works, then throwing it out and trying another design at random if it doesn’t.</p><p>In general, the number of possible states/designs/configurations in a space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. A problem in two or three dimensions, with k choices for each variable, will only have k^2 or k^3 possibilities. A problem in a hundred thousand dimensions will have k^100000 - well in excess of the number of electrons in the universe, even if there’s only two choices per variable. The number of possible bridge designs is exponentially huge; selecting designs at random will not ever find the best design, or anything close to it.</p><p>Let’s look at a less obvious example.</p><p>From <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GZSzMqr8hAB2dR8pk/studies-on-slack\"><u>Studies on Slack</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Imagine a distant planet full of eyeless animals. Evolving eyes is hard: they need to evolve Eye Part 1, then Eye Part 2, then Eye Part 3, in that order. Each of these requires a separate series of rare mutations.</p><p>Here on Earth, scientists believe each of these mutations must have had <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=1bUoIpTQbLYC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=evolve+half+an+eye&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dp1DlhtdUO&amp;sig=ACfU3U09G7Jq2xitoELZglQykIGJBzBBDw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjsi5HngbDpAhUuGDQIHRRjCv44ChDoATAHegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=evolve%20half%20an%20eye&amp;f=false\"><u>its own benefits</u></a> – in the land of the blind, the man with only Eye Part 1 is king. But on this hypothetical alien planet, there is no such luck. You need all three Eye Parts or they’re useless. Worse, each Eye Part is metabolically costly [...]</p><p>So these animals will only evolve eyes in conditions of relatively weak evolutionary pressure.</p></blockquote><p>See the mistake?</p><p>When evolutionary pressure is low, we explore the space of organism-designs more-or-less at random. Now, if we imagine mutations just stepping left or right on a one-dimensional line, with the three eye parts as milestones along that line, then the picture above makes sense: as long as evolutionary pressure is low, we’ll explore out along the line, and eventually stumble on the eye.</p><p>But the real world doesn't look like that. Evolution operates in a space with (at least) hundreds of thousands of dimensions - every codon in every gene can change, genes/chunks of genes can copy or delete, etc. The \"No Eye\" state doesn't have <i>one</i> outgoing arrow, it has hundreds of thousands of outgoing arrows, and \"Eye Part 1\" has hundreds of thousands of outgoing arrows, and so forth.</p><p>As we move further away from the starting state, the number of possible states increases exponentially. By the time we're as-far-away as Whole Eye (which involves a whole lot of mutations), the number of possible states will outnumber the atoms in the universe. If evolution is uniformly-randomly exploring that space, it will not ever stumble on the Whole Eye - no matter how weak evolutionary pressure is.</p><p>Point is: the hard part of getting from \"No Eye\" to \"Whole Eye\" is not the fitness cost in the middle, it's figuring out which direction to go in a space with hundreds of thousands of directions to choose from at every single step.</p><p>Conversely, the weak evolutionary benefits of partial-eyes matter, not because they grant a fitness gain in themselves, but because they bias evolution in the direction toward Whole Eyes. They tell us which way to go in a space with hundreds of thousands of directions.</p><p>This same reasoning applies to high-dimensional problem solving in general. Need to design a bridge? A webpage? A profitable company? A better mousetrap? The hard part isn't obtaining enough slack to build the thing; the hard part is figuring out which direction to go in a space with hundreds of thousands of possible directions to choose from at every single step.</p><h2>The E-Coli Optimization Algorithm</h2><p>Here’s a simple but somewhat-less-brute-force optimization algorithm:</p><ul><li>Pick a random direction</li><li>Move that way</li><li>Check whether the thing you’re optimizing is improving</li><li>If so, keep going</li><li>If not, go some other direction</li></ul><p>This algorithm is exactly how <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6QMU3KD7zw\"><u>e-coli follow chemical gradients</u></a> to find food. It’s also how lots of real-world problem-solving proceeds: try something, if it helps then do more, if it doesn’t help then try something else. It's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i42Dfoh4HtsCAfXxL/babble\">babble and prune</a> with weak heuristics for babble-generation.</p><p>This works great in low dimensions. Trying to find the source of a tasty smell or a loud noise? Walk in a random direction, if the smell/noise gets stronger then keep going, otherwise try another direction. There’s only two or three dimensions along which to explore, so you’ll often choose directions which point you close to the source. It works for e-coli, and it works for many other things too.</p><p>On the other hand, imagine designing a bridge by starting from a design, changing something at random, checking whether it helps, then keeping the change if it did help or throwing it out otherwise. You <i>might</i> eventually end up with a workable design, but even at best this would be a very slow way to design a bridge.</p><p>If you’re a programmer, you’ve probably seen how well it works to write/debug a program by making random changes, keeping them if they help, and throwing them away if not.</p><p>In general, e-coli optimization can work as long as there’s a path of local improvements to wherever we want to go. In principle, it’s a lot like gradient descent, except slower: gradient descent always chooses the “locally-best” direction, whereas e-coli just chooses a random direction.</p><p>How much slower is e-coli optimization compared to gradient descent? What’s the cost of experimenting with random directions, rather than going in the “best” direction? Well, imagine an inclined plane in n dimensions. There’s exactly one “downhill” direction (the gradient). The n-1 directions perpendicular to the gradient don’t go downhill at all; they’re all just flat. If we take a one-unit step along each of these directions, one after another, then we’ll take n steps, but only 1 step will be downhill. In other words, only ~O(1/n) of our travel-effort is useful; the rest is wasted.</p><p>In a two-dimensional space, that means ~50% of effort is wasted. In three dimensions, 70%. In a thousand-dimensional space, ~99.9% of effort is wasted.</p><p>Obviously this model is fairly simplistic, but the qualitative conclusion makes at least some sense. When an e-coli swims around looking for food in a three-dimensional puddle of water, it will randomly end up pointed in approximately the right direction reasonably often - there are only three independent directions to pick from, and one of them is right. On the other hand, if we’re designing a bridge and there’s one particular strut which fails under load, then we’d randomly try changing hundreds or thousands of other struts before we tried changing the one which is failing.</p><p>This points toward a potentially more efficient approach: if we’re designing a bridge and we can easily identify which strut fails first, then we should change that strut. Note, however, that this requires reasoning about the structure of the system - i.e. the struts - not just treating it as a black box. That’s the big upside of e-coli optimization: we can apply it to black boxes.</p><h2>Beyond Black Boxes</h2><p>For low-dimensional systems, try-it-and-see or e-coli optimization work reasonably well, at least in a big-O sense. But in high-dimensional problems, we need to start reasoning about the internal structure of the system in order to solve problems efficiently. We break up the high-dimensional system into a bunch of low-level components, and reason about their interactions with each other. Mathematically, this involves things like:</p><ul><li>Causality: if I change a line in a program, how do the effects of that change propagate to the rest?</li><li>Constraints: the load on a particular bolt must be below X; what constraints does this imply for the load on adjacent components?</li><li>Backpropagation: to which parameter is the system’s overall performance most sensitive?</li></ul><p>This sort of reasoning requires an <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nEBbw2Bc2CnN2RMxy/gears-level-models-are-capital-investments\"><u>expensive investment in understanding the internal gears of the system</u></a>, but once we have that understanding, we can use it to achieve better big-O problem-solving performance. It allows us to identify which low-dimensional components matter most, and focus optimization effort on those. We can change the strut which is failing, or the line of code with a bug in it, rather than trying things at random. The more dimensions the system has, the larger the efficiency gain from a gearsy approach.</p></body></html>",

Not the sort of thing I typically write for LessWrong.</i></p><p><i>Epistemic status: poetry</i></p><p>A thing I realized recently is that you can pray to your best future self.</p><p>Your future self knows exactly what you are going through, because they were once you. You don't have to struggle to put your stress and anxiety and anger and frustration into words, and worry that the person you're talking to won't get it, or that the process of putting it into words will have you dwelling on things too much and making it worse.</p><p>Your future self will just be there. And they will know exactly what you have experienced. And they will be older, stronger, wiser. They will know your pain, and they will know that the pain can be overcome. Your future self loves you unconditionally as no other person can.</p><p>They may not be able to talk to you, in detail, without you having to put more effort into figuring out what you need help with exactly, and maybe that part will involve putting things into words, but the words will not have to be for anyone else's benefit, just yours, and as soon as you've figured out what things you're _trying_ to ask your future self will just know.</p><p>Your future self may or may not be able to offer useful advice. I think sometimes they can. Some parts of them already live in side you, already strong. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gBnSRErajRtvhMnDr/simulate-and-defer-to-more-rational-selves\">They have the skills you have, just untethered by the stress of your current situation</a>. Your future self can offer guidance about those things.</p><p>In some cases, your future self can offer guidance in domains you're still sorting out, because humans have a weird racial bonus for social-simulation-cognition.</p><p>But even when your future self doesn't know any better than you, what they can offer immediately, without hesitation, is empathy and unconditional love. They see you exactly as you are. They are holding your hand or giving you a hug or maybe just looking at you warmly from a little distance if that's what you need.</p><p>They know about your flaws. They know how much work and/or time it'll take to overcome those flaws. But they know you will eventually overcome them. They love you anyway, and they will always be there for you if you need them.</p><p>There is... an important sense in which your future self doesn't exist. But there are at least two important senses in which they do.</p><p>The first way they exist is a bit speculative, but does match my current sense of how to think about the future. Your future self exists probabilistically.</p><p>They might literally exist, fractionally, depending on your metaphysics.</p><p>They may not literally exist, but there is a real, probabilistic chance that they _will_ exist, and you can pray to the branching possible subjective futures for the most relevant, experienced, competent and compassionate version of yourself to be here with you right now.</p><p>The second way is that they exist inside you. They may have already existed, or they may exist now that you've read this essay. I think it is possible for you to cultivate them, and strengthen your connection with them –&nbsp;no matter how real they are in an objective, externally verifiable future sense.</p><p>And if you struggle to make them real - if they are only on the cusp of realness because simulating future beings is tricky for you, or because you don't believe you can ever overcome the challenges that would prevent you from becoming them....</p><p>...well, I don't know how much this helps, but *I* believe in them. And I believe in your capacity to become them.</p><p>If we know each other well, there are probably specific and concrete ways that I believe in you and your future self. I can't offer this to everyone but I may be able to offer it to people I have an existing relationship with. If we don't know each other well, I'm believing in you in the sense that I believe in everyone. I may not be able to crisply and clearly convey that to you. But it is a real sense. I really do believe in everyone, in this particular way.</p><p>\"This particular way\" is doing a bit of work. I think your coherent, extrapolated self may know things you don't know, and may have learned that some of your goals were misguided. Because your ability to communicate with them is bottlenecked on your current skills and beliefs, I can't vouch for the advice they might give.</p><p>But I <i>can</i> vouch for their empathy, understanding, and love.</p><p>I believe there is at least one potential future where you unfold beautifully, triumphantly. Where you became the epic level version of yourself, with the experience to anticipate and resolve the problems you currently face, and the compassion to reach back through time and hold your hand and say \"Geez, it was awful that we experienced that, and I can't make all these problems go away right now. But I can be there with you to help you through it, and give the best advice we can.\" And maybe something about even listening to someone take you completely at face value is sort of painful somehow, but they understand that too.</p><p>I don't know if this is helpful to you. But I found it helpful to me, and wanted to share.</p>",

In practice, this means that one of the most important parts of successful conflict resolution is your <em>attitude -</em> otherwise, you&#x2019;re liable to misuse the tools you have available. A good attitude will naturally guide you to the right decisions, smooth out minor miscommunications, and build trust. It&#x2019;s the foundation on which all the other parts of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/wwcfhArpZt94pFkNG\">this sequence</a> are built. But what does &#x201C;a good attitude&#x201D; actually look like? While people have many different attitudes toward different parts of their life, there are four specific ones which I think are important for conflict resolution.</p><p>The first attitude has to do with what you&#x2019;re aiming for. Human beings have an unfortunate tendency to try and &#x201C;win&#x201D; arguments in a purely social sense (e.g. via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem\">ad hominem attacks</a>), but victory of that kind is typically <em>not</em> the goal you&#x2019;re interested in if you&#x2019;re reading this essay. Sometimes, the goal we seek is truly as simple as &#x201C;resolving the conflict&#x201D;, though usually it&#x2019;s not. More often, &#x201C;success&#x201D; really means uncovering the truth, or finding a solution where everyone gets what they want, or clearing up some underlying miscommunication. Know what it is you&#x2019;re really aiming for, and set your attitude accordingly. Aim for success, not for victory.</p><p>The second attitude is far simpler since it already has name: humility. Accept that sometimes you just don&#x2019;t have all the information. Accept that sometimes you makes mistakes. Accept that sometimes you honestly just change your mind (or have it changed by someone else). Our ego doesn&#x2019;t like admitting to these things, but they do happen, and digging in your heels to protect your ego is the fastest way to unnecessarily prolong a conflict.</p><p>The third attitude is an attitude toward others. Just like we have an unfortunate tendency to try and &#x201C;win&#x201D; arguments, we also have an unfortunate tendency to view other people in a conflict as &#x201C;enemies&#x201D;. Instead, it is far better to respect and trust your conversational partners, and <em>always</em> assume they are operating <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2017/08/28/good-faith/\">in good faith</a>. That one is so important I&#x2019;m just going to repeat it: <em>assume good faith</em>.</p><p>People often object that this is a naive or dangerous assumption, and in some settings it certainly can be. Past experience with a particular person certainly trumps any possible generalized advice. But I would argue that true bad faith is far, far rarer than most people realize. I see numerous conflicts every year which could have been trivially resolved if everyone involved had assumed good faith instead of jumping to &#x201C;you&#x2019;re a terrible person&#x201D;.</p><p>Finally, on a somewhat different tack from the others, I want to talk a bit about emotions. There is often an attitude (especially among programmers and other more analytically-inclined folks) that emotions are somehow irrelevant to a debate and should be ignored. I&#x2019;m certainly guilty of this myself sometimes. But most of the time in practice I find this to be both false, and quite unhelpful in dealing with conflict. This is probably worth an entire post to itself, but I&#x2019;ll keep it brief: your emotions carry real, valuable information about what you believe and what you value. You shouldn&#x2019;t let them rule you, and quite often they&#x2019;re incorrect or haven&#x2019;t caught up to the moment yet, but they are still both important and useful. Pay them their due.</p><p>This post covered four key attitudes which I find helpful and which are fundamental to how I deal with conflict resolution. In future posts we will tackle <strong>Communication</strong>, <strong>Comprehension</strong>, and <strong>Resolution</strong> with these attitudes in mind. I hope they&#x2019;re as useful to you as they are to me:</p><ol><li>Aim for success, not victory.</li><li>Be humble.</li><li>Assume good faith.</li><li>Pay attention to your emotions (but don&#x2019;t let them rule you).</li></ol>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>(Co-authored with Sailor Vulcan)</p><p>Long ago, in the <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QgYWrqrFoT7XJiFTT/order-and-chaos\">previous article</a></u>, we discussed the processes of guessing and checking, how they explore the unknown and the known, and how they can run in a distinct or subliminal mode. In this article, we&#x2019;ll see how these processes form different mindsets that handle different types of tasks. </p><h1>Mindsets</h1><p><em>Mindsets</em> are feedback loops of guessing and checking running in various modes. Their function is to create different types of maps that can be used for different purposes. </p><p>When using any mindset, the mind searches through hypothesis space in rough order of relevance to information from the territory (guessing) and redistributes its confidence in each hypothesis based on how well it compares against information from the territory and against other hypotheses that it holds in high confidence (checking). </p><p>When either of these processes takes place in the subliminal mode, it runs implicitly. It leaves no record of the iteration or comparison: only the results. When either process takes place in the distinct mode, it leaves an explicit memory of what information was accessed by the process in order to produce the results it did. Each of these modes has advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>Both the processes of guessing and checking are necessary for forming models of reality, but the modes in which these processes run influence what aspects of the model are updated and applied. </p><p>It should be noted that these mindsets do not have solid borders between them. The mindsets described below are analogous to primary colors, or a basis for a multidimensional vector space. They are the simplest way to define the range of skills people can access and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a person&#x2019;s repertoire. </p><p>As such, any limitations ascribed to a mindset are for the purpose of defining the purest and most basic building block form of that mindset. Any person&#x2019;s thought process can blur the distinction between adjacent mindsets, or combine any number of mindsets together. Many of these compound processes I&#x2019;ve already classified as hybrid mindsets, but for the sake of brevity we&#x2019;ll leave those for another article. </p><h2>&#x201C;Relevant&#x201D; Hypotheses</h2><p>Before we get into the mindsets, it should first be noted that throughout this article we will use the word &#x201C;relevant&#x201D; several times in the context of describing hypotheses. What does it mean for a hypothesis to be relevant? </p><p>The process of checking (ideally) uses certain criteria when it considers a hypothesis for inclusion in our map of a particular territory. Based on these criteria, checking will accept or reject the hypothesis to a varying degree. </p><p>One of these criteria should be accuracy: hypotheses contradicted by evidence will make for a map that doesn&#x2019;t match the territory. Checking should reject these hypotheses. </p><p>Simplicity should be another criterion, arguably tied to accuracy by Bayesian reasoning (or Occam&#x2019;s Razor, if you prefer): assuming they are already consistent with the available evidence, hypotheses should not be more complex than the evidence supports. Otherwise, they are likely to make inaccurate predictions about the territory. All else equal, checking should consider a more complex hypothesis less likely than a less complex one. </p><p>A third criterion is <em>relevance to our values</em>: a hypothesis should not be included in our map of a particular territory we care about if it doesn&#x2019;t make predictions about that territory, even if the hypothesis makes accurate predictions about a different territory. The more information a hypothesis gives us about the territory we&#x2019;re focusing on, the more relevant it is for the map of that territory. </p><p>(There may be more criteria people should use, but these three are sufficient for the purposes of this article.) </p><p>To illustrate what we mean by a relevant hypothesis, we can use the example of inventing incandescent lamp (light bulb) technology. If we value having artificial light, then hypotheses that make predictions about what will or won&#x2019;t serve as an incandescent filament are relevant to that value. We test and reject the ones that are inaccurate (&#x201C;paper will work as an incandescent filament&#x201D;) and replace them with hypotheses that are consistent with the evidence (&#x201C;paper will <em>not</em> work as an incandescent filament&#x201D;). </p><p>Accurate hypotheses about what will <em>not</em> work are still relevant, as each failure incrementally increases our knowledge. However, the accurate hypotheses about what <em>will</em> work give us the most information about the territory (&#x201C;tungsten will work as an incandescent filament&#x201D;) and so are usually the most relevant to our values, depending on the situation. </p><p>Accurate hypotheses about territories unrelated to the value of having artificial light, such as the hypothesis that penicillin has antibiotic effects, will be rejected as irrelevant by a checking process that is directed towards mapping the territory of artificial light technology. </p><p>This understanding of criteria that the checking process can use is important for describing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the mindsets. </p><h1>Primary mindsets</h1><p>The four primary mindsets are the simplest pairings of guessing and checking in the distinct and subliminal modes. They define the most basic functions that a mind can perform. </p><h2>Operation mindset</h2><p>Operation mindset uses the subliminal mode to store all its information about the territory in a cache. </p><p>The processes of guessing and checking take place subliminally, building high-resolution maps of localized situations that most people call &#x201C;intuition&#x201D;. These maps <em>shape effort</em>: they guide a person&#x2019;s movements to conform to the environment to get their desired results. The way to use operation mindset is to repeatedly practice interacting with environments that give consistent and immediate feedback. </p><p>One advantage of operation mindset is that the cache reduces the burden on your working memory, so you can use operation mindset for a long time before becoming mentally fatigued. With enough practice you can perform rote behaviors with operation while simultaneously using working memory for other purposes. Another advantage of operation is that a cached map can guide complex movements in real time and provide fast and accurate answers in complex situations, provided the situations are familiar. </p><p>However, operation also has several disadvantages compared to other mindsets. </p><p>Firstly, the cached map cannot be directly accessed. Its information is stored as implicit correlations between myriad factors rather than as explicit statements, which makes it difficult to share with others. It also means that to review and update your intuition for a changing situation requires further repetitive training. Without the ability to accept ad hoc edits, intuition alone is powerless in situations with changing parameters and delayed feedback. </p><p>Furthermore, the process of subliminal guessing does not range far in its exploration of hypothesis space, so non-local maxima of accuracy or relevance may go unnoticed. Operation may attempt to refine an ultimately futile method rather than approaching from a different angle. </p><p>Finally, the process of subliminal checking does not register nuance regarding which aspects of a hypothesis don&#x2019;t match the situation, and so operation can reject hypotheses that could be redeemed with only minor revisions. Operation can only map what it can directly interact with, which means abstract reasoning and logical principles are outside its grasp. </p><p>Examples of use: </p><ul><li>Physical coordination</li><li>Rote daily routines</li><li>Sports</li><li>Martial arts</li><li>Dance</li><li>Crafting</li><li>Using tools</li><li>Piloting vehicles</li></ul><h2>Synthesis mindset</h2><p>Synthesis mindset uses the distinct mode to handle its guessing, and the subliminal mode to cache its check, so to speak. </p><p>The distinct mode of guessing roves through hypothesis space based on the information fed to it. It can branch out and build on the ideas (hypotheses) it finds because it has an explicit record of where it&#x2019;s been. Subliminal checking runs some basic comparisons to make sure that the hypotheses are coherent enough to be expressible. In this way, synthesis mindset <em>generates ideas</em> that form maps of wide-ranging possibilities for our consideration. </p><p>The way to use synthesis mindset is to allow your mind to wander through free association while suspending judgment of the accuracy or relevance of the hypotheses you encounter. It also helps to deliberately remove assumptions about certain ideas, and to toy with mixing multiple ideas together. This process is often called &#x201C;being creative&#x201D; or &#x201C;using your imagination.&#x201D; </p><p>One advantage of synthesis mindset is that in its travels through hypothesis space, it reveals non-local maxima of accuracy or relevance, even if it cannot recognize them as such. The non-obvious hypotheses it comes up with may ultimately turn out to be more accurate or relevant than those you already have, and without using your imagination you would not have considered them. </p><p>The obvious disadvantage of synthesis mindset is that it has little power to screen the hypotheses it finds for accuracy or relevance. Synthesis cannot learn to smoothly navigate situations, nor to compare various options, nor to judge its hypotheses against the territory. For many serious problems, synthesis is necessary but insufficient to identify an effective solution. </p><p>Examples of use: </p><ul><li>Brainstorming</li><li>Art</li><li>Literature</li><li>Poetry</li></ul><h2>Analysis mindset</h2><p>Analysis mindset uses the subliminal mode to cache its guessing, and the distinct mode to pick up the check. </p><p>The subliminal mode of guessing keys off a situation and offers up the closest hypotheses to hand. The distinct checking process uses working memory to inspect each idea (hypothesis) to make sure it matches the observed data in all ways and to explicitly account for its findings. For any discrepancies, it may reject a hypothesis outright or request the guessing process to produce a revision to patch the flaw. In this way, analysis mindset can <em>evaluate ideas</em> against large samples of data from the territory to produce explicit, nuanced maps of the generalizable principles governing the territory&#x2019;s causal relationships. </p><p>One way to use analysis is to take note of discrepancies between ideas and reality. A good starting point is to describe each mismatch accurately and with nuance, acknowledging which aspects of an idea are compatible with evidence and which are not, and why. It helps to continue by honestly investigating anything that challenges your map, and seeking out more information to test your map against it. In the process, you can consider alternative ideas that could contribute to an explanation of the evidence you see. It&#x2019;s also important to explore the logical implications of each idea: what else would you expect to see if the idea were true? </p><p>A major advantage of analysis mindset is that the maps it forms of principles and causality can be used to figure out how processes and systems work. These maps can also predict the outcomes of unprecedented situations, sometimes with explicit probability estimates. Furthermore, analysis mindset helps correct errors in your models of reality by rejecting hypotheses that contradict observation or that are gratuitously complex. Upon discovering new information, you can update your maps ad hoc. </p><p>However, analysis has some disadvantages compared to other mindsets. </p><p>Firstly, analysis does not have access to non-obvious hypotheses unless they have already been brought to its attention. If the hypothesis most closely matching the territory isn&#x2019;t already within reach of analysis&#x2019;s cached guessing, analysis will either rule out all its hypotheses and fail to map the territory, or it will match the closest hypothesis to hand, either with overcomplicated patches or with exposed flaws labeled as anomalies. </p><p>Secondly, analysis cannot respond smoothly to situations requiring subtle movements or fine-tuned navigation in real time. The process of distinct checking takes too much time meticulously comparing each hypothesis to the territory, and by the time it finds the correct move the situation has already changed. </p><p>Lastly, analysis is ill-suited to come up with plans that fulfill multiple goals with the resources at hand. Even with its accurate maps of the principles governing a situation, the cached guessing process of analysis mindset does not range far enough to quickly identify and explore the different general approaches, or to consider non-obvious options. Moreover, the ability of analysis to identify discrepancies is insufficient for forming value judgments on what risks are subjectively worth taking. It is usually necessary to use explicit guessing in some capacity to explore the various options opened up by a decision in order to gauge its desirability relative to the alternatives. </p><p>Examples of use: </p><ul><li>History</li><li>Science</li><li>Applied mathematics</li><li>Economics</li><li>Literary criticism</li></ul><h2>Organization mindset</h2><p>Organization mindset uses the distinct mode to handle both guessing and checking, employing working memory to direct and track the activities of these processes. </p><p>The distinct processes of guessing and checking build explicit maps of systems and their most salient features. These maps help <em>allocate efforts </em>to enable you to achieve as many desired goals as possible. </p><p>To use organization mindset, you can review your various goals and the resources that are directly and indirectly available. You can then consider different options for using those resources to attempt to achieve as many goals as possible, and what the relative tradeoffs and constraints are for each option. </p><p>One advantage of organization mindset is that it suggests different plans and explicitly compares their marginal costs and benefits. Unlike with operation mindset, these suggestions and assessments can incorporate expectations about delayed or remote effects, and can be updated ad hoc when the situation changes. Organization can also anticipate how different efforts may affect each other and what can be done to make them compatible. </p><p>A disadvantage of organization mindset is that your working memory has tighter restrictions than your cache on how much information can be processed at once (and on how long it can be used before needing to rest, in biological brains). To cope with these limitations, organization used properly will ignore any details that aren&#x2019;t obviously important. </p><p>Additionally, compared to synthesis mindset, organization mindset explores less of hypothesis space through guessing, so it may still fail to notice some non-local maxima of accuracy or relevance. In other words, it may not be imaginative enough to see less familiar possibilities. </p><p>Conversely, compared to analysis, organization mindset may miss some points of mismatch between its maps and reality, and can fail to apply enough distinct checking to catch flaws in its plans. </p><p>Examples of use: </p><ul><li>Finance and budgeting</li><li>Planning and logistics</li><li>Administration and management</li></ul><h1>Secondary mindsets</h1><p>Mindsets can be combined in a variety of ways. When you combine two primary mindsets which aren&apos;t opposites, you get a secondary mindset. The four secondary mindsets are described below. </p><h2>Empathy mindset</h2><p>Empathy mindset uses the subliminal mode to handle both guessing and checking, and uses the distinct mode to handle guessing. It combines operation and synthesis to create maps of immediate possibilities and to navigate them intuitively. These maps help <em>individualize interactions</em> by exploring situations with hidden variables and handling their idiosyncrasies. </p><p>To practice empathy mindset, you must interact with an entity that changes internal states in response to interactions and to its environment. One way to use empathy is to borrow existing intuitions regarding similar situations in order to help model the current entity, and use imagination in order to tailor those intuitions to fit. Another approach to empathy is to imagine scenarios and then intuit how the entity you&#x2019;re dealing with might respond to them. Yet another approach is to start with desired responses, and then imagine and intuit ways in which the entity might be led to respond in such a way. Cautiously introduce variations in how you interact with the entity to see how that affects what it does. </p><p>One advantage of empathy mindset is that it can more effectively interact with and influence subtle and temperamental entities than any other basic mindset, and achieve otherwise unlikely outcomes. Empathy can also maintain desired behavior from entities even in variable situations and environments. It combines the graceful navigation of operation with the expanded hypothesis space of synthesis to dynamically generate and try out creative options for what approaches will be most effective. </p><p>A disadvantage of empathy mindset is that the individualized and implicit maps it creates are often difficult to explain or generalize. In addition, not all entities have idiosyncrasies that allow a person to influence them through skillful interaction; some entities are highly consistent. Finally, it is possible for attempts at empathy to backfire, depending on how far outside your local map you have ventured in the exploration of possibilities. </p><p>Examples of use: </p><ul><li>Psychological therapy </li><li>Diplomacy</li><li>Human social interaction</li><li>Animal training</li><li>Culinary arts</li></ul><h2>Semantics mindset</h2><p>Semantics mindset uses the subliminal mode to handle guessing and checking, but also uses the distinct mode to handle checking. It combines operation and analysis to create streamlined maps of general principles that can be applied intuitively to <em>simplify interactions</em>. </p><p>One way to use semantics mindset is to learn a lexicon of labels and rules, then practice applying them in appropriate situations until they become intuitive. Another way to use semantics is to learn and practice applying basic ideas or techniques until they become intuitive, then work your way up to more complicated situations which require you to use them together as a functional vocabulary. </p><p>One advantage of semantics mindset is that when calibrated to a set of situations meeting certain requirements, it is faster and easier than analysis mindset. Semantics uses assumptions in the form of cached checking to reduce the amount of working memory that it uses on checking. This enables large, complex problems to be simplified into modules. Thus equipped, semantics can quickly infer information that is not immediately evident. </p><p>Another advantage to semantics is that it is more generalizable than operation, enabling you to intuitively solve different problems within the same paradigm by adjusting the input parameters. Semantics is capable of conveying nuanced information and updating it ad hoc by applying the distinct checking of analysis. </p><p>A major disadvantage of semantics mindset is that like operation, it starts producing the wrong answers when the assumptions that it is based on are invalid. Additionally, semantics requires explicit rules and labels in order to form useful maps of situations. In a situation where no consistent rules can be inferred explicitly, semantics mindset cannot function effectively any more than analysis can. </p><p>Examples of use: </p><ul><li>Mathematics</li><li>Physics</li><li>Software</li><li>Law practice</li></ul><h2>Tactics mindset</h2><p>Tactics mindset uses the subliminal mode to handle checking and the distinct mode to handle both guessing and checking. It combines organization and synthesis to map in more detail the possibilities afforded to you based on your available resources. It uses its maps to identify ways in which you can <em>redirect paths</em>. </p><p>One way to use tactics mindset is to start by taking inventory of what goals you have and the options your resources afford you. You can then start questioning your assumptions about what you can&#x2019;t do with those resources, or about what you can call a resource in the first place. </p><p>Another way to use tactics is to start by brainstorming clever applications of resources you&#x2019;d like to try out or feats you would like to accomplish. You can then think about how you can apply your existing resources to implement those ideas. </p><p>Tactics combines the pragmatic weighing of options that organization provides with the wider range of hypotheses from synthesis. The major advantage of tactics mindset is that it allows you to come up with plans to accomplish feats that are not obviously possible or available. If a feat appears impossible, tactics is your best bet to find the way to make it happen. If your range of options seems narrow, tactics can expand your awareness of your options. </p><p>A major disadvantage of tactics mindset is that the possibilities it opens up may have side effects or points of weakness that the mindset won&#x2019;t notice. If a person gets too clever and neglects strategy, the solution provided by tactics may cause more trouble than the original problem. Another disadvantage of tactics is that its grounding in your available resources may limit how much of hypothesis space it explores, preventing it from effectively handling abstract ideas as well as synthesis alone might. Finally, compared to organization, the approaches that tactics comes up with may be less efficient. That&#x2019;s not a problem when the solution wouldn&#x2019;t even be found if not for tactics, but an inexperienced user of tactics may often overlook a sensible and practical solution in favor of a clever one. </p><p> Examples of use: </p><ul><li>Repurposing old and broken objects</li><li>Repurposing objects to do something you need right now</li><li>Zany schemes</li><li>Warfare</li><li>Board games</li></ul><h2>Strategy mindset</h2><p>Strategy mindset uses the subliminal mode to handle guessing, and uses the distinct mode to handle both guessing and checking. It combines organization and analysis to map the effects of different options in more detail, the requirements for them to work, the relative costs and benefits of those implications, and further options that would be relevant to dealing with them. It uses these maps to identify ways in which you may want to <em>fortify paths</em>. </p><p>One way to use strategy mindset is to start by considering various goals and options, and then asking yourself what the logical consequences of those options would be and what the assumptions are that they rely on. Another way is to start by considering the different matches and mismatches of various hypotheses, and then considering the marginal benefit of increased accuracy, discarding questions that are not likely to be worth the effort invested into them. </p><p>A major advantage of strategy mindset is that it allows you to see and address weaknesses in plans, by spending resources to set things up so that even if an assumption fails and a contingency occurs, the plan can still work. The foresight strategy affords allows you to prevent unwanted outcomes and thereby make the desired outcomes more likely. Strategy mindset also increases the efficiency of investigating discrepancies in knowledge by prioritizing the effort based on your own goals. </p><p>A disadvantage of strategy is that it is less geared towards getting accurate pictures of generalized principles than regular analysis is. Another disadvantage is that strategy may rely too heavily on its foresight compared to organization, causing analysis-paralysis when the best option may be to choose something good enough and reevaluate it later. Furthermore, while strategy mindset is useful for closing unwanted possibilities, it is less able to open possibilities of success, leading a person to conclude that all options have unacceptable side effects without realizing there are ways to overcome those problems. </p><p>Examples of use: </p><ul><li>Risk management</li><li>Safety measures</li><li>Emergency response</li><li>Warfare</li><li>Board games</li></ul><h1>Recap</h1><p>Now we&#x2019;ve looked at the eight primary and secondary mindsets, the different maps they build and the processes they use to do so, and their relative strengths and weaknesses. </p><ul><li><strong>Operation</strong> mindset <strong>shapes effort</strong></li><ul><li>Pairs subliminal guessing and checking</li></ul><li><strong>Synthesis</strong> mindset <strong>generates ideas</strong></li><ul><li>Pairs subliminal checking with distinct guessing</li></ul><li><strong>Analysis</strong> mindset <strong>evaluates ideas</strong></li><ul><li>Pairs subliminal guessing with distinct checking</li></ul><li><strong>Organization</strong> mindset <strong>allocates effort</strong></li><ul><li>Pairs distinct guessing and checking</li></ul><li><strong>Empathy</strong> mindset <strong>individualizes interactions</strong></li><ul><li>Combines operation and synthesis</li></ul><li><strong>Semantics</strong> mindset <strong>simplifies interactions</strong></li><ul><li>Combines operation and analysis</li></ul><li><strong>Tactics</strong> mindsets <strong>redirects paths</strong></li><ul><li>Combines organization and synthesis</li></ul><li><strong>Strategy</strong> mindset <strong>fortifies paths</strong></li><ul><li>Combines organization and analysis</li></ul></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GMTjNh5oxk4a3qbgZ/the-foundational-toolbox-for-life-introduction-1\">the introduction to this sequence</a></u>, I expressed my frustration that people consistently failed to apply what I considered &#x201C;common sense&#x201D; to solve critical problems.

    "htmlBody": "<p>In my recent post on <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/transistors-science-and-invention\">the case study of the transistor</a>, we saw that the research that led to its invention did not fall neatly into the categories of &#x201C;basic&#x201D; vs. &#x201C;applied&#x201D;, but in fact cycled rapidly between them.</p><p>An entire book&#x2014;<em>Pasteur&#x2019;s Quadrant</em>, by Donald Stokes&#x2014;is dedicated to the thesis that &#x201C;basic&#x201D; vs. &#x201C;applied&#x201D; is a false dichotomy that is harming science funding.</p><p>The core idea of <em>Pasteur&#x2019;s Quadrant</em> is that basic and applied research are not opposed, but orthogonal. Instead of a one-dimensional spectrum, with motion towards &#x201C;basic&#x201D; taking you further away from &#x201C;applied&#x201D;, and vice versa, he proposes a two-dimensional classification, with one axis being &#x201C;inspired by the quest for fundamental understanding&#x201D; and the other being &#x201C;inspired by considerations of use&#x201D;:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/img/pasteurs-quadrant.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>I find these phrases somewhat cumbersome, given their centrality to the thesis, so let&#x2019;s call them &#x201C;discovery&#x201D; and &#x201C;invention&#x201D; for short.</p><p>In Stokes&#x2019;s classification, research aiming at discovery, with no thought of invention&#x2014;&#x201C;pure basic research&#x201D;&#x2014;is characterized by Bohr&#x2019;s search for a model to explain the atom, and hence labeled &#x201C;Bohr&#x2019;s quadrant&#x201D;. The opposite, &#x201C;pure applied research&#x201D;, or invention with no attempt at discovery, is characterized by Edison and his lab, who tinkered endlessly to engineer products such as the light bulb, with little heed to theory: &#x201C;Edison&#x2019;s quadrant&#x201D;. But, crucially for Stokes, there is research that combines discovery and invention, motivated by both at the same time. &#x201C;Pasteur&#x2019;s quadrant&#x201D; is characterized by the career of the <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/books/louis-pasteur-free-lance-of-science\">great scientist</a> who gave us both the germ theory of disease <em>and</em> the first engineered vaccines.</p><p>Stokes traces the history of the basic-applied dichotomy back to ancient Greece, where they had different words for different types of knowledge: <em>episteme</em> for scientific knowledge, and <em>techne</em> for the practical arts. Long before <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/the-baconian-program\">the Baconian program</a>, <em>episteme</em> was not seen as the basis of <em>techne</em>&#x2014;nor was it, at the time. Mathematics, astronomy, and natural philosophy were ends in themselves, pursued for the pleasure of knowing, not with practical goals in mind. Plato formalized this by elevating conceptual knowledge to a higher realm, of which daily life was a mere imperfect reflection. His influence extended all the way to 19th-century Germany, where the modern research university was conceived, as a place for scientists to pursue scholarship in complete freedom. This model was ultimately exported to the United States in the late 1800s.</p><p>The modern American research funding paradigm was essentially established by Vannevar Bush at the end of World War II. During the war, government greatly increased funding for research, and great strides were made: radar, penicillin, malaria drugs, the proximity fuse, and of course the atomic bomb. As the war was ending, researchers wanted to keep their government funding, but also feared government micromanagement. How could they have both money and freedom?</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Bush&#x2019;s solution was the vision laid out in his famous report, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf50/vbush1945.jsp\">Science, The Endless Frontier</a>&#x201D; (written at President Roosevelt&#x2019;s request). In the report, Bush said that &#x201C;basic scientific research&#x201D; would lead to all manner of practical benefits:</p><blockquote>Advances in science when put to practical use mean more jobs, higher wages, shorter hours, more abundant crops, more leisure for recreation, for study, for learning how to live without the deadening drudgery which has been the burden of the common man for ages past. Advances in science will also bring higher standards of living, will lead to the prevention or cure of diseases, will promote conservation of our limited national resources, and will assure means of defense against aggression.</blockquote><p>But, paradoxically, basic research is not and <em>cannot</em> be explicitly directed at those benefits:</p><blockquote>Basic research is performed without thought of practical ends. &#x2026; The scientist doing basic research may not be at all interested in the practical applications of his work, yet the further progress of industrial development would eventually stagnate if basic scientific research were long neglected.</blockquote><p>Therefore, &#x201C;freedom of inquiry must be preserved&#x201D;:</p><blockquote>Scientific progress on a broad front results from the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown. &#x2026;</blockquote><p>And later:</p><blockquote>&#x2026; the primary obligation of the medical schools and universities is to continue the traditional function of such institutions, namely, to provide the individual worker with an opportunity for free, untrammeled study of nature, in the directions and by the methods suggested by his interests, curiosity, and imagination. The history of medical science teaches clearly the supreme importance of affording the prepared mind complete freedom for the exercise of initiative.</blockquote><p>So in short, Bush&#x2019;s message was: Invest in research with no thought of the return, and it <em>will</em> be returned many times over. Pump money into science, and it will trickle down to the economy. Give scientists absolute freedom to pursue their curiosity wherever it might lead, and it will ultimately lead to security and prosperity.</p><p>And he was not wrong. There is a large degree of truth in this message. But Stokes argues that Bush set up what I&#x2019;ll call the &#x201C;basic-applied dichotomy&#x201D;, and that we need to overcome this and recognize the importance of Pasteur&#x2019;s quadrant.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>What&#x2019;s the right way to categorize research?</p><p>I find Stokes&#x2019;s two-by-two, if not quite compelling, then at least intriguing (and certainly better than the litany of prior approaches he outlines).</p><p>Naming the third quadrant after Pasteur is apt, because more than anyone else I know of, Pasteur&#x2019;s career exemplifies the integration of science and engineering in a single mind. Tasked with improving the processes of French wine, beer, and vinegar makers, a mundane industrial engineering project aimed at iterative improvement, he showed the role of bacteria in fermentation, and discovered anaerobic metabolism&#x2014;a breakthrough in microbiology. Decades later, when studying diseases of livestock, a purely scientific research project, a botched experimental setup gave him the clue that he followed to create the first engineered vaccine, a watershed invention in medicine. Clearly this was a man with the aptitude and the inclination to pursue both scientific knowledge and practical applications. And it was Pasteur who said, &#x201C;There does not exist a category of science to which one can give the name applied science. There are sciences and the applications of science, bound together as the fruit of the tree which bears it.&#x201D;</p><p><a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/transistors-science-and-invention\">The case of the transistor</a>, too, defies simple categorization as &#x201C;basic&#x201D;&#xA0;or &#x201C;applied&#x201D; research. It was an inventive goal that required the inventors, multiple times, to make an excursion into scientific theory and to advance our understanding of matter, before returning once again to engineering. Nylon, created at DuPont, was a case of an invention that arose fortuitously out of research into polymer chemistry.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t think we can understand these examples simply by putting discovery and invention on orthogonal axes and declaring that there is a quadrant at their intersection. What I see in these examples is that any project or lab, at any point in time, has a goal which is either discovery or invention. But the researchers were able to quickly pivot from one to the other, either from necessity or from opportunity.</p><p>So Pasteur&#x2019;s fermentation work is a case of an inventive goal (improved processes) that turned into a more important scientific goal (understanding anaerobic metabolism). His vaccine work was the reverse: a scientific goal (understanding livestock diseases) that turned into a very valuable practical goal. The transistor work was a case of an inventive goal that required scientific goals for its completion. (The logical fourth possibility, a scientific discovery goal that required invention, could perhaps be represented by an innovative experiment such as the Michelson-Morley attempt to detect the ether, for which Michelson invented an interferometer.)</p><p>&#x201C;Pasteur&#x2019;s quadrant&#x201D;, as described by Stokes, seems to be a type of research which is <em>simultaneously</em> motivated by discovery and invention. But what&#x2019;s interesting about these examples is the rapid, flexible cycling back and forth between them.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>If this mode of research is important, what are the implications for how research is funded, organized and managed?</p><p>First, we must have people, projects, and labs that can do both science and invention.</p><p>To have people who can do both, they should be trained in both. More importantly, there must be a <em>role</em> that embraces both. This affects evaluation, compensation, promotions, and overall career paths. Further, the role should be recognized by society. This encompasses everything from students learning about it as a career option, to accolades for the top achievers.</p><p>To have projects and labs that do both, they need to be set up, funded, and evaluated with this mode of research in mind. They need the freedom to pivot quickly between science and invention as the need or opportunity arises.</p><p>In particular, I think we need ambitious programs of invention that are willing to push the frontiers of knowledge&#x2014;that is, to do science&#x2014;in order to succeed. Such projects may need broad goals and loose timeframes (see again the <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/transistors-science-and-invention\">transistor case</a>). Who does this today? Corporate research labs don&#x2019;t seem to be this ambitious anymore, and startups generally don&#x2019;t have this kind of funding and aren&#x2019;t able to take on this kind of risk.</p><p>We also need scientific research done by people who are capable of seizing the opportunity for invention when it comes along. Who does this now? At least some of this is done in university labs, but in between the invention and the market is a process of &#x201C;technology transfer&#x201D; with a reputation for being cumbersome and inefficient.</p><p>Arguably, we should have some of our best scientists occasionally tackle purely practical engineering problems, to shake up their research and expose them to fortuitous insights. Does this happen today? Perhaps through consulting with industry?</p><p>These are some of my preliminary conclusions from considering these case studies and from reading <em>Pasteur&#x2019;s Quadrant</em>.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>As researchers and philosophers discuss the path towards human-equivalent / superhuman general artificial intelligence, they frequently examine the concept of control. Control of our world has always been of central importance to our species, so it&#x2019;s no surprise that we&#x2019;d look to extend our control in the future. However, most of the currently discussed control methods miss a crucial point about intelligence &#x2013; specifically the fact that it is a fluid, emergent property, which does not lend itself to control in the ways we&#x2019;re used to. These methods treat the problem as an algorithmic one, directly addressed with specific instructions that can be encoded to ensure proper behavior (harkening back to Asimov&#x2019;s Three Laws of Robotics) &#x2013; but the AI of tomorrow will not behave (or be controlled) like the computers of today. Emergent intelligence can&#x2019;t be boxed up directly at an algorithmic level because this level is fluid, with constant shifts and changes that give the instructions no base to latch onto; the best we can hope for is to control it through a system of indirect rewards and punishments (much as we control human behavior today).</p><p>Before diving into the concepts of AI and control, it may be helpful to take a step back and align on the concept of emergence. An emergent property of an arrangement of objects is a property which could not be predicted based on the attributes of the objects themselves. This definition is a bit dense &#x2013; so as an example, think of a river with a rock in the middle of it. For a common observer, with standard concepts of &#x201C;river&#x201D; and &#x201C;rock&#x201D;, the expectation would be that the water flows cleanly around the rock. However, upon further examination, they would find that the river + rock system results in whirlpools forming behind the rock as the water flows around it. In this example, the whirlpool is an emergent property of the river + rock system. This example highlights another key facet of emergence &#x2013; it is dependent on the observer. In the situation just reviewed, the whirlpools being an emergent property depends on the observers limited concepts of &#x201C;river&#x201D; and &#x201C;rock&#x201D;; an experienced kayaker would expect the system to generate whirlpools (although they would lack predictive power of the type / size of whirlpool formed). We could even imagine a scientist that understands the system not as a river and rock, but as hundreds of trillions of individual molecules bumping into each other; as long as the scientist stays at this level of observation and explanation, very little is emergent (but also, very little is predictable) &#x2013; emergence requires the use of limited concepts (which most human concepts are).</p><p>Let&#x2019;s now extend the whirlpool example to take a look at how control and emergence play together. The first step in controlling something is to be able to create an instance of that something &#x2013; so for this example, we need to understand what is required to create a whirlpool. Although whirlpools are emergent, it doesn&#x2019;t take much to understand how to create them; after seeing a river with rocks in it, we quickly grasp the fact that it requires running water and an obstacle. In fact, we can create a new whirlpool simply by adding a rock to the river. Creation is only the first step in control, however; the more complete control we&#x2019;re looking for requires influencing the actual behavior of the whirlpool. When we start trying to control the whirlpool&#x2019;s behavior in this way, we realize this is a much more difficult problem than creation, as a variety of different factors (the size and shape of the rock, the speed and depth of the water, etc.) influence the behavior in complex ways. Creation is easy because we only need to understand the &#x201C;initial conditions&#x201D; required to form a whirlpool; we only need to supply the running water and the obstacle, and then let the laws of physics take it from there. To control the behavior, however, we actually need to understand the different ways in which these laws of physics come together to bring about the whirlpool (how the whirlpool &#x201C;emerges&#x201D; from them); we&#x2019;d need to use mathematical models to figure out the structure required to drive specific types of behavior. Interestingly, the control problem is equally hard regardless of whether we seek total control (i.e. fully prescribing whirlpool behavior) or partial control (i.e. keep the whirlpool diameter at 3cm), as all parts of the behavior are interconnected, and so we&#x2019;ll need to model complete behavior even if only seeking partial control (although there will be more &#x201C;solutions&#x201D; when seeking partial control). We can look to control behavior in other, more external ways (such as adding physical constraints in the water behind the rock), but the control offered by these methods will be inexact (unless we again construct a complete mathematical model of behavior, incorporating the constraints).&#xA0;</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YN9eXsX4jBCYOUcKBKdhCm0nO_J16_FX15oanjyYemqDxSpjhZxzBFLHta0od25owwQsv5laLq2o_kP1nEeZFsd7z7oCHfCkWxrsZ137WJB_gbI3xJUrYc_2PjbZgeQwsU6J3gBr\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:95%\"></figure></span><p>The whirlpool has served as a helpful example for highlighting the concepts of emergence and control, but it&#x2019;s time for us to turn back to our main topic, intelligence. <a href=\"https://mybrainsthoughts.com/?p=61\">This prior post</a> covers the nature of intelligence in more depth &#x2013; here, we&#x2019;ll focus just briefly on it&#x2019;s emergent nature. The foundational element of intelligence in life on earth is the neuron, and the behavior of a single neuron is well described. The typical neuron has inputs (dendrites) and an output (axon), with the output being activated when the inputs reach a certain voltage level. Intelligence (and learning, wisdom, knowledge, emotion, feeling, etc.) is an emergent phenomenon when these neurons are arranged in a particular type of way (in conjunction with all the other structures required for a living organism). When arranged in the right way, these neurons are able to recognize patterns in the world and leverage these patterns to increase the organism&#x2019;s chances of surviving and reproducing.&#xA0;</p><p>The crucial parallel between intelligence and the whirlpool is that, like for the whirlpool, controlling intelligence requires a greater degree of understanding than is necessary to create it. While we&#x2019;re still quite far from any sort of general artificial intelligence, the first intelligences we do create will arise because we&#x2019;ve figured out what &#x201C;initial structure&#x201D; is required for groups of neurons to recognize patterns and act intelligently. Crafting an &#x201C;initial structure&#x201D; in this way will not require a full understanding of how all parts of the brain work over time &#x2013; it will only require a general understanding of the right way to connect neurons and how these connections are to be updated over time (much as we didn&#x2019;t need a complete understanding of the laws of physics behind whirlpools to create them; we just needed to understand that a rock in a river would give rise to them). We won&#x2019;t fully understand the mechanisms which drive this &#x201C;initial structure&#x201D; towards intelligence (think of how hard it is to understand even a whirlpool at this level!) and so we won&#x2019;t have an ability to control these intelligences directly. We won&#x2019;t be able to encode instructions like &#x201C;do no harm to humans&#x201D; as we won&#x2019;t understand how the system represents these concepts (and moreover, the system&#x2019;s representations of these concepts will be constantly changing, as must be the case for any system capable of learning!) The root of intelligence lies in its fluidity, but this same fluidity makes it impossible (or at least, computationally infeasible) to control with direct constraints. It&#x2019;s much easier to understand the general neuron layout required for intelligence than it is to understand exactly how concepts are encoded in our brains and how those concepts change over time (which would be required for control). Luckily, we have significant experience as a species controlling intelligent systems indirectly &#x2013; our robust system of law is a testament to this ability. We&#x2019;ll need to rely on these same techniques when dealing with artificially intelligent systems, just as we do when dealing with other humans.</p><p>While we&#x2019;re still very far from creating any sort of general artificial intelligence, we have made enough progress to see the emergent aspect of intelligence directly and to better understand the limitations associated with control. Before addressing this point further, it will be helpful to have an understanding of how machine learning (specifically image recognition) works today; <a href=\"https://mybrainsthoughts.com/?p=124\">this post</a> provides additional details, but I&#x2019;ll give a short summary here. Machine learning consists of simulating a large number of &#x201C;neurons&#x201D; with randomly weighted connections to each other, then using a large number of examples to &#x201C;train&#x201D; the system, with the initially randomized weights updated on each run to more accurately label the test images. For example, if training the system to recognize cats, you would show it thousands of pictures of both cats and non-cats (fed in as pixel values), with the system making a prediction on each image. After every batch of images, the connection weights are updated such that they system would have made more accurate predictions for the batch (the exact mathematics aren&#x2019;t important here, but this is possible as the function of the total system is differentiable).&#xA0; Machine learning is powerful because it doesn&#x2019;t require a programmer to understand anything about the features of the object that must be recognized &#x2013; all the programmer needs is the algorithm and a vast number of training examples. When training a system to recognize a cat, the programmer doesn&#x2019;t need to think at all about things like claws or fur or whiskers; instead, they think in terms of the general structure of the neuron system (i.e. 1000 neurons on layer 1, connected to 200 neurons on level 2, etc.) The programmer sets up the &#x201C;initial conditions&#x201D; (like the river and the rock), then lets the tendencies of the algorithm (like the laws of physics) run their course, creating a system which can recognize the desired image. Even once the system is &#x201C;trained&#x201D; and able to recognize the desired image, the programmer still has only a limited understanding of <em>how</em> the system does the recognizing &#x2013; they can use certain techniques to understand the types of patterns recognized at each level of the system, but it&#x2019;s extremely difficult to understand holistically what is happening; all the programmer knows is that the specific combination of neurons and connections now works to identify cats. This limited understanding means any sort of exact control of the system is off the table &#x2013; for example, there&#x2019;s no way for a programmer to structure the algorithm in a way so as to avoid identifying a certain type of cat. The programmer could force this type of cat not to be recognized using external methods (i.e. labeling images of that type of cat as &#x201C;not a cat&#x201D;), but there&#x2019;s no way to disqualify a specific cat at the algorithmic level, as <em>it&#x2019;s not clear how that type of cat is represented</em>. A deeper knowledge of the workings of the system would be required for this type of control to be exacted, and we&#x2019;re quite far from having that level of knowledge even with the more simplistic AI programs of today. As we move towards more complex programs with generalized intelligence, the gap between creation and control will only widen, leaving us with intelligent programs at least as opaque to us as we are to each other.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZyWyAJbedvEgRT2uF/inaccessible-information\">Inaccessible Information</a>, Paul Christiano lays out a fundamental challenge in training machine learning systems to give us insight into parts of the world that we cannot directly verify. The core problem he lays out is as follows.</p>\n<p>Suppose we lived in a world that had invented machine learning but not Newtonian mechanics. And suppose we trained some machine learning model to predict the motion of the planets across the sky -- we could do this by observing the position of the planets over, say, a few hundred days, and using this as training data for, say, a recurrent neural network. And suppose further that this worked and our training process yielded a model that output highly accurate predictions many days into the future. If all we wanted was to know the position of the planets in the sky then -- good news -- we’re done. But we might hope to use our model to gain some direct insight into the nature of the motion of the planets (i.e. the laws of gravity, although we wouldn’t know that this is what we were looking for).</p>\n<p>Presumably the machine learning model has in some sense discovered Newtonian mechanics using the training data we fed it, since this is surely the most compact way to predict the position of the planets far into the future. But we certainly can’t just read off the laws of Newtonian mechanics by looking at the millions or billions or trillions of weights in the trained model. How might we extract insight into the nature of the motion of the planets from this model?</p>\n<p>Well we might train a model to output both predictions about the position of the planets in the sky and a natural language description of what’s really going on behind the scenes (i.e. the laws of gravity). We’re assuming that we have enough training data that the training process was already able to derive these laws, so it’s not unreasonable to train a model that also outputs such legible descriptions. But in order to train a model that outputs such legible descriptions we need to generate a reward signal that incentivizes the right kind of legible descriptions. And herein lies the core of the problem: in this hypothesized world we do not know the true laws of Newtonian mechanics, so we cannot generate a reward signal by comparing the output of our model to ground truth during training. We might instead generate a reward signal that (1) measures how accurate the predictions of the position of the planets are, and (2) measures how succinct and plausible the legible descriptions are. But then what we are really training is a model that is good at producing succinct descriptions that seem plausible to humans. This may be a very very different (and dangerous) thing to do since there are lots of ways that a description can seem plausible to a human while being quite divorced from the truth.</p>\n<p>Christiano calls this the instrumental policy: the policy that produces succinct descriptions that merely seem plausible to humans:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The real problem comes from what I’ll call the instrumental policy. Let’s say we’ve tried to dream up a loss function L(x, y) to incentivize the model to correctly answer information we can check, and give at least plausible and consistent answers on things we can’t check. By definition, the values L(x, y) are themselves accessible. Then it’s natural to learn a policy like: “on input x, produce the output y for which the loss L(x, y) will be minimal.” Let’s write BAD for this policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Christiano uses the term “inaccessible information” for information like the laws of gravity in this example: information about the underlying nature of things that a machine learning model might learn quite accurately as latent info in service of making predictions, but that is difficult to extract directly due to the difficulty of constructing a reward signal that correctly incentives the model to explain it clearly and honestly.</p>\n<p>We want models that tell the truth, but we don’t know how to recognize honest models in cases where we can’t simply compare what they say to an independently verifiable reality during training.</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<p>Christiano gives the following examples of accessible vs inaccessible information:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>“What will Alice say?” vs “What is Alice thinking?”</li>\n<li>“What’s on my financial statement?” vs. “How much money do I really have?”</li>\n<li>“Am I coughing?” vs. “What’s happening with my immune system?”</li>\n<li>“How will senators vote?” vs. “What’s the state of political alliances and agreements in the senate?”</li>\n<li>“What do I see on my computer screen?” vs. “Is my computer compromised?”</li>\n<li>“What’s the market price of this company?” vs. “How valuable is this IP really?”</li>\n<li>“Will the machine break tomorrow?” vs. “Is there hard-to-observe damage in this component?”</li>\n<li>“What does the news show me from 5000 miles away?” vs. “What’s actually happening 5000 miles away?”</li>\n<li>“Is this argument convincing?” vs. “Is this argument correct?”</li>\n<li>“What will happen tomorrow?” vs. “What will happen in a year” (depending on whether models transfer to long horizons)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In each case it is relatively straightforward to train a machine learning model to predict the accessible information (\"what will Alice say?\") since we can generate a reward signal by comparing the model's predictions to ground truth during training. But training a model to predict inaccessible information (\"what is Alice thinking?\") is problematic since we have no reliable way to produce a reward signal.</p>\n<h2>The fundamental dilemma of black box learning</h2>\n<p>In machine learning we use the following basic approach to developing intelligent systems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define a hypothesis space containing a sufficiently broad range of policies that at least one policy in the hypothesis space probably meets our design criteria</li>\n<li>Set up an evaluation procedure that measures the extent to which any specific policy meets our design criteria</li>\n<li>Search the hypothesis space for a policy that the evaluation procedure ranks highly</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is a very unusual design procedure. It is very different from, for example, the way a set of chopsticks or a microwave or an air conditioner is designed. It would be surprising to visit a chopstick factory and discover that one part of the factory was producing chopsticks of various shapes and sizes and a completely separate part of the factory was evaluating each one and providing only a narrow “reward signal” in return.</p>\n<p>But in machine learning this design procedure has proven powerful and compelling. It is often easier to specify a reasonable evaluation procedure than to find a design from first principles. For example, suppose we wish to design a computer program that correctly discriminates between pictures of cats and pictures of dogs. To do this, we can set up an evaluation procedure that uses a data set of hand-labelled pictures of cats and dogs, and then use machine learning to search for a policy that correctly labels them. In contrast we do not at present know how to design an algorithm from first principles that does the same thing. There are many, many problems where it is easier to recognize a good solution than to design a good solution from scratch, and for this reason machine learning has proven very useful across many parts of the economy.</p>\n<p>But when we build sophisticated systems, the evaluation problem becomes very difficult. Christiano’s write-up explores the difficulty of evaluating whether a model is honest when all we can do is provide inputs to the model and observe outputs.</p>\n<p>In order to really understand whether a model is honest or not we need to look inside the model and understand how it works. We need to somehow see the gears of its internal cognition in a way that lets us see clearly that it is running an algorithm that honestly looks at data from the world and honestly searches for a succinct explanation and honestly outputs that explanation in a legible form. Christiano says as much:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we were able to actually understand something about what the policy was doing, even crudely, it might let us discriminate between instrumental and intended behavior. I don’t think we have any concrete proposals for how to understand what the policy is doing well enough to make this distinction, or how to integrate it into training. But I also don’t think we have a clear sense of the obstructions, and I think there are various obvious obstructions to interpretability in general that don’t apply to this approach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that Christiano’s write-up is a fairly general and compelling knock-down of the black-box approach to design in which we build an evaluation procedure and then rely on search to find a policy that our evaluation procedure ranks highly. Christiano is pointing out a general pitfall we will run into if we take this approach.</p>\n<h2>Hope and despair</h2>\n<p>I was surprised to see Christiano make the following reference to MIRI’s perspective on this problem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would describe MIRI’s approach to this problem [...] as despair + hope you can find some other way to produce powerful AI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes it’s true that much of MIRI’s research is about finding a solution to the design problem for intelligent systems that does not rest on a blind search for policies that satisfy some evaluation procedure. But it seems strange to describe this approach as “hope you can find some other way to produce powerful AI”, as though we know of no other approach to engineering sophisticated systems other than search. In fact the vast majority of the day-to-day systems that we use in our lives have been constructed via design: airplanes, toothbrushes, cellphones, railroads, microwaves, ball point pens, solar panels. All these systems were engineered via first-principles design, perhaps using search for certain subcomponents in some cases, but certainly not using end-to-end search. It is the search approach that is new and unusual, and while it has proven powerful and useful in the development of certain intelligent systems, we should not for a moment think of it as the only game in town.</p>\n",

A one-sentence description of it, phrased in experiential terms, would be that &#x201C;<u><a href=\"https://mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-i-the-fundamentals/5-the-three-characteristics/\">All experienced phenomena, whether physical or mental, inner or outer, are impermanent</a></u>&#x201D;. </p><p>As an intellectual claim, this does not sound too surprising: few people would seriously think that either physical things or mental experiences last forever. However, there are ways in which impermanence does contradict our intuitive assumptions.</p><p>A conventional example of this is <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_blindness\">change blindness</a></u>. In a typical change blindness experiment, people report having good awareness of the details of a picture shown to them: but when details are changed during an eye saccade, subjects fail to notice any difference. Maybe a person&#x2019;s hat looks red, and people who have been looking <em>right at</em> the hat fail to notice that it looked green just a second ago: the consciousness of the green-ness has vanished, replaced entirely with red. </p><p>People are typically surprised by this, thinking that &#x201C;if it was red a second ago, surely I would remember that&#x201D; - a thought that implicitly assumes that sense percepts leave permanent memories behind. But as long something does not explicitly store a piece of conscious information, it is gone as soon as it has been experienced.</p><p>This is a natural consequence of the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model of consciousness from neuroscience. As I <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain\">have previously discussed</a></u>, studies suggest that the content of consciousness corresponds to information held in a particular network of neurons called the &quot;global workspace&quot;. This workspace can only hold a single piece of conscious content at a time, and new information is constantly trying to enter it, replacing the old information.</p><p>Now if the content of your consciousness happens to be something like this:</p><ul><li>0 milliseconds: Seeing a red hat</li><li>53 milliseconds: Thinking about cookies</li><li>200 milliseconds: Seeing a green hat</li></ul><p>Then at the 200 millisecond mark, unless some memory system happened to explicitly store the fact of seeing a red hat before, no trace of it remains in consciousness for the person to compare with. One can train particular subsystems to monitor the contents of consciousness and send occasional summaries of previous contents, which is part of what investigating impermanence involves.</p><p>Compare this to meditation teacher <u><a href=\"https://mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-i-the-fundamentals/5-the-three-characteristics/\">Daniel Ingram&#x2019;s description of impermanence</a></u>:</p><blockquote>Absolute transience is truly the actual nature of experiential reality.</blockquote><blockquote>What do I mean by &#x201C;experiential reality&#x201D;? I mean the universe of sensations that you directly experience. [...] From the conventional perspective, things are usually believed to exist even when you no longer experience them directly, and are thus inferred to exist with only circumstantial evidence to be relatively stable entities. [...] For our day-to-day lives, this assumption is functional and adequate.</blockquote><blockquote>For example, you could close your eyes, put down this book or device, and then pick it up again where you left it without opening your eyes. From a pragmatic point of view, this book was where you left it even when you were not directly experiencing it. However, when doing insight practices, it just happens to be much more useful to assume that things are only there when you experience them and not when you don&#x2019;t. Thus, the gold standard for reality when doing insight practices is the sensations that make up your reality in that instant. Sensations that are not there at that time are not presumed to exist, and thus only sensations arising in that instant do exist, with &#x201C;exist&#x201D; clearly being a problematic term, given how transient sensations are.</blockquote><blockquote>In short, most of what you assume as making up your universe doesn&#x2019;t exist most of the time, from a purely sensate point of view. This is exactly, precisely, and specifically the point. [...] sensations arise out of nothing, do their thing, and vanish utterly. Gone. Entirely gone. </blockquote><p>In Ingram&#x2019;s terms, people subconsciously assume that if a person in a picture has a red hat, then the person in the picture is going to keep having a red hat. Also, if the person in the picture has a green hat, they probably also had a green hat when you last looked at them. This kind of an assumption is often pragmatically useful, and may even be a true claim about the world, for as long as the image you are looking at is not being manipulated by researchers who keep changing subtle details. But it is not an accurate model of how your own mind functions.</p><h1>Consciousness as an FBI report</h1><p>In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq/book-summary-consciousness-and-the-brain\">a previous article</a>, I mentioned that according to neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene, one of the functions of consciousness is for subsystems in the brain to exchange summaries of their conclusions. He offered the analogy of the US president being briefed by the FBI. The FBI is a vast organization, with thousands of employees: they are constantly shifting through enormous amounts of data and forming hypotheses about topics with national security relevance. But it would be useless for the FBI to present to the president every single report collected by every single field agent, as well as every analysis compiled by every single analyst in response. Rather, the FBI needs to internally settle on some overall summary of what they believe is going on, and then present that to the President, who can then act based on the information. Similarly, Dehaene suggests that consciousness is a place where different brain systems can exchange summaries of their models, and to integrate conflicting evidence in order to arrive to an overall conclusion.</p><p>In a similar way, it&#x2019;s usually not necessary for the brain to keep a conscious track of every little detail in an image. Rather, sensory information comes in, and subsystems responsible for processing it broadcast a summary of what they consider important about it. If you look at a painting, a general summary of its contents will be produced and maintained in consciousness, while minor details like the color of someone&#x2019;s hat won&#x2019;t be recorded unless a person had a particularly important reason to look at it. (That would be the equivalent of the FBI including a field agent&#x2019;s random observations in a report to the president. They&#x2019;re very unlikely to include those unless they are <em>really</em> important.)</p><p>This is particularly noticeable when learning to draw: as Raemon discusses in <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3ve2pEZS2dBmxbZS2/drawing-less-wrong-observing-reality\">Drawing Less Wrong: Observing Reality</a></u>:</p><blockquote>When you look at a person, what you perceive is not a series of shapes and colors that correspond to what&apos;s there, but rather a bunch of hastily constructed symbols that convey the information that the brain thinks is important. If you haven&apos;t rewired your brain for drawing, then &quot;important&quot; questions do not include &quot;<em>Is that elbow angled at 90 degrees or 75?</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>Where are the eyes in relation to the top of the head?</em>&quot; Instead, what you usually care about are things like &quot;is this person happy, or angry?&quot; and the information that gets recorded is a little tag that says &quot;Smiling&quot; with a vague curving-upwards-line symbol accompanying it.</blockquote><blockquote>A large chunk of the information we usually need has to do with the face. This plays a role in two common biases that are near-universal in inexperienced artists:</blockquote><blockquote>-Drawing the head much larger than it actually is, compared to the rest of the body</blockquote><blockquote>-Drawing the &quot;face&quot; (i.e. everything between the eyebrows and mouth) as if they took up the entire head rather than the bottom half. Practically everything above the eyebrows conveys no relevant information, so it&apos;s just ignored.</blockquote><blockquote>Your brain has a mental model of what a human is &quot;supposed&quot; to look like, and that model is wrong. You can see major gains in drawing capability just by learning the &quot;ideal&quot; proportions of a human being. </blockquote><p>The relation of this to impermanence is that observing the contents of your mind lets you notice just how little sense data is actually used, and how quickly it vanishes. Returning to Daniel Ingram:</p><blockquote>We are typically quite sloppy about distinguishing between physical and mental sensations (memories, mental images, and mental impressions of other physical or mental sensations). These two kinds of sensations alternate, one arising and passing and then the other arising and passing, in a quick but perceptible fashion. Being clear about exactly when the physical sensations are present will begin to clarify their slippery counterparts&#x2014;flickering mental impressions&#x2014;that help co-create the illusion of continuity, stability, or solidity. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Each one of these sensations (the physical sensation and the mental impression) arises and vanishes completely before another begins, so it is possible to sort out which is which with relatively stable attention dedicated to consistent precision and to not being lost in stories. This means that the instant you have experienced something, you can know that it isn&#x2019;t there anymore, and whatever is there is a new sensation that will be gone in an instant. There are typically many other momentary sensations and impressions interspersed with these, but for the sake of practice, this is close enough to what is happening to be a good working model.</blockquote><p>Ingram suggests that between physical sensations, there are mental sensations which &#x201C;fill in the gaps&#x201D;, and which prevent people from noticing that the original physical sensations only come in sporadically. As people become more adept at meditation practices such as following the breath, they may come to notice that a large part of their time has been spent on following <em>a</em> <em>thought about the breath</em>, rather than <em>the breath itself</em>: and far less sensory information about the breath actually comes to consciousness than they assumed.</p><p>In an <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and\">earlier article on insight meditation</a></u> I gave another example about these kinds of mental sensations. I mentioned a time when I was doing concentration meditation, using an app that played the sound of something hitting a woodblock, 50 times per minute. As I was concentrating on listening to the sound, I noticed that what had originally been just one thing in my experience - a discrete sound event - was actually composed of many smaller parts. The beginning and end of the sound were different, so there were actually two sound sensations; and there was a subtle visualization of something hitting something else; and a sense of motion accompanying that visualization. I had not previously even been fully aware that my mind was automatically creating a mental image of what it thought that the sound represented.</p><p>Continuing to observe those different components, I became more aware of the fact that my visualization of the sound changed over time and between meditation sessions, in a rather arbitrary way. Sometimes my mind conjured up a vision of a hammer hitting a rock in a dwarven mine; sometimes it was two wooden sticks hitting each other; sometimes it was drops of water falling on the screen of my phone.</p><p>Normally, all of this would just be packaged together into a general impression of &#x201C;I&#x2019;m hearing some sound&#x201D;. Our raw sense data is made up of countless small details and sensations, each arising and passing away in rapid succession - but we mostly perceive the high-level summaries, which are much more static. This creates an experience of seeing solid and discrete objects, and a feeling of there being permanent objects.</p><p>So how <em>does</em> one actually come to see what is happening in their mind? </p><p>In <em>The Mind Illuminated</em>, meditation teacher and former neuroscientist John Yates (Culadasa) suggests that one way this happens is by taking the subsystems responsible for producing such summaries and directing them to produce summaries about the content of consciousness. The brain already has a subsystem that generates overall summaries of what&#x2019;s going on in your mind; you can train that system to produce more detailed reports. Yates calls such summaries <em>introspective awareness</em> (discussed in more detail in <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WYmmC3W6ZNhEgAmWG/a-mechanistic-model-of-meditation\">an earlier article</a></u>). </p><h1>The impermanence of the self</h1><p>As I have discussed, consciousness involves a constant competitive process, where different subsystems send content to the global workspace. At any given time, only one of these pieces of content is selected to become the content of consciousness. We might say that there has been a &#x201C;subsystem switch&#x201D; or a &#x201C;subsystem swap&#x201D; when the content of consciousness changes from that submitted by one subsystem to that submitted by another.</p><p>In normal circumstances, the structure of your mind is such that you cannot directly notice the different subsystems getting swapped in and out. Your consciousness can only hold one piece of information at a time. Suppose that at one moment, you are thinking of your friend, and at the next you are thinking of candy. When you think of candy, you are no longer aware of the fact that you were thinking of your friend the previous moment. You can often <em>infer</em> that a subsystem switch has happened, but you can&#x2019;t actually <em>experience </em>the switch.</p><p>However, if you develop more detailed introspective awareness, the stream of your consciousness may include reports such as this:</p><ul><li>Subsystem 1: So I was talking with my friend and she said&#x2026;</li><li>Subsystem 2: Ooh, candy.</li><li>Awareness subsystem: The train of thought about my friend switched to a train of thought about candy right now.</li></ul><p>Subjectively, this feels like becoming aware of the subsystem swapping in real time: a thought comes in, while an &#x201C;afterimage&#x201D; of the previous thought lingers for a brief moment, enough to make you realize that one kind of thought has replaced the other. If the trains of thought are different enough, the transitions between might feel really sharp and distinct.</p><p>You may also notice that you have two or more separate thought streams going in parallel, while having had no awareness of the fact. At one time you are thinking about your friend, and at the other time you are thinking about candy. Despite the fact that these two thought streams have kept alternating, maybe switching once every couple of seconds, they have been entirely unaware of each other. First the candy is everything that is in your mind, then your friend, then the candy again.</p><p>This is not to say that it would normally be impossible to be aware of having multiple trains of thought going on. Even without meditative training, your brain is constantly producing summaries of what&#x2019;s happening, including summaries of what&#x2019;s happening in your head. But what normally happens is something like having the first train of thought, then having the second train of thought, and then having general introspective awareness of there being two trains of thought. What does not usually happen is that the introspective awareness is sharp enough to register the fact that <em>whenever the train of thought switches, everything else disappears from consciousness for the duration</em>. </p><p>Rather than there being a single observer who experiences all of their own thoughts, there are three separate processes, two of them concerned with their own issues and a third meta-process keeping a loose record of what the two others have been up to.</p><p>A rough analogy would be to a (single-core) computer that keeps <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking\">executing multiple different programs in succession</a></u>, with the contents of the processor being cleaned out for the next program each time the execution switches. As long as everything goes smoothly, things will appear to the user as multiple different programs being executed at the same time, and the programs themselves will be unaware of the other programs. Yet, a sufficiently fine-grained trace of the different processes will reveal that only one has been running at a time. (Though unlike in this analogy, mental subsystems do keep running even when &#x201C;swapped out&#x201D;; they just don&#x2019;t have write access to consciousness during that time.)</p><p>By developing sufficient detail, another thing that can be noticed is that the sense of self is actually only present a part of the time. As discussed in previous posts [<u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/W59Nb72sYJhMJKGB8/a-non-mystical-explanation-of-no-self-three-characteristics\">1</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h2xgbYBNP4dLharg4/on-the-construction-of-the-self\">2</a></u>], the experience of a self is basically a piece of data - a <em>narrative</em> which is sometimes experienced and sometimes not. That is, it is another high-level summary of what is happening - &#x201C;I am doing this thing&#x201D; - constructed from lower-level data. (<u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h2xgbYBNP4dLharg4/on-the-construction-of-the-self?commentId=rtutmz8Lb5F8dnfbf\">In a comment</a></u>, Vanessa Kosoy suggested that the experience of a self is an explanation of <em>why</em> the person is doing things, constructed for social purposes and to be able to justify your behavior afterwards. This sounds plausible to me.)</p><p>That means that the content of your consciousness may be something like:</p><ul><li>Time 1: The sight of a bird outside the window.</li><li>Time 2: The thought &#x201C;there&#x2019;s a bird over there&#x201D;.</li><li>Time 3: The experience of typing on a keyboard.</li><li>Time 4: The sound of a car outside.</li><li>Time 5: A mental image of a car.</li><li>Time 6: A sense of being someone who sees the bird and hears the car, while typing on a keyboard.</li></ul><p>&#x2026; that is, normally you may experience there being a constant, permanent self which feels like <em>what you really are</em>. But in fact, during a large part of your conscious experience, that sense of self may simply not be there at all. Normally this might be impossible to detect due to what&#x2019;s called the <u><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/introspection/notes.html\">refrigerator light illusion</a></u>: the light in a refrigerator turns on whenever you open the door, so it seems to you to always be on. Likewise, whenever you ask &#x201C;do I experience a sense of self right now&#x201D;, that question <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/W59Nb72sYJhMJKGB8/a-non-mystical-explanation-of-no-self-three-characteristics#The_self_as_a_tool_for_planning\">references and activates</a></u> a self-schema, meaning that the answer is always &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. It is only by developing introspective awareness that records <em>all</em> mental content, without needing to make reference to a self, that you can come to notice the way in which your self constantly appears and disappears.</p><p>It is worth noting that coming to experience this may feel very frightening. Psychologist and meditation teacher Ron Crouch <u><a href=\"https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/12/the-dark-night/\">describes one way that it can go</a></u>:</p><blockquote>What is actually happening, down deep, is that as your attention is syncing up with the dissolution of phenomena you are finding that there is nothing in experience that the sense of &#x201C;me&#x201D; can hold onto as stable and permanent. It just can&#x2019;t get any footing. You do not realize it at a cognitive level, but you are getting a deep insight into the impermanence of all phenomena, and along with that, into the impermanence of the self. This is something that is terrifying to one&#x2019;s very roots. Needles to say this initial stage can be a great source of distress and people can become stuck here for some time if they do not have good guidance.</blockquote><p>We might think the distress follows from the mind&#x2019;s underlying assumption that the self must be something like a permanent object. Whenever one has checked for the presence of the self, it has been there: thus, it is something that persists uninterrupted over time (except maybe in sleep). Now it - or something that resembles what it used to be - suddenly keeps vanishing and reappearing. Does that mean that you are dying?</p><p>Eventually, given enough further practice, the mind readjusts and revises its models. Continuity of consciousness does not mean uninterrupted continuity of self after all; the self is as impermanent as any other sensory experience. Nothing here to see, move along now.</p><h1>Impermanence and unsatisfactoriness</h1><p>One aspect of craving is <em>clinging, </em>a kind of repeated <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvXFBaThWrMsSjicD/craving-suffering-and-predictive-processing-three\">craving</a></u>. The mind notices a pleasant or unpleasant sensation, and then tries to keep the pleasant sensations in consciousness and the unpleasant sensations out of consciousness. This may feel like you are trying to &#x201C;freeze&#x201D; the content of consciousness into a particular, pleasurable slice of experience.</p><p>In <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/r6kzvdia4S8TKE6WF/from-self-to-craving-three-characteristics-series\">an earlier post</a></u>, I gave a list of examples about craving; this is also a good list of examples to use for clinging, so I&#x2019;ll repeat it here:</p><ul><li>It is morning and your alarm bell rings. You should get up, but it feels nice to be sleepy and remain in bed. You want to hang onto those pleasant sensations of sleepiness for a little bit more.</li><li>You are spending an evening together with a loved one. This is the last occasion that you will see each other in a long time. You feel really good being with them, but a small part of you is unhappy over the fact that this evening will eventually end.</li><li>You are at work on a Friday afternoon. Your mind wanders to the thought of no longer being at work, and doing the things that you had planned to do on the weekend. You would prefer to be done with work already, and find it hard to stay focused as you cling to the thoughts of your free time.</li><li>You are single and hanging out with an attractive person. You know that they are not into you, but it would be so great if they were. You can&#x2019;t stop thinking about that possibility, and this keeps distracting you from the actual conversation.</li><li>You are in a conversation with several other people. You think of a line that would be a really good response to what someone else just said. Before you can say it, somebody says a thing, and the conversation moves on. You find yourself still thinking of your line, and how nice it would have been to get to say it.</li><li>You are playing a game of chess. You see an opportunity to make a series of movies that looks like it would win the game for you. You get so focused on the sequence of moves that would bring you a victory, that you don&#x2019;t notice that your opponent could also respond in a way that would ruin the entire plan.</li><li>You had been planning on going to a famous museum while on your vacation, but the museum turns out to be temporarily closed at the time. You keep thinking about how much you had been looking forward to it. </li></ul><p>What is essentially going on, is the craving trying to <em>fight against impermanence</em>. Taking the example of being sleepy and in bed: there is the sensation of sleepiness and a feeling of pleasure; <em>and</em> that annoying thought which keeps saying that you really need to get up soon... and the craving wants that pleasant sleepiness <em>back </em>and <em>stable</em>, damnit. If only it would focus on the sleepiness enough, maybe that annoying reminder would go away...</p><p>This contributes to the loop where the mind sees craving as necessary for well-being: phenomena won&#x2019;t stabilize in consciousness by themselves, and craving takes actions to make them more stable. Whenever it is unsuccessfully trying to do so, there is discomfort; when it succeeds in getting the pleasant thing to become the object of consciousness (if only for a moment), there is less discomfort (if only for a moment). Now, that discomfort is being generated <em>by the craving itself</em>, so it could also be eliminated by dropping the craving&#x2026; but the system does not notice that.</p><p>Nor does it notice that following the craving does not lead to consistent happiness. Of course, we may <em>intellectually</em> understand that there&#x2019;s no single thing that would make us permanently and eternally happy. But at the subsystem level, each source of craving is based on a schema that states something like:</p><ul><li>If I get the thing I am craving, things will feel satisfying.</li></ul><p>When the subsystem related to that goal is active, this is the schema which will be active in the person&#x2019;s mind. If you are hungry for food, you only think about how food will bring relief to your discomfort. Intellectually, you may know that soon afterwards you will start wanting something else - but the assumption that your mind is operating from, is that getting the food will bring contentment. And that assumption is correct! Recall that unsatisfactoriness is actually <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvXFBaThWrMsSjicD/craving-suffering-and-predictive-processing-three\">caused <em>by</em> craving</a>. So getting the food <em>will</em> make the craving for it go away - until the next craving pops up, which is likely to happen very soon.</p><p>This has the consequence that each <em>individual </em>craving may have its prediction confirmed. The craving for food correctly predicts that food will bring satisfaction from that craving. The craving to look at the phone while you eat correctly predicts that looking at the phone will bring satisfaction from that craving. The craving to go watch pictures of attractive naked people after eating correctly predicts that going to watch pictures of attractive naked people will bring satisfaction from that craving&#x2026; while the overall system remains in a near-constant state of craving that just keeps changing its target.</p><p>In the paper <em>Suffering</em> <a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/YK1AjI/YaFw\">(</a><u><a href=\"https://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb05philosophie/files/2013/04/Metzinger_suffering_penultimate.pdf\">Metzinger, 2016</a></u><a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/YK1AjI/YaFw\">)</a>, Thomas Metzinger reports on an &#x201C;experience sampling&#x201D; experiment, where messages were sent to people&#x2019;s phones at random times, asking them whether they felt that their current experience would feel worth reliving:</p><blockquote>For many, the result was surprising: the number of positive conscious moments per week varied between 0 and 36 [out of 70], with an average of 11.8 or almost 31 per cent of the phenomenological samples, while at 69 per cent a little more than two thirds of the moments were spontaneously ranked as not worth reliving.</blockquote><p>Metzinger notes that one cannot generalize from these results to the general population: this was a small, unreplicated pilot study done with a highly selected group (philosophy students). But as he also notes, what <em>is</em> remarkable is that <em>nearly all</em> of the participants were surprised by their own results - they had expected many more moments to feel pleasurable. He speculates that human motivation may depend on systematic self-deception: if a person valued positive experiences but noticed that most of their experience was actually unpleasant, they might become paralyzed.</p><p>And it does seem that increased awareness of the impermanence of satisfaction helps reduce craving. I like to think of each individual craving as a form of a <em>hypothesis</em>, in the <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvXFBaThWrMsSjicD/craving-suffering-and-predictive-processing-three\">predictive processing</a></u> sense where hypotheses drive behavior by seeking to prove themselves true. For example (<u><a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00151/full\">Friston et al. 2012</a></u>), your visual system may see someone&apos;s nose and form the hypothesis that &quot;the thing that I&apos;m seeing is a nose, and a nose is part of a person&apos;s face, so I&apos;m seeing someone&apos;s face&quot;. That contains the prediction &quot;faces have eyes next to the nose, so if I look slightly up and to the right I will see an eye, and if I look left from there I will see another eye&quot;; it will then seek to confirm its prediction by making you look at those spots and verify that they do indeed contain eyes.</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://stuff.kajsotala.fi/LW/Craving/saccade.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:68%\"></figure></span><p><em>Eye movements seeking to confirm the hypotheses of &#x201C;I am seeing a face&#x201D;. From <u><a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00151/full\">Friston, Adams, Perrinet &amp; Breakspear 2012</a></u>.</em></p><p>Normally, each craving is successfully proving true the hypothesis of &quot;pursuing this craving will cause satisfaction&quot;&#x2026; but included in that prediction is not only a claim that satisfying this craving will bring momentary satisfaction. As the hypothesis is not modeling events that happen after it is satisfied, there is an implied claim that this will bring <em>lasting </em>satisfaction.</p><p>If the mind-system develops increased awareness of the way repeated craving seems to just lead to a constant state of discomfort, then under the right conditions it may consider the hypotheses in those cravings falsified and discard them. </p><h1>Fighting against a sensation as assuming its permanence</h1><p>Another thing that is happening is the subsystems failing to notice how fighting against a sensation actually helps <em>keep</em> it in consciousness, and how the sensation might actually fall away <em>on its own</em> if it was not being fought against. </p><p>Suppose that you are feeling stressed out over something, and a craving is activated to get rid of the feeling of stress. This involves sending into consciousness a plan for getting rid of the sensation of stress, which needs to <em>make reference to the sensation of stress</em>. This tends to redirect <em>more</em> attention towards the sensation of stress, strengthening the signal associated with it&#x2026; and because sensations are normally impermanent and tend to easily vanish, this may help keep it in consciousness whereas it would otherwise have disappeared on its own. </p><p>In general, craving often operates under the assumption that unpleasant sensations are permanent: that is, they will persist in consciousness until actively resisted. And certainly it is true that not <em>all</em> unpleasant sensations will just disappear if you stop feeding them with attention. But even then, redirecting attention into a struggle against them may <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rD57ysqawarsbry6v/attention-control-is-critical-for-changing-increasing\">actively make them stronger</a></u>.</p><p>If one develops sufficient introspective awareness, they may come to experience this directly. They will notice a neutral sensation, a negative sensation, another neutral sensation, then the aversion to the negative sensation&#x2026; and notice there are actually quite a few neutral sensations, during which the negative sensation does not bother them at all. This helps notice that struggling against discomfort is actually not <em>necessary</em> for being free of discomfort; one is free of discomfort a large part of the time already.</p><h1>Impermanence as vibration</h1><p>No discussion of impermanence would be complete without touching upon the topic of &#x201C;vibrations&#x201D;. Recall that according to the predictive processing model, the brain is composed of layers prediction machinery. A given layer can receive sensory information from a lower layer, and from the higher layer predictions of what that information <em>should</em> look like. For purposes of prediction, each layer is trying to form <em>models</em> of what it expects to see. </p><p>Rather than sense information primarily &#x201C;flowing up&#x201D; from the sense organs, the brain keeps making guesses of what it <em>expects</em> to see. These expectations are sent &#x201C;down to the senses&#x201D;, with the brain using the sense data to <em>check</em> its assumptions and correcting for any mismatches. Mismatches that seem small enough may be ignored and explained away as noise.</p><p>One possible model is that the sensory information from the lower levels represents stable, permanent objects. As has been noted, this assumption is often a useful and correct one for predicting how the world behaves, so the system begins to assume it&#x2026; ignoring the fact that sensory data is actually coming <em>in pulses</em> rather than constantly. </p><p>When one&#x2019;s consciousness starts dropping some of the mental impressions that normally &#x201C;fill in the gaps&#x201D;, it may lead to an experiential quality of reality &#x201C;vibrating&#x201D;. Here is how <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/sznhbtAmucbACzS24/p/QjoTFHzvrxQg9A6j3\">DavidM describes this</a></u>:</p><blockquote>A meditator practicing in this style will eventually find that their experience is not static, but &apos;vibrates&apos; or fluxes in a peculiar way over extremely short periods of time (fractions of a second). For an explanation by analogy, imagine a set of speakers playing music without dynamic variation; if a person rapidly turns the volume knob in the pattern off-low-high-low-off, the amplitude of the music will flux over time. Similarly, a meditator practicing in this style finds that the components of experience are not static, but fluctuate rapidly from nonexistent to existent and back again. N.B. This has nothing to do with the fact that the contents of experience are constantly changing. Rather, apparently static objects (e.g. an unchanging white visual field) turn out to be in flux.</blockquote><p>For the most part, the hypothesis of &#x201C;sensory data represents permanent objects&#x201D; has turned out to deliver good results, so normally any gaps in the data will be automatically &#x201C;filled in&#x201D; by the model, as they are assumed to be meaningless noise. As a result, a &#x201C;neural autocompletion feature&#x201D; can create an impression of closely observing sensory data, even when sensory data is actually sparse and the impression of it is mostly fabricated on the basis of a few data points.</p><p>For as long as the sensed data deviates only a little from the expected, the deviation is treated as noise and ignored; but once the deviation crosses some critical threshold, it is picked up and registered as surprising. If one intentionally goes looking for vibrations, then one is trying to pick up finer and finer distinctions in the sense data. This forces the system to pay attention to minor patterns that would otherwise have been treated as meaningless noise. That causes it to notice discrepancies between the higher-level model&#x2019;s prediction of &#x201C;solid stream of sense data&#x201D; and the sensory experiences that are coming in as pulses. This leads to an awareness of vibrations, and more generally insight into how the brain fills in data which is not actually there.</p><p>On the other hand, I have also heard reports of people finding vibrations without explicitly even looking at sensory details, in contexts such as doing loving-kindness meditation. I am confused about what is going on there and don&#x2019;t know how to explain it. This is also an area that I have personally investigated relatively little.</p><p><em>This is the sixth post of the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mf2MCkYgSZSJRz5nM/a-non-mystical-explanation-of-insight-meditation-and-the\">a non-mystical explanation of the three characteristics of existence&quot; series</a>.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>In this post, we&apos;ll examine how we might get to artificial general intelligence, and will put some thought into what this type of &#x201C;superintelligence&#x201D; might look like. We&#x2019;ll start out by taking a step back, and looking at the most likely potential pathways by which to achieve this goal &#x2013; as the behaviors exhibited by any &#x201C;superintelligent&#x201D; agent will have significant pathway dependence. We&#x2019;ll then explore the necessary attributes for any intelligent system &#x2013; and the unnecessary elements that we&#x2019;re used to seeing in humans (and other species) but that may not appear in an artificial intelligence. Once we&#x2019;ve laid this groundwork for thinking about artificially intelligent systems / agents, we&#x2019;ll take a look at how to think about the goals these systems would have, and will consider how they might compare to our own human goals. As we&#x2019;re currently still quite far from constructing any sort of generally intelligent machine, intuitions formed from the observation of existing AI systems may serve as poor guides (intuitions from observing human agents will be far more applicable) &#x2013; this post looks to help guide you to new intuitions, but that process will be aided by the temporary setting aside of existing views based on the significant limitations of artificial systems as they exist today.</p><p>Crafting an artificial intelligence of any sort will be extremely difficult &#x2013; seemingly magnitudes more difficult than anything accomplished in the course of human history. As covered in another post on my blog, <a href=\"https://mybrainsthoughts.com/?p=61\">Defining Intelligence</a><strong>,</strong> there&#x2019;s significant difficulty associated with just understanding what intelligence is &#x2013; let alone building it ourselves. Our species is designed to be good at top-down architecture, with limited dependencies between the different parts of the system (think about building a house &#x2013; each brick has an easily defined role to play, and plays only that role); intelligence, on the other hand, is a bottom-up phenomena, arising from interactions between all parts of the system (the stock market is another good example of a bottom-up type phenomena). Our difficulties with bottom-up phenomena are exemplified by the enormous amount of work it has taken to understand how the C. Elegans nervous system drives behaviors &#x2013; only 302 neurons, but so much complexity due to interdependencies. When considering these difficulties, it can seem futile to think about achieving a type of artificial intelligence that surpasses human capabilities &#x2013; but all hope is not lost. We conveniently have access to an artifact (in fact, billions of instances of it) that can already do much of what we&#x2019;re trying to implement. Rather than coming up with intelligence from scratch, we can instead look to reverse-engineer the brain, and use that understanding to improve on the brain&#x2019;s capabilities in different ways.&#xA0;</p><p>A big open question is at what granularity we&#x2019;ll need to understand the brain to then implement similar capabilities in an artificial system. Will a general understanding of the processes used in the brain to encode and associate concepts be sufficient to implement an algorithm that acts similarly? Or will we need to understand myriad individual circuits within the brain to get at the true root of intelligence? Neuroscience is currently working to answer these questions, and the answers will help us understand how we might go about building an AI that operates on the principles of the brain. These answers will also help us understand the nature of any artificial intelligence &#x2013; the more we rely on the brain&#x2019;s structure, the more similar to us the AI will be.&#xA0;</p><p>While a &#x201C;brain-like&#x201D; AI seems to be the most likely path, it still remains possible that clever engineers will be able to come up with alternate strategies for creating intelligent agents. It&#x2019;s difficult to comment on what these strategies might look like (as the existing algorithms are so far off), but one shared attribute seems to be that they&#x2019;d have to be constructed in a bottom-up fashion, rather than top-down. Throughout the rest of this post, we&#x2019;ll consider the case of an AI generated by some bottom-up / emergent strategy distinct from that occurring in the brain; while it seems far more likely that the eventual solution will be brain-based, this strategy allows us to examine the most general case.</p><p>An artificial intelligence created using different principles than the brain&#x2019;s could be extremely foreign to us in many ways &#x2013; it wouldn&#x2019;t have the same biological drivers as us (e.g. to survive and reproduce, among many others), it wouldn&#x2019;t sense the world like us, and it certainly wouldn&#x2019;t look like us. However, even though these are significant differences, there would be a number of ways in which it would be quite similar to us. It seems any means of attaining intelligence would need to rely on the principle of learning, as this is the only way to ensure flexibility and adaptability across the infinite number of tasks for which efficiency might be desired. Learning requires both time and experience &#x2013; so any AI we develop will not be solving the world&#x2019;s problems or transcending human limits immediately. Creating a superhuman artificial intelligence will simply mean we&#x2019;ve found some initial structure and update algorithm with the capacity for better extracting knowledge from experience, and we&#x2019;ll still need to give it the necessary time to have these requisite experiences before it can be effective (there will undoubtedly be ways to speed up this learning process, but it seems likely to require a significant amount of time, especially for the first AIs we create. Eventually, we may understand intelligence so well that we can directly imbue AIs [or even ourselves] with specific pieces of knowledge, but that capability is significantly more difficult than crafting an effective initial state and update algorithm for an AI. It&#x2019;s a very top-down type strategy to try and directly manipulate the state of an intelligent system in a productive manner). Additionally, it will need to have some level of curiosity about it&#x2019;s world, to ensure that it takes the steps to engage in experiences which allow it to expand it&#x2019;s knowledge about the world. This curiosity has been deeply ingrained in humans through the process of evolution &#x2013; just watch any toddler interact with their world! Without curiosity (of some sort), the AI will not make full use of its learning abilities, and will remain an artifact with enormous potential to learn, yet limited knowledge. One other sometimes overlooked requirement will be for the AI to understand human language, meaning it will develop similar concepts for different objects in the world. As Newton said, &#x201C;We stand on the shoulders of giants&#x201D; &#x2013; and if we want our AIs to surpass our intelligence, we will need them to stand on those same shoulders. Expecting AIs to build up the same knowledge that has taken humanity millennia, by themselves, is simply not feasible, at least initially. Finally, it seems important to briefly consider the consciousness of artificial intelligence. As these agents will need to have at least as complete an understanding of the world as we humans do, it seems they would run into the same &#x201C;strange loop&#x201D; of their inner workings and actions being a part of the world they&#x2019;re seeking to understand &#x2013; leading to a sense of &#x201C;I&#x201D;. When you imagine what one of these AIs would need to be capable of to achieve superhuman intelligence (i.e. everything a human can do, and more!), it feels much more natural to ascribe to them a sense of self.&#xA0;</p><p>We&#x2019;ve now covered a bit on what qualities a superintelligent agent might have &#x2013; but what would this agent <em>want?</em> What goals would it seek to use it&#x2019;s intelligence to accomplish? On this topic, it&#x2019;s easy to slip into viewing any artificial intelligence as we view machines today &#x2013; with an exactly specified final goal (or goals) that they use their intelligence to achieve (e.g. a Roomba&#x2019;s &#x201C;goal&#x201D; is to cover the entire space in which it operates). But the superintelligences we create will have far more in common with us humans than with a Roomba &#x2013; and how would we define our goals? We have certain base goals, such as eating, drinking, and sex &#x2013; but we aren&#x2019;t purely driven by these desires in the same way a mouse might be. Our intelligence has allowed us to incorporate the fact that we have these drives into the model we use to navigate the world, and in doing so has freed us of direct action based on our biology. We understand when we&#x2019;re hungry and take note of it, but are able to take opposing action (e.g. dieting). We could program in these same base drives to an AI, but it would have an even greater ability to &#x201C;jump outside the system&#x201D; and recognize these inner drives, freeing itself from direct influence. For example, an AI may be designed to feel the same &#x201C;hunger pangs&#x201D; we do when it begins running low on battery power &#x2013; this would make finding electricity <em>a</em> goal for the agent, but would not make it <em>the</em> goal, as it would only provide a certain level of influence on the decisions the agent made (you could imagine making the &#x201C;hunger pangs&#x201D; constant and incredibly powerful &#x2013; this might work to some effect in serving as a stronger behavioral guide, but it would likely either limit the agents ability to be curious and acquire knowledge, or would entice the agent to find a way to fix that connection in itself [i.e. perform self-neurosurgery]. The complexity of any goal of this type would need to be extremely limited [as we&#x2019;ll now cover], increasing the ease with which the agent could modify itself to remove this constraint).&#xA0;</p><p>How about our higher-level goals? These goals seem much more difficult to pin down exactly (as they run from having possessions, to being respected, to inflicting harm on others, to not having possessions, etc.) and come about through a sort of bottom-up interplay of the structure of our own brains with the societal, cultural, academic, religious, etc. influences all around us. These goals are formulated as abstractions &#x2013; they live in the realm of represented concepts in our brains. Understanding, at a functional level, the reason someone wants more money, would require understanding their innate concept of money, the things they associate with that concept, the concepts for those associated things, etc. &#x2013; it becomes a whole web of dependencies. These higher-level goals will arise for any superintelligent agent in the same way, and can&#x2019;t be programmed in directly due to their abstract nature (you&#x2019;d need a complete understanding of the encoding for the relevant concept, all associated concepts, etc.). We can&#x2019;t know ahead of time what the agent will want, for the same reason we&#x2019;ll never be able to determine everything an adult would want from their brain as a baby &#x2013; complex goals are an emergent property of the agent coupled with it&#x2019;s experiences, not something innate. This uncertainty means we must be very careful as we wade into the waters of superhuman AI, as the AIs goals will be even more variable than our own, and will not be at the mercy of the programmer&#x2019;s will (in fact, they&#x2019;ll have far more dependency on the programmer&#x2019;s nurture!).</p><p>The prospect of superhuman artificial intelligence is exciting &#x2013; it offers us a chance to throw off the last vestiges of our biological chains and take a new evolutionary leap (although as we move closer, we may realize we have quite an affinity for those chains!). However, we&#x2019;re still a long ways from anything close, and significantly more research on the brain will be required before we can leverage natural selection&#x2019;s principles for our own creations. Once we have the requisite understanding, it will still take significant time for these intelligent systems to learn &#x2013; due to the bottom-up nature of the solution, all we can do is set the system&#x2019;s initial conditions, and then watch (and teach). It&#x2019;s impossible to tell what goals these agents will come up with as they learn &#x2013; but with careful fostering, they may share a great deal with their creators!</p>",

The authors ran multiple predictions with heldout data and various sensitivity analyses. The results seem robust. It's still unclear how <i>generalisable</i> they are, since it's essentially an observational study. (I managed the project who wrote the paper, but I wasn't involved as a co-author.)</p><h2><a href=\" https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116129\">The effectiveness and perceived burden of nonpharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 transmission: a modelling study with 41 countries</a></h2><blockquote><p><i>Background:</i> Existing analyses of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID19 transmission have concentrated on the joint effectiveness of large-scale NPIs. With increasing data, we can move beyond estimating joint effects towards disentangling individual effects. In addition to effectiveness, policy decisions ought to account for the burden placed by different NPIs on the population.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Methods:</i> To our knowledge, this is the largest data-driven study of NPI effectiveness to date. We collected chronological data on 9 NPIs in 41 countries between January and April 2020, using extensive fact-checking to ensure high data quality. We infer NPI effectiveness with a novel semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, modelling both confirmed cases and deaths to increase the signal from which NPI effects can be inferred. Finally, we study how much perceived burden different NPIs impose on the population with an online survey of preferences using the MaxDiff method.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Results:</i> Eight NPIs have a &gt;95% posterior probability of being effective: closing schools (mean reduction in R: 50%; 95% credible interval: 39%-59%), closing nonessential businesses (34%; 16%-49%), closing high-risk businesses (26%; 8%-42%), and limiting gatherings to 10 people or less (28%; 8%-45%), to 100 people or less (17%; -3%-35%), to 1000 people or less (16%; -2%-31%), issuing stay-at-home orders (14%; -2%-29%), and testing patients with respiratory symptoms (13%; -1%-26%). As validation is crucial for NPI models, we performed 15 sensitivity analyses and evaluated predictions on unseen data, finding strong support for our results. We combine the effectiveness and preference results to estimate effectiveness-to-burden ratios.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Conclusions:</i> Our results suggest a surprisingly large role for schools in COVID-19 transmission, a contribution to the ongoing debate about the relevance of asymptomatic carriers in disease spreading. We identify additional interventions with good effectiveness-burden tradeoffs, namely symptomatic testing, closing high-risk businesses, and limiting gathering size. Closing most nonessential businesses and issuing stay-at-home orders impose a high burden while having a limited additional effect.</p></blockquote><p>The team who produced this work is also <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ecyYjptcE34qAT8Mm/job-ad-lead-an-ambitious-covid-19-forecasting-project\">hiring for a new project manager</a>.</p></body></html>",

Time moved that slowly.</p>\n<p>Time has sped up again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, yeah. Not so much anymore.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>In March and April I found myself constantly checking Twitter and the financial markets for news, frantically hunting for ways to get a handle on what was happening in the world, worried everything would fall apart. Would our supply chains hold? Would we be able to maintain civil order? Would millions die? How can I keep my family and friends safe?</p>\n<p>My beloved New York City was no longer a place one could live a reasonable life. So we fled. Even after that, great worry.</p>\n<p>Then things started to calm down. Most of May, I increasingly managed to relax. We learned how to grill properly. I played a bunch of <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/26/spoiler-free-review-assassins-creed-odyssey/\">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a>. I stopped checking Twitter or the stock market.</p>\n<p>My biggest worries were dealing with getting the Emergents Alpha ready and Magic: The Gathering melting down under the weight of the companion mechanic in particular and its new design philosophy in general.</p>\n<h3>End of the Beginning</h3>\n<p>Then, on May 25, 2020, in Minneapolis, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd\">four policemen murdered George Floyd</a>.</p>\n<p>The resulting cycle of protests against police brutality causing more police brutality, which in turn amplifies the protests, has been ongoing each day since then. Huge crowds flood the streets. The crowds come disproportionately from communities with more Covid-19 cases than average. The crowds often yell. The police use tear gas on them, which causes coughing. The police arrest them and lock them in tight quarters, which is going to spread the virus even if the outdoor activities don’t, hopefully in small enough numbers this isn’t a huge deal.</p>\n<p>To the extent other things are also happening, that only makes the infection situation worse.</p>\n<p>It would be very surprising if all this did not lead directly to a surge of new Covid-19 infections.</p>\n<p>It would also be very surprising if all this did not lead <em>indirectly </em>to a much bigger surge of new Covid-19 infections.</p>\n<p>Effectively, the lock down is over.</p>\n<p>Nuance is hard in the best of circumstances. The community I know who got most ahead of the game on Covid-19, the Rationalist community, is still so bad at nuance that one of its de facto community leaders felt he could not go anywhere or do anything during the epidemic. Because if he did, others would not be able to properly parse his actions as responsible, or be able to choose responsible actions themselves, and all quarantine would collapse for everyone..</p>\n<p>These are not the best of circumstances.</p>\n<p>People have seen, and will continue to see, the photos and videos of gigantic crowds in the streets. They will see the approval of those crowds, by the exact same people who told them they should face a depression and 30% unemployment to fight Covid-19. The same people who told them they should not see family and friends and live their lives.</p>\n<p>Even those who support the protests are going to have a very, very hard time taking extreme restrictions seriously going forward. Life beckons.</p>\n<p>For those who don’t support the protests, forget about it.</p>\n<p>There is no going back. Either people’s private choices, <em>after the resulting adjustments in perception of risk, </em>based on their local desire to keep themselves and their communities safe, will still be enough to contain this virus. Or, we will entirely fail to contain this virus until herd immunity provides enough help to turn the tide.</p>\n<p>I cannot think of a more just cause then stopping state-sanctioned murder. That does not make these implications go away.</p>\n<p>That is where we are <em>going to be. </em>We are probably going to see a massive dumb reopening, much faster and more complete than previously predicted or planned. That is the world we now live in.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if I even think that these effects are bad.</p>\n<p>This could all work out for the best.</p>\n<p>It could work out because we contain the virus anyway. I don’t expect it, but it’s definitely plausible.</p>\n<p>It could also work out because we were never going to successfully contain in most places without stronger herd immunity – regardless of whether we <em>could have </em>done so given better policy – and this gets us there faster and by infecting a relatively young subset of the population. Also definitely plausible.</p>\n<p>Or it could work out because outdoor events don’t matter, and this leads to lots more things happening outdoors but not indoors, so we move to a better world no matter the outcome. This, too, seems plausible to me.</p>\n<p>Our, it could work out because enough people adjust their behaviors to stay home more, because they predict a second wave, and this cancels out or more than cancels out the direct effects above. You never know.</p>\n<p>How long before we know the results?</p>\n<p>It has been over a week since things were set in motion. The first few days were relatively small. Events didn’t start having their full impact until at least the last few days. They may not have reached anything like their peak yet. And if the virus is now spreading in a particular sub-population, we may see exponential growth within that particular sub-population, over the course of several cycles of infection. So the effect might be small at first, then only look large weeks later.</p>\n<p>Secondary effects, from others adjusting behaviors, will also be gradual and delayed.</p>\n<p>On top of any lag of the actual infections, the time from infection to positive test has always been an open question.

On June 2 there was a scary jump in positive test rates. That was especially scary as it could have represented Memorial Day. But the trend was back on course again on June 3, so things were probably fine at least until the protests.</p>\n<p>New York continues to reopen. On a personal level, they are allowing outdoor dining here in a few days, and full restaurants a week later. For all practical purposes the limiting factors on my behavior will be my own risk considerations, not official restrictions. I was training myself to stop sweating the small stuff, and prepare to go out more and more into the world. Now it’s much less clear that’s going to happen.</p>\n<p>The Northeast in general continues to do well, but not as well as New York.</p>\n<p>The rest of the country is still a more mixed bag. The Midwest is encouraging and a welcome surprise, enough to make overall numbers move in the right direction. But the jump in cases out West is troubling. It is spearheaded by California, with most Western states seeing a marked jump. The South also continues to creep upwards, especially Texas, South Carolina and Virginia. It’s worth noting that Florida and Georgia saw declines, so unless they’re fudging the data this isn’t about speed of legal reopening.</p>\n<p>The death counts aren’t changing much, as one would expect given their lag. They are listed as a valuable sanity check, but the three week or more delay is fatal to them usually providing the key new information in a given week. By comparing the two charts, we can see exactly how delayed. If anything, it’s a big mystery that the deaths move <em>way too much in lockstep </em>with cases, rather than on a delay. Is this that case diagnosis is more delayed than seems reasonable, or is under bad circumstances? Or is it something else?</p>\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\n<p>Thus, this week’s update was mostly speculation about the future.</p>\n<p><strong>P</strong><strong>lease keep the comments section confined to Covid-19 considerations. </strong></p>\n<p>Watching the positive test counts over the next few weeks will be crucial to figuring out our new path, as we also determine the path of our nation in other ways.</p>\n<p>New York is seeing major protests, and had a very clear improving trend line, with very good plentiful on-demand testing. I think it’s a very good place to look to see the delta from recent events, as it’s one place where we know the prior score.</p>\n<p>If New York continues to make similar progress for two weeks, then the protests are not very dangerous as a primary effect. Even one full week of the same trend line would be enough to be pretty confident this effect is not large.</p>\n<p>If New York <em>quickly </em>stops making progress, or even reverses, we have to assume that the primary impacts are very dangerous.</p>\n<p>Neither of these tells us much about secondary adjustments. Those will be gradual. People are creatures of habit. Many of them are also scared of going outside given the unrest. In the short run, this likely works the other way. We won’t know what the real impact of the unrest is upon the curve, until there is less unrest. And that long term trend is what matters.</p>\n<p>If we do have a second wave, estimating the impact of partial herd immunity will determine the path forward. If I am right that New York’s advantage over other areas is mostly its larger herd immunity, and I’m also right that it is making up for otherwise relatively <em>unsafe </em>circumstances rather than Cuomo having delivered the goods on that front, then that’s very good news. We should see similar actions result in shrinking R0 over time.</p>\n<p>However, note that <em>this will be a delayed effect. </em>First, in places with very little immunity, we will instead have the <em>opposite </em>effect. As the new normal sets in, people’s choices in the new normal determine their risk level, and the more risky are infected more. As this takes effect, things look like they are getting worse, even as the groundwork is laid – by making those risky people immune – for things to get better later. Or so we hope. We can even view ‘New York City gets very infected’ as a geographic example of the exact same thing. For a while it made the nation’s epidemic seem much worse than it was. But that concentration of risk made our long term prospects much better.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I continue to be an optimist of sorts on this, but with little confidence.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, it’s doubtful the United States has much state capacity left to take meaningful action against Covid-19. It’s up to the individuals now, even more than it seemed to be a week ago.</p>\n<p>The die has been cast. The only question is what number it lands on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

When we describe rational thought processes, we tend to think of them as essentially deterministic, deliberate, and algorithmic. After some self-examination, however, I&apos;ve come to think that my process is closer to babbling many random strings and later filtering by a heuristic.</em> </blockquote><blockquote><em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pC6DYFLPMTCbEwH8W/p/i42Dfoh4HtsCAfXxL\">-alkjash</a></em></blockquote><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>I want to describe my first and so far only experience inventing a math problem. It&apos;s probably not an original or important problem. But I think there is value in describing the origins of ideas, especially when those ideas are actionable.</p><p>Here is the problem:</p><blockquote>Draw a square bounding box of side length N. One at a time, drop a square of side length L, oriented identically to the bounding box, at a random location such that it is entirely enclosed within the bounding box, until two of the dropped squares overlap. What is the relationship between the average total area of the dropped squares (excluding the last one dropped), and L^2/N^2?</blockquote><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/S3nSro6.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>I did some analysis on this problem. As L increases, each square fills more area (increasing L^2/N^2), but the chance of an overlap increases as well (decreasing L^2/N^2). Until L^2/N^/2 = 0.25, the relationship closely follows a power law. After that point, the relationship is linear, as it becomes impossible to fit more than one square in the bounding box, meaning that the only remaining factor is the increasing size of the single dropped square.</p><p>It would be interesting to work out why this relationship holds, but my primary goal here is to describe how I formed this problem.</p><p><strong>Circumstances</strong></p><p>I am studying math, CS, and chemistry at the undergraduate level (as a post-bacc student). I was not passionate about mathematics until a couple years ago, and do not consider myself an unusually talented math student compared to my classmates.</p><p>I came up with this problem while smoking weed and listening to my girlfriend play the violin on the porch. I often notice that weed can make me ask more expansive or deep questions, follow a train of thought with more focus, and allow me to explore a vague idea that I might otherwise dismiss.</p><p>It also dramatically enhances my ability to visualize. I have a poor sensory imagination. But when I smoke weed, I can see and manipulate mental pictures and audio with much greater vividness and sustained attention.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1IJI3QV.gif\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p><strong>Developing the Idea</strong></p><p><em>Babble</em></p><p>In this case, I started imagining kaleidoscopic, geometric nonsense. Triangles fanning out from some nebulous origin point. Lines waving in symmetry.</p><p>Then I got the idea, I don&apos;t know from where, to imagine dropping a cube from the sky down onto the mental &quot;ground.&quot; I imagined stacking them, or having them fall in adjacent columns. There was a pleasure in being able to visualize this. At some point, I had the idea that this could suggest some sort of math problem.</p><p>Then I imagined a lot more cubes falling, stacking up, at all different orientations, and realized they would have gaps in between them. And I wondered about how much space they would all fill up.</p><p>To make that make sense, I realized there would need to be some sort of container, like a crate or barrel. From that point, it became more obvious that the problem would be about the relationship of the size of the cubes to the size of the container.</p><p><em>Prune</em></p><p>But this problem seemed complex. So I simplified it to 2D shapes in a 2D bounding box. And to make it as simple as possible, I made the orientations all identical, and made the shapes and bounding box squares. This last step took place when I explained the problem to my girlfriend.</p><p>At this point, the problem had crystallized into a form I could solve. And of course, it could be extended by solving for other shapes, allowing the orientation to be random, and many other constraint changes.</p><p><strong>What Was Important About The Babble?</strong></p><p>One aspect of the babbling that I think was important is that it started with an <u>atomic rule</u>: dropping cubes from the sky. Such a rule is simple, but can have complex implications when additional constraints are added. Perhaps this is akin to introducing a piece of evidence to an argument, a new rule to game, or a character&apos;s decision in a story.</p><p>Another important aspect is the <u>pleasure</u> I took in free exploration of that first atomic rule. It was fun to visualize, and it felt pleasurable to just continue exploring the visualization, without having any particular goal in mind, or pressure to create any particular form of output. Rather than forcing myself toward the goal of defining a math problem, I was just allowing further ideas to bubble up, exploring the problem environment: this imaginary world of falling cubes. The weed helped. I don&apos;t think sober me would have found the dropped-cubes idea interesting to think about.</p><p>A third is the ability to <u>mentally manipulate the materials</u> in an easy and focused way. If I&apos;d had to use some clunky computer software to play around with cubes, I don&apos;t think it would have been as easy to do, and it would have been more distracting. If I&apos;d tried to do it in my head, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to visualize it or focus.</p><p>I think these three factors are fundamental to what alkjash calls &quot;babble.&quot;</p><p><strong>Can Deliberate Practice Increase The Manipulability And Pleasure Of Babble?</strong></p><p>From <em><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.1965.21.1.35\">Creativity in Science through Visualization</a> (</em>1965):</p><blockquote>The hypothesis is advanced that the creative persons appear to have stumbled onto and then developed to a high degree of perfection the ability to visualize&#x2014;almost hallucinate&#x2014;in the area in which they are creative. And their visualizations seem to be of a sort that lend themselves to easy manipulation in the thinking process. This is illustrated by reports from many of the great inventors of the past and it is easy to demonstrate that individuals differ enormously in the kind and degree of their ability to think in such manipulatable visualizations.</blockquote><p>What&apos;s happened since then?</p><p>The top-cited scholarly document referencing this paper is <em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DWmtB9szhFsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;ots=ggirFex3XQ&amp;sig=LHZ0-lo7OqAyDL_FenH9QqLzvJQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Visual Thinking</a></em> by Rudolph Arnheim, published in 1969. He also published <em><a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/448061?journalCode=ci\">A Plea For Visual Thinking</a></em> in 1980.</p><blockquote>Perception and thinking are treated by textbooks of psychology in separate chapters. The senses are said to gather information about the outer world; thinking is said to process that information. Thinking emerges from this approach as the &quot;higher,&quot; more respectable function, to which consequently education assigns most of the school hours and most of the credit. The exercise of the senses is a mere recreation, relegated to spare time. It is left to the playful practice of the arts and music and is readily dispensed with when a tight budget calls for economy.</blockquote><p>How does visualization work? There are two <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/PBR.17.1.29\">neurologically distinct visual pathways</a>: the object pathway, which processes color and shape; and the spatial pathway, which processes relationships and transformations in space. There seems to be a trade-off between them, as people strong in one tend to be weak in the other. but it&apos;s unclear to what degree this is due to nature or nurture.</p><p>Some approaches to improving visualization ability include:</p><ul><li>Mental practice</li><li><a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J294v15n03_03?journalCode=wzpp20\">Imagery rehearsal</a> seems to involve simply setting aside time to practice visualizing, and can be combined with deep muscle relaxation.</li><li><a href=\"https://twin.sci-hub.tw/5828/5b238f0f7023b991082b99d8d3583385/cumming2016.pdf#page=11&amp;zoom=100,94,433\">Layered stimulus response training</a> &quot;helps individuals more easily generate and control their imagery experience by adding different elements of the image in progressive layers.&quot;</li></ul><p>Although these techniques have their nuances, they all seem to boil down to setting aside some time to try and picture something in your mind. Beyond that, you have to figure it out yourself. But the advice here seems to be that it&apos;s relatively easy to develop this skill, if you try.</p><p><strong>Five Minute Visualizing Meditation</strong></p><p>So I set my timer for five minutes (sober), sat on the couch, and closed my eyes.</p><p>At first, I saw only blankness, with intrusive verbal thoughts crossing my mind.</p><p>I realized that there were two approaches I could take. One was to set a goal, like &quot;visualize a white triangle.&quot; The other was to just allow my brain to start visualizing and let this develop freely.</p><p>I chose the latter, which immediately relieved some tension.</p><p>The images that arose in my mind where chaotic and not entirely visual. There was a sense of spatial distance that felt kinetic rather than visual, like a sensation of stretching. But visual images did arise. And along with them, a sense of being able to direct my attention, and to manipulate the visualization.</p><p>The way my attention and mental manipulations affected the visualization was often unpredictable. I saw a sketchy picture of a ceiling fan. Then I pulled the fan off the base, and replaced it with a white cube which continued to rotate. Then white cubes started to fall on the ground, which bent to form a sphere. The white cubes surrounded the sphere at regular intervals, then blasted off into space.</p><p>I saw a waving sheet-like surface. Although it was shadowy, I could consciously choose to change its color to blue, yellow, black, red. I could sort of &quot;magnify&quot; the edge of it, though I didn&apos;t have control over what that magnified image would look like, exactly, or how the waving motion would change in response to magnification.</p><p>I noticed the visualizations becoming more vivid, complex, and manipulable as time went on.</p><p>This seems promising.</p><p><strong>A Ten Minute Visualization Meditation</strong></p><p>After typing up my observations, I repeated the experiment for ten minutes.</p><p>The visualizations returned more quickly, and developed much greater vividness and complexity. There was a sense of being able to explore and control the visualization more reliably. Other senses were woven in. </p><p>I noticed some odd challenges. I pictured a house, and while I could visualize the interior, I couldn&apos;t make myself feel as though I was entirely inside the house. Instead, I felt like I was looking at the house from the outside, but had a drone-like secondary perspective that could go into the house. I tried to give this secondary perspective my full visual attention and my sense of being &quot;the real me,&quot; but I wasn&apos;t able to do this completely or for very long.</p><p>My visualizations tend to move around, change rapidly, and appear and disappear quickly. I have to chase a picture down and make an effort to hold it in my mind, otherwise it will disappear over the &quot;horizon.&quot;</p><p>I do seem to have to close my eyes to engage with my imagination. I wonder if I can improve my ability to visualize with my eyes open.</p><p><strong>Ten Minute Visualization With Eyes Open</strong></p><p>This is more difficult than the eyes-closed versions, but I am eventually able to sustain visualization. I notice a tendency to let my eyes slip closed.</p><p>There is a sense of some force, almost like a mental wind, that &quot;blows the picture around.&quot; I visualize a leaf with a lady bug crawling on it, and this wind blows the leaf all around my mental space. It takes a strong effort to get it to stay in the center of my mental vision and to stay stable enough for the lady bug to crawl across it.</p><p>Many of the visualizations are nonsense: the moon gets caught in an accordion. Others are of eating or drinking, wandering around a city, abstract geometries.</p><p>I also get weird sequences of aimless curiosity. I&apos;m standing on a rooftop. I look at the shingles. Then I imagine them popping off the roof. Can I see the individual nails? How many shingles are on the roof? Wait, who cares?!</p><p>What&apos;s missing here is both the atomic rule that gave the visualization some useful constraints, and the genuine pleasure in manipulating the rule.</p><p>Perhaps now that the visualizations are coming more easily, I can enforce some of these rules.</p><p><strong>Final Ten Minute Visualization</strong></p><p>Soon after closing my eyes, I picture an endless space containing regularly-spaced cubes. Quickly, I recognize this as a visualization of countable infinity. I picture this plane of countable cubes as resting on a much larger, uncountably infinite, column-like &quot;foundation&quot; of the numbers in between integers.</p><p>At first, I picture the number closest to the integer such as (6 and 6.000[...]1) as being on opposite ends of this &quot;column,&quot; then realize this doesn&apos;t make sense. Instead, the uncountably infinite numbers would stretch from 6 to 7, with 6.000[...]1 as close to 6 as possible. And I recognize my error as a consequence of the way we write numbers, in which you need many more digits to represent 6.000[...]1 than you need in order to represent 6.1. Even though 6.1 is further away from 6 than the number 6.000[...]1 is from 6, 6.1 visually <em>looks</em> more similar to 6 than 6.000[...]1.</p><p>I didn&apos;t have a particular aim in starting this visualization, except that I wanted it to be mathematical in nature. It seems as though there is a genre of math-y visualizations that can be productive to explore.</p><p><strong>Reflections</strong></p><p>It occurs to me that my irritation at my inability to <em>control</em> my visualizations, and having no concept that it might be productive to <em>allow</em> myself to visualize nonetheless, has led in myself to decades of neglecting this faculty.</p><p>I am wondering what will come of continued visualization practice. I am also curious about visual memory. I notice that memories would sometimes pop up as I visualized, which is otherwise a fairly rare occurrence for me. People use memory palaces to remember better. It&apos;s often possible to fit much more information into a picture than into words or sounds, so perhaps if I can improve my visualization, a better visual memory will come along with it.</p><p>I am also curious about how my habits could be altered to make more room for visualization. Typing this blog post pulls attention away from my visual imagination. When I sit down to write or think, are my thoughts tending in certain directions because I&apos;m not making an effort to engage my visual imagination?</p><p>I think I&apos;ll need more time to explore visualization in an open-ended way before I can say anything more definite.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><span>\n\nIt's often helpful to be able to build or fix things without needing\nto go to the store: perhaps it's urgent, perhaps you don't have a car,\nperhaps there's a pandemic on, perhaps you have an idea that you want\nto try out before your interest fades.  In cooking, the foods that you\nkeep on hand are often called \"pantry staples\"; what are the\nequivalent consumables worth stocking for DIY projects?\n\n</span>\n\n</p><p>\n\nFor me, the key \"ingredients\" I want to have on hand are:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p><b>2x4s</b>: 1½\" by 3½\" by generally 8', very strong\nthough not infinitely so, lots of wood to sink a fastener into.  Can\nbe doubled up if you need to make a post.  It can be worth getting\nsome 2x3s as well (cheaper; useful when a 2x4 is more than you need)\nand 2x6s (stronger; can span a wider distance; might happen to be a\nuseful thickness).  I wouldn't stock 2x8s or bigger since if I need\nthose I'm probably working on a big enough project that I'm getting\nmore materials anyway.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>¾\" plywood</b>: comes in 4x8 sheets, but these are\nunwieldy and too big to fit down my basement stairs so I usually have\nthe sheets cut into three 16\" or two 24\" strips on the store's panel\nsaw first.  I usually get AB (one nice side, one decent side) softwood\nsince it's reasonably cheap, easy to work with, and attractive enough\nwhen sanded that I don't mind it indoors.  Having some ¼\" plywood\ncan be useful for lighter things and spacing adjustments.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>screws</b>: you need some way to attach these together, and\nscrews are a good default.  Traditionally the standard\nfastener would be nails, but I find screws are a better fit for small\nprojects.  I like that there's no hammer blow to knock things out of\nalignment or need to be braced against.  Historically people have\npreferred nails because of higher shear strength, but screws are\nactually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmajKElnwfE\">very\ngood here</a>.  Star-drive (torx) screws are a lot more pleasant than\nPhillips (plus-shaped) because the bit stays on the screw more\neasily.  You want at least 3\" (attaching two 2x4s), 2¼\" (attaching\n¾\" plywood to the flat side of a 2x4), and 1½\" (attaching ¾\"\nplywood to more ¾\" plywood) though I've also found ½\", ¾\", 1\n¼\", and 3½\" sizes useful enough to keep on hand.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>glue</b>: wood glue, or you can just use white glue.  Before\nscrewing two pieces of wood together consider putting in a bit of\nglue.  You'll get a much stronger joint, and the screws provide\nclamping with no extra effort.  Since the screws are there you\ngenerally don't need to wait for the glue to dry before continuing,\nwhich removes the normal downside of using glue.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><b>scraps</b>: when you finish a project, keep your scraps,\nespecially the ones of more unusual materials.  This collection of\nweird shapes can provide inspiration, have the weird thing you're\nlooking for, or keep you from needing to cut up a larger piece.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWandering around the house, here are some examples I've made from just\nthese \"staples\":\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nTable, as a project with the kids:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/small-kids-table-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/small-kids-table.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/small-kids-table.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/small-kids-table-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nReclining phone holder (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/wrist-issues\">more</a>):\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/reclining-phone-holder-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/reclining-phone-holder.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/reclining-phone-holder.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/reclining-phone-holder-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nMonitor stand (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/making-a-standing-desk\">more</a>):\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/monitor-stand-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/monitor-stand.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/monitor-stand.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/monitor-stand-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSousaphone holder:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sousaphone-holder-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sousaphone-holder.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sousaphone-holder.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/sousaphone-holder-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThese are also good to have on hand for projects where you're ordering\nsomething special-purpose, but either don't want to order staples as\nwell or won't know exactly what you want until you have the new part:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nCase, to go around an ordered USB controller (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/building-toe-buttons\">more</a>):\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/usb-game-controller-adapter-box-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/usb-game-controller-adapter-box.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/usb-game-controller-adapter-box.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/usb-game-controller-adapter-box-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nFolding couch monitor, which needed the monitor and hinges (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/folding-couch-monitor\">more</a>):\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/folding-couch-monitor-painted-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/folding-couch-monitor-painted.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/folding-couch-monitor-painted.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/folding-couch-monitor-painted-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAdapting a sliding window to fit an AC (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/air-conditioning\">more</a>):\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sliding-window-air-conditioner-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sliding-window-air-conditioner.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sliding-window-air-conditioner.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/sliding-window-air-conditioner-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nEverything I do this way does have a bit of a homemade look, but I\nreally like how quickly I can make all sorts of sturdy things.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100166698067572\">facebook</a></i></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<h1>The Skill of Noticing Emotions</h1><p><em>(Thanks to Eli Tyre and Luke Raskopf for helping teach me the technique. And thanks to Nora Ammann, Fin Moorhouse, Ben Laurense, Daniel Hynk, Nathan Young, Toby Jolly, Michael Ng, James Walsh and Jaime Sevilla for feedback on various drafts!)</em></p><p><em>(For those familiar with the core idea, you might find it more interesting to skip to the long list of personal examples in the Appendix)</em></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>I was introduced to a technique called Noticing at my <a href=\"https://www.rationality.org/\">CFAR</a> workshop back in October, to become better aware of my emotions and better at productively reacting to them. I&#x2019;ve since found this a really powerful technique, and it&#x2019;s become a pretty key tool for solving problems in my life. My goal in this post is to give my take on Noticing, explain how I actually go about using it, and hopefully convince you to give it a try!</p><p>What do I mean by Noticing? I first want to introduce the idea of an emotion or mental state being <strong>noticeable</strong>: something that feels important and urgent and is immediately promoted to conscious attention. An excellent example of a noticeable experience is hearing my name. When I hear someone say &#x201C;Neel&#x201D; it immediately feels important and captures my attention. Even if I&#x2019;m busy and focused on something, hearing my name can easily break that focus and cause me to change what I&#x2019;m doing.</p><p>Being noticeable breaks down into two parts: something that I&#x2019;m <strong>aware</strong> of and something that feels <strong>important</strong>. For example, I&#x2019;m often aware that I&#x2019;m procrastinating, but can&#x2019;t muster the motivation to actually do anything about it. It&#x2019;s something I am aware of, but not something that feels <em>important</em>. I like to think of this as spending most of my life on autopilot, focused on the present moment. A noticeable event or emotion will turn off autopilot and engage my conscious mind. Hearing my name does disable autopilot, but if I&#x2019;m aware that I&#x2019;m procrastinating and continuing to do so, I&#x2019;m still on autopilot.</p><p>Noticing, then, is a technique to take a specific emotion or mental state<a href=\"about:blank#fn-pM7LcMpZPeFFfrzy4-1\">[1]</a> and deliberately make it noticeable. This essentially installs automatic triggers to turn off my autopilot. This is extremely useful, because a lot of problems in my life dissolve when I can just be more self-aware at the right times! For example, I&#x2019;ve had a lot of success with noticing the feeling of defensiveness in arguments. By default, I&#x2019;ll often lash out and stop arguing in good faith when defensive. But by making the feeling of defensiveness noticeable, I can recognise in the moment where the urge to lash out comes from. This doesn&#x2019;t stop me becoming defensive, but once I&#x2019;ve identified the problem I can take steps like removing myself from the situation.</p><h2>Why should you care about noticing?</h2><p>In general, fixing a problem involves figuring out the right thing to do, the right time to do it, and then actually doing it in the moment. And I often find it easy to do the first two, but then forget to do the right thing in the moment. One symptom of this is that I find it <em>much</em> easier to give other people advice than to apply it myself. For example, it&#x2019;s easy to understand a bias like the planning fallacy in the abstract, and even to identify it in friends. But it&#x2019;s <em>much</em> harder to notice in the moment when I&apos;m falling prey to it and to put in the effort to correct for this. I find Noticing valuable for bridging this gap, and helping remind myself in the moment to actually apply the ideas I already understand. I spend much of my life on autopilot, focused on what I&apos;m doing, and Noticing helps me be self-aware at the times when it&#x2019;s most useful to be.</p><p>A concrete example of how I&#x2019;ve used this: While working, unrelated ideas often pop into my head and I feel an urge to explore them. Eg an impulse to check my messages or google a random fact. This always feels justified in the moment, and like it&#x2019;ll be a quick detour. But in practice it&#x2019;s incredibly hard to stop procrastinating, often starting a half hour rabbit hole that leaves my original task long forgotten. This makes it near impossible to maintain focus and deep work. With Noticing, I&#x2019;ve been able to make the feeling of those fleeting urges feel noticeable. And by becoming self-aware at the moment of distraction, I can recognise that the urge just <em>feels</em> important, rather than actually mattering. This doesn&#x2019;t work perfectly, but it triggers several times a day, and has made it <em>much</em> easier to focus.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve found a pretty wide range of things can be improved by better control of my autopilot. A few general categories:</p><ul><li> I find it easy to get caught up in mental loops, like procrastinating by scrolling on Reddit, or falling into spirals of insecurity. Noticing can help me to recognise the loop as it&#x2019;s beginning, and to break it then<br> </li><li> This has been a <em>really</em> powerful application - I find these loops build a lot of momentum and take a lot of willpower to break once they&#x2019;ve begun. Breaking them before they really begin is much easier.<br> </li><li> To increase my awareness of positive emotions, eg gratitude.<br> </li><li> To better use and track my intuitions, eg noticing what&#x2019;s confusing me while learning.<br> </li><li> To build better social habits, eg paraphrasing back what the other person is saying, being less judgemental<br> </li></ul><p>Further, by practicing Noticing for a while I&#x2019;ve found myself developing a more general skill of being self-aware. I&apos;ve found it notably easier over time to be aware of how I&apos;m behaving and why, and better at tracking my emotions. And it&apos;s much easier to start noticing something new!</p><h2>How to apply it</h2><p>I&#x2019;ve hopefully convinced you that Noticing is useful, so how to actually use it? My approach is to install a mental reflex, where every time I feel the mental state I take a simple physical action, like snapping my fingers. I call these actions <strong>markers</strong>, and their purpose is to take the experience of Noticing outside of my head and make it harder to ignore.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll now outline the exact algorithm I use to install these reflexes<a href=\"about:blank#fn-pM7LcMpZPeFFfrzy4-2\">[2]</a>, but in general I expect this to be a pretty personal process. I expect the best approach to vary a lot between people, so I encourage you to adapt it to whatever feels most natural and helpful!</p><br><h3>Algorithm</h3><ol><li>Choose the mental state</li><ol><li>This should be as specific as possible. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be easy to put into words, but should be eg one you have clear memories of</li><li>Normally I first identify a problem which could be resolved by being self-aware at the right times, and then identify a relevant mental state. Good prompts: </li><ol><li>When do I think &#x201C;I should have known better&#x201D;?</li><li>What do I often regret?</li></ol><li>A good litmus test for whether Noticing fits your problem: &#x201C;If I could set an alarm to go off in my head at the right time, would this problem feel solved?&#x201D;</li></ol><li>Choose your <strong>marker </strong>action</li><ol><li>This should be a small and subtle physical action. It&#x2019;s important that it&#x2019;s something you can always do, eg snapping your fingers or tapping your foot</li></ol><li>List 10 previous examples where you&apos;ve felt this mental state</li><ol><li>Ideally ones that are recent, and that feel visceral - where they&apos;ve really stuck in your mind</li><li>10 is an arbitrary number, the point is that more examples are always better. I recommend setting a 5 minute timer and spending the full 5 minutes brainstorming. It&#x2019;s easy to list examples off the top of your head and then feel stuck, but it&#x2019;s surprising how many more examples you can find with more time.</li></ol><li>Mentally simulate each example, and take the action when you feel the emotion</li><ol><li>Try to really relive the experience, in as much visceral detail as possible. The goal is that it&#x2019;s something you feel rather than something you&apos;re describing</li><li>Add as many details as possible to flesh out the scene</li><ol><li>Eg what were you saying? What did it feel like? Where were you? What could you see?</li></ol><li>Look out for cues associated with the state, eg physical sensations, thought patterns you have, common contexts</li></ol><li>Actively practice this over the next 2 weeks - I call this the <strong>learning period</strong></li><ol><li>Keep it in the back of your mind that you&apos;re practicing Noticing on this mental state</li><li>Leave yourself regular reminders, eg post-it notes next to your bathroom mirror, daily email reminders, a list you check as part of your morning routine</li><li>It can be helpful to track the times you successfully notice over this period, eg incrementing a <u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Counter-Clicker-Chrome-People-Counting/dp/B000I6R1PS/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&amp;keywords=tally+counter&amp;qid=1589216315&amp;sr=8-14\">counter</a></u>, or writing it down</li></ol></ol><h3>Motivation behind the Algorithm</h3><p>The following is my model for why this algorithm works. All models are wrong, and so this is almost certainly incorrect in important ways, but I find this useful for motivating the algorithm. When tweaking the algorithm, I think it&#x2019;s more important to keep to the spirit of this model than to keep to the letter of the algorithm.</p><p>When I&#x2019;m focused on a task, on autopilot, most of my conscious attention is going towards it. But some part of my subconscious mind, my <strong>awareness</strong>, is still aware of what&#x2019;s going on around me. There&#x2019;s always going to be a lot of unimportant background stimuli, so my awareness will ignore things by default. But it needs to be able to promote important things to my attention, so it has a list of a few important things. And when it detects something with a strong association to something important, it flags that in my conscious attention. This is the experience of something being noticeable. So, to make a mental state noticeable, I need to make it <strong>feel important</strong> and to create <strong>strong associations </strong>with it.</p><p>How does the algorithm actually help with this?</p><ol><li>Choosing as specific a mental state as possible is valuable, because if it feels clear and concrete in my mind, the associations will be stronger. There&#x2019;s a clear target to latch on to.</li><li>The marker action is useful to help it actually feel important in the moment. </li><ol><li>It&#x2019;s important that it&#x2019;s physical, because it&#x2019;s easy to be somewhat aware of the emotion but for it not to feel important and be ignored. Just as I can be aware that I&#x2019;m procrastinating but it doesn&#x2019;t feel important enough to be able to stop. Taking a <em>physical </em>action, even a simpler one, makes it much harder for my mind to implicitly ignore the emotion</li><ol><li>It&#x2019;s easy to skip this part, and think you can &#x2018;just notice&#x2019; - I <em>highly </em>recommend having a physical marker</li></ol><li>The marker should be a simple action that takes minimal willpower and can always be performed. This makes it easier to build the reflex of <em>paying attention</em> to this mental state. The goal is to help your mind focus, rather than to directly solve the problem</li></ol><li>Mentally simulating historical examples helps make it feel important, because my mind is extremely good at pattern spotting. These simulations give it a bunch of visceral data points of &#x201C;when I feel this emotion, it&#x2019;s important and I react to it&#x201D;. </li><ol><li>It&#x2019;s normal for this to feel a bit over-the-top, you want to really drill in that this is a reflex. The point is to do it enough times for my subconscious mind to spot a pattern, rather than stopping when I feel like my conscious mind gets it. </li></ol><li>When simulating, it&#x2019;s also useful to look for as many <strong>cues </strong>for the mental state as possible. Ie things that correlate with it, like physical sensations and associated contexts and emotions. </li><ol><li>This increases the probability that my awareness notices one of the associated cues, and flags it to my attention. </li><li>I call this increasing the <strong>surface area</strong> on the emotion, I want to understand it and what it looks like in as much detail as possible.</li></ol><li>The learning period is important because it&#x2019;s <em>hard</em> to build this artificial association that the emotion is important. In the short term, this association will be quite weak, and keeping it in the back of my mind helps me respond to it. As it becomes more familiar, the association becomes stronger and is more likely to stick in the long term.</li><ol><li>A useful framing: The default state of the world is that I will forget about all new habits I develop. This isn&#x2019;t something I can resolve by just &#x201C;trying harder&#x201D;, I need to take action and create external reminders to help it stick long term</li></ol></ol><h3>Tips</h3><ul><li>Try to simulate the examples in as much detail as possible. The goal is to build surface area and familiarity</li><ul><li>For me, it feels like a mental movie playing out in my mind</li><li>Pay attention to physical, emotional and sensory details</li><li>Recency helps a lot</li></ul><li>Solutions: The marker action is explicitly <em>not </em>supposed to be a solution to the problem, the goal is just to help you notice it better</li><ul><li>The end goal is to end up noticing <em>and </em>solving the problems, but the bottleneck is noticing. Once I reliably become self-aware at the right time, the solution is often obvious. Separating noticing the problem and solving it makes it easier to achieve both in the long term.</li><li>In practice, I&#x2019;ll often have default reactions in mind for what to do once I&#x2019;ve become self-aware. But it&#x2019;s important to give yourself the affordance to ignore those, and to make the marker action as low-effort as possible. To build an effective reflex, it needs to be something you can do without thinking, rather than feeling like a decision</li></ul><li>Choosing a specific state is harder than it first seems. My instinct is to look for a specific <em>word</em>, but often one word can refer to many different mental states and internal experiences</li><ul><li>Eg, for me anxiety could mean: </li><ul><li>Fear of consequences</li><li>Awareness of uncertainty</li><li>Concern on someone else&apos;s behalf</li><li>Fear of social judgement.</li></ul><li>Often I notice during the examples stage that the emotion feels a bit fuzzy and hard to pin down. This normally means I&#x2019;m not being specific enough</li><li>This is hard and often requires iteration, don&#x2019;t expect it to be immediately easy! I often start Noticing something new, realise that I didn&#x2019;t have a sufficiently specific state in mind, and need to start again.</li></ul><li>Pace yourself: I highly recommend only trying to Notice one thing at a time, especially when starting out. The <em>goal </em>is to build a robust habit, but it will be quite fragile at first, and practicing on multiple states makes each stick less well.</li><ul><li>This can seem a bit frustrating, but I actually find it really exciting from the right perspective. Noticing is a great example of a <u><a href=\"http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/p/microrationality.html\">Tortoise Skill</a></u>: something I can train in the background while living my life normally. These aren&#x2019;t a big deal in the short term, but really build up in the long term</li></ul><li>For important problems, it&#x2019;s often not clear what the solution is, even if you became self-aware at the right time. Noticing can still be helpful there, because it can help you get surface area on the problem. By practicing Noticing in the moment, you can get a better idea of what the problem actually feels like in the moment and what goes through your head. This can be a valuable first step to help you figure out what a good solution could be</li><li>Upkeep: I find sometimes Noticing sticks well at first, but fades within a month or two. It can be helpful to simulate a few more examples to top it up if I notice it fading</li><li>Tally counters: I find it <em>super </em>useful to carry a <u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Counter-Clicker-Chrome-People-Counting/dp/B000I6R1PS/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&amp;keywords=tally+counter&amp;qid=1589216315&amp;sr=8-14\">tally counter</a></u> in my pocket, and make my physical action to click the counter</li><ul><li>This is a very visceral and hard to ignore action</li><li>Carrying the counter around is a good physical reminder that I&#x2019;m practicing Noticing</li></ul><li>Orient positively:</li><ul><li>Ultimately, the goal is to build a success spiral, and make Noticing something to feel excited about. I think this makes it stick much better, and is more fun to think about</li><li>But it&#x2019;s easy to, eg, realise an hour after the fact that I didn&#x2019;t notice the emotion I&#x2019;m tracking, and feel guilty about this. This is unhelpful because it builds negative associations, making me much more likely to give up on the idea and stop tracking the emotion.</li><ul><li>I find it helpful to reframe forgetting as another chance to practice, because I now have a new, visceral example to simulate!</li></ul><li>I find it useful to dwell on the fact that Noticing is <em>hard </em>to make robust, and that any progress is exciting. It&#x2019;s extremely useful to notice an emotion half of the time, if the alternative is never!</li></ul><li>Some people find it easier to practice Noticing on sensory experiences, especially when starting out. </li><ul><li>Eg the feeling of the breeze, the sound of birdsong, the glint of sunlight</li><li>I expect this could be worth trying if your emotions/mental experiences don&#x2019;t feel very visceral to you</li></ul><li>Phase shifts: Noticing, if done well, is a habit. Like most habits, it&#x2019;s very easy to lose when you have a big shift in your day-to-day life, eg going on holiday, starting a new job, moving, etc. If you have an upcoming phase shift, it&#x2019;s important to ensure you re-learn the habit afterwards!</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Ultimately, I&apos;m extremely excited about Noticing because a lot of my problems boil down to not being self-aware at the right time. I think the bottleneck for learning a lot of good mental habits is doing the right thing <em>in the moment</em>, and Noticing has given me an extremely powerful tool for actually doing this. If you&apos;re reading this and empathise with the kinds of problems I&apos;ve outlined, I urge you to take some time to try it out yourself! </p><p>Noticing is a very general technique, so I&#x2019;ve given a long list of specific ways it&#x2019;s worked for me in the Appendix. I find it easy to get excited about the potential of a new technique, but fail to come up with any clear direction for how to apply it, and end up forgetting about it. So hopefully this list can provide some inspiration for specific ways it could be useful to you.</p><p>I&apos;ve found it especially interesting to practice Noticing in the longer term. It&apos;s felt like there&apos;s a general meta-cognitive skill of &quot;being aware of how I&#x2019;m thinking and what I&#x2019;m feeling&quot; that I&apos;ve been developing. I&apos;ve both found it much easier to begin noticing something new, and found it generally easier to be self-aware and pay attention to what I&apos;m feeling. So if you feel excited about the idea of Noticing, I highly recommend just trying it out on something, even if it doesn&#x2019;t feel like a perfect fit. You aren&#x2019;t just solving that specific problem, you&#x2019;re training the general skill of self-awareness!</p><p>It&apos;s extremely easy to be <u><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy\">Typical Mind Fallacy</a></u>-ing when talking about techniques like this, and I expect different things work best for different people. I&apos;d be extremely interested in hearing about other people&apos;s experiences with Noticing, or other effective tools for these kinds of problems!</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><h1>Appendix: Personal Examples</h1><p>A few notes:</p><ul><li>These are obviously super specific to how my mind works, and likely won&#x2019;t perfectly generalise</li><ul><li>I&#x2019;ve done my best to capture the relevant emotional state as the Trigger, but it&#x2019;s pretty difficult to articulate this kind of thing. The words I&#x2019;ve put are often vague, but correspond to a specific state inside my head</li></ul><li>They range from having clear default actions to being more &quot;turn off auto-pilot and figure out what to do next&quot; (recorded as &#x2018;be self-aware&#x2019;)</li><ul><li>I found when training that the bottleneck was mostly becoming self-aware at the right time, so the point was to focus on the marker action. </li><li>But it was useful to have a list of sensible next actions in mind, which I&#x2019;ve listed as Reactions</li></ul></ul><h2>Productivity</h2><ul><li>Guilt-based motivation: I very frequently use <u><a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/guilt/\">guilt-based motivation</a></u> on myself, which is pretty bad for my general happiness and intrinsic motivation. </li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Using mental force on myself</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Take a break, &quot;would it matter if I didn&apos;t do this?&quot;, visualise why I feel excited about the task, &quot;how will doing this task make my future self happier?&quot;</li><li>I feel extremely excited about this particular application, because I helped a friend try Noticing on this problem. And a few months later they seem to have essentially stopped feeling guilt-based motivation!</li></ul><li>Distraction:</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: The sudden urge to do something (eg google something, check my messages)</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Often just being self-aware is enough to kill this - I realise it isn&#x2019;t important. If it&apos;s important, I&apos;ll make a Trello card for it then go back to work.</li><ul><li>This combines very well with Trello&apos;s ability to easily add an item in a few keystroke</li></ul><li>As I detailed earlier, I&#x2019;ve found this <em>super </em>useful for maintaining Deep Work</li></ul><li>Learning more effectively:</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: The feeling of confusion or lack of clarity when learning a new concept</li><li><strong>Reactions</strong>: Thinking further on it, google &quot;intuitive explanation of ___&quot;, asking someone for help, making a note to look into this later</li><li>Often while learning something new I&apos;ll be a bit confused, and notice after a while that I&apos;m totally lost. Noticing helps me focus on exactly what&#x2019;s confusing me and detect this much earlier, and has made my learning much more efficient!</li><ul><li>I think this is one of the most useful mental habits I&#x2019;ve ever developed, and has definitely helped a lot with getting the most out of my degree!</li></ul></ul><li>Not making progress: I find that I&#x2019;ll often be trying to do something, and be spending time inefficiently. And this isn&#x2019;t clear to me in the moment, but feels obvious after the fact</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger: </strong>Frustration, feeling caught in a loop, feeling stuck</li><li><strong>Reaction: </strong>Open an empty notepad and write down what&#x2019;s currently in my head</li><li>This triggers in a <em>really </em>wide range of situations, it&#x2019;s triggered over 45 times in the 2 weeks since I started this habit. </li><ul><li>Eg pursuing an ineffective idea, trying to brainstorm but really staring off into space, trying to work when my mind is focused on an unpleasant interaction, spending 10 minutes googling irrelevant details, etc.</li><li>It&#x2019;s had fun side-effects like becoming notably faster at doing maths problems. I recognise much earlier &#x201C;this solution idea is fruitless and I should try something else&#x201D;.</li></ul><li>Taking my thoughts out of my head and writing them down is a key component of actually solving the problem. This often takes my thoughts from a vague mess to something concrete, and the next step then feels clear</li><li>This is much less specific than some others - I expect I&#x2019;d have struggled to learn it without a lot of earlier Noticing practice</li></ul><li>Procrastination:</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Aversion/putting something off (eg &quot;I should do this some time&quot;)</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Be self-aware (and realise there&#x2019;s a good chance I&#x2019;ll never get round to this). Ask myself &quot;Would I be surprised if I don&apos;t do this?&quot; Add it to my to-do list</li><li>This has been <em>really </em>useful, I&#x2019;ve found that 80% of &#x201C;good ideas I forget about&#x201D; fail at this step, but will happen if I can just get the ball rolling</li></ul><li>Pushing myself: I find that I have a strong completionist drive, and really hate leaving things unfinished. I&#x2019;ll often push myself to complete things, long past the point where I should have taken a break.</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: The compulsion to complete something, pushing myself</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Be self-aware, take a break, closing the tab, &#x201C;Does it matter if I don&#x2019;t finish this now?&#x201D;</li></ul><li>Punctuality:</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Awareness of how long I have left before I need to leave</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: &quot;Would I be surprised if I was late for this?&quot;, just making myself get ready now, setting a timer for when to start getting ready</li><li>This is pretty idiosyncratic: I&#x2019;m both late for everything, <em>and </em>very aware of time, but it doesn&#x2019;t feel <em>important</em>.</li></ul></ul><h2>Social</h2><ul><li>Understanding other people&#x2019;s explanations:</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: The feeling of confusion or lack of clarity</li><li><strong>Reactions</strong>: Asking a question, asking them for an example, paraphrasing back to them what they&apos;ve said, expressing confusion and prompting them to elaborate</li><li>I think these habits have <em>majorly</em> improved my communication skills. I find this often triggers several times during a conversation, and that I frequently misunderstood the first time.</li></ul><li>Giving compliments:</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Appreciation/admiration/gratitude</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Thanking the other person, or making a note to message them later</li><li>This has been a really awesome one for my overall happiness! Just being more aware of gratitude feels great, and I better appreciate why my friends are awesome</li><li>I think giving sincere compliments more freely makes me much more pleasant to be around</li></ul><li>Having interesting conversations:</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Curiosity/excitement about what somebody is saying</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Asking a question about that point, prompting them for more</li><li>I find that often when someone says something, small parts of what they say is much more interesting to me than the rest. Focusing the conversation on that part (often recursively) is now my default approach to conversations</li><ul><li>This has <em>massively </em>increased the number of interesting conversations I have!</li><li>It&#x2019;s especially effective when I&#x2019;ve just met the person, as a strategy for going from small talk to something mutually interesting</li></ul></ul><li>Being less judgemental:</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Annoyance/dismissiveness directed at someone else</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: &#x201C;What&#x2019;s a world where they&#x2019;re a good person and they acted this way?&#x201D;</li><li>I find it pretty easy to feel frustrated at other people, and view them in a fairly un-nuanced, one-dimensional sense. A lot of this stems from instinctively being judgemental rather than empathetic.</li></ul></ul><h2>Discussions</h2><ul><li>Defensiveness in an argument:</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Feeling defensive - often associated with stress, heart beating faster, not feeling grounded</li><li><strong>Reactions</strong>: Changing the topic, trying to paraphrase back their case, trying to steelman, disengaging from the conversation</li></ul><li>Being empathetic (Minds should make sense):</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Frustration/incredulity at someone&apos;s beliefs/position in an argument</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Reminding myself that other people&apos;s minds make sense from the inside, and that I&apos;m probably missing something. &#x201C;Assume they&#x2019;re correct, explain why?&#x201D; Paraphrase back to them their point of view. Asking for clarification/posing hypotheticals. </li><li>This one is pretty generally applicable, and I think has improved my communication skills a lot! </li><ul><li>This also triggers when I&#x2019;m explaining something, and somebody asks a question that feels dumb. My default reaction is frustration, and to repeat the point. But I&#x2019;ve found that being curious and trying to unpack why the question made sense to them can let me resolve the confusion much more effectively</li></ul></ul></ul><h2>Mental health</h2><ul><li>Insecurities: </li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: The feeling of self-doubt</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Be self-aware, use the Outside View, ask a friend for calibration, look for past evidence</li><li>I find it pretty easy to be caught in loops of self-doubt and insecurity. Noticing helps me to kill the loops before they really get going</li><ul><li>Surprisingly, just reminding myself &#x201C;this is a cognitive bias, and I can&#x2019;t trust my intuitions&#x201D; is often enough to dissolve it.</li></ul></ul><li>Mindless procrastination: I&apos;ll often get caught up in a loop of procrasting for a long time, and realise I stopped enjoying myself half an hour ago</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: The feeling of strain/going through the motions, noticing more time has passed than I expected</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: &quot;Do I actually want to be doing this?&quot;, shutting my eyes, closing the tab, taking a break</li><li>The underlying problem feels pretty heavily related to the difference between <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HmfxSWnqnK265GEFM/are-wireheads-happy\">wanting and liking</a></u></li></ul><li>Anxiety: I find it super easy to get caught in anxiety spirals, Noticing helps to break the loop at the start</li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Anxiety</li><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Taking a break, going outside, meditating. Be self-aware</li><li>Just realising that it&#x2019;s all in my head, and that the <em>feeling </em>of importance isn&#x2019;t the same thing as actually being a big deal, both go a long way to resolving this.</li></ul><li>Paying attention to my emotions: </li><ul><li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Suppressing my emotions/trying to be in control </li><ul><li>Unexpectedly, this is a really salient trigger for me</li></ul><li><strong>Reaction</strong>: Be self-aware.

Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3jYwvwrNXyD3koHTM/open-and-welcome-thread-june-2020?commentId=fWW6orw8pj3NCX9mz\">as Wei Dai discovered recently</a>, this tends to backfire.</p><p>It may feel a bit counterintuitive, but this is actually fairly predictable: the math backs it up on some reasonable assumptions. First, let&#x2019;s assume that the topic required unusual levels of clarity of thought not to be sucked into the prevailing (wrong) consensus: say a mere 0.001% of people accomplished this. These people are worth finding, and listening to.</p><p>But we must also note that a good chunk of the population are just pessimists. Let&#x2019;s say, very conservatively, that 0.01% of people predicted the same disaster just because they always predict the most obvious possible disaster. Suddenly the odds are pretty good that anybody you find who successfully predicted the disaster is a crank. The mere fact that they correctly predicted the disaster becomes evidence only of extreme reasoning, but is insufficient to tell whether that reasoning was extremely good, or extremely bad. And on balance, most of the time, it&#x2019;s extremely bad.</p><p>Unfortunately, the problem here is not just that the good predictors are buried in a mountain of random others; it&#x2019;s that the good predictors are buried in a mountain of extremely poor predictors.

    "htmlBody": "<p>This is the first post in a sequence aiming to create a practical guide to resolving interpersonal conflict (with a light focus on workplace conflicts). It draws on a lot of rationalist ideas without having any prerequisite readings, and with an attempt at accessible language; I hope this ends up equally useful to everyone, whether or not you consider yourself part of the &quot;rationalsphere&quot;.</p><p>The ideas behind this sequence started as some quick notes for a colleague at work, based on a long whiteboard conversation we had. Eventually I wrote it up properly as <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2019/09/14/success-over-victory-conflict-resolution/\">a massive 6000-word personal blog post</a>. Finally after some prompting, I&apos;m polishing it a bit further, splitting it up into usable chunks, and sharing it here.</p><h2>Conflict, and Conflict Resolution</h2><p>We encounter conflict every day. Perhaps you&#x2019;re having an unavoidable Thanksgiving-dinner conversation about politics, or maybe you&#x2019;re chatting with your neighbour when you realize that you have <em>very</em> different views on a recent change by the local sports team. For me, as for many people, a lot of these conflicts tend to arise at work: dealing with unreasonable customers, unreasonable coworkers, or unreasonable managers is just part of the job. Whether your work is blue-collar, white-collar, retail, or even raising chickens, conflict happens whenever two people want or believe different things, and that isn&#x2019;t exactly rare.</p><p>With so many conflicts in our day-to-day lives, resolving them becomes an important life skill. Typically, we do this using communication; it&#x2019;s thankfully rare that minor conflicts devolve into violence. And yet, communicating well is one of the hardest parts of modern life. Technology has created a number of new ways to communicate our ideas, those ideas grow more complex every day, we spend less and less time face to face, and partisan political bias seems to be driving us further and further apart. Even so, communication is still our main approach for resolving most of the conflicts we encounter.</p><p>Given its importance, it shouldn&#x2019;t be surprising that conflict resolution is a topic already rich in conventional wisdom, academic studies, and self-help books; practically speaking I don&#x2019;t have much that is new to contribute. However, at the heart of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltonto.com/2017/innovation-is-combination/\">many great innovations</a> is the combination of multiple ideas in different fields, and that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to try and do here. I&#x2019;ll be mixing together insights collected from a number of places, including the epistemological debates that I went through as part of my religious journey, the rationalist community, a brief but interesting career as a manager of people, and of course several <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2017/08/12/authentic-service-and-self-improvement/\">self-help books</a> which touch on conflict resolution in some fashion. Anchoring all of these is my unusually intense dislike of interpersonal conflict. It&#x2019;s just a part of who I am, so I&#x2019;ve spent a lot more time resolving conflicts and thinking about this in my own life than I think is normal, or probably healthy.</p><p>I debated leaving out the parts that are truly unoriginal to make a single post on &#x201C;the good stuff&#x201D;, but I think that would be doing a disservice to the topic. It&#x2019;s all <em>important</em>, and just because some of it has been covered elsewhere, doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s not required to be successful. I&#x2019;ve broken the material into four main posts which I call <strong>Attitude</strong>, <strong>Communication</strong>, <strong>Comprehension</strong>, and <strong>Resolution</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Attitude</strong> is about how we think about and approach conflict in our lives, and the attitudes we can take to do that more effectively.</li><li><strong>Communication</strong> is about the different ways we communicate, the impact that can have on conflict, and how to choose the best communication tool for the job.</li><li><strong>Comprehension</strong> is about the value of fully grasping the whole picture, including the many sides to each debate, even when most of them are wrong.</li><li><strong>Resolution</strong> is a deep dive into the nature of disagreement, providing tools and patterns to let you break any conflict down into its fundamental building blocks, with simple tricks for classifying and resolving those atomic disagreements one at a time.</li></ul><p>Before we begin, I want to note three more things up front. First, that all of this is focused on conflict resolution via communication. If a conflict has reached the point of physical violence then the rules are very different; some of what&#x2019;s in here might still be applicable, but I make no warranty to that effect. Second, that this is partly written from the perspective of a neutral third-party moderator. Everything here is just as applicable if you&#x2019;re actively involved in the conflict, but it becomes much harder to use effectively. And third, that this sequence is entirely focused on resolving conflicts, not making decisions. Effective decision-making and consensus-building in the context of an unresolved (or unresolvable) disagreement is a whole other problem deserving of its own sequence.</p>",

All opinions expressed are my own however.]</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thelastrationalist.com/fuzzies-and-saddies-part-one-x-risk-and-motivation.html\">In my essay on Fuzzies and Saddies</a> I wrote about four components that were necessary to implement &quot;Eliezer&apos;s version of extropy&quot;:</p><blockquote>1. High future shock. This is necessary to realize that there are solutions  to the problems we have, and anything really worth fighting for. That  it&apos;s not all hopeless, there are glorious things within our reach. <br> </blockquote><blockquote>2. A love for the world and its inhabitants, <a href=\"http://yudkowsky.net/other/yehuda/\">the belief that death is Bad</a>,  a fully developed secular moral system. New Atheism is toxic nonsense  because skepticism is toxic nonsense. The skeptic focuses only on  downside risk, EY-style rationality is an improvement because it  considers opportunity cost. It&apos;s not enough to not-lose in rationality,  you need to capture the foregone upside. <br> </blockquote><blockquote>3. Sanity. You need to have a very clear view of the world, and be very well in tune with yourself, <a href=\"https://www.thelastrationalist.com/memento-mori-said-the-confessor.html\">have a strong well constructed (i.e., not full of ad-hoc garbage) identity</a>, good epistemics, etc. <br> </blockquote><blockquote>4. Agency. You need to be well versed in the practical methods of piloting  yourself to actually do things. Building habits, not giving up at the  first setback, strength, etc. <br> </blockquote><p>I currently believe that the path to this starts with agency, because  without that there is no motivation to put in the work to get these  other things. Agency is hard for people because the default  implementation of human motivation is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing\">satisficer</a>.  You get hungry, you eat and are no longer hungry; until the equilibrium  is disrupted and you become hungry again. People rarely act like  maximizers, getting as much &apos;good&apos; as they can from a situation. Perhaps  part of the magic of money is that it reliably gets people to act like  maximizers, people are willing to keep pursuing money no matter how much  they have. People are not willing (nor able) to keep eating food after  their hunger has been sated. A maximizing agent by contrast implicitly  wants everything, the infamous <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer\">paperclip maximizer</a>  will, if given the power to do so, consume every available resource in  the universe to make more paperclips. Any full-scope agent will begin to  look like a maximizer, <strong>regardless of their morality</strong>. Maximizing and agency are not synonyms, but maximizing and Agency are.</p><h2>The Gospel Of Universalist Greed (And a Warning)</h2><p>This has interesting consequences for good people with any interest  in being &apos;rational&apos;. A rational agent that is offended by suffering, or  that enjoys seeing other people live meaningful lives has no principled  reason to be satisfied with just assisting the people around them. In  theory they should want to be a maximizer, so that they can help people  on a larger scale. They should try to cultivate a kind of Universalist  Greed, by which &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; becomes a love for the world.  This is illustrated intuitively by an experience I had picking up trash  on the beach:</p><blockquote>One day I went with my friend to the beach to pick up trash. Now, I  wasn&apos;t under any illusions that this was Saving The World or whatever, I  just wanted to go for a walk with my friend and cleaning up trash on  the beach sounded like a decent thing to do while we talked. And while  we were doing it, we got to asking ourselves how you could scale the  thing up. If you wanted to pick up more trash, because we could see that  we were really fighting an uphill battle against apathy here, what  could you do? One idea was to do a livestream of ourselves doing the thing, and  hopefully inspire more people to go try it by showing our cool  philosophical conversations during. Another idea was to make a trash collection game where it would use  machine learning to identify and score points for different kinds of  trash, but it&apos;d be hard to prevent people from gaming that I guess. But,  the really important point is that picking up all that trash was  actually pretty physically taxing. I have a picture somewhere of the  collection. <br> <br> We picked up a garbage bag full of trash, on the beach. Which birds try  to eat, fish try to eat, poisons the water, etc. And I imagined big  piles of trash like this on every beach in the world, and the herculean  task of trying to pick it all up. All that aching in my bones was one  garbage bags worth, that pain is what it felt like to pick up a beach of  trash. So you know, kind of start...zooming out. 5 beaches worth of  pain, 10 beaches, 20 beaches, 50, 100...I imagined this little army of  people picking up trash off beaches, at a scale where it&apos;s no longer  human, it&apos;s just a number. And each monotonic increase in that number  represents that pain in my bones, that ache in my back. And the good of picking up a beach worth of trash. If your brain was  designed to exist in the modern world, that&apos;s what it would feel like to  do good at scale, to make a number go up that was adjusted to the right  thing. It&apos;d be the good feelings of picking up a beach worth of trash,  times that tick, tick drip drip of good being done in the world if you  do it at scale. </blockquote><p>Universalist Greed in this precisely-articulated sense is a novel  feature of Extropy. As far as I know before the 20th century there is no  concept of a &apos;maximizing agent&apos; as a value-neutral category. There are  &apos;tyrants&apos; and &apos;conquerers&apos;, but the idea of a good person who wants  literally everything is foreign territory. Perhaps the closest is  Niccolo Machiavelli, who was reviled as a sort of antichrist for their  advocacy of rational tyranny on utilitarian grounds. It is no  coincidence that a certain kind of left-wing thinker <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/the-silicon-ideology\">reacts to &apos;rationalist&apos; ideas by screaming &apos;fascism!&apos;</a> (Armistead, 2016). This kind of frank ambition is traditionally parsed as moral and spiritual sickness.</p><p>The problem with wanting everything is that everyone else wants  everything too. Solving this problem is nontrivial. One simple  equilibrium that works is to instruct good people to renunciate and to  punish others who fail to renunciate their agency. In practice this  looks a lot like the message of the song &apos;Handlebars&apos; by the Flobots.  Handlebars starts with a tranquil atmosphere as the protagonist  describes their carefree life doing simple, naive, childish things. As  they mature and become more savvy they begin to involve themselves in  politics and business. By the end of the song they&apos;ve become a global  tyrant drunk with power:</p><blockquote>My reach is global, my tower secure <br> My cause is noble, my power is pure <br> I can hand out a million vaccinations <br> Or let &apos;em all die in exasperation <br> Have &apos;em all healed from their lacerations <br> Or have &apos;em all killed by assassination <br> I can make anybody go to prison <br> Just because I don&apos;t like &apos;em </blockquote><p>The message is simple: Don&apos;t become too ambitious, or you&apos;ll  inevitably do harm. It&apos;s not an unfounded fear, the cautionary tale of  so many 20th century dictators should be enough to give us serious  pause. It&apos;s easy to imagine these figures as self serving tyrants of  which we have nothing in common, yet Mussolini writes in his Doctrine of  Fascism (Mussolini &amp; Gentile, 1932):</p><blockquote>Anti-individualistic, the Fascist conception of life stresses the  importance of the State and  accepts the individual only in so far as  his interests coincide with those of the State, which stands for the  conscience and the universal, will of man as a historic entity (11). It  is opposed to classical liberalism which arose as a reaction to  absolutism and exhausted its historical function when the State became  the expression of the conscience and will of the people. Liberalism  denied the State in the name of the individual; Fascism reasserts the  rights of the State as expressing the real essence of the individual  (12). And if liberty is to he [sic] the attribute of living men and not  of abstract dummies invented by individualistic liberalism, then   Fascism stands for liberty, and for the only liberty worth having, the  liberty of the State and of the individual within the State (13). The  Fascist conception of the State  is all embracing; outside of it no  human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus  understood, Fascism, is totalitarian, and the Fascist State - a  synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values - interprets, develops, and  potentates the whole life of a people (14). </blockquote><p>This decidedly Hobbesian vision of social organization reads like a  dark parody of Eliezer Yudkowsky&apos;s proposal for a Coherent Extrapolated  Volition. CEV is a preliminary idea for how a &apos;singleton&apos; Friendly  Artificial Intelligence might implement good will towards mankind. It is  &quot;our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we  wished we were, had grown up farther together&quot; (Yudkowsky, 2004). In  Mussolini&apos;s thought however all poetics are dispensed with, any notion  of an &apos;eschaton&apos; dismissed as mere fantasy, the only goodwill that is  retained is the &apos;goodwill&apos; shown by a body towards its constituent  cells. In the Fascist vision of universalism, all men are placed into  moral relevance by constraining them within a constructed set of values  that they exist only in relation to. While it might sound evil to you  now, this disturbing vision was met with rapturous applause  internationally. Mussolini was thought a savior that might liberate  mankind from that <em>other</em> totalitarian ideology, Communism.</p><p>If we&apos;re too inclined to deny this, the communist dictators are even  more illustrative. Perhaps most illustrative is the life of Mao  Tse-tung. Most of my knowledge of Mao&apos;s life comes from Jerome Chen&apos;s <em>Mao and The Chinese Revolution</em>  (Chen, 1970) which admittedly reads more like hagiography than  biography, nevertheless painting a fascinating picture. Unlike the  internationalist revolutionaries Lenin and Trotsky, Mao was never a  fanatic believer in Communism as a system of government. Rather Mao was  an opportunistic Chinese Nationalist. He believed it was not  geopolitically possible to align himself with the Jeffersonian  Democracies (which he philosophically preferred) and instead chose to  agitate for Communism on the grounds that it would give China a powerful  partner in the USSR. He deftly navigated national politics, civil war,  and various levels of intrigue to become head of the Chinese Communist  Party.</p><p>Mao&apos;s tenure presided over some of the most horrible man-made events  in human history, his former friend Sidney Rittenberg describes it aptly  (Margolis, 2013):</p><blockquote>So how does the man on the gated estate in Arizona, who once played gin  rummy with Mao and introduced him to the dictator&#x2019;s much-loved Laurel  and Hardy, assess Mao today?  <br> <br> &#x201C;I think China has to face the fact that Mao was a monster, one of the  worst people in human history. He was a genius, but his genius got  completely out of control, so he was a great historic leader, and a  great historic criminal. He gave himself the right to conduct social  experiments that involved upturning the lives of hundreds of millions of  people, when he didn&#x2019;t know what the outcome might be. And that created  famines in which tens of millions died, and a revolution in which  nobody knows how many died.&#x201D; <br> <br> Mao, Rittenberg believes, began to feel guilt for his more catastrophic  actions. &#x201C;In 1967, I saw him sitting on the Tiananmen gate tower with a  look of complete anguish on his face. I think he was upset that things  weren&#x2019;t going right.&#x201D; But at a personal level, he says, &#x201C;although he  said nice things about me, I didn&#x2019;t feel any warmth. He liked to meet  for a lively, democratic discussion on why his policies were correct. If  you disagreed, you were a counter-revolutionary. He was an enlightened,  ingenious strategist, but the narrow peasant envy and prejudice were  obviously there all the time.&#x201D; </blockquote><p>Yudkowsky himself writes about this phenomena from the perspective of  evolutionary psychology. He says that people should model themselves as  running on &apos;corrupted hardware&apos; that will <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Ends-Dont-Justify-Means-Among-Humans\">reliably flip the switch towards abuse and evil</a>  once the right conditions are met (Yudkowsky, 2008). I can&apos;t recall the  source, but I distinctly remember an objection being made at some point  that dictators have surprisingly few heirs if this was the explanation  for their behavior. The response was something like &quot;well maybe the  ancestral environment didn&apos;t teach us how to take advantage when you  have power on that level&quot;. Eliezer himself admits that the relative  equality of hunter-gatherer bands is a factor he has trouble accounting  for (Yudkowsky, 2008).</p><p>On the contrary I find this argument somewhat dubious <em>precisely because</em> Matt Ridley recounts in detail the practices that historical monarchs and lords used to maximize their offspring in his <em>The Red Queen</em> (Ridley, 1993). For example Ridley makes the practice of using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_nurse\">wet nurses</a>  a key point in his argument that monarchs maximize their inclusive  fitness. The behavior we observe is not consistent with these  historically known practices. Lenin left behind no children, Stalin had  three, Mussolini had six, and most historians believe Hitler had no  children. It would certainly have been possible for each of these men to  sire a large family if they&apos;d had the desire. That they did not, or  allowed the shinyness of their calling to distract them from it suggests  a disturbing possibility: When they say that they did the things they  did because they felt it was the right thing to do, they are being  entirely honest with us. </p><p>For Universalist Greed to be a viable ethic, there must be some  method of getting maximizing agents to cooperate with each other.  Yudkowsky&apos;s Coherent Extrapolated Volition is one prototype of this  coordinating machinery. The idea is that a peace treaty may be struck  between Agents so that anyone who happens to win the game will give away  almost all of their winnings to others. At first this might seem like a  non-starter. However by publicizing this idea along with the  observation that most human Agents probably have significant overlap in  their desires it becomes possible to imagine that the highest  expected-value scenario for any individual Agent is to credibly adopt  (and expect others to adopt) this strategy. If you live in a world where  you can expect the heir of the cosmos to gift you (and everyone else)  some of their resources this is plausibly a much better dynamic for you  on average than a free-for-all. A simple litmus test for whether you are  running a &apos;Universalist Greed&apos; strategy is how you would feel about  someone else with your strategy and values becoming god-monarch of the  universe: If it wouldn&apos;t seem significantly different than you yourself  playing that role, that is a good sign you&apos;re in this category.</p><h2>Alchemy As Universalist Greed</h2><p>While Universalist Greed in the Extropian sense is novel, the concept  does have ancestors that stretch back many centuries; even all the way  back to antiquity. Often these ancestors are startling in their  prescience, stating almost exactly important ideas which appear again in  more modern ontologies. Probably the most important of these ancestors  is alchemy, in part because of its longevity (chemical research into  making gold dates back to the 3rd century A.D.), its direct inspiration  of the more modern ideas that replaced it, and its focus on the natural  world as the place to seek mankind&apos;s liberation.</p><p>In alchemy we begin to see not just notions of post-scarcity or the  idea of defeating death, there is a more profound precedent which is set  in this field: we begin to see the first seeds of a Universalist Greed.  This is shown in the common moral dimension which is added to the quest  for the Philosopher&apos;s Stone. Normally the Philosopher&apos;s Stone is a  vehicle to satisfy human greed, turning worthless base metals such as  lead into valuable metals such as silver and gold. Knowledge of the  stone was said to be carefully guarded so that it does not fall into the  wrong hands. In his <em>Secrets of Alchemy</em> Lawrence Principe  describes Jabir ibn-Hayyan&apos;s (721 &#x2013; c. 815) &apos;dispersion of knowledge&apos;,  which is supposedly advised to him by his master (Principe, 2013):</p><blockquote>The Jabirian corpus also carries stylistic features that left their mark  on subsequent alchemical writers. The first of these is the dispersion  of knowledge (tabdid al-&apos;ilm), a method ostensibly for helping to  preserve secrecy. Jabir states that &quot;my method is to present knowledge  by cutting it up and dispersing it into many places.&quot; The idea is that  the entirety of Jabir&apos;s teaching cannot be found altogether in one  place; instead, he distributes a single idea or process piecemeal  through one or several books. This technique partly fulfills the charge  given to Jabir by his supposted master, Ja&apos;far: &quot;O Jabir, reveal the  knowledge as you desire, but such that none have access to it but those  who are truly worthy of it.&quot; </blockquote><p>We also see this moral dimension brought up in the Franciscan  attitude towards alchemy, which saw the practice as an important defense  against the coming of the antichrist, to quote John of Rupescissa (ca.  1310 &#x2013; between 1366 and 1370) (Principe, 2013):</p><blockquote>I considered the coming times predicted by Christ in the Gospels,  namely, of the tribulations in the time of the Antichrist, under which  the Roman Church shall be tormented and have all her worldly riches  despoiled by tyrants...Thus for the sake of liberating the chosen people  of God, to whom it is granted to know the ministry of God and the  magisterium of truth, I wish to speak of the work of the great  Philosophers&apos; Stone without lofty speech. My intention is to be helpful  to the good of the holy Roman Church and briefly to explain the whole  truth about the Stone. </blockquote><p>This moral dimension is also exhibited by writers like Count Michael  Maier (1569-1622) who discuss their quest for the stone in decidedly  moralizing language (Tilton, 2003):</p><blockquote>In Maier&apos;s eyes disease was closely associated with impiety and a sinful  lifestyle; and the Universal Medicine which he strove to uncover  imparted &apos;temperance&apos; to the human body, a term which refers  simultaneously to a somatic and a psychic or moral state. The imbalance  of humours in the body that Maier sought to treat was the direct result  of overindulgence in sensual pleasures, such as the drinking of alcohol,  sexual debauchery and gluttony. Likewise, impious urges such as anger  are the result of just such a disequilibrium in the four bodily fluids,  which may be remedied by the temperance-imparting lapis just as metals  may gain a more perfect proportion or balance of opposing elements.  Furthermore, the operation of Maier&apos;s alchemical remedies depends upon  the &apos;virtue&apos; of divine origins inhering in the rays of the sun, be it  directly received or reflected; and in the term virtus itself we may  also see something of the holistic sense that has been largely lost to  contemporary science, i.e. the dual meaning of &apos;strength&apos; or &apos;power&apos; and  &apos;moral virtue&apos;. </blockquote><p>All of this is quite interesting when you consider that the  Philosopher&apos;s Stone is fundamentally a greedy enterprise. Many  alchemists were maligned by their neighbors for reputed abuse of the  stone. For example the alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel (1673-1734) found  his start with the theological branches of chemistry. His uncharismatic  disposition made him many enemies such that he was involved in several  duels (Montillo, 2013). Rumors followed him, including accusations of  body snatching for his alchemical experiments. The peasantry came to  believe that he had brewed the legendary philosophers stone, and was  using gold produced by it to buy up property. He is said to have lost  the recipe in a house fire which destroyed his lab. Local clergy were  offended by his pursuit of the elixir of life and many thought him a  minion of the devil (Montillo, 2013).</p><p>In fact, controversy over alchemy led to some of the first arguments  in favor of man&apos;s ability to surpass nature through technology. The  Franciscan friar Roger Bacon (c.&#x2009;1219/20 &#x2013; c.&#x2009;1292) wrote that contrary  to the ideas of critics, alchemical gold did not have to be inferior to  natural gold; it could be <em>superior</em> by dint of its synthetic  manufacture (Principe, 2013). Today nobody would argue that man is  incapable of creating products that surpass those offered by nature, but  in the 13th century when these arguments were made they were radical. </p><p>It is probably no coincidence that Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein, often  considered the first work of Science Fiction, focused on alchemical  themes of reanimation and artificial life. Shelley was inspired by the  real-life Galvinists: in the eighteenth century the discovery of animal  electricity combined with old chemical knowledge to create hopes of  total mastery over biology. Creatures might be &quot;assembled from their  component parts&quot; and given life by an electrical stimulus (Montillo,  2013). There was even some hope that death itself might be conquered.  Percy Shelley, from whom Mary Shelley learned all of her alchemical  knowledge, was an alchemist who was also interested in galvanic ideas.  It is through this curious historical circumstance that the history of  Extropy is actually bound up directly with the history of alchemy.</p><p>The 19th century also saw explicit secularism become a rising threat  to the established order. Here is the &apos;honorable&apos; antiquarian Algernon  Herbert <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=_XSMG4df8fQC\">discussing Hermetic (i.e. esoteric-alchemical) atheist mystery cults</a> (Herbert, 1829). Keep in mind that &quot;The Iliaster&quot; is one of  Paracelsus&apos;s names for the philosophers stone:</p><blockquote><strong>The same is the demigod of the school of Ammonius Saccas, called Man*</strong>.  The outward doctrine of the pagans represented the dead as remaining in  the imperfect state of soul without body, and they were not so much to  blame for their description of that state as for the perpetuity which  they assigned to it. <strong>They held out no promise of resurrection to any, and no general expectations of reward or punishment.</strong>  And it was the intention of the Free-Masons to promulgate again the  like doctrines, as they  informed Henry 6th, saying, that they had in  concealment &#x201C;the art of becoming good  and  per&#x201C;fect&apos;79  <em>without the help of fear and hope</em>.&#x201D; <strong>  But the interior doctrine was, that the souls of men (that is to say,  so much of the Quintessenceas was in  them, or, as the Alchemists called  it, their Evestrum) should suffer an oblivion of their past lives, and a  compurgation by means of the elements or of a sort of chemical  permutation, and should then pass into other human or animal bodies;  until at last their very existence was destroyed by absorption into the  mass of the universe. </strong> <br> <br> Such was and is in substance, though with various modifications in the  ways of stating it, the spirit of the interior atheism as concerning the  future state. But those who, by participation in the Great Mysteries,  partake of the nature of the Great Iliaster, shall return with glorified  bodies when he returns, and are subject to no Lethe which should  destroy their moral and to no absorption which should destroy their  natural identity. <strong>That is not a mere dream of the fanatics; but it is  (in one sense) supported by the prediction of Daniel, that many of the  wicked shall arise at the first resurrection.</strong> The reader now sees  how that fact, which is historically ascertained, is also morally  accounted for, the interment of treasure; those, who were to come in the  retinue of the great universal tyrant, were, in hoarding, not merely  giving to him, but saving for themselves. </blockquote><p>I find this passage (bolding mine) stunning in both its semantic  associations and its testimony to the threat that Herbert must have felt  from atheism. He calls the atheists &apos;fanatics&apos;, a word which would seem  entirely out of place in the same sentence as &apos;atheism&apos; today. Not only  does he engage with the concept, itself an admission that atheism has  some intellectual standing, Herbert feels compelled to give his account  of what &apos;mundane atheists&apos; of the Hermetic (alchemical) sort believed.  Further, having discussed in brief their plan to defeat death he goes so  far as to admit that <em>this plan will work(!)</em>, at least until  Christ smites them for their hubris during the second coming. This is an  admission of the most baffling sort, I am completely shocked that this  text exists. Herbert seems to be a respected enough author <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algernon_Herbert\">to have his own wikipedia page</a>  so it seems unlikely that this is some kind of anomalous document like a  conspiracy theory. This gives us some window into the role that alchemy  would have played (through Hermeticism) in creating the foundations for  the secular humanism that would later play so prominent a role in  Extropy.</p><p>In his history of transhumanism Nick Bostrom says that there is no  relation between the work of Nietzsche (1844 &#x2013; 1900) and transhumanism  because Nietzsche is looking for a non-technological intervention into  human nature (Bostrom, 2005). I disagree, in particular I disagree that  this is the reason why there is no relation and I disagree that there is  no relation. The specific disqualification of Nietzsche&apos;s work is that  there is no notion of Universalist Greed in it; Nietzsche is not a  Universalist. His elitist individualism is somewhat at odds with the  manic individual altruism of thinkers like Max More and Eliezer  Yudkowsky. Nevertheless it approaches absurdity to claim that the person  who wrote &quot;Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done  to overcome him?&quot; has no philosophical relationship to transhumanism. </p><h2>20th Century Development</h2><p>During the 20th century Hermetic orders and secret societies shifted  somewhat in their role. Increasing secularization made many of the  secrets previously harbored by these pseudo-cults speakable in public  without (lethal) reprisal. These orders were also the victim of a  general decline in fraternal organizations and clubs. This makes their  history in the 20th century something of a late, decadent phase. A great  deal of that decadence might be attributed to one Aleister Crowley, the  infamous Satanist that disrupted the more or less stable Masonic  structure and teachings. </p><p>Crowley got his start in these organizations through his induction  into the Hermetic Order Of The Golden Dawn in 1898. Earlier at Trinity  College he had developed a love of the alchemist-poet Percy Bysshe  Shelley, and was almost certainly a fan of <em>Frankenstein</em>  (Wikipedia contributors, 2020), which Percy Shelley helped edit (Adams,  2008). In 1910 as part of his wandering mystic eclecticism, Crowley  joined the Ordo Templi Orientis branch of Hermeticism, where he  eventually achieved the VII degree (Carter &amp; Wilson, 2004). Two  years later in 1912 he would publish his <em>Book of Lies</em>, Theodor  Reuss, the head of the OTO was furious. He confronted Crowley and  claimed that he had revealed the highest secret of the order, a form of  sex magick (i.e. of the sort that made Tantric Buddhism infamous in the  West) in this book (Carter &amp; Wilson, 2004). Crowley insisted he had  done no such thing, until Reuss showed him the passage in question.  Reuss swore him to secrecy and advanced him in the order to its highest  degree. In 1917 Crowley began rewriting the masonic material at the  foundation of the OTO in line with his <em>Thelema</em>, a philosophy which posited that each man has a <em>will</em> and that &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law&quot; (Carter &amp; Wilson, 2004).</p><p>While at this point the reader may be tempted to conclude that we&apos;ve  lost the thread of connection, and none of this has anything to do with  Max More or Eliezer Yudkowsky, they would be quite wrong. In the same  year that he began developing his Thelema in earnest, Crowley wrote the  novel <em>Moonchild</em> (1917) which discusses the artificial creation of a world-savior in the form of a homunculus (Carter &amp; Wilson, 2004):</p><blockquote>But other magicians sought to make this Homunculus in a way closer to  nature. In all these cases they had held that environment could be  modified at will by the application of telesmata or sympathetic figures.  For example, a nine-pointed star would attract the influence which they  called Luna &#x2014; not meaning the actual moon, but an idea similar to the  poets&apos; idea of her. By surrounding an object with such stars, with  similarly-disposed herbs, perfumes, metals, talismans, and so on, and by  carefully keeping off all other influences by parallel methods, they  hoped to invest the original object so treated with the Lunar qualities,  and no others. (I am giving the brifest outline of an immense subject.)  Now then they proceeded to try to make the Homunculus on very curious  lines. <br> <br>  Man, said they, is merely a fertilized ovum properly incubated. Heredity  is there even at first, of course, but in a feeble degree. Anyhow, they  could arrange any desired environment from the beginning, if they could  only manage to nourish the embryo in some artificial way &#x2014; incubate it,  in fact, as is done with chickens to-day. Furthermore, and this is the  crucial point, they thought that by performing this experiment in a  specially prepared place, a place protected magically against all  incompatible forces, and by invoking into that place some one force  which they desired, some tremendously powerful being, angel or archangel  &#x2014; and they had conjurations which they thought capable of doing this &#x2014;  that they would be able to cause the incarnation of beings of infinite  knowledge and power, who would be able to bring the whole world into  Light and Truth. <br> <br>  I may conclude this little sketch by saying that the idea has been  almost universal in one form or another; the wish has always been for a  Messiah or Superman, and the method some attempt to produce man by  artificial or at least abnormal means. </blockquote><p>Given his conception of the soul as information it is unsurprising  that Eliezer Yudkowsky would seek to endow his Friendly AI with the  abstract will (or &apos;values&apos; as he terms it) of the human race. His  abnormally birthed Messiah is not <strong>a</strong> man so much as he (she?) is <em>all</em>  men. Certainly the ambition to summon a being of infinite knowledge and  power to enlighten humanity is invoked as literally here as possible.  But for the moment we will step away from Crowley, to focus on another  important ancestor to Eliezer&apos;s philosophy, one Count Alfred Korzybski.</p><p>If one event in the 20th century had to be singled out as decisive of  its character, it would probably be the first world war. WWI was an  unprecedented martial slog that inspired a great deal of philosophical  soul searching. It also created the necessary conditions for the rise of  the Soviet Union, which included its own branch of Utopian Universalist  Greed that this work is too brief to contain (Andarovna, 2019). Alfred  Korzybski participated in this slaughter, and found himself quite shaken  up by it. Worse still, many had predicted WWI before its onset, Jan  Bloch&apos;s infamous <em>Is War Now Impossible?</em> was published 15 years  before the start of WWI. If everyone knew the war was on its way it  seemed absurd that nobody could stop it (Miyazaki, 2020). </p><p>Korzybski considered the problem of what lesson should be learned  from WWI long and hard. The ultimate result of his thinking was the book  <em><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25457/25457-pdf.pdf\">The Manhood of Humanity</a></em>, published in 1921. Manhood of Humanity is a book whose essential thesis is that man is a <em>time binder</em>,  differentiated from the rest of nature by the ability to retain  experiences and transmit them across generations. In Korzybski&apos;s view,  technological and social progress is an exponential function dependent  on already accumulated knowledge (Kodish, 2011). Empirically the growth  rate of technological capabilities had surpassed that of socializing  abilities, inevitably leading to existential risk:</p><blockquote>At present I am chiefly concerned to drive home the fact that it is the great disparity between the rapid progress of the natural and technological sciences on the one hand and the slow progress of the metaphysical, so-called social &#x201C;sciences&#x201D; on the other hand, that sooner or later so disturbs the equilibrium of human affairs as to result periodically in those social cataclysms which we call insurrections, revolutions and wars. </blockquote><blockquote>...</blockquote><blockquote>And I would have him see clearly that, because the disparity which  produces them increases as we pass from generation to generation&#x2014;from  term to term of our progressions&#x2014;the &#x201C;jumps&#x201D; in question occur not only  with increasing violence but with increasing frequency. </blockquote><p>This realization was so profound to Korzybski that he couldn&apos;t be  satisfied just writing a book about the general phenomena. Given his  thesis, it seemed obvious that the only hope of saving the world would  be to find out what &apos;time binding&apos; is made of, and then use that  understanding to improve our ability to bind time in the social sciences  (Kodish, 2011). He expected to put out a follow up book soon after <em>Manhood</em>, but it actually took him 10 years to write. The resulting work was published in 1933 as <em>Science and Sanity</em>,  which can be thought of kind of like Eliezer Yudkowsky&apos;s Sequences if  they had been published in the 1930&apos;s. To write them, Korzybski did his  best to absorb the science then available to him about human cognition,  physics, mathematics, and several other subjects besides (Kodish, 2011).  He wrote that man was not an animal (obviously a mammal, but a  time-binding mammal!), that cognition should be thought of as something  performed by the whole-organism and its nervous system, that &quot;the map is  not the territory&quot;, and had his students learn to differentiate between  levels of abstraction above raw sensory perception. </p><p>Science and Sanity was a cult hit that appealed to a particular sort  of person. It was especially popular with the then-burgeoning Science  Fiction fandom (Brunton, 2020):</p><blockquote>Van Vogt, lover of systems, was always convinced a system existed for  his life: a way to generate &#x201C;unusual solutions&#x201D; for the various problems  of being human. He wrote a get-rich-quick book, a book about hypnotism,  and &#x2013; God help us all &#x2013; &#x201C;a novel about my theories on women,&#x201D; &#x201C;which  has never been published as such&#x201D; (small mercies). He wrote entire  novels based on the system of General Semantics, a set of language and  logic practices for becoming more objective and reasonable &#x2013; to  streamline the process of thinking. He sketched out schemes for  meta-systems of living, with names like &#x201C;Null-A&#x201D; and &#x201C;Nexialism,&#x201D; and  spent a decade or so in Dianetics, fiddling with e-meters and tape  recorders amid piles of pamphlets offering superhumanity in a storefront  on Sunset Boulevard. (He shared this peculiar trajectory toward  transforming consciousness &#x2013; Semantics, Scientology, and pulp science  fiction, rather than, say, Marx or activism or acid &#x2013; with William  Burroughs.) </blockquote><p>The 1930&apos;s science fiction pulp (as found in <em>Astounding Science Fiction</em>)  was of a new kind for literary pulp, in that it came with an  ideological mission (Wright, 2013). While today we take the existence of  rockets for granted, in the 1930&apos;s rockets were a fringe theoretical  subject whose practical possibility had not been established (Carter  &amp; Wilson, 2004). One of the overall goals of the science fiction  pulp was to take humanity to the stars by promoting the development of  rocketry (Wright, 2013). Science fiction has in fact preceded and in  many cases promoted the practical research that would later come to  redefine our society and conceptions of what is possible.</p><p>The mind-powers obsessed science fiction fandom and the esoteric  magick of Aleister Crowley are combined in the person of Jack Parsons.  Parsons is unusual in that his childhood interest in science fiction  translated into pioneering work on rocketry. In fact, Parsons is  arguably the person who did the most to make practical rocketry in the  United States viable (Carter &amp; Wilson, 2004). He was also a devoted  disciple of Crowley, and became infamous for the Thelemic rituals and  ceremonies he&apos;d put on in his Pasadena mansion. These were part of a  general quest to take Thelema mainstream, ushering in the age of the  beast (Carter &amp; Wilson, 2004). By destroying Christianity Parsons  hoped to uplift humanity, a goal ostensibly shared by Crowley who wrote  at one point to Parsons (Carter &amp; Wilson, 2004):</p><blockquote>It seems to me that there is a danger of your sensitiveness upsetting  your balance. Any experience that comes your way you have a tendency to  over-estimate. The first fine careless rapture wears off in a month or  so, and some other experience comes along and carries you off on its  back. Meanwhile you have neglected and bewildered those who are  dependent on you, either from above or from below. <br> <br> I will ask you to bear in mind that you have one fulcrum for all your  levers, and that is your original oath to devote yourself to raising  mankind. All experiences, all efforts, must be referred to this; as long  as it remains unshaken you cannot go far wrong, for by its own  stability it will bring you back from any tendency to excess. At the same time, you being as senstitive as you are, it behoves [sic]  you to be more on your guard than would be the case with the majority of  people. </blockquote><p>For his part, Parsons turned his leased mansion estate into 19  apartments. The ad he put out in the local paper informed prospective  tenants that he would only rent to atheists and bohemians (Carter &amp;  Wilson, 2004). This strange group house became a social and intellectual  hot spot for the Pasadena aerospace and science fiction scenes.</p><p>While I&apos;m not aware of Parsons himself ever taking any interest in  General Semantics, his friends sure did (Carter &amp; Wilson, 2004).  Most notably Parsons was friends with L. Ron Hubbard, who played the  role of &apos;scribe&apos; during Parsons&apos; infamous <em>Babalon Working</em>, in  which he combined Enochian magick rituals with tantric sex practices to  try and birth a Moonchild (Carter &amp; Wilson, 2004). Needless to say  this did not work, but the experience seems to have been formative for  Hubbard, whose enduring interest in Crowley&apos;s Thelema (supposedly first  encountered at age 16) and General Semantics would become key  inspiration for his Dianetics and Scientology (Wright, 2013):</p><blockquote>One striking parallel between Hubbard and Crowley is the latter&apos;s  assertion that &quot;spiritual progress did not depend on religious or moral  codes, but was like any other science.&quot; Crowley argued that by advancing  thrugh a graded series of rituals and spiritual teachings, the adept  could hope to make it across &quot;The Abyss,&quot; which he defined as &quot;the gulf  existing between individual and cosmic consciousness.&quot; It is an image  that Hubbard would evoke in his Bridge to Total Freedom. <br> <br> Although Hubbard mentions Crowley only glancingly in a lecture &#x2014; calling  him &quot;my very good friend&quot; &#x2014; they never actually met. Crowley died in  1947 at the age of seventy-two. &quot;That&apos;s when Dad decided that he would  take over the mantle of the Beast and that is the seed and the beginning  of Dianetics and Scientology,&quot; Nibs later said. &quot;It was his goal to be  the most powerful being in the universe.&quot; </blockquote><p>It would be easy to dismiss Thelema as a weird, marginal product of  its era, one only of interest to modern readers as a curiosity. However  Crowley&apos;s ideas seems to cast a long cultural shadow whose influence is  not always obvious. For example, it&apos;s interesting to me how much focus  is put into the notion of &apos;finding your passion&apos;, a concept that seems  almost identical to Crowley&apos;s assertion that the purpose of life is to  find your Will and then do it. It seems likely that the Sith in George  Lucas&apos;s <em>Star Wars</em> are based at least in part on Thelema. A  skeptically inclined reader could probably dismiss any modern  similarities as general secularization, which Crowley merely forecasted  rather than caused. Perhaps more important to our current analysis is  that these ideas were &apos;in the water supply&apos; among science fiction  authors during this period. Someone who makes a habit of reading scifi  from that time would at the very least be indirectly exposed to them.</p><p>In his post <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/YicoiQurNBxSp7a65/is-clickbait-destroying-our-general-intelligence\">Is Clickbait Destroying Our General Intelligence?</a>  Eliezer Yudkowsky writes about how when he was growing up he read many  books from the Golden Age of Science Fiction in the 1950s (Yudkowsky,  2018). This is the same Golden Age which believed that psychology would  eventually come to dominate the sciences in prestige. This is evident  for example in the works of Isaac Asimov who wrote in his <em>Foundation</em>  trilogy that the greater of the two civilization-restoring  &apos;Foundations&apos; would be the one which dealt with matters of the human  mind. This theme also appears in the work of A.E Van Vogt, who based his  <em>World of Null-A</em> on the notion of a future where General Semantics eventually becomes the foundation of world government.</p><p>This latter novel is interesting in that Yudkowsky cites it as the  first time he was exposed to General Semantics (Yudkowsky, 2009). <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/q79vYjHAE9KHcAjSs/rationalist-fiction\">In his post on rationalist fiction</a>  Eliezer says until writing it he had not been aware that Korzybski had  invented the phrase &apos;the map is not the territory&apos;. This implies that he  probably isn&apos;t particularly familiar with Korzybski, instead being  exposed to General Semantics as a proper system through Hayakawa&apos;s <em>Language In Thought and Action</em>.  Unlike Korzybski, Hayakawa is at least mentioned in The Sequences.  Unfortunately Bruce Kodish&apos;s excellent biography of Korzybski was not  available until 2011, otherwise Eliezer might have read it and avoided  certain mistakes; like picking the name &apos;rationality&apos; for his  philosophy.</p><p>One of the key reasons for the overall failure of General Semantics  as a movement was it gambled very hard on the future prestige of  psychology, which did not materialize. This can be seen in Korzybski&apos;s  insistence and dedication to getting mainstream psychology to take him  seriously, but it can also be detected in the sort of person that  populated the General Semantics movement. For example in Bruce and Susan  Kodish&apos;s <em>Drive Yourself Sane</em> both authors admit to being  therapists (Kodish &amp; Kodish, 2011). I suspect that this was directly  related to the expectation that psychology and psychiatry were rising  stars, and that being eminent in these fields would be a ticket to  widespread success and awareness.</p><p>Interestingly enough even the concept of &quot;post-rationalism&quot; is not new. In his <em>The Art of Awareness</em>  (originally published in 1966) J. Samuel Bois attempts to reform  General Semantics in the vein of postmodern philosophy. The Art of  Awareness is a frustrating book, I actually shouted at it a couple times  while reading, especially when I read: &quot;The central notion is that we  have no way of determining whether the world is structured according to  the patterns we ascribe to it&quot; (Bois, 1996). At that point I screamed  &quot;YOU CAN PREDICT THINGS!&quot;. It is made all the more frustrating by the  fact that it is written with the highest erudition and education. I&apos;m  quite sure that Bois and <a href=\"https://meaningness.com/\">David Chapman</a> would get along swimmingly.</p><p>Bostrom&apos;s history of transhumanism says that after this period you  mostly have groups of disconnected subject matter focus like cryonics  (Bostrom, 2005). This is not a history of transhumanism, so most of  these are off topic for our purposes. Instead we will skip ahead to 1988  when Max More publishes his Extropy Magazine. Extropy is interesting in  that it is perhaps the first time someone wrote about Universalist  Greed with so much openness and enthusiasm. I suspect that a great deal  of the negative reaction to More&apos;s Extropy is more or less an intuitive  diagnosis of moral sickness over this feature. In his <em>Principles of Extropy</em> he writes (More, 2003):</p><blockquote><strong>Perpetual Progress</strong> <br> <br> Extropy means seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and effectiveness, an  open-ended lifespan, and the removal of political, cultural, biological,  and psychological limits to continuing development. Perpetually  overcoming constraints on our progress and possibilities as individuals,  as organizations, and as a species. Growing in healthy directions  without bound. </blockquote><p>In a world which is smothered in &apos;green&apos; activism that worships  nature in lieu of real solutions to our looming resource problems, the  idea of infinite growth is radical and a little scary. The high-flying  predictions of the 1950&apos;s were predicated on the idea that we would have  massive surplus energy from nuclear reactors (McCluskey, 2018). In that  sense the open, boundless ambition of More is a return to the form of  mid 20th century science fiction. I often use the phrase &quot;Eliezer&apos;s  Extropy&quot; to refer to the spinoff philosophy that Yudkowsky calls  &apos;rationality&apos;, which goes to great lengths to lay out Extropy as a  necessary consequence of physical science and rationality:</p><blockquote>This &apos;extropian character&apos; is of course dependent on a deep familiarity  with the philosophy&apos;s core themes and aesthetics. If the overriding  theme of Christianity is repentance and salvation, the theme of  Eliezer&apos;s extropy is necessity and necessary conclusions. To teach  someone extropy, is to teach them necessity. To advance you must resolve  confusions, stop confusing layers of abstraction, and become a scholar  of natural philosophy. Rationality and extropy go together in the same  way that to become a better Buddhist you have to meditate. Confusing as  it may have been it&apos;s not surprising that Eliezer labeled his extropy  and his rationality as the same thing. High future shock is meant to  follow from an unbiased consideration of human potential. If your  unbiased consideration of human potential would not suggest high future  shock, this is a sign that your natural philosophy is too weak. </blockquote><p>Most readers might be a little confused by this, since neither &apos;Extropy&apos; or &apos;Max More&apos; are mentioned in the sequences (<a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Search?q=extropian&amp;action=search\">though an &apos;extropian&apos; is</a>). However as Tom Chivers recounts in his book <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em>,  Eliezer Yudkowsky was a contributor to the Extropians mailing list that  split because he felt the Extropians &apos;boundless growth&apos; was not  boundless enough (Chivers, 2019):</p><blockquote>One of the names on the Extropians&apos; mailing list was Eliezer Yudkowsky.  &apos;This was in the 1990s,&apos; says Robin Hanson, an economist at George Mason  University and an important early Rationalist figure. &apos;Myself, Nick  Bostrom, Eliezer and many others were on it, discussing big future  topics back then&apos;. But neither Bostrom nor Yudkowsky were satisfied with  the Extropians. &apos;It was a relatively libertarian take on futurism,&apos;  says Hanson. &apos;Some people, including Nick Bostrom, didn&apos;t like that  libertarian take, so they created the World Transhumanist Association,  explicitly to no longer be so libertarian&apos;. The World Transhumanist  Association later became Humanity+ or H+. &apos;It hardly trips off the  tongue as a descriptor,&apos; says Hanson. &apos;But that&apos;s what they insisted  they call everything.&apos; Humanity+ had a more left-wing, less utopian  approach to the future. <br> <br> Yudkowsky, on the other hand, felt that the problem with the Extropians  was a lack of ambition. He set up an alternative, the SL4 mailing list.  SL4 stands for (Future) Shock Level 4; it&apos;s a reference to the 1970  Alvin Toffler book <em>Future Shock</em>. Future shock is the  psychological impact of technological change; Toffler describes it as a  sensation of &apos;too much change in a short period of time&apos;. <br> <br> ... <br> <br> He acknowledged that transhumanists like the Extropians were SL3,  comfortable with the idea of human-level AI and major bodily changes up  to and including uploading human brains onto computers. But he wanted to  create people of SL4, the highest level. SL4, he says, is being  comfortable with the idea that technology, at some point, will render  human life unrecognizable: &apos;the total evaporation of &quot;life as we know  it&quot;.&apos; </blockquote><p>While Yudkowsky&apos;s &apos;rationalist community&apos; has been in decline for  some years, the notion of universalist greed returns in Effective  Altruism. Effective Altruism, which is mostly a floating signifier for a  variety of causes, principally Singerism, significantly waters down the  ambition of More and Yudkowsky. In its primary component (Singerism)  the notion of conquering the universe has been replaced by &quot;Earn To  Give&quot; and saving marginal lives in the third world (Todd, 2017). This  shares an uneasy alliance with what&apos;s left of the Yudkowsky sect, as  well as his fellow travelers like Nick Bostrom.</p><p>This is all a brief outline of an immense subject, but the takeaway is that open Universalist Greed is a novel, promising, yet also very dangerous idea. Some thinkers have argued that <a href=\"https://sinceriously.fyi/choices-made-long-ago/\">there are no significant information effects</a> involved in the choice to pursue Universalist Greed (Ziz, 2018). That seems strange to me, given that this idea is more or less new and the default morality teaches good people to renunciate agency. Asking them to overturn thousands of years of tradition is a big ask, even if the justification of existential risk is compelling. Most good people have probably not even had the opportunity to hear this idea, let alone reject it, let alone stew on it and change their minds.</p><p>Maybe we should give them the opportunity?</p><h2>Bibliography</h2><ol><li>Armistead, J.

Characters in HPMOR may dislike people who are ahead of them, or envy people who have things they want, but “you don’t have a license to be important” is not a thing that anyone in HPMOR, hero or villain or NPC, ever feels.</p>\n<p>For though I have known many a negative emotion in my life, yea I have known bitterness, frustration, despair, resentment, and a few times even envy and a sense that someone else has something that I deserve more, I have never felt the status-regulation-slapdown emotion.  I needed to deduce its abstract existence via evolutionary psychology once HPMOR finally provoked enough data.  I still have no idea what it <em>feels</em> like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are these a real thing? To find out, I asked my friend <a href=\"https://blog.justinith.com/\">Justin Ith</a>. Justin Ith is a master of social finesse. Asking him if status-regulation emotion is real is like asking Leonardo da Vinci if red and green are different colors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Justin: \"Are you asking if status-regulation emotion is a real thing people feel?\"</p>\n<p>Me: \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Justin: \"If so, then absolutely yes.\"</p>\n<p>Justin: \"Lets say there are 9 followers and 1 leader in a group.

I agree up to that point. But then, some people follow up by saying that the prediction is that the system will accomplish its goal. For example, it makes sense to model AlphaGo as goal-directed towards winning at Go, because it will eventually win. And taking the intentional stance allows me to predict that.</p><p>But what if I make AlphaGo play against AlphaZero, which is strictly better at Go? Then AlphaGo will consistently lose. Does it mean that it&#x2019;s no longer goal-directed towards winning?</p><p>What feels wrong to me is the implicit link drawn between goal-directedness and competence. A bad Go player will usually lose, but it doesn&#x2019;t seem any less goal-directed to me than a stronger one that consistently wins.</p><p>Competence is thus not the whole story. It might be useful to compute goal-directedness; reaching some lower-bound of competency might even be a necessary condition for goal-directedness (play badly enough and it becomes debatable whether you&apos;re even trying to win). But when forcing together the two, I feel like something important is lost.</p><p>To solve this problem, I propose a new metric of goal-directedness, focus: how much is the system trying to accomplish a certain goal. Focus is not the whole story about being goal-directed, but I think computing the focus of a system for some goal (details in the next paragraph) gives useful information about its goal-directedness.</p><p>Given a system <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

Basically all policies at intermediary steps of the RL training are in <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"Pol\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;\">P</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">o</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">l</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</li><li>Lastly, I pick a distance between policies. If the two policies are deterministic, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance\">Hamming distance </a>will do. If they are stochastic, maybe some vector distance based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence\">Kullback-Leibler divergence.</a></li><li>Then, the focus of <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"S\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;\">S</span></span></span></span></span></span> towards <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"G\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">G</span></span></span></span></span></span> is inversely proportional to the distance between <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"S\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.032em;\">S</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"Pol\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;\">P</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">o</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">l</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</li></ul><p>The intuition here is that any policy that result from training on this reward function is aiming maximally towards the goal, by definition. And by taking the appropriate distance, we can measure how far our system is from such a fully focused policy. The distance captures the proportion of actions taken by the policy that fits with aiming towards the specific goal.</p><p>Of course, there are many points that need further thought:</p><ul><li>What does &#x201C;all policies given by using RL&#x201D; mean in this case? The easy answer is all policies resulting from taking any RL method and any initial conditions, and training for any amount of resources on the reward function of the goal. But not only is this really, really uncomputable, I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s well defined enough what are &#x201C;all methods of RL&#x201D;?). Ideally, I would want to limit the study to one specific RL algorithm (SARSA for example) and then the set of generated policies would be well-defined. But I&#x2019;m not sure if I&#x2019;m losing any policy by doing so.</li><li>Even when fixing some RL algorithm, it is completely unfeasible to consider all initial conditions and amounts of resources. Yet this is the obvious way to compute the set of maximally-focused policies. Here I hope for either a dense subset (or a good approximation) of this set of policies, or even an analytical characterization if ones exists.</li><li>The ghost of \tcompetence strikes back here, because I cannot really consider any amount of resources; if I did, then every policy would be maximally-focused for the goal, as it would be generated by taking the policy as an initial condition and using no resources at all. My intuition for dealing with this is that there should be a meaningful lower bound on the amount of resources the RL algorithm has to use before the resulting policy is indeed maximally-focused. Maybe enough resource for all state values or state-action pairs value to have been updated at least once?</li></ul><p>Finally, assuming we are able to compute the focus of any system for any goal, how to interpret the results we get? Focus is not divided between goals like probability: for example, the full goal consisting of all possible states always has maximal focus, as all policies are optimal for the corresponding reward; but other goals might also have the same focus. This entails that finding the most representative goal is not only about focus, but also about the triviality of the goal.</p><p>My far less clean intuition here is that the &#x201C;triviality&#x201D; of the goal should weight its focus. That is, the goal consisting of all possible states is trivial, whereas the one consisting of exactly one state is not trivial at all. Thus even if the former has stronger focus than the latter, it has to be really, really stronger to compensate its triviality. Or said another way, a non-trivial goal with a small but not negligible focus exhibits goal-directedness than a trivial goal with enormous focus.</p><p>Even with all those uncertainties, I still believe focus is a step in the right direction. It trims down competence to the part that seems the most relevant to goal-directedness. That being said, I am very interested in any weakness of the idea, or any competing intuition.</p><p><em>Thanks to J&#xE9;r&#xE9;my Perret for feedback on the writing, and to Joe Collman, Michele Campolo and Sabrina Tang for feedback on the idea.</em></p>",

I have a 4-year-old daughter and that gives me about ~2 more years to figure this out and I am trying to put together as much material as I can. Given the age of my daughter, I’d like to “solve” something like K-12 for now, but I guess some things may be applicable at any age.</p><p>I am familiar with Bryan Caplan's main theses formulated in the Case Against Education or Robin Hanson's Elephant in the Brain arguing that education is <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/08/school-isnt-about-learning.html\">mostly about signalling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/04/school_is_to_su.html\">stuff</a>. I therefore partly understand what's <i>wrong</i> and I am now trying to make my findings actionable and unsurprisingly, it seems pretty hard. I also do realize that there is very little research indicating that specific parental choices have much long term impact.</p><p>The important attributes of the ideal solution:</p><ul><li>comply to <i>rationalists mindset </i>- understanding and applying basic CFAR-like style of reasoning or at least knowing and applying <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juliagalef/status/954100071703789568\">a 5-year-old version of how beliefs work</a>, bugs-are-for-solving idea</li><li>follow <i>scientific/experimental</i> approach (I know it's overlapping), not being afraid of finding the right explore vs. exploit balance</li><li>the educators should grasp at least basics about how to learn and teach effectively, such as <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\">Learning how to learn</a> related concepts or even as little as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/goRshyncBQ8899xr8/a-brief-summary-of-effective-study-methods\">this post</a></li><li>not to waste the time of my kid (like on signalling, or studying things just to forget them after \"exam\"), generally trying to reduce the stupid parts about the current education system as much as possible</li><li>make students excited about the real world (I <i>love</i> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4dG4GhpZH2hgz59x/joy-in-the-merely-real\">Joy in the merely real</a>)</li><li>convey what it is like to be a human (like, emotions exist and you can learn about yourself from them or deal with them)</li><li>convey important concepts about the world (for example altruism, cost-effective analysis, probability, or even markets or signalling)</li><li>teaching students things that are actually useful on the job market</li><li>not-USA-specific - we are living in Central Europe. It's of course still good to point to things that work well somewhere as an inspiration for replication locally.</li></ul><p>I do realize it’s a lot to ask, but I don't aim for perfection. I believe the current system is <i>so</i> badly broken and inadequate (seems that almost everyone agrees on this fact) that even with a little effort invested we can get better outcomes after a few months of preparation.&nbsp;</p><p>For <i>example</i>, one of the solutions could be starting a small home-schooling group with <i>good</i> tutors (<a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem\">Blooms 2SD problem</a> hints towards this direction). I know it sounds ambitious to find someone satisfactory given the requirements but I believe I am in a good position in finding people who are half-way through and with some training, we would get there. I realize that K12 is not only about education but also about things like finding a peer group, which could be supplied via other channels (like afternoon activities) or switching into a regular school for some time. All these options are on the table, the goal is to find the most cost-effective solution.

Brown et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The biggest <strong><a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/\">GPT-2 model</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/c48f996a5db5/alignment-newsletter-46\">AN #46</a></strong>) had 1.5 billion parameters, and since its release people have trained language models with up to 17 billion parameters. This paper reports GPT-3 results, where the largest model has <em>175 billion</em> parameters, a 10x increase over the previous largest language model. To get the obvious out of the way, it sets a new state of the art (SOTA) on zero-shot language modeling (evaluated only on Penn Tree Bank, as other evaluation sets were accidentally a part of their training set).</p><p>The primary focus of the paper is on analyzing the <em>few-shot learning</em> capabilities of GPT-3. In few-shot learning, after an initial training phase, at test time models are presented with a small number of examples of a new task, and then must execute that task for new inputs. Such problems are usually solved using <em>meta-learning</em> or <em>finetuning</em>, e.g. at test time <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400\">MAML</a></strong> takes a few gradient steps on the new examples to produce a model finetuned for the test task. In contrast, the key hypothesis with GPT-3 is that language is so diverse, that doing well on it already requires adaptation to the input, and so the learned language model will <em>already be a meta-learner</em>. This implies that they can simply &quot;prime&quot; the model with examples of a task they care about, and the model can <em>learn</em> what task is supposed to be performed, and then perform that task well.</p><p>For example, consider the task of generating a sentence using a newly made-up word whose meaning has been explained. In one notable example, the prompt for GPT-3 is:</p><p><em>A &quot;whatpu&quot; is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses the word whatpu is:</em></p><p><em>We were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus.</em></p><p><em>To do a &quot;farduddle&quot; means to jump up and down really fast. An example of a sentence that uses the word farduddle is:</em></p><p>Given this prompt, GPT-3 generates the following example sentence for &quot;farduddle&quot;:</p><p><em>One day when I was playing tag with my little sister, she got really excited and she started doing these crazy farduddles.</em></p><p>The paper tests on several downstream tasks for which benchmarks exist (e.g. question answering), and reports zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot performance on all of them. On some tasks, the few-shot version sets a new SOTA, <em>despite not being finetuned using the benchmark&#x2019;s training set</em>; on others, GPT-3 lags considerably behind finetuning approaches.</p><p>The paper also consistently shows that few-shot performance increases as the number of parameters increases, and the rate of increase is faster than the corresponding rate for zero-shot performance. While they don&#x2019;t outright say it, we might take this as suggestive evidence that as models get larger, they are more incentivized to learn &#x201C;general reasoning abilities&#x201D;.</p><p>The most striking example of this is in arithmetic, where the smallest 6 models (up to 6.7 billion parameters) have poor performance (&lt; 20% on 2-digit addition), then the next model (13 billion parameters) jumps to &gt; 50% on 2-digit addition and subtraction, and the final model (175 billion parameters) achieves &gt; 80% on 3-digit addition and subtraction and a perfect 100% on 2-digit addition (all in the few-shot regime). They explicitly look for their test problems in the training set, and find very few examples, suggesting that the model really is learning &#x201C;how to do addition&#x201D;; further, when it is incorrect, it tends to make mistakes like &#x201C;forgetting to carry a 1&#x201D;.</p><p>On broader impacts, the authors talk about potential misuse, fairness and bias concerns, and energy usage concerns; and say they about these issues what you&#x2019;d expect. One interesting note: &#x201C;To understand how low and mid-skill actors think about language models, we have been monitoring forums and chat groups where misinformation tactics, malware distribution, and computer fraud are frequently discussed.&#x201D; They find that while there was significant discussion of misuse, they found no successful deployments. They also consulted with professional threat analysts about the possibility of well-resourced actors misusing the model. According to the paper: &#x201C;The assessment was that language models may not be worth investing significant resources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that current language models are significantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for &#x201C;targeting&#x201D; or &#x201C;controlling&#x201D; the content of language models are still at a very early stage.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> For a long time, I&#x2019;ve heard people quietly hypothesizing that with a sufficient diversity of tasks, regular gradient descent could lead to general reasoning abilities allowing for quick adaptation to new tasks. This is a powerful demonstration of this hypothesis.</p><p>One <strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZHrpjDc3CepSeeBuE/gpt-3-a-disappointing-paper\">critique</a></strong> is that GPT-3 still takes far too long to &#x201C;identify&#x201D; a task -- why does it need 50 examples of addition in order to figure out that what it should do is addition? Why isn&#x2019;t 1 sufficient? It&#x2019;s not like there are a bunch of other conceptions of &#x201C;addition&#x201D; that need to be disambiguated. I&#x2019;m not sure what&#x2019;s going on mechanistically, but we can infer from the paper that as language models get larger, the number of examples needed to achieve a given level of performance goes down, so it seems like there is some &#x201C;strength&#x201D; of general reasoning ability that goes up (see also <strong><a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2020/05\">this commentary</a></strong>). Still, it would be really interesting to figure out mechanistically how the model is &#x201C;reasoning&#x201D;.</p><p>This also provides some empirical evidence in support of the threat model underlying <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">inner alignment concerns</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care\">AN #58</a></strong>): they are predicated on neural nets that implicitly learn to optimize. (To be clear, I think it provides empirical support for neural nets learning to &#x201C;reason generally&#x201D;, not neural nets learning to implicitly &#x201C;perform search&#x201D; in pursuit of a &#x201C;mesa objective&#x201D; -- see also <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nFDXq7HTv9Xugcqaw/is-the-term-mesa-optimizer-too-narrow\">Is the term mesa optimizer too narrow?</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/eef1d6c95d7c/an-78formalizing-power-and-instrumental-convergence-and-the-end-of-year-ai-safety-charity-comparison\">AN #78</a></strong>).)</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fRsjBseRuvRhMPPE5/an-overview-of-11-proposals-for-building-safe-advanced-ai\">An overview of 11 proposals for building safe advanced AI</a></strong> <em>(Evan Hubinger)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post describes eleven &#x201C;full&#x201D; AI alignment proposals (where the goal is to build a powerful, beneficial AI system using current techniques), and evaluates them on four axes:</p><p>1. <strong>Outer alignment:</strong> Would the optimal policy for the specified loss function be aligned with us? See also <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/33EKjmAdKFn3pbKPJ/outer-alignment-and-imitative-amplification\">this post</a></strong>.</p><p>2. <strong>Inner alignment:</strong> Will the model that is <em>actually produced</em> by the training process be aligned with us?</p><p>3. <strong>Training competitiveness:</strong> Is this an efficient way to train a powerful AI system? More concretely, if one team had a &#x201C;reasonable lead&#x201D; over other teams, would they keep at least some of the lead if they used this algorithm?</p><p>4. <strong>Performance competitiveness:</strong> Will the trained model have good performance (relative to other models that could be trained)?</p><p>Seven of the eleven proposals are of the form &#x201C;recursive outer alignment technique&#x201D; plus &#x201C;<strong><a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d\">technique for robustness</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/6078fe4f9928/an-81-universality-as-a-potential-solution-to-conceptual-difficulties-in-intent-alignment\">AN #81</a></strong>)&#x201D;. The recursive outer alignment technique is either <strong><a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/debate/\">debate</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/0ae5d69de63b/alignment-newsletter-5\">AN #5</a></strong>), <strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/scalable-agent-alignment-via-reward-modeling-bf4ab06dfd84\">recursive reward modeling</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/f1947668b183/alignment-newsletter-34\">AN #34</a></strong>), or some flavor of <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/t3AJW5jP3sk36aGoC/capability-amplification\">amplification</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/f6488137d76c/alignment-newsletter-42\">AN #42</a></strong>). The technique for robustness is either transparency tools to &#x201C;peer inside the model&#x201D;, <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9Dy5YRaoCxH9zuJqa/relaxed-adversarial-training-for-inner-alignment\">relaxed adversarial training</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/732eaa192df0/an-70-agents-that-help-humans-who-are-still-learning-about-their-own-preferences\">AN #70</a></strong>), or intermittent oversight by a competent supervisor. An additional two proposals are of the form &#x201C;non-recursive outer alignment technique&#x201D; plus &#x201C;technique for robustness&#x201D; -- the non-recursive techniques are vanilla reinforcement learning in a multiagent environment, and narrow reward learning.</p><p>Another proposal is Microscope AI, in which we train AI systems to simply understand vast quantities of data, and then by peering into the AI system we can learn the insights that the AI system learned, leading to a lot of value. We wouldn&#x2019;t have the AI system act in the world, thus eliminating a large swath of potential bad outcomes. Finally, we have STEM AI, where we try to build an AI system that operates in a sandbox and is very good at science and engineering, but doesn&#x2019;t know much about humans. Intuitively, such a system would be very unlikely to deceive us (and probably would be incapable of doing so).</p><p>The post contains a lot of additional content that I didn&#x2019;t do justice to in this summary. In particular, I&#x2019;ve said nothing about the analysis of each of these proposals on the four axes listed above; the full post talks about all 44 combinations.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I&#x2019;m glad this post exists: while most of the specific proposals could be found by patching together content spread across other blog posts, there was a severe lack of a single article laying out a full picture for even one proposal, let alone all eleven in this post.</p><p>I usually don&#x2019;t think about outer alignment as what happens with optimal policies, as assumed in this post -- when you&#x2019;re talking about loss functions <em>in the real world</em> (as I think this post is trying to do), <em>optimal</em> behavior can be weird and unintuitive, in ways that may not actually matter. For example, arguably for any loss function, the optimal policy is to hack the loss function so that it always outputs zero (or perhaps negative infinity).</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>MISCELLANEOUS (ALIGNMENT) </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03218\">Planning with Uncertain Specifications</a></strong> <em>(Ankit Shah et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Suppose you recognize that there are no &#x201C;certain specifications&#x201D;, and so infer a distribution over specifications. What do you then do with that distribution? This paper looks at this problem in the context where the specifications are given by formulas in linear temporal logic (which can express temporal non-Markovian constraints). They identify four possibilities:</p><p>1. <em>Most likely</em>: Plan with respect to the most likely specification.</p><p>2. <em>Most coverage</em>: Satisfying as many formulas as possible, ignoring their probability (as long as they have non-zero probability)</p><p>3. <em>Chance constrained</em>: Like the above, except you weight by probabilities, and drop the least likely formulas up to a parameter &#x3B4;.</p><p>4. <em>Least regret</em>: Like the above, with &#x3B4; set to zero.</p><p>Intuitively, the <em>Most likely</em> criterion won&#x2019;t be very robust since it is only taking one specification into account, <em>Most coverage</em> is aiming for maximum robustness, <em>Chance constrained</em> interpolates, where larger &#x3B4; corresponds to trading robustness for gain in ability. This is exactly the pattern we see in a task where a robot must set a dinner table.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> Ultimately, I hope that in cases like this, the agent plans conservatively initially, but also tries to learn which specification is actually correct, allowing it to become more bold over time. Nonetheless, it seems quite difficult to do this well, and even then we likely will have this tradeoff between robustness and task performance. This is the case with humans too: if you try to please everyone (robustness), you&#x2019;ll end up pleasing no one (task performance).</p><h1>OTHER PROGRESS IN AI </h1><h2>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13590\">Suphx: Mastering Mahjong with Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></strong> <em>(Junjie Li et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Mahjong is a large imperfect information game with complex rules where turn order can be interrupted. This makes it challenging to solve with existing techniques like MCTS and counterfactual regret minimization. This paper details what was necessary to build <em>Suphx</em>, an AI system that is stronger than 99.99% of humans. Some highlights:</p><p>- Like the original AlphaGo, they first learned from human gameplay and then finetuned using reinforcement learning, with deep CNNs as their models. They learned both action models as well as value models. They added an entropy bonus to ensure that the policy remained stochastic enough to continue learning over the course of RL.</p><p>- They have <em>five</em> learned action models, corresponding to five different decisions that need to be made in Mahjong, as well as a rule-based system for deciding whether or not to declare a winning hand.</p><p>- To handle imperfect information, they first train an <em>oracle agent</em> that gets access to all information, and then slowly reduce the amount of information that it gets to observe.</p><p>- They could use search to improve the performance online, but did not do so in their evaluation (since Suphx was playing on a website with time constraints). Suphx with search would probably be significantly stronger.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I am a bit curious how they removed observations from the oracle agent, given that you usually have to keep the structure of the input to a neural net constant. Perhaps they simply zeroed out the observations they didn&apos;t want?</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09729\">Mastering Complex Control in MOBA Games with Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></strong> <em>(Deheng Ye et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper presents an AI system that can play the Multi-player Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game <em>Honor of Kings</em>. They are inspired by <strong><a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/\">OpenAI Five</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/8234356e4b7f/alignment-newsletter-13\">AN #13</a></strong>) (and Honor of Kings sounds quite similar to Dota, though it is 1v1 instead of 5v5), and have a similar learning setup: reinforcement learning using PPO. Their architecture requires an off-policy algorithm (I&#x2019;m not sure why, maybe they have stale parameters across their rollout servers), so they add an importance sampling correction to the PPO objective, as well as an additional type of gradient clipping. The input is a combination of the image and underlying game state info. The resulting agents are able to beat top human players, and in an event with the public, the AI system lost only 4 out of 2100 matches. Unlike OpenAI Five, this required only around 100 hours to train (though it&#x2019;s unclear how much compute was used).</p><h2>DEEP LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/more-efficient-nlp-model-pre-training.html\">More Efficient NLP Model Pre-training with ELECTRA</a></strong> <em>(Kevin Clark et al)</em> (summarized by Flo): There are two main approaches to pretraining for NLP, language models (LMs) which iteratively predict the next word in a given incomplete sentence, and masked language models (MLMs), which predict the identities of a few masked words in an otherwise complete sentence. While not just looking at the previous words (bidirectionality) can be advantageous, MLMs only learn to predict the masked words, which reduces how much is learnt from a given sentence. </p><p>The authors present an alternative approach, ELECTRA, that outperforms RoBERTa while requiring less than a third of the compute. This is achieved by changing the form of the pretraining task from predicting words to discriminating fake words: Instead of masking, some words are replaced by words generated by an MLM and the trained model has to classify these as fake. This way, we get bidirectionality, but also a more dense signal, as the model has to produce an output for every single word, not just the masked ones. While this looks similar to GANs, the generator is only trained on the usual MLM loss and is not incentivized to fool the discriminator, as GANs don&apos;t seem to work well on sequence data.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xMH1BtvB\">Paper: ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators</a></strong></p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I found it a bit surprising that replacing word prediction with fake discrimination would help that much, but from the ablations, it seems like this is really mostly an instrument to get a loss signal for every single word, which is a cool idea. On a more zoomed-out perspective, results like this seem to show that gains in <strong><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-efficiency/\">algorithmic efficiency</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/4f7ffc5cbe53/an-99-doubling-times-for-the-efficiency-of-ai-algorithms\">AN #99</a></strong>) are not fundamentally slowing down. </p><h2>HIERARCHICAL RL </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/dads-unsupervised-reinforcement.html\">DADS: Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning for Skill Discovery</a></strong> <em>(Archit Sharma et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): Reinforcement learning in robotics typically plans directly on low-level actions. However, it sure seems like there are a simple set of <em>primitives</em> like walking, running, shuffling, etc. that are inherent to the robot morphology. What if we could learn these primitives, and then plan using those primitives? This paper introduces a method for learning these primitives <em>without a reward function</em>. They simply optimize skills for <em>predictability</em> and <em>diversity</em> (by optimizing the mutual information between the current state and next state, conditioned on which skill is being executed).</p><p>They can then use these primitives for <em>model-based planning</em> for a downstream task. You can think of this as a regular RL problem, except that an action in their &quot;action space&quot; takes the form &quot;execute skill X for T timesteps&quot;. They use <em>model-predictive control</em> (MPC), in which you sample a bunch of trajectories, and execute the first action of the trajectory that gets the highest reward. Since each of their high-level actions determines the policy for T timesteps, they can scale to much longer horizon tasks than MPC can usually be used for. They show that this approach is competitive with regular model-based RL.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01657\">Paper: Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills</a></strong></p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think unsupervised learning is likely to be key in getting more powerful and general AI systems without requiring a truly staggering amount of expert data, and this is a great example of what that might look like. Note though that the learned primitives are certainly not what you&apos;d expect of a human: for example, the humanoid learns to vaguely shuffle in a direction, rather than walking. In addition, they did require specifying an &quot;x-y prior&quot; that required skills to be diverse based on x-y coordinates, which is why the skills learned navigation primitives, as opposed to e.g. distinct types of flailing.</p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p> I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=\"https://rohinshah.com/\">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Somewhat experimental.</em></p><p>Among the Fruit Gnomes, there were two groups that were involved in an intense and annoying debate: the No-Banana-Eaters against the All-Fruiters. It was unclear who had started this kind of argument. But now it usually went as follows.</p><p>The All-Fruiters pointed out that excluding bananas from your diet was completely unnatural and obviously unhealthy. Of course, they said, some Fruit Gnomes should reduce their banana consumption. But bananas still contained many important nutrients that were hard to replace. The proponents of the banana taboo, in turn, pointed out that usually the all-fruiters were less healthy than those who did not eat bananas. And most of the all-fruiters basically ate way too many bananas. And that was bad for the Fruit-Gnome metabolism.</p><p>One day, an annoyed Vegetable Dwarf listened to the fruit gnome debate and said: &quot;Come on people, it is not possible that each of your groups has a healthier diet than the other.&quot; So what was the problem?</p><p>With some reflection, the parties of the debate realized that they should apply two rules to their debate:</p><ol><li>Do not compare an optimized all-fruit diet to a typical no-banana diet, except if the typical no-banana diet is an optimized no-banana diet.</li><li>Do not compare an optimized no-banana diet to a typical all-fruits diet, except if banning bananas makes the typical all-fruiter choose the optimized no-banana diet.</li></ol><p>The first rule follows from a simple insight; if you choose a diet such that it makes you as healthy as possible, and this optimal diet contains bananas, then taking the bananas away will make you less healthy (that is, the optimized value of an objective function must decrease if you add a binding constraint). But if you want to have a fair comparison, then you should compare the resulting diet to the diet of a no-banana-eater who has also optimized her diet to be as healthy as possible, except for the bananas. Maybe the lack of bananas is not that much of a problem in the end.</p><p>The second rule is the mirror-image of the first; if you have someone who has chosen his no-banana diet in a way that makes him as healthy as possible, then comparing to a typical all-fruiter is not meaningful. The exception is for simple cases where people who must not eat bananas will, by themselves, choose the most healthy no-banana diet. (There are some reasons why this could be the case: maybe this just reflects their preferences, or maybe banning bananas makes you talk to people who tell you how to choose a healthy diet.)</p><p>Applying these rules to their debate, the Fruit Gnomes saw that you could eat healthy without bananas, though maybe you might need some supplements. However, they also saw that an actually healthy all-fruits diet did not include many bananas, and that the typical All-Fruiter got healthier by reducing banana consumption, though she might also find it very costly (in terms of investing time to learn new recipes and changing old habits) to choose a sufficiently healthy banana-free diet.</p><p>When the dust from the old debates had settled, the Fruit Gnomes saw clearer that many participants in these debates had never chosen their diet primarily for health reasons. Instead, most members of the No-Banana group had wanted to avoid taking the bananas that otherwise would be eaten by the banana birds; these birds could not eat anything else. To the All-Fruiters, banana birds did not matter enough to change their ways and forgo the delicious taste of bananas. Of course, these motivations had been visible before, but with confusing debate rules, you sometimes do not see clearly. For some, the banana question was really about health, but hardly anybody of them had taken part in the debates. For the others, the healthy-diet topic became a proxy fight. So the Fruit Gnomes decided to augment the new debating rules:</p><p>3. Do not present secondary reasons to choose a diet as though they were the primary ones.</p><p>And suddenly, it was possible to talk about banana birds (in fairy tales, this works). The debates had not become friendlier, but at least they were a bit less confused, and a bit more honest.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Suppose that I have a great model for predicting “what will Alice say next?”</p><p>I can evaluate and train this model by checking its predictions against reality, but there may be many facts this model “knows” that I can’t easily access.</p><p>For example, the model might have a detailed representation of Alice’s thoughts which it uses to predict what Alice will say, <em>without</em> being able to directly answer “What is Alice thinking?” In this case, I can only access that knowledge indirectly, e.g. by asking about what Alice would say in under different conditions.</p><p>I’ll call information like “What is Alice thinking?” inaccessible. I think it’s very plausible that AI systems will build up important inaccessible knowledge, and that this may be a central feature of the AI alignment problem.</p><p>In this post I’m going to try to clarify what I mean by “inaccessible information” and the conditions under which it could be a problem. This is intended as clarification and framing rather than a presentation of new ideas, though sections IV, V, and VI do try to make some small steps forward.</p><h3>I. Defining inaccessible information</h3><p>I’ll start by informally defining what it means for information to be <strong>accessible</strong>, based on two mechanisms:</p><h4>Mechanism 1: checking directly</h4><p>If I can check X myself, <em>given other accessible information, </em>then I’ll define X to be accessible.</p><p>For example, I can check a claim about what Alice will do, but I can’t check a claim about what Alice is thinking.</p><p>If I can run randomized experiments, I can probabilistically check a claim about what Alice <em>would</em> do. But I can’t check a counterfactual claim for conditions that I can’t create in an experiment.</p><p>In reality this is a graded notion — some things are easier or harder to check. For the purpose of this post, we can just talk about whether something can be tested even a single time over the course of my training process.</p><h4>Mechanism 2: transfer</h4><p>The simplest model that provides some accessible information X may also provide some other information Y. After all, it’s unlikely that the simplest model that outputs X doesn’t output <em>anything</em> else. In this case, we’ll define Y to be accessible.</p><p>For example, if I train a model to predict what happens over the next minute, hour, or day, it may generalize to predicting what will happen in a month or year. For example, if the simplest model to predict the next day was a fully-accurate physical simulation, then the same physics simulation might work when run for longer periods of time.</p><p>I think this kind of transfer is kind of dicey, so I genuinely don’t know if long-term predictions are accessible or not (we certainly can’t directly check them, so transfer is the only way they could be accessible).</p><p>Regardless of whether long-term predictions are accessible by transfer, there are other cases where I think transfer is pretty unlikely. For example, the simplest way to predict Alice’s behavior might be to have a good working model for her thoughts. But it seems unlikely that this model would spontaneously describe what Alice is thinking in an understandable way — you’d need to specify some additional machinery, for turning the latent model into useful descriptions.</p><p>I think this is going to be a fairly common situation: predicting accessible information may involve almost all the same work as predicting inaccessible information, but you need to combine that work with some “last mile” in order to actually output inaccessible facts.</p><h4>Definition</h4><p>I’ll say that information is <em>accessible</em> if it’s in the smallest set of information that is closed under those two mechanisms, and <em>inaccessible</em> otherwise.</p><p>There are a lot of nuances in that definition, which I’ll ignore for now.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p>Here are some candidates for accessible vs. inaccessible information:</p><ul><li>“What will Alice say?” vs “What is Alice thinking?”</li><li>“What’s on my financial statement?” vs. “How much money do I really have?”</li><li>“Am I coughing?” vs. “What’s happening with my immune system?”</li><li>“How will senators vote?” vs. “What’s the state of political alliances and agreements in the senate?”</li><li>“What do I see on my computer screen?” vs. “Is my computer compromised?”</li><li>“What’s the market price of this company?” vs. “How valuable is this IP really?”</li><li>“Will the machine break tomorrow?” vs. “Is there hard-to-observe damage in this component?”</li><li>“What does the news show me from 5000 miles away?” vs. “What’s actually happening 5000 miles away?”</li><li>“Is this argument convincing?” vs. “Is this argument correct?”</li><li>“What will happen tomorrow?” vs. “What will happen in a year” (depending on whether models transfer to long horizons)</li></ul><h3>II. Where inaccessible info comes from and why it might matter</h3><p>Our models can build up inaccessible information because it helps them predict accessible information. They know something about what Alice is thinking because it helps explain what Alice does. In this diagram, the black arrow represents the causal relationship:</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/337/1*5pYA1mSouzw8ZYp8KZdoGQ.png\" /></figure><p>Unfortunately, this causal relationship doesn’t directly let us <em>elicit</em> the inaccessible information.</p><p>Scientific theories are prototypical instances of this diagram, e.g. I might infer the existence of electron from observing the behavior of macroscopic objects. There might not be any explanation for a theory other than “it’s made good predictions in the past, so it probably will in the future.” The actual claims the theory makes about the world — e.g. that the Higgs boson has such-and-such a mass — are totally alien to someone who doesn’t know anything about the theory.</p><p>I’m not worried about scientific hypotheses in particular, because they are usually <em>extremely </em>simple. I’m much more scared of analogous situations that we think of as intuition — if you want to justify your intuition that Alice doesn’t like you, or that some code is going to be hard to maintain, or that one tower of cards is going to be more stable than another, you may not be able to say very much other than “This is part of a complex group of intuitions that I built up over a very long time and which seems to have a good predictive track record.”</p><p>At that point “picking the model that matches the data best” starts to look a lot like doing ML, and it’s more plausible that we’re going to start getting hypotheses that we don’t understand or which behave badly.</p><h4>Why might we care about this?</h4><p>In some sense, I think this all comes down to what I’ve called <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/the-strategy-stealing-assumption-a26b8b1ed334\">strategy-stealing</a>: if AI can be used to compete effectively, can humans use AI to compete <em>on their behalf</em>?</p><p>More precisely, for every strategy A that an AI could pursue to bring about some arbitrary outcome, is there a strategy A* that would help humans get what we want over the long term, without leaving us at a competitive disadvantage over the short term?</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/882/1*3eFydti4F_W3cxVHz8sMqQ.png\" /></figure><p>If so it’s good news for humanity: if most humans build AIs who execute plans like A*, then humans won’t be outcompeted by unaligned AIs who execute plans like A.</p><p>But the mere <em>existence</em> of A* isn’t very helpful, we need to actually be able to figure out that A* leads to human flourishing so that we can do it. If we can’t recognize plans like A*, then humanity will be at a disadvantage.</p><p>We could have a problem if the fact “A* leads to human flourishing” is inaccessible while the fact “A leads to paperclips” is accessible.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iFkiPIH05WCkN9j9rgYHSw.png\" /></figure><p>In this case, we either need to be sure that no one acts on the basis of information like “A leads to lots of paperclips,” or we need to figure out some way to access the inaccessible information that “A* leads to lots of human flourishing.”</p><h3>III. Eliciting inaccessible info and the instrumental policy</h3><p>I’ve been talking as if we can’t access inaccessible info (and the name is suggestive…), but I don’t think you should be convinced of that yet.</p><p>Let M be a model that reports only accessible facts — it answers questions like “what will Alice say next?” but not questions like “is Alice actually happy with the situation?” It’s built up a lot of knowledge about the world, and uses that knowledge to estimate accessible facts well as it can.</p><p>We suspect there is a related model M* that uses all of M’s machinery in order to explain what’s going on in Alice’s head. By the definition of inaccessibility, M* is at least somewhat more complex than M. So if we want to learn M*, we need a training objective that penalizes M relative to M*.</p><p>But it’s really easy to tell M* and M apart! M won’t automatically tell us what Alice is thinking, but it also won’t automatically make up credible stories that hold together. Both of those require extra complexity. So we can still hope to get M* if we train our model to (i) correctly provides accessible info, (ii) says something consistent and plausible about inaccessible info.</p><p>The real problem comes from what I’ll call the <em>instrumental policy</em>. Let’s say we’ve tried to dream up a loss function L(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) to incentivize the model to correctly answer information we can check, and gives at least plausible and consistent answers on things we can’t check. By definition, the values L(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) are themselves accessible.</p><p>Then it’s natural to learn a policy like: “on input <em>x</em>, produce the output <em>y</em> for which the loss L(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) will be minimal.” Let’s write BAD for this policy.</p><p>Put differently, BAD is the model that performs a simple substitution — when you ask it question Q, it replaces it with the meta question “What answer to question Q will make the person training me happiest?” By definition, this new question is also accessible, so it can be posed to M.</p><p>BAD may be much simpler than M*, because all it has to do is describe this substitution, whereas M* needs to build new machinery to explain inaccessible facts.</p><p>If M is very weak, BAD may perform much worse than M* because it doesn’t understand the loss function very well. But if M understands a lot about the world, and about its training process, then it seems like BAD will get at least as low a loss as M* — it’s using the same machinery as M and M*, and picking whatever value leads to the lowest loss. It can choose to report its own best estimates if that’s the best strategy, e.g. for questions where we can check. So by the time M and M* are human level, it already seems like BAD should be getting as low a loss as M*.</p><p>This gets a little bit more complicated if I do consistency checks or if I have large output spaces, and of course humans aren’t <em>that</em> good at lying, but it seems like the basic idea is pretty solid: once we have a model of accessible information, we can directly turn it into a model that will pass whatever checks we throw at it.</p><p>For concreteness, imagine M is a model of Alice’s behavior and we are asking it “is Alice actually happy?” Then M* is the model which translates its model of Alice’s psychology into words and explains it to us, while BAD is the model that asks “What answer would sound most believable to the person asking the question?”</p><p>The question is: if we start with model M and fine-tune it to answer inaccessible questions, is it easier to learn to articulate what it believes or is it going to learn to answer strategically?</p><p>We need to be <em>very</em> careful about our checks if we want to ensure that BAD doesn’t get a lower loss than M*. For example, it may turn out that sometimes the truth looks a little bit wrong to us…. And if we do everything right, then M* and BAD perform equally well, and so we may not have much control over which one we get.</p><h3>IV. When inaccessible info is a safety problem</h3><p>Let’s get a bit more detailed about the argument in section II. I think that our inability to access inaccessible info would become a safety problem when:</p><ol><li>We care about inaccessible facts, so we can’t just evaluate plans based on their accessible consequences.</li><li>Inaccessible info is a competitive advantage — agents who are blind to inaccessible facts about the world will get outcompeted.</li><li>There are <em>some</em> agents who are able to use inaccessible facts to acquire influence, e.g. because they are optimizing accessible long-term goals.</li></ol><h3>1. We care about inaccessible facts</h3><p>If I only cared about accessible facts, then I might not need to ever access inaccessible facts. For example, if I cared about my life expectancy, and this was accessible, then I could ask my AI “what actions lead to me living the longest?” and execute those.</p><p>For better or worse, I think we are likely to care about inaccessible facts.</p><ul><li>Generally we care about what’s <em>actually happening</em> and not just what appears to be happening. We don’t want smiling faces on cameras. And if there’s a lot of inaccessible action in the world, then it’s reasonably likely for accessible indicators to be systematically manipulated by inaccessible forces.</li><li>We care intrinsically about what happens inside people’s heads (and inside computers), not just outward appearances. Over the very long term a <em>lot</em> may happen inside computers.</li><li>If we totally give up on measuring how well things are going day-to-day, then we need to be actually optimizing the thing we really care about. But figuring that out may require reflecting a long time, and may be inaccessible to us now. We want a world where we actually reach the correct moral conclusions, not one where we believe we’ve reached the correct moral conclusions.</li><li>Our real long-term priorities, and our society’s long-term future, may also be really weird and hard to reason about even if we were able to know what was good. It just seems really bad to try to evaluate plans only by their very long-term consequences.</li><li>We care about things that are far away in space or time, which I think are likely to be inaccessible.</li></ul><p>Overall I’m quite skeptical about the strategy “pick an accessible quantity that captures everything you care about and optimize it.” I think we basically need to optimize some kind of value function that tells us how well things are going. That brings us to the next section.</p><h3>2. Inaccessible info is a competitive advantage</h3><p>Instead of using AI to directly figure out whether a given action will lead to human flourishing over the coming centuries, we could use AI to help us figure out how to get what we want over the short term — including how to acquire resources and flexible influence, how to keep ourselves safe, and so on.</p><p>This doesn’t require being able to tell how good a very long-term outcome is, but it does require being able to tell how well things are going. We need to be able to ask the AI “which plan would put us in an <em>actually good</em> position next year?”</p><p>Unfortunately, I think that if we can only ask about accessible quantities, we are going to end up neglecting a bunch of really important stuff about the situation, and we’ll be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to AIs which are able to take the whole picture into account.</p><p>As an intuition pump, imagine a company that is run entirely by A/B tests for metrics that can be easily checked. This company would burn every resource it couldn’t measure — its code would become unmaintainable, its other infrastructure would crumble, it would use up goodwill with customers, it would make no research progress, it would become unable to hire, it would get on the wrong side of regulators…</p><p>My worry is that inaccessible facts will be similarly critical to running superhuman businesses, and that humans who rely on accessible proxies will get outcompeted just as quickly as the company that isn’t able to optimize anything it can’t A/B test.</p><ul><li>Even in areas like business that society tries particularly hard to make legible, evaluating how well you are doing depends on e.g. valuing intellectual property and intangible assets, understanding contractual relationships, making predictions about what kinds of knowledge or what relationships will be valuable, and so on.</li><li>. In domains like social engineering, biology, cybersecurity, financial systems, <em>etc.</em>, I think inaccessible information becomes even more important.</li><li>If there is a lot of critical inaccessible information, then it’s not clear that a simple proxy like “how much money is actually in my bank account” is even accessible. The only thing that I can directly check is “what will I see when I look at my bank account statement?”, but that statement could itself be meaningless. We really care about things like who effectively controls that bank account and what would really happen if I tried to spend the money. (And if I largely care about inaccessible facts about the world, then “what would happen if I tried to spend my money?” may itself be inaccessible.)</li><li>I can pay inaccessible costs for an accessible gain — for example leaking critical information, or alienating an important ally, or going into debt, or making short-sighted tradeoffs. Moreover, if there are other actors in the world, they can try to get me to make bad tradeoffs by hiding real costs.</li></ul><h3>3. Some AIs can plan with inaccessible info</h3><p>So far this discussion could just be about an <em>AI missed opportunity</em>, not an <em>AI risk</em>.</p><p>Things become problematic when it is possible to build AI systems that do use inaccessible info to pursue ambitious long-term goals that would conflict with human flourishing. If illegible knowledge is important enough, those systems could outcompete humans and divert some (or almost all) of our civilization’s resources.</p><p>This happens if <em>any</em> interesting long-term goal is accessible, i.e. if there’s any accessible goal that benefits from accumulating influence.</p><p>Why might some long-term goal be accessible?</p><ul><li>Verifiable long-term predictions may accessible, e.g. “total reward over the next 50 years” might be accessible as a generalization of “total reward over the next 50 minutes.”</li><li>Even if models don’t transfer in a natural way to very long time horizons, they may still transfer in <em>some</em> way. Maybe they can’t generalize to something as cleanly specified as “total reward,” but e.g. they may be able to predict quantities that happen to be natural in terms of the representation they are using.</li><li>More generally, models will do <em>something</em> when we run them way out of distribution. I think the best reason to expect models to not plan intelligently over long time horizons is that they lack the abilities and knowledge. Once they have relevant cognitive machinery, I think it’s pretty likely that they’ll use the machinery somehow when they go out of distribution, and if you search over a lot of possibilities.</li></ul><p>The key asymmetry working against us is that optimizing flourishing appears to require a particular quantity to be accessible, while danger just requires <em>anything </em>to be accessible.</p><p>There’s a longer discussion about whether anyone would want to build such AI systems, or might be likely to do it accidentally. And another discussion about how bad it would actually be. But I think that once we satisfy the 3 properties in this section then we have a real problem, and the remaining question is one of magnitude, with a bunch of factors pulling up and down.</p><h3>V. Possible responses</h3><p>At a high level, we’d like to get good answers by training a model to make checkable predictions and then somehow incentivizing it to use the same machinery to also report inaccessible facts, for example by forcing it to report views and enforcing consistency.</p><p>I think there are a bunch of problems with that plan, but the strongest one is that it’s totally unclear how we ever get the intended policy rather than the instrumental policy.</p><p>Here are some possible angles of attack:</p><ul><li>In some intuitive sense there is a discontinuity between saying X because you believe it and saying X because you believe that it’s what you need to say to get a high reward. If weak policies are straightforward rather than instrumental, then maybe we can exploit continuity to avoid the instrumental strategy.<br />I’m generally pretty scared of these approaches since they feel pretty brittle, and people seem prone to being optimistic even before we can test or understand anything.<br />But I’m a bit more hopeful if we consider continuity of behavior rather than continuity in the space of policies, and if we exploit it by using a model at time T to help check the behavior of a model at time T+1.</li><li>If we were able to actually understand something about what the policy was doing, even crudely, it might let us discriminate between instrumental and intended behavior. I don’t think we have any concrete proposals for how to understand what the policy is doing well enough to make this distinction, or how to integrate it into training. But I also don’t think we have a clear sense of the obstructions, and I think there are various obvious obstructions to interpretability in general that <em>don’t</em> apply to this approach. So together with the other points on this list — especially the existence of a discontinuity and the use of previous versions of a model to help — I think it could be part of a solution.</li><li>The “instrumental” strategy — “pick the answer that minimizes my training loss” — may have a shorter description, but it seems to be unnecessarily computationally complex. First it figures out what’s true, and then it strategically decides what to say in light of that. It would be a bit cheaper just to actually report what’s true, if we set up the training process well enough that honest reporting got you optimal reward.<br />It’s not clear how to leverage this though, since “use the simplest model” seems like an important and useful prior. We can’t just replace it with “use the cheapest model” without sacrificing competitiveness. That said, it may be able to buy us something in combination with the previous approaches.<br />(See discussion <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nyCHnY7T5PHPLjxmN/open-question-are-minimal-circuits-daemon-free\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fM5ZWGDbnjb7ThNKJ/are-minimal-circuits-deceptive\">here</a>.)</li><li>We aren’t able to check inaccessible answers, and they aren’t output by the simplest model, but maybe we can make being straightforward the easiest strategy in some other sense. For example, if you have two models who can’t interact but need to agree on a consistent story, you could imagine the truth being the easiest thing for them to coordinate on. I think that scheme in particular is pretty unlikely to work, but there is a large space of possibilities here, especially when combined with the other points on this list. For example, maybe you could perform consistency checks between models at different points in time.</li><li>Maybe we can work with models M that don’t understand enough about the world, or especially about their training process, in order to turn into the instrumental policy BAD. I tend to be pretty skeptical of “security by obscurity” — if we want to make life hard for the instrumental policy not working, I want it to be because we have randomness hidden from it, or we’ve constructed a smarter agent that it can’t simulate. I think it’s pretty bad news if we are relying on a smart model not understanding facts about its own situation, and that’s the kind of solution that is particularly likely to break down over time.</li><li>We could hope that our models don’t build up important inaccessible knowledge, e.g. because it’s possible to justify most interesting conclusions with deduction or because we have reasonably good accessible proxies for our value function. I’m pretty skeptical about this over the long term, but I’m not sure exactly how bad it will be how early.</li><li>The argument in this post is pretty informal, and there’s a reasonable chance that you can drive a solution through one of the many gaps/loopholes. I like the problem-solving strategy: “write out the proof that there is no solution, and then sift through the proof looking for a fatal hole.”</li></ul><p>Overall I don’t see an obvious way forward on this problem, but there are enough plausible angles of attack that it seems exciting to think about.</p><h3>VI. How this relates to amplification and debate</h3><p>Overall I don’t think it’s very plausible that amplification or debate can be a <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/scalable-ai-control-7db2436feee7\">scalable</a> AI alignment solution on their own, mostly for the kinds of reasons discussed in this post — we will eventually run into some inaccessible knowledge that is never produced by amplification, and so never winds up in your distilled agents.</p><p>In the language of my <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/policy-amplification-6a70cbee4f34\">original post on capability amplification</a>, the gap between accessible and inaccessible knowledge corresponds to an obstruction. The current post is part of the long process of zooming in on a concrete obstruction, gradually refining our sense of what it will look like and what our options are for overcoming it.</p><p>I think the difficulty with inaccessible knowledge is not specific to amplification — I don’t think we have any approach that moves the needle on this problem, at least from a theoretical perspective, so I think it’s a plausible candidate for a <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/hard-core-subproblems-8948463455ef\">hard core</a> if we fleshed it out more and made it more precise. (I would describe MIRI’s approach to this problem could be described as despair + hope you can find some other way to produce powerful AI.)</p><p>I think that iterated amplification <em>does</em> address some of the most obvious obstructions to alignment — the possible gap in speed / size / experience / algorithmic sophistication / etc. between us and the agents we train. I think that having amplification mind should make you feel a bit less doomed about inaccessible knowledge, and makes it much easier to see where the real difficulties are likely to lie.</p><p>But there’s a significant chance that we end up needing ideas that look totally different from amplification/debate, and that those ideas will obsolete most of the particulars of amplification. Right now I think iterated amplification is by far our best concrete alignment strategy to scale up, and I think there are big advantages to starting to scale something up. At the same time, it’s really important to push hard on conceptual issues that could tell us ASAP whether amplification/debate are unworkable or require fundamental revisions.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c749c6a88ce\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/inaccessible-information-c749c6a88ce\">Inaccessible information</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com\">AI Alignment</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>[Not my area of expertise, but I would be surprised if the core thesis was wrong in a significant way. Probably not as original as I think it is. Based on <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2020/01/11/milk-metaphor-existential-risk/\">a previous blog post of mine</a> that went in a very different/weird direction. Cross-posted from <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2020/06/02/law-cultural-proximity/\">Grand, Unified, Crazy</a>.]</em></p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Currently, different human cultures have different behavioural norms around all sorts of things. These norms cover all kinds of personal and interpersonal conduct, and extend into different legal systems in countries around the globe. In politics, this is often talked about in the form of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window\">Overton window</a>, which is the set of political positions that are sufficiently &#x201C;mainstream&#x201D; in a given culture to be considered electable. Unsurprisingly, different cultures have different Overton windows. For example, Norway and the United States currently have Overton windows that tend to overlap on some policies (the punishment of theft) but perhaps not on others (social welfare).</p><p>Shared norms and a stable, well-defined Overton window are important for the stable functioning of society, since they provide the implicit contract and social fabric on which everything else operates. But what exactly is the scope of a &#x201C;society&#x201D; for which that is true? We just talked about the differences between Norway and the U.S., but in a very real sense, Norway and the U.S. share &#x201C;western culture&#x201D; when placed in comparison with Iran or North Korea. In the other direction, there are many distinct cultures entirely within the U.S. with different norms around things like gun control. <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/\">The categories were made for man, not man for the categories.</a></p><p>However blurry these lines are, it might be tempting to assume that they get drawn roughly according to geography; it&apos;s certainly reflected in our language (note my use of &quot;western culture&quot; already in this post). But this isn&apos;t quite right: the key factor is actually <em>interactional</em> proximity; it&apos;s just that in a historical setting geographical and interactional proximity were the same thing. Time for an example.</p><h1>Ooms and Looms</h1><p>Back in the neolithic era, the tribe of Oom and the tribe of Loom occupied opposite banks of their local river. These two tribes were closely linked in every aspect: geographically, linguistically, economically, and of course, culturally. Because the Ooms and the Looms were forced into interaction on such a regular basis, it was functionally necessary that they shared the same cultural norms in broad strokes. There was still room for minor differences of course, but if one tribe started believing in ritual murder and the other didn&apos;t, that was a short path to disagreement and conflict.</p><p>Of course, neolithic tribes sometimes migrated, which is what happened a short time later when the tribe of Pa moved into the region from a distant valley. Compared to the Ooms and the Looms, the Pas were practically alien: they had different customs, different beliefs, and spoke a different language altogether. Unsurprisingly, a great deal of conflict resulted. One day an amorous Oomite threw a walnut towards a Pa, which was of course a common courting ritual among both the Ooms and the Looms. Unfortunately, the Pa saw it as an act of aggression. War quickly followed.</p><p>Ultimately, the poor Pa were outnumbered and mostly wiped out. The remaining Pa were assimilated into the culture of their new neighbours, though a few Pa words stuck around in the local dialect. Neolithic life went on.</p><p>In this kind of setting, you could predict cultural similarity between two people or groups purely based on geographic proximity. It was possible to have two very different peoples living side by side, but this was ultimately unstable. In the long run, such things resulted in conflict, assimilation, or at best a gradual homogenization as memes were exchanged and selected. But imagine an only-slightly-different world where the river between the Ooms and the Looms was uncrossable; we would have no reason to believe that Oom culture and Loom culture would look anything alike in this case. The law that describes this is the law of cultural proximity:</p><p><em>In the long run, the similarity between two cultures is proportional to the frequency with which they interact.</em></p><h1>More First Contact</h1><p>Hopefully the law of cultural proximity was fairly self-evident in the original world of neolithic tribes. But over time, trade and technology started playing an increasing role in people&apos;s lives. The neolithic world was simple because interactions between cultures were heavily mediated by geographic proximity, but the advent of long-distance trade started to wear away at that principle. Ooms would travel to distant lands, and they wouldn&#x2019;t just carry home goods; they would carry snippets of culture too. Suddenly cultures separated by great distances could interact more directly, even if only infrequently. Innovations in transportation (roads, ship design, etc) made travel easier and further increased the level of interaction.</p><p>This gradual connecting of the world led to a substantial number of conflicts between distant cultures that wouldn&#x2019;t have even know about each other in a previous age. The Ooms and the Looms eventually ran into their neighbour the Dooms, who conquered and assimilated them both in order to control their supply of cocoa. The victor of successive conflicts, the Dooms formed an empire, developed new technologies, and expanded their reach even farther afield. On the other side of a once-uncrossable sea, the Dooms met the Petys; they interacted infrequently at first, but over time their cultures homogenized until they were basically indistinguishable from each other.</p><h1>The Great Connecting</h1><p>Now fast-forward to modern day and take note of the technical innovations of the last two centuries: the telegraph, the airplane, the radio, the television, the internet. While the prior millennia saw a gradual connecting of the world&#x2019;s cultures, the last two hundred years have seen a massive step change: the great connecting. On any computer or phone today, I can easily interact with people from one hundred different countries around the globe. Past technologies metaphorically shrank the physical distance between cultures; the internet eliminates that distance entirely.</p><p>But now remember the law of cultural proximity: the similarity between two cultures is proportional to the frequency with which they interact. This law still holds, over the long run. However the internet is new, and the long run is long. We are currently living in a world where wildly different cultures are interacting on an incredibly regular basis via the internet. The result should not be a surprise.</p><h1>The Future</h1><p><em>[This section is much more speculative and less confident than the rest.]</em></p><p>The implications for the future are... interesting. It seems inevitable that in a couple of generations the world will have a much smaller range of cultures than it does today. The process of getting there will be difficult, and sometimes violent, but the result will be a more peaceful planet with fewer international disagreements or &quot;culture wars&quot;. A unified world culture also seems likely to make a unified world government possible. Whether the UN or some other body takes on this role, I expect something in that space to grow increasingly powerful.</p><p>While a stable world government seems like it would be nice, homogeneity has its pitfalls. There&apos;s a reason we care about ecological diversity so much.</p><p>Of course in the farther future, human culture will fragment again as it spreads into space. The speed of light is a hard limit, and while our first Martian colony will likely stay fairly connected to Earth, our first extra-solar colony will be isolated by sheer distance and will be able to forge its own cultural path. Beyond that, only time will tell.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Almost a decade ago, Luke Muehlhauser ran a series \"<a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_and_Philosophy\">Rationality and Philosophy</a>\" on LessWrong 1.0. It gives a good introductory account, but recently, still dissatisfied with the treatment of the two groups' relationship, I've started a larger \"<a href=\"https://suspendedreason.com/2020/04/15/meta-sequences-introduction-criteria/\">Meta-Sequence</a>\" project, so to speak, treating the subject in depth.</p><p>As part of that larger project, I want to introduce a frame that, to my knowledge, hasn't yet been discussed to any meaningful extent on this board: <em>conceptual engineering</em>, and its role as a solution to the problems of \"counterexample philosophy\" and \"conceptual analysis\"—the mistaken if implicit belief that concepts have \"necessary and sufficient\" conditions—in other words, Platonic <em>essences. </em>As Yudkowsky has argued extensively in \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb\">Human's Guide to Words</a>,\" this is <em>not </em>how concepts work. But he's far from alone in advancing this argument, which has in recent decades become a rallying cry for a meaningful corner of philosophy.</p><p>I'll begin with a history of concepts and conceptual analysis, which I hope will present a productively new frame, for many here, through which to view the history of philosophy. (Why it was, indeed, a \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FwiPfF8Woe5JrzqEu/philosophy-a-diseased-discipline\">diseased discipline</a>\"—and how it's healing itself.) Then I'll walk through a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yLKd9_mpRc\">talk by Dave Chalmers</a> (<a href=\"http://consc.net/papers/engineering.pdf\">paper if you prefer reading</a>) on conceptual engineering, using it as a pretense for exploring a cluster of pertinent ideas. Let me suggest an alternative title for Dave's talk in advance: \"How to reintroduce all the bad habits we were trying to purge in the first place.\" As you'll see, I pick on Dave pretty heavily, partly because I think the way he uses words (e.g. in his work with Andy Clark on embodiment) is reckless and irresponsible, partly because he occupies such a prominent place in the field.</p><p>Conceptual engineering is a crucial moment of development for philosophy—a paradigm shift after 2500 years of bad praxis, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)\">reification fallacies</a>, magical thinking, religious \"essences,\" and linguistic misunderstandings. (Blame the early Christians, whose ideological leanings lead to a triumph of Platonism over the Sophists.) Bad linguistic foundations give rise to compounded confusion, so it's important to get this right from the start. Raised in the old guard, Chalmers doesn't understand why conceptual engineering (CE) is needed, or the bigger disciplinary shift CE might represent.</p><h2>How did we get here? A history of concepts</h2><p>I'll kick things off with a description of human intelligence from Jeurgen Schmidhuber, to help ground some of the vocabulary I'll be using in the place of (less useful) concepts from the philosophical traditions:</p><blockquote>As we interact with the world to achieve goals, we are constructing internal models of the world, predicting and thus partially compressing the data history we are observing. If the predictor/compressor is a biological or artificial recurrent neural network (RNN), it will automatically create feature hierarchies, lower level neurons corresponding to simple feature detectors similar to those found in human brains, higher layer neurons typically corresponding to more abstract features, but fine-grained where necessary. Like any good compressor, the RNN will learn to identify shared regularities among different already existing internal data structures, and generate prototype encodings (across neuron populations) or symbols for frequently occurring observation sub-sequences, to shrink the storage space needed for the whole (we see this in our artificial RNNs all the time).</blockquote><p>The important takeaway is that CogSci's current best guess about human intelligence, a guess popularly known as <em>predictive processing</em>, theorizes that the brain is a machine for detecting regularities in the world—think similarities of property or effect, rhythms in the sense of sequence, conjunction e.g. temporal or spatial—and compressing them. These compressions underpin the daily probabilistic and inferential work we think of as the very basis of our intelligence. Concepts play an important role in this process, they are bundles of regularities tied together by family resemblance, collections of varyingly held properties or traits which are united in some instrumentally useful way which justifies the unification. When we attach word-handles to these bundled concepts, in order to wield them, it is frequently though not always for the purpose of communicating our concepts with others, and the synchronization of these bundles across decentralized speakers, while necessary to communicate, inevitably makes them a messy bundle of overlapping and inconsistent senses—they are \"fuzzy,\" or \"inconsistent,\" or \"polysemous.\"</p><p>For a while, arguably until Wittgenstein, philosophy had what is now called a \"classical account\" of concepts as consisting of \"sufficient and necessary\" conditions. In the tradition of Socratic dialogues, philosophers \"aprioristically\" reasoned from their proverbial armchairs (Bishop 1992: The<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Bishop-1992-The-Possibility-of-Conceptual-Clarity-in-Philosophy-8d454551f65a471facb7406714f68864\"> </a>Possibility of Conceptual Clarity in Philosophy's words—not mine) about the definitions or criteria of these concepts, trying to formulate elegant factorings that were nonetheless robust to counterexample. Counterexample challenges to a proposed definition or set of criteria took the form of presenting a situation which, so the challenger reasoned, intuitively seemed to <em>not</em> be a case of the concept under consideration, despite fitting the proposed factoring. (Or of course, the inverse—a case which intuitively seemed like a member but did not fit the proposed criteria. Intuitive to <em>whom</em> is one pertinent question among many.)</p><p>The legitimacy of this mode of inquiry depended on there being necessary and sufficient criteria for concepts; if such a challenge was enough to send the proposing philosopher back to the drawing board, it had to be assumed that a properly factored concept would deflect any such attacks. Once the correct and elegant definition was found, there was no possible member (<em>extension</em>) which could fit the criteria but not feel intuitively like a member, nor was there an intuitive member which did not fit the criteria.</p><p>Broadly construed I believe it fair to call this style of philosophy <em>conceptual analysis</em> (CA)<em>.</em> The term is established as an organizing praxis of 20th century analytic philosophy, but, despite meaningful differences between Platonic philosophy and this analytic practice, I will argue that there is a meaningful through-line between them. While the analytics may not have believed in a \"form\" of the good, or the pious, which exists \"out there,\" they did, nonetheless, broadly believe that there were sufficient and necessary conditions for concepts—that there was a very simple-to-describe (if hard-to-discover) pattern or logic behind all members of a concept's extension, which formed the goal of analysis. This does, implicitly, pledge allegiance to some form of \"reality in the world\" of the concept, its having a meaningful structure or regularity in the world. While this may be the case at the <em>beginning</em> of a concept's lifespan, entropy has quickly ratched by early childhood: stretching, metaphorical reapplication &amp; generalization, the over-specification of coinciding properties.</p><p>(The history I'm arguing might be less-than-charitable to conceptual analysis: Jon Livengood, philosopher out of Urbana-Champaign and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/jonathanlivengood\">member of the old LessWrong</a>, made strong points in conversation for CA's comparative merits over predecessors—points I hope to publish in a forthcoming post.)</p><p>But you can ignore my argument and just take it from the <em>SEP</em>, which if nothing else can be relied on for providing the more-or-less uncontroversial take: \"Paradigmatic conceptual analyses offer definitions of concepts that are to be tested against potential counterexamples that are identified via thought experiments... Many take [it] to be the essence of philosophy...\" (<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/\">Margolis &amp; Laurence 2019</a>). Such comments are littered throughout contemporary philosophical literature.</p><p>As can be inferred from the juxtaposition of the Schmidhuber-influenced cognitive-scientific description of concepts, above, with the classical account, conception of concepts, and their character, was meaningfully wrong. Wittgenstein's 1953 <em>Investigations</em> inspired Eleanor Rosch's Prototype Theory which, along with the concept \"fuzzy concepts,\" and the support of developmental psychology, began pushing back on the classical account. Counterexample philosophy, which rested on an unfounded faith in intuition plus this malformed \"sufficient and necessary\" factoring of concepts, is a secondary casualty in-progress. The traditional method for problematizing, or disproving, philosophical accountings of concepts is losing credibility in the discourse as we speak; it has been perhaps the biggest paradigm shift in the field since its beginning in the 1970s.</p><p>This brings us up to our current state: a nascent field of conceptual engineering, with its origins in papers from the 1990s by Creath, Bishop, Ramsey, Blackburn, Graham, Horgan, and more. Many, though far from all, in analytic have given up on classical analysis since the late 20th C fall. A few approaches have taken their place, like experimental conceptual analysis or \"empirical lexicography\" à la Southern Fundamentalists, where competent language speakers are polled about how they use concepts. While these projects continue the descriptive bent of analysis, they shift the method of inquiry from aprioristic to empirical, and no longer chase their tail after elegant, robust, complete descriptions. Other strategies are more prescriptive, such as the realm of conceptual engineering, where philosophers are today more alert to the discretionary, lexicographic nature of the work they are attending to, and are broadly intentional within that space. Current work includes attempting to figure out valid grounds by which to judge the quality of a \"conceptual re-engineering\" (i.e. reformulation, casually used—re-carving up the world, or changing \"ownership rights\" to different extensions). The discourse is young; the first steps are establishing what this strategy even consists of.</p><p>Chalmers is in this last camp, trying test out conceptual engineering by applying it to the concept \"conceptual engineering.\" How about we start <em>here</em>, he says—how about we start by testing the concept on itself.</p><p>He flails from the gate.</p><h2>Back to the text</h2><p>The problem is that Chalmers doesn't understand what \"engineering\" is, despite spending the opening of his lecture giving definitions of it. No, that's not quite right: ironically, it is Chalmers's inquiry into the definition of \"engineering\" which demonstrates his lack of understanding a to what the approach entails, dooming him to repeating the problems of philosophies past. Let me try to explain.</p><p>Chalmers:</p><blockquote>What is conceptual engineering? There is an obvious way to come at this. To find the definition of conceptual engineering, go look up the definition of engineering, and then just appeal to compositionality.</blockquote><p>At first blow this seems like a joke, indeed it's delivered as a joke, but it is, Chalmers assures us, the method he actually used. Based on a casual survey of \"different engineering associations\" and various \"definitions of engineering on the web,\" he distills engineering to the (elegant and aspiring-robust) \"designing, building, and analyzing.\" Then he tweaks some words that are already overburdened—\"analyze\" is already taken when it comes to concepts (That's what we're trying to get away from, remember? Conceptual analysis) so he substitutes \"evaluate\" for \"analyze.\" And maybe, he writes, \"implementing\" is better than \"building.\" So we wind up with: <em>conceptual engineering is designing, implementing, and evaluating concepts.</em></p><p>This doesn't seem like a bad definition, you protest, and it isn't. But we were never <em>looking</em> for a definition. That's the realm of conceptual analysis. We quit that shit alongside nicotine, back in the 80s. Alright, so what <em>are</em> we trying to do? We're trying to solve a problem, multiple problems actually. The original problem was that we had concepts like \"meaning\" and \"belief\" that, in folk usage, were vague, or didn't formalize cleanly, and philosophers quite reasonably intuited that, in order to communicate and make true statements about these concepts, we first had to know what they \"were.\" (The <em>\"is\"</em> verb implies a usage mission: <em>description</em> over <em>prescription.</em>) The problem we are trying to solve is, itself, in part, conceptual analysis—plus the problems conceptual analysis tried originally to solve but instead largely exacerbated.</p><p>This, not incidentally, is how an engineer approaches the world, how an engineer would approach writing Chalmers's lecture. Engineers see a problem and then they <em>design</em> a solution that <em>fits</em> the current state of things (context, constraints, affordances) to <em>bring about the desired state</em> of affairs.</p><p>Chalmers is just an analyst, and he can only regurgitate definitions like his analyst forbearers. Indeed what is Chalmers actually figuring out, when he consults the definition of \"engineering\"? In 1999 Simon Blackburn proposes the term \"conceptual engineering\" as a description of what he's up to, as a philosopher. He goes on to use it several times in the text (<em>Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy</em>), typically to mean something like \"reflecting\":</p><blockquote>We might wonder whether what we say is \"objectively\" true, or merely the outcome of our own perspective, or our own \"take\" on a situation. Thinking about this we confront categories like knowledge, objectivity, truth, and we may want to think about them. At that point we are <em>reflecting</em> on concepts and procedures and beliefs that we normally just <em>use</em>. We are looking at the scaffolding of our thought, and doing conceptual engineering.</blockquote><p>For reasons still opaque to me, the usage becomes tied up with the larger post-CA discourse. To understand what's going on in this larger discourse, or to understand what this larger discourse <em>ought</em> to be up to, Chalmers reverse-engineers the naming. In trying to figure out what our solutions should be to a problem, Chalmers can only do as well as Blackburn's metaphorical appropriation of \"engineering\" fits the problem and solution in the first place. The inquiry is hopelessly mediated by precedent once again. (For future brevity, I'll call conceptual engineering a <em>style of solution,</em> or \"strategy\": a sense or method of approaching a problem.)</p><p>Let me try to be more clear: If the name of the strategy had been \"conceptual ethics,\" or \"conceptual revision,\" or \"post-analytic metaphilosophy\" (all real, rival terms) Chalmers's factoring of the strategy would be substantially different, even as the problem remained exactly the same. Once again, a handle has been reified.</p><p>Admittedly, the convergence of many philosophers in organizing around this term, \"conceptual engineering,\" tells us that there is <em>something</em> in it which is aligned with the individual actors' missions—but the amount of historical chance and non-problem-related reasons for its selection obfuscates our sense of the problem instead of clarifying it.</p><p>Let us not ask, \"What is the definition of the strategy we wish to design, so we may know how to design it?\" Let us ask, \"What is the problem, so that we can design the strategy to fit it?\" <em>This</em> is engineering.</p><h2>De novo &amp; re-engineering</h2><p>Chalmers:</p><blockquote>So I encourage making a distinction between what I call <em>de novo</em> engineering and re-engineering. De novo engineering is building a new bridge, program, concept, whatever. Re-engineering is fixing or replacing an old bridge, program, concept, or whatever. The name is still up for grabs. At one point I was using de novo versus de vetero, but someone pointed out to me that wasn’t really proper Latin. It’s not totally straightforward to draw the distinction. There are some hard cases. Here’s the Tappan Zee Bridge, just up the Hudson River from here. The old Tappan Zee bridge is still there, and they’re building a new bridge in the same location as the old bridge, in order to replace the old bridge. Is that de novo because it’s a new bridge, or is it re-engineering because it’s a replacement?</blockquote><p>Remember: the insight of a metaphor is a product of its analogic correspondence. This is not the \"ship of Theseus\" it seems.</p><p>If we were to build an exact replica of the old bridge, in the same spot, would it be a new bridge, or the same bridge? You're frustrated by this question for good reason; it's ungrounded; it can't be answered due to ambiguity &amp; purposelessness. <em>New in what way? Same in what way? Certainly most of the properties are the same, with the exception of externalist characteristics like \"date of erection.\" The bridge has the same number of lanes. It connects the same two towns on the river.</em></p><p><em>De novo</em>, as I take it from Chalmers's lecture, is about capturing phenomena (noticing regularity, giving that regularity a handle), whereas re-engineering involves refactoring existing handle-phenomena pairs either by changing the assignments of handles or altering the family resemblance of regularities a handle is attached to. Refactorings are functional: we change a definition because it has real, meaningful differences. These changes are not just \"replacing bricks with bricks.\" They're more akin to adding a bike lane or on-ramp, to added stability or a stoplight for staggering crossing.</p><p>Why do I nitpick a metaphor? Because the cognitive tendency it exhibits is characteristic of philosophy at its worst: getting stuck up on distinctions that don't matter for those that do. If philosophers formed a union, it might matter whether a concept was \"technically new\" or \"technically old\" insofar as these things correlate with the necessary (re)construction labor. Here, what matters is changing the <em>function</em> of concepts: what territories they connect, and which roads they flow from and into; whether they allow cars or just pedestrians. \"Re-engineering\" an old concept such that it has the same extensions and intensions as before doesn't even make sense as a project.</p><h2>Abstracting, distinguishing, and usefulness</h2><p>At this point, we have an understanding of what concepts are, and of the problems with concepts (we need to \"hammer down\" what a concept is if we want to be able to say meaningful things about it). It's worth exploring a bit more, though, what we would want from conceptual engineering—its commission, so to speak—as well as qualities of concepts which make them so hard to wield.</p><p>Each concept in our folk vocabulary has a use. If a concept did not have a use, if it was not a regularity which individuals encountered in their lives, it would not be used, and it would fall out of our conceptual systems. There is a Darwinian mechanism which ensures this usefulness. The important question is, what <em>kind</em> of use, and at what <em>scale</em>?</p><p>For a prospective vegetable gardener shopping at a garden supply store, there is a clear distinction between <em>clay-based soil</em> and <em>sand-based soil</em>. They drain and hold water differently, something of significant consequence for the behavior of a gardener. But whether the soil is light brown or dark brown likely matters very little to him, we can suppose he makes no distinction.</p><p>However, for a community of land artists, who make visual works with earth and soil, coloration matters quite a bit. Perhaps this community has evolved different terms for the soil types just like the gardeners, but unlike the gardeners may make no distinction between the composition of the soil (clay or sand) beyond any correspondences with color.</p><p>A silly example that illustrates: concepts <em>by design</em> cover up some nuanced differences between members of its set, while <em>highlighting</em> or bringing other differences to the fore. The first law of metaphysics: no two things are identical, not even two composites with identical subatomic particle makeups, for at the very least, these things differ in their locations in spacetime; their particles are not the same particles, even if the types are. Thus things are and can only be the same in <em>senses</em>. There is a smooth gradient between analogy and what we call equivalence, a gradient formed by the number of shared senses. We create our concepts around the distinctions that matter, for us as a community; and we do so with a minimum of entropy, leaving alone those distinctions that do not. This is well-accepted in classification, but has not as fully permeated the discourse around concepts as one might wish. (Concepts and categories are, similarly, pairings of \"handles\" or designators with useful-to-compress regularities.)</p><h3>Bundling &amp; unbundling</h3><p>In everyday life, the concept of \"sound\" is both phenomenological experience and physical wave. The two are bundled up, except when we appeal to \"hearing things\" (noises, voices) when there is a phenomenological experience without an instigating wave. But there is never a situation which concerns us in which waves exist without <em>any phenomenological experience whatsoever.</em> Waves without phenomenology—how does that concern us? Why ought our conceptual language accommodate that which by definition has nothing to do with human life, when the function of this language is describing human life?</p><p>Thus the falling tree in the empty forest predictably confounds the non-technical among us. The solution to its dilemma is recognizing that the concept (here a folk concept of \"sound\") bundles, or conflates, two patterns of phenomena whose <em>unbundling</em>, or distinction, is the central premise (or \"problem\") of the paradox. Scientists find the empty forest problem to be a non-problem, as they long ago performed a \"narrow-and-conquer\" method (more soon) on the phenomenon \"sound\": sound is sound waves, nothing more, and phenomenological experience is merely a consequence of these waves' interaction with receiving instruments (ears, brains). They may be right that the falling tree obviously meets the narrowed or unbundled scientific criteria for sound—but it does <em>not</em> meet the bundled, folk sense.</p><p>(Similarly, imagine the clay-based soil is always dark, and sand-based soil always light. Both the gardeners and land artists call dark, clay-based soil <em>D1</em> and light sand-based soil <em>D2</em>. If asked, <em>\"Is dirt that is light-colored, but clay-based, D1 or D2?\"</em> the gardners and land artists would ostensibly come to exact opposite intuitions.)</p><p>All this is to say that concepts are bundled at the level of maximum abstraction that's useful. Sometimes, a group of individuals realizes this level of abstraction covers up differences in class members which are important to separate; they \"unbundle\" the concept into two. (This is how the \"empty forest\" problem is solved: <em>sound as waves</em> and <em>sound as experience</em>.) I have called this the \"divide and conquer\" method, and endorse it for a million reasons, of which I'll soon name a fistful. Other times, a field will claim their singular sense (or sub-sense, really), which they have separated from the bundled folk whole, is the \"true\" meaning of the term. In their domain, for their purposes, it might be, but such claims cause issues down the line.</p><h3>The polysemy of handles</h3><p>In adults, concepts are generally picked up &amp; acquired in a particular manner, one version of which I will try to describe.</p><p>In the beginning, there is a word. It is used in conversation, perhaps with a professor, or a school teacher, a parent—better, a friend; even better, one to whom we aspire—one whom we want, in a sense, to become, which requires knowing what they know, seeing how they see. Perhaps on hearing the word we nod agreement, or (rarer) confess to not knowing the term. If the former, perhaps its meaning can be gleaned through content, perhaps we look it up or phone a friend.</p><p>But whatever linguistic definition we get will become meaningful only through correspondence with our lived reality—our past observations of phenomena—and through coherence with other concepts and ideas in our conceptual schema. Thus the concept stretches as we acquire it. We convert our concepts as much as our concepts convert us: we stretch them to \"fit\" our experiences, to fit what previously may have been a vaguely felt but unarticulated pattern, now rapidly crystallizing, and this discovery of a concept &amp; its connection with other concepts further crystallizes it, distorts our perception in turn with its sense of <em>thingness</em>; the concept begins to stretch our experience of reality. (This is the realm of Baader-Meinhof &amp; weak Sapir-Whorf.)</p><p>When we need to describe something which feels adjacent to the concept as we understand it, and lack any comparatively better option, we will typically rely on the concept handle, perhaps with qualifications. Others around us may pick up on the expansion of territory, and consider the new territory deservingly, appropriately settled. Lakoff details this process with respect to metaphor: our understanding of concreta helped give rise to our abstract concepts, by providing us a metaphorical language and framework to begin describing abstract domain.</p><p>Or perhaps we go the other way, see a pattern of coinciding properties which go beyond the original formulation but in our realm of experience, seem integral to the originally formulated pattern, and so we add these specifications. One realm we see this kind of phenomenon is racial stereotyping. Something much like this also happened with Prototype Theory, which was abandoned in large part out of an opposition to its <em>empirical bent</em>—a bent which was never an integral part of the theory, but merely one common way it was applied in the 70s.</p><p>All of this—the decentralization, the historical ledger, the differing experiences and contexts of speakers, the metaphorical adaptation of existing handles to new, adjacent domains—leads to fuzziness and polysemy, the accumulation of useful garbage around a concept. Fuzziness is well-established in philosophy, polysemy well-established in semantics, but the discourses affected by their implications haven't all caught on. By the time a concept becomes entrenched in discourse, it describes not one but many regularities, grouped—you guessed it—by family resemblance. \"Some members of a family share eye color, others share nose shape, and others share an aversion to cilantro, but there is no one single quality common to all\" (<a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/12/07/something-runs-through-the-whole-thread/\">Perry 2018</a>).</p><h3>Lessons for would-be engineers</h3><p>The broader point I wish to impart is that we do not need to \"fix\" language, since the folk concepts we have are both already incredibly useful (having survived this long) and also being constantly organically re-engineered on their own to keep pace with changing cultures, by decentralized locals performing the task far better than any \"language expert\" or \"philosopher\" could. Rather, philosophy must <em>fit</em> this existing language to its own purposes, just as every other subcommunity (gardeners, land artists...) has done: determine the right level of abstraction, the right captured regularities and right distinction of differences for the problem at hand. We will need to be very specific and atomic with some patterns, and it will behoove us to be broad with others, covering up what for us would be pointless and distracting nuance.</p><p>Whenever we say two things are alike in some sense, we say there is a hypothetical hypernym which includes both of them as instances (or \"versions\"). And we open the possibility that this hypernym is meaningful, which is to say, of use.</p><p>Similarly, for every pair of things we say are alike in some sense, there will also necessarily be difference in another sense—in other words, these things could be meaningfully distinguished as <em>separate</em> concepts. If any concept can be split, and if any two instances can be part of a shared concept, then why do the concepts we have exist, and not other concepts? This is the most important question for us, and the answer, whatever it turns out to be, will have something to do with <em>use</em>.</p><p>Once again we have stumbled upon our original insight. The very first question we must ask, to understand what any concept ought to be, is to understand what problem we are trying to solve, what the concept—the set of groupings &amp; distinctions—accomplishes. The concept \"conceptual engineering\" is merely one, and arguably the first, concept we should factor, but we cannot be totally determinate in our factoring of it: its approach will always be contingent on the specific concept it engineers, since that concept exists to solve a unique problem, i.e. has a unique function. Indeed, that might be all we can say—and so I'll make my own stab at what \"conceptual engineering\" ought to mean: the re-mapping of a portion of territory such that the map will be more useful with respect to the circumstances of our need.</p><h2>E-belief: a case study in linguistic malpractice</h2><p>Back in the 90s, Clark and Chalmers defined an <em>extended belief</em>—e.g. a belief that was written in a notebook, forgotten, and referenced as a source of personal authority on the matter—as a belief proper. It is interesting to note that this claim takes the inverse form of traditional \"counterexample philosophy\" arguments: <em>despite native speakers not intuitively extending the concept \"belief\" to include e-belief, we advocate for it nonetheless.</em></p><p>Clark thinks the factoring is useful to cognitive science; Chalmers thinks it's \"fun.\" The real question is <em>Why</em> didn't <em>they call it e-belief?</em> which is a question very difficult to answer for any single case, but more tractable to answer broadly: claims to redefining our understanding of a foundational concept like \"belief\" are interesting, and contentious, a territory and status grab in the intellectual field, whereas a claim to discover a thing that is \"sort of like belief, or like, sorta kinda one part of what we usually mean by 'belief' but not what we mean by it in another sense\" doesn't cut it for newsworthiness. Here's extended belief, aided by note-taking systems and sticky notes: \"Well, you know, if you wrote something you knew was false down in a notebook, and then like, forgot the original truth, you'd 'believe' the falsehood, in one sense that we mean when we use the word 'believe.'\" I'm strawmanning its factoring—it describes a real chunk of cognition, of cognitive enmeshment in a technological age, and the way we use culture to outsource thinking—but at the end of the day, one (self-)framing—e-belief is belief proper—attracts a lot of glitz, and one framing doesn't. Here's Chalmers:</p><blockquote>Andy and I could have introduced a new term, \"e-believe,\" to cover all these extended cases, and made claims about how unified e-belief is with the ordinary cases of believing and how e-belief plays the most important role.</blockquote><p>Yeah, that would have been great.</p><blockquote>We could have done that, but what fun would that have been? The word \"belief\" is used a lot, it's got certain attractions in explanation, so attaching the word \"belief\" to a concept plays certain pragmatically useful roles.</blockquote><p>He continues:</p><p>Likewise the word \"conceptual engineering\" Conceptual engineering is cool, people have conferences on it... pragmatically it makes sense to try to attach this thing you're interested in to this word.</p><p>He's 80% right and 100% wrong. Yes, there is a pragmatic incentive to attach your carving to existing carvings, to try to \"take over\" land, since contested land is more valuable. It's real simple: urban real estate is expensive, and this is the equivalent of squatters rights on downtown apartments. Chalmers and Clark's <em>factoring</em> of extended cognition is good, but they throw in a claim on contested linguistic territory for the glitz and glam. These are the natural incentives of success in a field.</p><p>That it's incentivized doesn't mean it's linguistic behavior philosophers ought to encourage, and David ought know better. If two people have different factorings of a word, they will start disagreeing about how to apply it, and they will apply it in ways that offend or confuse the other people. This is how bad things happen. Chalmers wrote a 60-page, 2011 paper on verbal disputes about exactly this. I'm inclined to wonder whether he really <em>did</em> take the concept from LessWrong, where he has freely admitted to have been hanging out on circa 2010, a year or two after the publication of linguistics sequences which discussed, at length, the workings of verbal disputes (there referred to as \"tabooing your words\"). The more charitable alternative is that this is just a concept \"in the water\" for analytic philosophy; it's \"bar talk,\" or \"folk wisdom,\" and Chalmers was the guy who got around to formalizing it. His paper's gotten 400 citations in 9 years, and I'm inclined to think that if it were low-hanging fruit, it would've been plucked, but perhaps those citations are largely due to his stardom. The point is, the lesson of verbal disputes is, you have to first be talking about the same thing with respect to the current dimensions of [conversation or analysis or whatever] in order to have a reliably productive [conversation or analysis or whatever]. Throwing another selfish -semous in the polysemous \"belief\" is like littering in the commons.</p><h2>The problems with narrowness (or, the benefits of division)</h2><p>I've written previously on various blogs about what I call \"linguistic conquests\"—epistemic strategies in which a polysemous concept—the product of a massive decentralized system of speakers operating in different environments across space and time, who using metaphor and inference have stretched its meaning into new applications—is considered to have been wrestled into understanding, when what <em>in fact</em> has occurred is a redefinition or refactoring of the original which moves it down a weight class, makes it easier to pin to the mat.</p><p>I distinguished between two types of linguistic conquest. First, the \"narrow and conquer\" method, where a specific sub-sense of a concept is taken to be its \"true\" or \"essential\" meaning, the core which defines its \"concept-ness.\" To give an example from discourse, Taleb defines the concept <em>rationality</em> as \"What survives, period.\" The second style I termed \"divide and conquer,\" where multiple sub-senses are distinguished and named in an attempt to preserve all relevant sub-senses while also gaining the ability to talk about one <em>specific</em> sub-sense. To give an example from discourse, Yudkowsky separates <em>rationality</em> into epistemic rationality—the pursuit of increasingly predictive models which are \"true\" in a loose correspondence sense—and instrumental rationality—the pursuit of models which lead to in-the-world flourishing, e.g. via adaptive self-deception or magical thinking. (This second sense is much like Taleb's: rationality as what <em>works</em>.)</p><p>Conquests by narrowing throw out all the richly bundled senses of a concept while keeping only the immediately useful—it's <em>wasteful</em> in its parsimony. It leaves not even a ghost of these other senses' past, advertising itself as the original bundled whole while erasing the richness which once existed there. It leads to verbal disputes, term confusion, talking past each other. It impoverishes our language.</p><p>Division preserves the original, bundled concept in full, documenting and preserving the different senses rather than purging all but the one. It advertises this history; <em>intended </em>meaning, <em>received</em> meaning—the qualifier indicates that these are hypernyms of \"meaning,\" which encompasses them both. Not just this, but the qualifier indicates the <em>character</em> of the subsense in a way that a narrowed umbrella original never will. Our understanding of the original has been improved even as our instrumental ability to wield its subsenses grows. Instead of stranding itself from discourse at large, the divided term has <em>clarified</em> discourse at large.</p><p>Chalmers, for his part, sees no difference between \"heteronymous\" and \"homonymous\" conceptual engineering—his own terms for two-word-type maneuvers (he gives as an example Ned Block factoring \"access consciousness\" from consciousness) and one-word-type maneuvers. One must imagine this apathy can only come from not having thought the difference through. He gives some nod—\"homonymous conceptual engineering, especially for theoretical purposes, can be very confusing, with all these multiple meanings floating around.\" Forgive him—he's speaking out loud—but not fully.</p><p>Ironically, divide-and-conquer methods are, quite literally, the solution to verbal disputes, while narrow-and-conquer methods, meanwhile, are, while not the sole cause of verbal disputes, one of its primary causes. Two discourses believe they have radically different stances on the nature of a phenomenon, only to realize they have radically different stances on the factoring of a word.</p><p>Another way of framing this: you must always preserve the full extensional coverage. It's no good to carve terms and then discard the unused chunks—like land falling into the sea, lessening habitable ground, collapsing under people's feet. I'm getting histrionic but bear with me: If you plan on only maintaining a patch of your estate, you must cede the rest of the land to the commons. Plain and simple, an old world philosophy.</p><p>(Division also answers Strawson's challenge: if you divide a topic into agreeably constituent sense-parts, and give independent answers for each sense, you have given an accounting of the full topic. Dave, by contrast, can only respond: \"Sure, I'm changing the topic—here's an interesting topic.\")</p><h2>A quick Q &amp; A</h2><p>I'm going to close by answering an audience question for Dave, because unfortunately he does not do so good a job, primarily on account of not understanding conceptual engineering.</p><blockquote>Paul Boghossian: Thanks Dave. Very useful distinctions. [Note: It's unclear why Chalmers' distinctions are useful, since he has not indicated any uses for them.] To introduce a new example, to me one of the most prominent examples of de novo engineering is the concept genocide... Lemkin noticed that there was a phenomenon that had not been picked out. It had certain features, he thought those features were important for legal purposes, moral purposes, and so on. And so he introduced the concept in order to name that. [He's on the money here, and then he loses it.] That general phenomenon, where you notice a phenomenon, of course there are many phenomena, there are murders committed on a Tuesday, you could introduce a word for that, but there, I mean, although you might have introduced a new concept, it's not clear what use is the word. So it looks as though... I mean, science, right? I mean...</blockquote><p>Paul is a bit confused here also. Noticing phenomena in the world is not something particular to science; the detection of regularity <em>is cognition itself</em>. If we believe Schmidhuber or Friston, this is the organizing principle of life, via error minimization and compression. \"Theorizing\" is a better word for it.</p><p>And yet, to the crux of the issue he touches on: why don't we introduce a word for murders committed on a Tuesday? You say, well what would be the point? Exactly. This isn't a very hard issue to think through, it's intuitively quite tractable. Paul <em>also</em> happens to mention <em>why</em> the concept \"genocide\" was termed. He just had to put the two together. \"Genocide\" had legal and moral purposes, it let you argue that the leader of a country, or his bureaucrats, were culpable of something especially atrocious. It's a tool of justice. That's why it exists: to distinguish an especially heinous case of statecraft from more banal ones. When we pick out a regularity and make it a \"thing,\" we are doing so because the thingness of that regularity is of use, because it distinguishes something we'd like to know, the same way \"sandy soil\" distinguishes something gardeners would like to know.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>This is not the most eloquent title, and it is not even that precise. Here is some more context. Find the words &quot;main question &quot; for my main question.  I figured I would say that to avoid berrying the lead.<br><br>Consider a salaried employee making N1 = $ 100000 in the US in year 2020. Let&apos;s estimate their taxes with assumptions and round numbers.<br><br>Calculation 1.<br><br>1. No investment taxable stuff. Taxed as Single<br>2. Payroll taxes of about 7650 total. (SS 6.2, Medicare 1.45)<br>3. They take the standard deduction for an individual, 12200. No extra tax credits.<br>4. Their federal income tax is against a taxable income of about 87800. (Yes, I believe that it&apos;s 100000 - 12200, not 100000 - 7650. The payroll taxes do not lower the amount 87800). The federal income tax is about 15000.<br>5. Their state income tax is also against 87800 for about 4000.  (would be about 5700 in California)<br>6. 100000 - 7650 - 15000 - 4000 = 73350<br><br>Calculation 2: They make the same salary and donate 10000 to nonprofits that year. (Or to a deferred fund which counts the deduction in 2020, ....)<br><br>2. Same payroll taxes 7650. As far as I&apos;m aware, donating normally cannot lower this<br>3. Let&apos;s estimate their itemized deduction as 16000 instead of 12200.<br>4. Their federal income tax is against a taxable income of about 84000, not 87800. At a marginal rate of around 23%, (I think it&apos;s in between tax brackets. I don&apos;t want to worry about absolute details!) the federal income tax decreases by 0.23 * 3800 = 874<br>5. Their state income is against 84000. At a marginal rate of around 7%, the state income tax is about 266 less.<br>6. Their income after donation is about 73350 - 10000 + 874 + 266 equals 8860 less (not 10000 less).<br><br>Calculation 3: Let&apos;s suppose that their itemized deduction would have been exactly 12200 without donation and is thus 22200. Skipping steps, their income after donation is about 73350 - 10000 + 2300 + 700 = 7000 less. Generally, by donating 10000 around these tax brackets, the most you can hope to get back by the standard tax code is 3000.<br><br>Calculation 4: Let&apos;s suppose that this employee is about to agree with their employer on a salary of 10000, and the employer donates 10000, to any choice of most 501c3 nonprofits registered in US (that is A LOT) at the employee&apos;s choice.<br><br>2. Their payroll tax is about 765 less.<br>3. They take the standard deduction for an individual, 12200.<br>(skipping some steps)<br>Compared to Calculation 1, They lose 10000 in base income, pay 765 less payroll, 2300 less federal, and 700 less state = 6235 less. This is better than Calculation 3 by 765. I also claim that it is realistic and fair to compare Calculation 4 to Calculation 2  (because without conventional donations, people might be quite far from the 12200 standard deduction), for which Calculation 4 is 2625 better. Also, the company saves 765 in payroll taxes, and it is conceivable for the employee to ask the company to give up that differential, instead donating 10765 to charities. (Note 1) I claim that this contract is thousands of dollars better for the employee, with further benefits like ducking under the IRA limits or lowering salary for need-based scholarships. I also claim that this big differential persists with the consideration of investment income and equity compensation.<br><br>-----------<br><br>With these calculations, I hope to make it convincing and as clear as I can, that someone who would have donated a significant amount to 501c3 nonprofits should rationally consider if their employer would agree to a new contract in which they take a gross salary deduction and donate that amount to charities at the employee&apos;s choice. (Moreover, their consideration is stronger if they&apos;re far from the standardized deduction, and if they were planning to give more, and if this gross deduction lowers them below IRA thresholds (124000) / other things, ...   <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2020\">https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2020</a> )<br><br>This is NOT the only rational choice of course. There is a considerable cost to asking for this in the first place. Also there are technical corporate tax things in which a corporation&apos;s charitable donation carryovers expire faster than their NOL carryovers. Also, a corporation could decide to lower their discretionary nonprofit donations in response; basically a big crowding out effect. This might affect their future comp. I claim that this future-comp effect is mitigated if you ask for it after an agreed raise, but I&apos;m not sure. Also they might be resented by coworkers. Also, I completely acknowledge that a lot of US companies have X2 corporate matching programs to an appreciable limit, like thousands. If these programs are generally un-restrictive (as opposed to restricting to local nonprofits, e.g.), then these companies could very reasonably say no. (Note 2)<br><br>So my main question is more or less: How many US employers would agree to this contract fully faithfully? Could there be a crowding out effect, especially at larger employers? And maybe to be a bit more precise than &quot;proportion of US employers,&quot; because of wildly varying sizes, I would like to try to pose my question as this. Consider a subset of the US labor force that you choose first, such as &quot;college grads present - 1990 as salaried employees in the US or looking for salaried work, without tricky income stuff.&quot; What proportion of this subset, (weighted equally), if they each hypothetically asked for this contract individually (not all at the same time / collectively) at some specified level, like 10% of their salary, would have their employer agree?<br>(So this is weighted roughly by employer size.)<br><br>I unconfidently estimate that the answer is 15%, excluding employers which have a 2X matching program with a limit &gt; 2000 or comparable / better.</p><p>Extra questions which are also hard:</p><p>I am aware of payroll deduction / donation mechanisms like Gusto (  <a href=\"https://support.gusto.com/team-management/hr-tools/giving/1066220501\">https://support.gusto.com/team-management/hr-tools/giving/1066220501</a>  ) and one by MIT in-house:  <a href=\"https://giving.mit.edu/payroll-deductions\">https://giving.mit.edu/payroll-deductions</a>  ). I don&apos;t know exactly how these work, but I think that these do not give the benefit in my &quot;Calculation 4.&quot; In particular, I think that these do NOT give the benefit of lowering payroll taxes nor ducking under IRA limits, and they are effectively the same as donating yourself but with the valid value of less paperwork. But, I&apos;m looking for more evidence on these and other mechanisms in the US. (Yes I&apos;m lazy and haven&apos;t asked their support centers.)<br><br>(Note 1). If you think this is not conceivable, my employer agreed to it.<br>(Note 2). I work at a startup. Before I asked, I am 90% sure that we had no corporate donations and had none planned for a while.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><span>\n\nGrowing up, I thought of air conditioning as extravagant. And AC for a\nlarge house, especially if it's poorly insulated or you only use a\nsmall part of the house, can get costly. On the other hand, AC for a\nsingle room is just pennies per hour, and if it lets you sleep\nwell on a hot night or makes you more productive during a hot day,\nit's probably well worth it.\n\n</span>\n\n</p><p>\n\nTo take an example, <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RGM11L5/\">this small\nwindow unit</a> is rated at 5,000 BTU with an Energy Efficiency Ratio\nof 11.0.  This means we should expect it to draw 454W (5,000 / 11) on\na hot day (95F, 50% humidity) when running on high.  Living in MA we\nhave some of the most expensive electricity in the country, and at our\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/rough-utility-costs\">$0.21/kWh</a> 454W is 9.5¢/hr.\nAt temperatures below that 95F it will be more efficient because it\nwill draw less (I measured 332W testing this weekend) and you won't\nneed to run it constantly to keep a good temperature.  This brings it\ndown to about the power consumption of a PC, and maybe between\n1¢/h and 5¢/h.  A workday's worth is then ~$0.09 to ~$0.45.\nIt doesn't have to make you much more productive or comfortable to be\nworth it!\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBut maybe climate change means I should be avoiding AC for altruistic\nreasons?  The dirtiest fuel still used is coal, at <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&amp;t=11\">2.21lb\nCO2e</a> per kWh. At $10/T for carbon offsets that's 1.1¢/kWh.\nNot zero, but it's very low.  If you're worried about longer-term\nsustainability when we run out of things to offset, at that point\nwe're not going to be using coal (since if someone is still burning\ncoal you could pay them to stop) and demand for AC lines up well with\nthe production curve for solar.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nYou could even make an AC unit directly connected to a solar panel,\nwithout the efficiency losses of converting to alternating current or\ncharging a battery.  You should be able to make a ~4,000 BTU window\nunit that runs off a standard 65x29 panel and runs the compressor at\nwhatever speed the incoming voltage will support.  Probably not worth\nit, though, unless you need cooling year-round whenever the sun is\nshining, since otherwise the panel is wasted the rest of the time.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/how-we-cool-our-house\">Fan pre-cooling</a> is still a good\nfit for large houses, days that don't get that hot, and weather where\nit cools down a lot overnight.  Working from home, with my 'office'\nbeing the corner of our third-floor bedroom with South-facing windows,\nhowever, this room is a much better fit for AC than pre-cooling.\nAnticipating hot days later this summer, I put in a window unit:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sliding-window-air-conditioner-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sliding-window-air-conditioner.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/sliding-window-air-conditioner.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/sliding-window-air-conditioner-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSince it's a narrow sliding window, it was a bit tricky.  The opening\nmeasured exactly 16 inches, and standard window AC units typically\nlist a minimum width of ~23 inches.  They do make vertical AC units\nfor narrow spaces, but they're generally large and expensive.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf you don't install the sliding accordion panels on a unit, though,\nyou can generally use it in a substantially narrower window.  The one\nI talked about above has body width of just under 16 inches, and\nwithout its accordion panels it fit perfectly.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThat is, perfectly side-to-side.  Vertically I did need to fill the\nspace above and keep it firmly in the window.  I cut a piece of\nplywood to exactly the vertical gap, and attached a bracket to keep it\nfrom moving.  The panel slides in horizontally, and catches the top\nlip of the unit.  For the bottom of the unit, since I wasn't using the\nincluded brackets I put on a narrow strip of wood to keep the unit\nsolidly on this side of the frame.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf I wanted to make it nicer I could paint the wood, or cut out the\nmiddle section and put in something transparent like glass or\nplexiglass.  For now, though, I'm planning to leave it as is.\n\n  </p>",

A few places:</p><ul><li>Evolved FPGA circuits - see the awesome blog post <a href=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/\">On the Origin of Circuits</a> focusing on the classic <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.50.9691\">1996 paper by Adrian Thompson</a>. An evolved circuit of just 37 logic gates managed to perform a function which kinda seems impossible with those components. It turned out that the components were used in weird ways—the circuit ran differently on nominally-identical FPGAs, the transistors were not all used as on/off switches, there was some electromagnetic coupling or power-line coupling going on, etc. Can we understand how this circuit works? In the paper, they didn't try. I imagine that a good physicist, given enough time and experimental data, could get at least a vague idea of the most important aspects. But there might be subtleties that can't really be explained better than a simulation, or maybe some component has 17 unrelated functions that occur at different parts of the cycle, or maybe you need to account for a microscopic bump in some wire, or whatever. If it were 370 components instead of 37, and there were limits on what you can measure experimentally, it would be that much harder.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver\">Busy Beaver Function</a> Σ(n) is unknown for as low as n=5. So we have a bunch of really simple computer programs, and no one knows whether they run forever or halt. When you get to larger n it gets even worse: For n≥1919 (and perhaps much smaller n too), Σ(n) is formally undecidable. While <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/261657/g%c3%b6dels-incompleteness-theorem-meta-reasoning-loophole\">that's not exactly the same as saying that we will never understand these programs</a>, I kinda expect that there <i>are</i> in fact programs whose asymptotic behavior really is \"infinitely inscrutable\", i.e. programs which don't halt, but where there is fundamentally no way to understand why they don't halt, short of actually running them forever, and that's true even if you have a brain the size of Jupiter. (I could be wrong, and this is not an important part of my argument.)</li><li>Riemann hypothesis: We have a simple-to-define function that exhibits an obvious pattern of behavior. Like those busy beaver Turing machines, the answer to \"why\" is \"I dunno, we ran the calculation, and that's what we've found, at least so far\". In this case, I assume that an explanation probably exists, but I find it interesting that we haven't discovered it yet, after 150 years of intense effort.</li></ul><p>In summary, my intuition is that:</p><ol><li>Simple components can give rise to recognizable emergent patterns of behavior for inscrutably complicated reasons that can't necessarily be distilled down to any \"explanation\" beyond \"we simulated it and that's what happens\", and</li><li>Neurons are <i>not</i> simple components, in that even if they have a legible primary input-output function, they probably have dozens of \"side-channel\" input-output functions that probably get sporadically used by evolution as well. (If you tug on a dendrite, then it's a spring!)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo4vez7gut8\"><sup><a href=\"#fno4vez7gut8\">[1]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>These two considerations coalesce to give me a prior expectation that there may be large numbers of <i>very</i> deep rabbit holes when you try to work out low-level implementation details of how the brain does any particular thing. The brain might do that thing by a beautiful, elegant, simple design ... or it might do that thing in some bizarre, ridiculous way, which we will not understand except by looking in weird places, like measuring mechanical stresses on cell membranes, or by measuring flows of chemicals that by all accounts ought to have no relation whatsoever to neuron firing, or by simulating systems of 492 components which interact in a complicated way that can't really be boiled down into anything simpler.</p><p>The book <i>The Idea of the Brain</i> has some great examples of the horrors facing neuroscientists trying to understand seemingly-simple neural circuits:</p><blockquote><p>…Despite having a clearly established connectome of the thirty-odd neurons involved in what is called the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, Marder's group cannot yet fully explain how even some small portions of this system function. ...in 1980 the neuroscientist Allen Selverston published a much-discussed think piece entitled \"Are Central Pattern Generators Understandable?\"...the situation has merely become more complex in the last four decades...The same neuron in different [individuals] can also show very different patterns of activity—the characteristics of each neuron can be highly plastic, as the cell changes its composition and function over time...</p><p>…Decades of work on the connectome of the few dozen neurons that form the central pattern generator in the lobster stomatogastric system, using electrophysiology, cell biology and extensive computer modelling, have still not fully revealed how its limited functions emerge.</p><p>Even the function of circuits like [frog] bug-detecting retinal cells—a simple, well-understood set of neurons with an apparently intuitive function—is not fully understood at a computational level. There are two competing models that explain what the cells are doing and how they are interconnected (one is based on a weevil, the other on a rabbit); their supporters have been thrashing it out for over half a century, and the issue is still unresolved. In 2017 the connectome of a neural substrate for detecting motion in <i>Drosophila</i> was reported, including information about which synapses were excitatory and which were inhibitory. Even this did not resolve the issue of which of those two models is correct.</p></blockquote><p>I haven't chased down these references, and can't verify that understanding these things is really as difficult as this author says. On the other hand, these are <i>really really simple systems</i>; if they're even remotely approaching the limits of our capabilities, imagine an interacting bundle of 10× or 100× more neurons, doing something more complicated, in a way that is harder to experimentally measure.</p><p>So anyway, maybe scientists will eventually understand how the brain does absolutely everything it does, at the “implementation level”. I don't think that's ruled out. But I sure don't think it's likely, even for the simplest worm nervous system, in the foreseeable future.</p><h1>Part 2: …But that doesn't mean brain-inspired AGI is hard!</h1><p><strong>Side note 1:</strong> I use \"brain-inspired AGI\" in the sense of copying (or reinventing) high-level data structures and algorithms, not in the sense of copying low-level implementation details, e.g. neurons that spike. \"Neuromorphic hardware\" is a thing, but I see no sign that neuromorphic hardware will be relevant for AGI. Most neuromorphic hardware researchers are focused on low-power sensors, as far as I understand.</p><p><strong>Side note 2:</strong> The claim “brain-inspired AGI is likely” is unrelated to the claim “brain-inspired AGI will bring about a better future for humankind than other types of AGIs”, although these two claims sometimes get intuitively bundled together under the heading of \"cheerleading for brain-like AGI\". I have grown increasingly sympathetic to the former claim, but am undecided about the latter claim, and see it as an open research question—indeed, a <i>particularly urgent</i> open question, as it informs <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4basF9w9jaPZpoC8R/intro-to-brain-like-agi-safety-1-what-s-the-problem-and-why\">high-leverage research prioritization decisions that we can act on immediately</a>.</p><p><strong>OK, back to the main text.</strong> I want to argue something like this:</p><p><i><strong>If some circuit in the brain is doing something useful, then it's humanly feasible to understand what that thing is and why it's useful, and to write our own CPU code that does the same useful thing.</strong></i></p><p>In other words, the brain's implementation of that thing can be super-complicated, but the input-output relation cannot be that complicated—at least, the <i>useful</i> part of the input-output relation cannot be that complicated.</p><p>The crustacean stomatogastric ganglion central pattern generators discussed above are a great example: their <i>mechanisms</i> are horrifically complicated, but their <i>function</i> is simple: they create a rhythmic oscillation. Hey, you need a rhythmic oscillation in your AGI? No problem! I can do that in one line of Python.</p><p>At the end of the day, we survive by exploiting regularities in our ecological niche and environment. If the brain does something that's useful, I feel like there has to be a legible explanation in those terms; and from that, that there has to be legible CPU code that does the same thing.</p><p>I feel most strongly about the boldface statement above in regards to the neocortex. The neocortex is a big <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NkSpukDkm9pjRdMdB/human-instincts-symbol-grounding-and-the-blank-slate\">uniform-ish</a> machine that learns patterns in inputs and outputs and rewards, builds a predictive model, and uses that model to choose outputs that increase rewards, using some techniques we already understand, and others we don’t. If the neocortex does some information-processing thing, and the result is that it does its job better, then I feel like there has to be some legible explanation for what it's doing, why, and how, in terms of that primary prediction-and-action task … there has to be some reason that it systematically helps run smarter searches, or generates better models, or makes more accurate predictions, etc.</p><p>I feel much <i>less </i>strongly about that above boldface statement in regards to the brainstem and hypothalamus (the home of evolved instinctive responses to different situations, I would argue, see <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hE56gYi5d68uux9oM/intro-to-brain-like-agi-safety-3-two-subsystems-learning-and\">here</a>). For example, I can definitely imagine that the human brain has an instinctual response to a certain input which is adaptive in 500 different scenarios that ancestral humans typically encountered, and maladaptive in another 499 scenarios that ancestral humans typically encountered. So on average it's beneficial, and our brains evolved to have that instinct, but there's no tidy story about why that instinct is there and no simple specification for exactly what calculation it's doing.</p><p>By the same token, in this sense, I expect that understanding the key operating principles of human intelligence will be dramatically easier than understanding the key operating principles of the nervous system of a 100-neuron microscopic worm!! Weird thought, right?! But again, every little aspect of those worm neurons could be a random side-effect of something else, or it could be an adaptive strategy for some situation that comes up in the worm's environment once every 5 generations, and how on earth are you ever going to figure out which is which?? And if you can't figure out which is which, how can you hope to “understand” the system in any way besides running a molecule-by-molecule simulation?? By contrast, “human intelligence” is a specific suite of capabilities, including things like “can carry on conversations, invent new technology, etc.”—a known target to aim for.</p><p>(<i>Added for clarification:</i> The point of the previous paragraph is that “understanding how a nervous system gives rise to a particular identifiable set of behaviors” is tractable, whereas “understanding the entire design spec of a nervous system”—i.e., every way that it optimizes inclusive genetic fitness—is <i>not</i> tractable. And I'm saying that this is <i>such</i> a big factor that it outweighs even the many-orders-of-magnitude difference in complexity between microscopic worms' and humans' nervous systems.)</p><h1>Conclusions</h1><p>I guess I have a not-terribly-justified gut feeling that we <i>already</i> vaguely understand how neocortical algorithms work to create human intelligence, and that “soon” (few decades?) this vague understanding will develop into full-fledged AGIs, assuming that the associated R&amp;D continues. On the other hand, I acknowledge that this is very much <i>not</i> a common view, including among people far more knowledgeable than myself, and in particular there are plenty of neuroscientists who view the project of understanding the human brain as a centuries-long endeavor. I guess this post is a little piece of how I reconcile those two facts: At least in some cases, when neuroscientists talk about understanding the brain, I think they mean understanding what all the calculations are and how they are implemented—like what those researchers have been trying and failing to do with the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion in that book quote from part 1 above—but for a human brain with 10⁹× more neurons. Yup, that sounds like a centuries-long endeavor to me too! But I think understanding human intelligence well enough to make a working AGI algorithm is <i>dramatically</i> easier than that.

That's what evolution does, just like an evolved PCB circuit would probably use the board itself as a mechanical resonator or whatever other ridiculous things you can imagine. So my generic expectation is: (1) If you removed the glial cells, it would break lots of brain computations; (2) If there were no such thing as glial cells, a functionally-identical circuit would have evolved, and I bet it wouldn't even look all that different. By the way, I know almost nothing about glial cells, I'm just speculating. :-)</p></div></li></ol>",

Then consider DreamQuest, which I consider a tier 2 game, and/or Monster Train.</p>\n<p>In my tier system, Slay the Spire is a Tier 1 game. It is a Must Play.</p>\n<p>DreamQuest and Monster Train are Tier 2 games. They are Worth It, for those who can get into them.</p>\n<p>Dicey Dungeons is a Tier 4 game in the genre. It’s Playable. For true genre lovers only. I enjoyed watching it do its thing but have no desire to explore it in depth.</p>\n<p>I am always happy to play Tier 3 (Good) or better games in genres I like, if there are no known fresh Must Play or Worth It games available that scratch the same itch. Tier 2 or higher games are worth playing, to me, in most genres, provided they agree with you.</p>\n<h3>Core Mechanics</h3>\n<p>Monster Train is a deckbuilding roguelike in the style of games like <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/12/09/review-slay-the-spire/\">Slay the Spire</a> and DreamQuest.</p>\n<p>You start out with a deck of mostly basic cards that are mostly quite bad. Between battles, you get to do things that improve that deck. You get good cards that fit your strategy. You get rid of bad cards that don’t fit your strategy. You improve and duplicate your cards. You get artifacts that give you static advantages, similar to relics in Slay the Spire.</p>\n<p>Each battle, you face several waves of monsters. They mostly but not always start at the bottom train level.</p>\n<p>Each turn, you draw a hand of cards then spend our local version of energy/mana/fire to play them. Your fire replenishes each turn. You can play monsters to fight on each of three levels, provided there is space for them, and you can also play spells. Monsters that get deployed don’t go back in your deck, whereas spells stick around. When you run out of cards, your discard pile gets shuffled again to become your deck. All standard stuff.</p>\n<p>Then on each level, they attack your stuff, your stuff attacks back if it survived, then any surviving attackers move up a level. If they survive at the top level they get to fight your pyre, which takes damage that lasts between battles. If your pyre goes to zero, you lose. At the end of each fight, the boss starts fighting. The boss will keep battling whatever is on each level continuously until one side is dead.</p>\n<p>If you beat the Seraph at the end, you reignite the fires of Hell and win the run. You score points, unlock new cards, and the difficulty level slowly increases, as embodied by your Covenant rank. That’s similar to Ascension levels in Slay the Spire.</p>\n<p>Like Slay the Spire, the game has its own unique art style and attitude, and music and sound effects that support its aesthetics. I don’t consider it as good at this as Slay the Spire, but it’s still effective at what it needs to do, in the sense that DreamQuest really isn’t and succeeds despite its graphics being resonant but also really really bad.</p>\n<p>Monster Train has been growing on me. Games remain fun. It’s better and deeper than it looked at first glance. It’s possible it will end up as a Tier 2 game by the time I finish with it.</p>\n<p>If this sounds fun to you, stop here and go in without further information. Come back once you have won a run, or at least fought the Seraph.</p>\n<p>If you are still not sure, or you’re back after playing a bit, here’s further thoughts that are still mostly spoiler-free.</p>\n<h3>Picking a Theme</h3>\n<p>Monster Train is a game of wild swings in power level.</p>\n<p>There are a handful of themes that can get out of hand quickly. If you don’t succeed at one of them, you won’t win. You can’t hedge your bets and you can’t play things by halves. It won’t work. Pick a side. If you start down a path and the tools don’t appear, you’ll die to one of the later battles. If you’re very lucky you can pivot, but that seems rare.</p>\n<p>The alternative is certain death. If you don’t start down a path, you die every time.</p>\n<p>The choice of major enhancements makes this even more clear. You can choose, after fights three and six, either to gain an extra card draw each turn, an extra fire to play cards, or an extra capacity point on floors.</p>\n<p>I have yet to see a good case for choosing card draw, but there are definitely decks that want double capacity and decks that want at least one fire instead. This locks you in to your plans even more than before.</p>\n<p>By the middle of a run, around floor four, you know exactly what you are planning to do and what needs to happen.</p>\n<p>Often, you’ll know exactly which problems are the ones that might take you down. There are a handful of specific problems decks need to solve to survive the last few battles. Many strategies have one particular sub-problem that is especially likely to kill them, and will otherwise probably win.</p>\n<h3>Know Your Roots</h3>\n<p>It might not look like it at first glance, but I think the game has as much in common with DreamQuest as it does with Slay the Spire.</p>\n<p>You’re warned from the beginning about what final boss configuration you are up against.</p>\n<p>You are on a very tight deadline to expand your power level at times. Other times, you’re essentially done halfway through. Much of what you find will be either amazing or useless. When you get a chance to shrink your deck, you freaking pounce on it.</p>\n<p>Each class has tight builds that can work, which you have to aim for almost from the start. In Slay the Spire archetypes are not the right way to think about the game. In DreamQuest or Monster Train, they are <em>absolutely </em>the right way to think about the game.</p>\n<p>Note that I still say Class here rather than Class Pair. In my experience, you lean into one or the other theme, and use only a little from the other. There are good units and a few good spells everywhere, but you can’t mix multiple card-intensive themes if you want to win. Trying to do both at once <em>can </em>work if you’re being handed the world, but mostly not otherwise.</p>\n<p>Some of the cards, even without upgrading, are <em>stupidly </em>powerful. With upgrades, those cards become absurd. Getting and supporting those cards is usually key to victory. At a minimum, you need to put a strong upgrade set on multiple creatures, or you’re toast.</p>\n<p>There’s no question the game incorporates a lot of innovations from Slay the Spire too. The branching paths, the card choices, the upgrading and so on are clearly refinements of those ideas, for better or for worse.</p>\n<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>\n<p>These are the big ones that stand out for me, including stuff that didn’t fit into the above.</p>\n<p>While there are a lot of cons listed, that’s because I am holding the game to a very high standard.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<p>Genre tends to be insanely great by default, and it’s a new twist on that genre.</p>\n<p>Many problems feel importantly <em>different </em>than past games in genre.</p>\n<p>Decisions on how to configure your team across three levels can be very tricky and complex in interesting ways.</p>\n<p>Lot of the stuff feels good to do. Good fun factor.</p>\n<p>Remarkably deep planning is possible, and becomes necessary on harder levels.</p>\n<p>Consistent aesthetic is well executed.</p>\n<p>Short journey makes each game a contained unit.</p>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<p>Runs and battles can both take a while after they are mostly or entirely over.</p>\n<p>Once you know your path you often don’t make many interesting decisions.</p>\n<p>No undo button for clear mistakes even more frustrating than in Slay the Spire.</p>\n<p>Absurdly unbalanced in many places. Some crazy good relics and events and cards.</p>\n<p>And there’s the snowball effect of getting an amazing thing and getting to copy it.</p>\n<p>Short journey forces focus on endgame from the start. Things that don’t work at the end are non-starters at the start. There’s only really one ‘transition’ in deck construction, which is after the first 2-3 battles, then that’s it.</p>\n<p>First few battles have low stakes, can feel like wasting time once you’re used to them.</p>\n<p>Pyre health doesn’t trade off with other things in interesting ways often enough. When things get through and actually kill you, usually they massively overkill you.</p>\n<p>Game stats point to stupid stuff and leave out stuff that I’d be interested in, please fix.</p>\n<p>Unlocks are really, really slow. Game may look a lot less interesting than it is because of this.</p>\n<p>Runs start to blur together. Not enough different cards.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Crossposted from </em><a href=\"https://www.calebontiveros.com/you-see-the-territory-or-nothing-at-all/.\">here</a>. </p><p>This post is about the philosophy of perception, what makes a philosophical debate substantive, and cognitive qualia.</p><p>Consider two views about the nature of perception and the world: on indirect realism we perceive a veil, we only indirectly get at the world through this veil. On direct realism, we perceive the world. The veil is lifted and we are in direct contact with the world.</p><p>On indirect realism what we perceive are mental objects like sense data. This is the veil that stands between us and the world. We must infer the existence of the world.</p><p>You can visualize the two views in the following ways:</p><pre><code><code>indirect: perceiver =&gt; sense data =&gt; world <br>direct: perceiver =&gt; world  <br><br>indirect: perceiver =&gt; map =&gt; territory <br>direct: perceiver =&gt; territory  <br><br>indirect: perceiver =&gt; veil =&gt; world <br>direct: perceiver =&gt; world </code></code></pre><p>Indirect realism gets its intuitive appeal from the idea of hallucination. If I have the experience of a red elephant in my room then I am perceiving my visual field, not a red elephant in the room. The object of my perception is the appearance of a red elephant, nothing more. We can visualize this as:</p><pre><code><code>perceiver =&gt; experience of a red elephant =&gt;  </code></code></pre><p>The last arrow points to nothing because there is no red elephant in the world. Here&#x2019;s how the direct realist would visualize this case:</p><pre><code><code>perceiver =&gt;  </code></code></pre><p>The direct realist says that you don&#x2019;t perceive anything when you hallucinate. You either see the territory or nothing at all.</p><p>Despite the intuitive appeal of indirect perception, the direct view is better. Using our visualization, you can get at this by stepping back and considering the question that a theory of perception should answer: what is the object of one&#x2019;s perception? In the case where perception is accurate, the answer is the world. But for the indirect realist, the object of perception is a mental object, like sense data.</p><p>But <em>how</em> is the object of perception perceived? What is it perceived <em>through</em>?</p><p>On direct realism the object of perception is perceived through mental states, which we can call experience. Returning to the visualization, the `=&gt;` is experience.</p><pre><code><code>perceiver =&gt; world = perceiver experiences the world </code></code></pre><p>The indirect realist cannot say this. This is because the object of perception is a mental object. Which is to say, it is experience. On this, picture one only experiences experiences. You can visualize this as follows:</p><pre><code><code>indirect: perceiver =&gt; experience =&gt; world = perceiver experiences experience </code></code></pre><p>Of course, there&#x2019;s a sense in which you can experience experiences. I can experience an AirBnB experience. But when we say that, <em>experience</em> means two different things. What the indirect realist is committed to is the idea that one perceives mental states through other mental states at the same moment. This isn&#x2019;t right, there&#x2019;s just experience. Not experiences of experience. The mistake that the indirect realist makes is that they confuse the <em>object</em> of perception with the <em>vehicle</em> of perception, what was is aware of with how one is aware. We&#x2019;re aware <em>through</em> experience, not just aware of things in our head.</p><p>You might be wondering what is going on in this debate. Is it substantive? Sometimes we debate things that are substantive, like whether there is a God or not. On other occasions, it seems like we are playing verbal or conceptual games.</p><p>I think this is a case where we&#x2019;re playing conceptual games.</p><p>Here are two tests for whether something is a conceptual debate or not.</p><p>First the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words\">taboo</a> <a href=\"http://www.consc.net/papers/verbal.pdf\">test</a>. Try to carry on the debate in other terms. If you can&#x2019;t do this, there&#x2019;s a good chance you&#x2019;re arguing over the meaning of words or a concept. Here&#x2019;s how this would look like in the God debate:</p><pre><code><code>Before taboo <br>atheist: there is no God <br>theist: there is a God  <br><br>After <br>atheist: there is no supernatural triomni person <br>theist: there is a supernatural triomni person </code></code></pre><p>There&apos;s clearly a substantive debate here. Whether or not there is a supernatural triomni person is not a linguistic matter.</p><p>How does it go in the perception debate?</p><pre><code><code>Before taboo <br>direct: the object of perception is the world <br>indirect: the object of perceptions are mental states   <br><br>After <br>direct: mental states are not the object of awareness <br>indirect: mental states are the the object of awareness </code></code></pre><p>This, of course, pushes the debate from <em>perception</em> to <em>awareness</em>. This may game will be played a few rounds, but it&#x2019;s not clear to me how to proceed once the words like <em>perception</em>, <em>awareness</em>, <em>contents of experience</em>, and <em>acquaintance</em> are tabooed. Which is one would expect if one is only arguing over the purview of a concept. Both parties agree that we have experiences that are candidates for perception. The direct realist doesn&#x2019;t deny that we can have the experience of a red elephant suddenly appearing in our rooms. What they do deny is that there would be any perception going on in that case. But it&apos;s difficult to restate this debate without using perception or its synonyms.</p><p>A shorter way to determine whether a debate is purely conceptual is to ask whether it differentiates between different ways for the concrete world to be. Consider debates over the following propositions:</p><pre><code><code>Pluto is a planet <br>If something is a planet, then it clears its planetary orbit </code></code></pre><p>If two parties are disagreeing about whether Pluto is a planet, they are likely disagreeing over whether Pluto meets the requirements for being a planet, like whether <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_the_neighbourhood\">it clears the neighborhood around its orbit</a>. The concrete world would be one way if Pluto cleared its neighborhood, it would be another way if it didn&#x2019;t.<br></p><p>If two parties disagreed over the second proposition, then they&#x2019;d be debating the requirements for being a planet. This is a conceptual matter. The concrete world would not change if the proposition were true or not.</p><p>Now, move to the debate over the nature of perception. We have two propositions:</p><pre><code><code>Charles perceives a red elephant <br>If someone perceives X, then X is a mental state </code></code></pre><p>Does the first differentiate different ways for the concrete world to be? It depends. If what perception means is having a mental state that includes the appearance of a red elephant, then yes, it does. If the proposition were true, then Charles has a mental state that includes a red elephant. If it were false, then he has a different mental state. What it would be like to be Charles would be different in the two cases.</p><pre><code><code>True: Charles has a mental state that includes the appearance of a red elephant. <br>False: Charles has a different mental state </code></code></pre><p>Likewise, if what perception means is to <em>accurately</em> represent the world, then this to differentiates between different ways for the concrete world to be. In one case, there is a red elephant and in another case there isn&#x2019;t. The concrete world is different in both cases:</p><pre><code><code>True: there&#x2019;s a red elephant <br>False: there&#x2019;s no red elephant </code></code></pre><p>The debate over the nature of perception isn&#x2019;t about whether there are red elephants or not. Nor is it about whether one can have the mental state that would be characterized by the appearance of a red elephant.</p><p>Instead, it&#x2019;s about whether perception has as its object the world or some mental state. Which is to say it&#x2019;s about propositions like this:</p><pre><code><code>If someone perceives X, then X is a mental state </code></code></pre><p>Whether this proposition is true or not will make no difference to the concrete world. Which indicates that this debate is merely conceptual.</p><h3>Cognitive Qualia</h3><p>I used to think that debates over concepts didn&#x2019;t matter. Of course, conceptual clarity is useful because it eases communication and carving up the world neatly makes it easier to handle.</p><p>But the debates don&#x2019;t matter in the sense that you aren&#x2019;t figuring out anything fundamental about the concrete world. Whether or not there are quarks, whether ants are sentient, or whether egalitarian societies are more productive -- these debates matter. They get at different ways for the world to be in a way that purely conceptual debates do not.</p><p>But there&#x2019;s another way in which these debates matter, something that took me a few years to realize.</p><p>I was reminded of this by hearing <a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/the-portal/episodes/7d086129-e19d-4e17-8a6b-2dcd741c5f50\">Eric Weinstein say the following to Josh Wolfe</a>:</p><blockquote>The thing that I am talking to now is the projection of you inside of my head. That comes from the stimulation. I mean, I believe that I have eyes, I don&apos;t want to get completely Jiggy but just assume that reality is the standard picture of reality. I see you as being across the room for me, but that&apos;s not the thing that it&apos;s really happening, what&#x2019;s really happening, if everything I know to be is correct, Is that the thing across the room for me is generated a model in my mind, which is the only thing I&apos;ve ever interacted with.</blockquote><p>This is wrong. Eric spoke to Josh Wolfe, not a model of Josh Wolfe.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s not the main point here, the main idea is that what it&#x2019;s like to be a direct realist can differ radically from what it&#x2019;s like to be an indirect realist. In other words, there&#x2019;s such a thing as <em>cognitive qualia</em>. Qualia refers to the subjective character of mental states. There&#x2019;s something it&#x2019;s like to be sad, overjoyed, feel pain, feel pleasure. Likewise, there&#x2019;s something it&#x2019;s like to believe that you can see the territory, something else to believe that you&#x2019;re stuck to seeing the map.</p><p><a href=\"http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/belieflikeclothes.html\">Robin Hanson</a> has called out how beliefs are basically just like clothes. They have a social and functional role:<br></p><blockquote>Functionally, beliefs inform us when we choose our actions, given our preferences. But many of our beliefs are also social, in that others see and react to our beliefs. So beliefs can also allow us to identify with groups, to demonstrate our independence and creativity, and to signal our wealth, profession, and social status.</blockquote><p>This picture is insightful, but incomplete. Beliefs have an experiential role as well.</p>",

A mathematical formulation of “transparent or interpretable” is currently not available: sparsity has been proposed as a possible candidate proxy for these properties, and so we want to investigate how well the links between sparsity and interpretability holds, and what kinds of sparsity aid in what kinds of interpretability.</p>\n<p><em>(A note on the field of Interpretability: we’ve talked a bit previously about what interpretability is, as the topic is broad and the term is very underdefined. It’s important to note, when discussing whether a particular property (like sparsity) makes a model more or less interpretable, we need to specify what kind of interpretability method we’re using, as different methods will benefit from different properties of the model.)</em></p>\n<p>We have several intuitions that sparsity in neural networks might imply greater interpretability, and some which point in the opposite direction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debugging a system with many weights and interconnections seems more complex than to do the same for a sparser system with less parameters and connections; High connectivity is one of reasons why neural networks are not considered transparent.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, human-recognizable features are often complex objects - such as in an image classification task, where humans recognize faces, dog ears, and trees as opposed to simple patterns of white noise. There is hence a risk that making a system sparser could lessen its capacity to work with such high-level concepts.\n<ul>\n<li>In other words, a dense system may be able to use complex but human-interpretable features, whereas a sparse system wouldn't have the capacity to recognise these features and hence focus on simpler features which are less meaningful to humans.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Neural networks trained against adversarial attacks produce more human recognizable features [1]. If making the system sparser makes it more vulnerable to adversarial attacks, then it may then be less human-interpretable. However, it is unclear in what direction the causality would flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this post we investigate a specific instantiation of an interpretability method which intuitively seems to benefit greatly from sparsity, and discuss ways in which we can make the most of these benefits while not changing the network to be too sparse and lose performance</p>\n<h1>Introduction of the Experiment</h1>\n<p>To test whether sparsity is good for interpretability, the obvious thing to do is to get a sparse neural network, and see whether it's easier to interpret. To do it we need following things: a neural network, a pruning method to produce a sparse network, and an interpretability method to apply to this sparse network.</p>\n<p><strong>Neural network</strong>. We will use a simple network of the following architecture trained on MNIST (2 hidden layers of size 32 with ReLU activations; in total 26432 weights in kernels):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qr9hRSp.png\" alt=\"MNIST Network\"></p>\n<p>This architecture gets 95+% accuracy on the MNIST test set after three epochs of training.</p>\n<p><strong>Pruning method</strong>. The lottery ticket hypothesis [2] claims that neural networks pruned, reset to their initial training weights, and retrained, and that this retrained network will often learn faster, attain better asymptotic performance and generalise better than the original network. The pruning method used in this paper is relatively simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initialize the neural network, and save the initialisation.</li>\n<li>Train the network to convergence.</li>\n<li>Prune X% of smallest weights per layer.</li>\n<li>Reset the network to its initialization,</li>\n<li>Repeat the above process, each time pruning a percentage of the weights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that in our experiment we are pruning only only kernels, not biases. As there are only 74 weights in biases, this isn't a consequential number of parameters compared to 27432, and it makes the implementation simpler.</p>\n<p><strong>Gaining insight</strong>. Having matrices with many zeros is not in itself helpful. We need to use an interpretation method to take advantage of this sparsity. Because we hope for quite a sparse representation at the end, chose to visualize the network as it's flowgraph.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate how this works, we'll use the following computation:</p>\n<p><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\begin{bmatrix}5 &amp;

To make it clearer, we can exploit the following observations: Many vertices and corresponding edges are from the input layer to the first hidden layer. We can detect dot product operations in the first layer and simply visualize weights as a 2D image, because the first layer is directly connected to the pixels.

green is used for positive values; red for negative, and grey is the zero.</em></p>\n<p>A further simplification is to display only subgraph of the flowgraph that is relevant for each output separately. While it loses information about what is reused between outputs, it provides more readable graphs.</p>\n<p>Combining these two simplifications, we get the following visualisation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://kreatrix.org/blog/sparsity.html#visualisation2\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XT8EjNg.png\" alt=\"Visualisation two\"></a></p>\n<p>Here we can observe that some filters on the input are relatively interpretable, and it is clear what shapes they detect:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SB4QyvW.png\" alt=\"Filter 1\"> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7Gqn4IA.png\" alt=\"Filter 2\"> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jLaYbrA.png\" alt=\"Filter 3\"></p>\n<p>On the other hand, some of them look more like random pixel detections:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vssXYWt.png\" alt=\"Filter 4\"> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/czJPdu7.png\" alt=\"Filter 5\"> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PG7anwt.png\" alt=\"Filter 6\"></p>\n<p>The computation after the initial layer still remains relatively dense and hard to understand. It is now possible to track the flow of individual values through the graph in most places, but we can do better.</p>\n<h1>Visualising behaviour on specific inputs</h1>\n<p>To get more insight, we can also visualize flowgraphs on individual inputs. This allows us to visualize values flowing between nodes; the thickness of lines corresponds to the absolute value of the scalar value produced by a source operation while green lines carry positive values, red lines carry negative values, and grey lines are exactly 0.</p>\n<p>Also, for each visualized dot product, we show the result of applying this filter to the input image (that is, the result of the dot product multiplication of the input and the weights). This is shown as the right-hand figure next to the dot product filter visualisations at the top of the flowgraph.</p>\n<p>The following figure shows this visualisation for six random images from the test set (the values in square brackets in the nodes are the actual values that flow through the graph):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://kreatrix.org/blog/sparsity.html#visualisation3\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oPq6TDA.png\" alt=\"Visualisation three\"></a></p>\n<p>The figure shows that it relatively trackable to see which part of the network contributes to the final decision. For example, let us see how the probability that the input is digit 0 (<code>output_0</code>) is computed. For the digit 1 input, it is clear that the decision to not classify it as a 0 is heavily influenced by one specific dot product that detects pixels in the middle of the figure. Another observation is that there are two main branches in the flow that plays an important role of classifying digit 0 correctly (i.e. digit 0 and <code>output_0</code>). It mixes together a detector of a bottom pixels and detection of some specific pixels. For the sixth input (digit 6) is used, it is not classified as 0 even though some of detectors are positively triggered (similarly to case with input 0); however, the detector of the central pixels overweights and produce a negative score.</p>\n<h1>Pruning once more</h1>\n<p>Let us revisit the idea of pruning. We have pruned the network as much as possible to get a more understandable object then a fully connected network. However, there is space for trade-offs; we don't need to prune each layer equally, and could trade off pruning some layers more to prune other layers less.</p>\n<p>Specifically, in our case we have a visualization of the first layer who's interpretability is not influenced as much by the sparsity. This allows us to completely disable pruning of the first layer. With this approach we get the following network flowgraph that has 93.5% accuracy on the test set:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FYyR8JE.png\" alt=\"New Pruned Architecture\"></p>\n<p>The network has 95% of its original weights, but last two kernels are several times smaller than in the previous case. This gives us a significantly simpler flowgraph. It can be now easily shown in one diagram for each outputs without loosing clarity. The following figure shows resulting flow graphs applied on six figures from the testing test.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://kreatrix.org/blog/sparsity.html#visualisation4\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cZqNeRy.png\" alt=\"Visualisation four\"></a></p>\n<p>One interesting observation is that this network returns a constant value for <code>output_2</code>. This means that the digit 2 is a kind of reference point; an input is classified as digit 2 if other outputs are sufficiently suppressed.</p>\n<p>We can again easily track down properties like digit 1 is not classified as 0 because of the pixel in the middle part. In this version, it is less clear what each dot products detects, but on the other hand it very straightforward what is happening with each dot product value in the rest of the computation.</p>\n<h1>Domains other than MNIST</h1>\n<p>The approach of pruning and visualization of flow graphs may be also applied to other domains such as reinforcement learning for continuous control. We use the classic <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0\">OpenAI CartPole-v0</a> environment. The following figure shows a network trained with DQN, and then pruned when reaching maximal score, on the CartPole environment. For this network, we can observe that one input (i_1, which is the cart velocity) is completely ignored, while the agent still gains the maximal score.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://kreatrix.org/blog/sparsity.html#visualisation1\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1asg8yJ.png\" alt=\"Visualisation five\"></a></p>\n<p>On the other hand, our approach doesn't seem useful for convolutional neural networks, since applying the convolutional filters over the whole output of the previous layer is a part of the algorithm and it is not pruned with weights. Therefore, a convolutional filter even with a single weight may produce many connections in the flow graph. The presented approach still produces dense flow graphs even for heavily pruned convolutional networks.</p>\n<p>The following figure shows a network created as 3 convolutional layers (6 channels, 3x3 filters, without padding, kernel sizes: 54, 324, 324) followed by a dense layer (kernel size: 29040, no activation). The layers was pruned to 6 (11%), 23 (7%), 23 (7%), and 135 (0.46%) of their original sizes. The resulting network has only 80% accuracy and quite a low number of weights, but still produces a relatively large and dense graphs. The graph for computing <code>output_7</code> is the largest one (1659 vertices).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://kreatrix.org/blog/sparsity.html#visualisation1\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x8lDBke.png\" alt=\"Visualisation six\"></a></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>While we may not have conclusively answered the question posed in the title, we have generated insight and intuitions with this simple example. As expected, pruning dense object may lead to more interpretable objects; however, there are trade-offs. Only counting the number of weights in the final object is probably not the ideal metric to get a most interpretable result. In our experiment, the later flowgraphs (of dense nets) where more interpretable despite having many more weights than the previous examples. This points to an answer to the opposing views of sparsity possibly giving both more and less interpretability; In some settings sparsity is beneficial in giving humans understanding and transparency, but when a visualisation which doesn't rely on sparsity can still produce results that humans can understand and interpret, the sparsity isn't necessarily useful.</p>\n<p><em>Acknowledgement: This text was created as a part of <a href=\"https://aisrp.org/\">AISRP</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p><strong>Adversarial Robustness as a Prior for Learned Representations [<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00945.pdf\">PDF</a>]</strong> <em>Engstrom, L., Ilyas, A., Santurkar, S., Tsipras, D., Tran, B. and Madry, A., 2019.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Training Pruned Neural Networks  [<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03635.pdf\">PDF</a>]</strong> <em>Frankle, J. and Carbin, M., 2018.

It seems to have a lot to do with devices whose behavior depends on the consequences of their own behavior: that is, devices that behave in ways that cause the overall system in which they are embedded to evolve towards a target configuration, for a wide variety of possible environments.</p>\n<p>If we only need the device to work in a single embedding system, then we can use simple feed-forward control. For example, to build an autonomous car that navigates from one precisely known location to another, via a precisely known trajectory, we can hardcode all the necessary turns and just let the car go. We might call this a non-adaptive system.</p>\n<p>But if we want the autonomous car to navigate successfully when there are other vehicles on the road whose positions are apriori unknown to us, then we need a car that adapts its behavior based on input from sensors. The particular kind of adaptation we need is that the car behaves such that it evolves towards a target configuration in which the car is at its desired destination.</p>\n<p>One way we can build such a feedback loop is by designing a feed-forward algorithm that takes sensor inputs and produces actuator outputs. A thermostat is an example of this: we just design the thermostat to turn on the heater when the observed temperature is below the target temperature. We could similarly design an autonomous car that observes vehicles around it and moves a little to the left whenever there is a vehicle too close on the right, etc. We might call these systems adaptive systems. PID controllers are adaptive systems.</p>\n<p>One very powerful special case of adaptive system is a system whose behavior is determined by optimizing over an explicit internal simulation of its environment. This is how contemporary autonomous cars are actually built: we observe other vehicles on the road, then we search for a plan for how to behave for the next few seconds or minutes. Search means we consider many possible plans, and for each one we run a simulation of what would happen if we executed that plan: Would we hit another vehicle? Would we arrive at our destination? This search process is itself a feedback loop: we use some gradient descent or another optimization algorithm to set up a computation with a tendency to evolve towards a working plan, then we use this plan in an overarching feedback loop in which the physical car moves about, which affects other traffic on the road, which affects what we observe next, which affects the premises upon which we search for our next plan. We might call this a two-level adaptive system because the internal search has the characteristics of an adaptive system in its own right, as does the overarching vehicle/road system. Model-predictive control is a two-level adaptive system.</p>\n<p>As soon as we come to this multi-level setup we run into problems. We are running simulations of a world that will, in reality, be affected by the output of the simulation itself, since our car’s behavior is affected by the search over simulations, and the behavior of the other vehicles on the road is affected by our car’s behavior. So the situation is not at all so clear as running a simple roll-out of how the world will evolve for each possible action we might take. A great deal of MIRI’s research has highlighted ways that naive implementations of such two-level adaptive systems will fail.</p>\n<p>Now we made an assumption above that we had already factored the car’s cognition into perception and planning. But this factorization is actually quite a profound point. We could build an autonomous car algorithm that did not factor in this way. We would take in raw observations and store them to memory. Then we would run a search jointly over possible explanations of sensor data and possible plans of action. So nodes in our search would read as “perhaps there are vehicles here and here and we should do this”, “perhaps there is just one vehicle and we should do that”, and so on. We would evaluate each node based jointly on how well the hypothesis matches sensor data and how efficiently the plan achieves the goal of navigating to a destination. This would (1) force us to store all of our sensor data going back to the beginning of time, and (2) force us to consider a search space with size equal to the produce of the hypothesis and planning spaces, and (3) force us to re-do a lot of expensive perceptual calculations many times within the search.</p>\n<p>It is remarkable that, in general, it seems that agency can be factorized into perception and planning, at least in the context of two-level adaptive systems. Beliefs are in fact just epiphenomena of this factorization. Just as the singular value decomposition of a matrix produces two orthonormal matrices with a diagonal matrix squeezed in between, so too this perception/planning decomposition of agency produces two search algorithms (both of which are adaptive systems in their own right) with a set of beliefs squeezed in between.</p>\n<p>But we should remind ourselves that there are sophisticated systems outside of this paradigm of two-level adaptive systems. A tree does not operate based on a factorization of perception and planning, yet exhibits adaptive behavior with a level of sophistication and robustness unmatched by any machine humans have yet built. In fact a tree does not, so far as we know, run any kind of internal search process at all. Yet its behavior is strongly adaptive to its environment: if sunlight is blocked in one location then it will deprioritize growth in that location; if a limb is cut off then it will regrow; if its water source shifts then its root structure will adapt to that. We should not rashly dismiss trees as unsophisticated since we have not yet learned to produce machines of comparable sophistication or robustness.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Something that I've gotten a lot of value out of when learning many different things is to deliberately overcorrect when I notice I'm doing something the wrong way. For example, if I'm trying to hit the ball straight on a golf club, and I'm always hitting to the left, I make a deliberate effort to hit it to the right, rather than just trying to hit straight. Or if I'm speaking my lines too fast, I will slow down and try to speak them at 0.75x speed instead of just 1.0x speed.</p>\n<p>In these situations, what often ends up happening is that, instead of actually overcorrecting in the opposite direction, it turns out that the amount of effort I'm putting in to intentionally try and do the opposite thing is actually just about what's needed to make me hit the happy medium. If I had instead strove for just trying to reach the medium, I would likely still be biased in the same direction, but just less so.</p>\n<p>The other benefit is getting a feel for the entire range of motion / the entire action space. By default, I think I feel cautions to try and overcorrect or overextend. There's some part of me that thinks, \"Well, I'm already obviously biased towards X, why try and become biased towards not-X?\" There's some sort of fear there of \"Is trying to be extra wrong in the other direction even allowed?\" and some internal disdain, like \"I shouldn't try and intentionally do something <em>wrong</em>!\"</p>\n<p>But I think the right thing to do is to flip that gut feeling around–\"If I'm already biased towards X, then I already have a propensity for it. In that case, it makes really good sense to try and understand the things I'm not good at, which in this case is not-X!\" This is really good experiential knowledge from a purely exploratory standpoint, as well as from a skill gain perspective.</p>\n</body></html>",

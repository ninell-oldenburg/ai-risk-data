My take:</p><p>A single architecture that can handle both the games that require significant exploration, and the games that require long-term credit assignment, and the 'easy' games, without tricks or expert performance, seems like an achievement to me. The main question then becomes \"does it scale out of the simulator to problems we care about more than Atari?\"</p><p>What does it use? It looks like it's a lot of 'engineering improvements' and data. That is, lots of approaches will have tons of small components that are set to some simple default. You need to explore, so you use the simplest possible method of exploration, which is every action you roll a die and epsilon percent of the time you take a random action. Of course you could do better if you thought about it more, but there are many places like that in the code, and 'thinking about it more' requires both developer effort and compute (which, since the efficiency of the whole thing depends on how much compute it can spend, might mean you're spending dollars to earn cents if you use a fancy method where a simple one would do).</p><p>That is, this doesn't look like a radical new competitor to DQN; this looks like DQN after five years of iteration and testing, where some defaults are swapped to fancier settings and others aren't, and thus is updating me a little upward on the importance of engineering and data as an input factor.</p><p>They say this isn't the end of Atari research:</p><blockquote><p>This by no means marks the end of Atari research, not only in terms of data efficiency, but also in terms of general performance. We offer two views on this: firstly, analyzing the performance among percentiles gives us new insights on how general algorithms are. While Agent57 achieves strong results on the first percentiles of the 57 games and holds better mean and median performance than NGU or R2D2, as illustrated by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265\">MuZero</a>, it could still obtain a higher average performance. Secondly, all current algorithms are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04683\">far from achieving optimal performance</a> in some games. To that end, key improvements to use might be enhancements in the representations that Agent57 uses for exploration, planning, and credit assignment.</p></blockquote></body></html>",

I find this question interesting in its own right, but it&apos;s also an opportunity to dig into the nitty-gritty of producing something, which I wish happened more on LessWrong. I don&apos;t expect this to lead directly to a vaccine facility coming into existence- presumably the people who have the power to do that already have access to the knowledge as well- but I think it&apos;s a useful exercise in how things actually get done.</p><p>To recap, David&apos;s argument as I understand it is:</p><ul><li>The world is under-capacity for vaccines as it is</li><li>Building a vaccine production facility takes a lot of time and money, so we need to start funding and building them now to have them ready when we have candidates ready.</li><li>We&apos;re likely to want to mass-produce multiple vaccines until we know which ones work the best, increasing the amount of capacity needed.</li></ul><p>There&apos;s already a great discussion of this in the replies to his thread, and I encourage you to read it before commenting here. Some questions that came up in that discussion:</p><ul><li>Is there such a thing as a generic vaccine production facility, or do different vaccines require different facilities?</li><li>What raw materials (e.g. sterile eggs) are we also likely to need large quantities of, and should perhaps start sourcing now?</li></ul><p>Some additional questions I have are:</p><ul><li>Are there costs besides the obvious financial ones to building these facilities ahead of time? Are they competing for a resource we need more elsewhere?</li><li>Who does have the power and knowledge to make these facilities?</li><li>What are some historical equivalents?</li></ul>",

Jumping onto something\ninvolves both moving and jumping at the same time, which was tricky.\nEven just our second time playing she had that better, but precise\nmovement is still at the edge of what she can do.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lily-anna-cloudy-ps3-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lily-anna-cloudy-ps3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/lily-anna-cloudy-ps3.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/lily-anna-cloudy-ps3-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnna understands how the controller works, but doesn't have good\nenough command over her fingers to reliably get it to do what she\nwants.  She can make her character go in her chosen direction more\noften than not, but if she's going for any sort of target she usually\novershoots it.  Some getting frustrated and just pressing buttons\nrandomly.  I think I should play a few more games with just Anna,\nbecause when Lily's playing she often just watches her instead of\nfiguring out how to move her own character.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe game has a main character and a sidekick, but they can do all the\nsame things.  The difference is that if the two go off in different\ndirections the camera follows the main character and the sidekick gets\nteleported back into view.  There's nothing the sidekick can do to\naccidentally impede progress.  This works very well for two kids where\none mostly understands the game and the other is tagging along.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe characters can die, but death doesn't matter very much.  If you\nfall in the water or spend too long walking through hot chili you fall\nover dramatically but then pop back up again next to the other\nplayer.  If both players die at once you start a bit farther back, but\nnot much.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThere's a small amount of violence, like little gummy bears who pounce\non you, and you do chop them or pour hot coffee on them, but it's\nlight and cartoony enough that I'm not really worried about it.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSo far Lily and Anna have played with me kibitzing, I've played with\neach of them individually, and ~5d in they just tried playing together\nwithout me.  They've played about half an hour a day each day since we\ngot it, and would be enthusiastic about playing longer if we let them.\nIt's a very silly game, but it's at a good level for them in that\nthere's nothing you need to do that's very hard and the stakes are\nsuper low throughout.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100151759749082\">facebook</a></i></p>",

For example, they help me introduce and discuss a problem for AI safety proposals having to do with aligned AIs being outcompeted by unaligned AIs. </p><h2>Distinguishing three kinds of competitiveness and competition</h2><p>A system is <em>performance-competitive</em> insofar as its ability to perform relevant tasks compares with competing systems. If it is better than any competing system at the relevant tasks, it is very performance-competitive. If it is almost as good as the best competing system, it is less performance-competitive. <br></p><p>(For AI in particular, &#x201C;speed&#x201D; &#x201C;quality&#x201D; and &#x201C;collective&#x201D; intelligence as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/semvkn56ZFcXBNc2d/superintelligence-5-forms-of-superintelligence\">Bostrom defines them</a> all contribute to performance-competitiveness.)<br></p><p>A system is <em>cost-competitive</em> to the extent that it costs less to build and/or operate than its competitors. If it is more expensive, it is less cost-competitive, and if it is much more expensive, it is not at all cost-competitive. <br></p><p>A system is <em>date-competitive</em> to the extent that it can be created sooner (or not much later than) its competitors. If it can only be created after a prohibitive delay, it is not at all date-competitive. <br></p><p>A <em>performance competition </em>is a competition that performance-competitiveness helps you win. The more important performance-competitiveness is to winning, the more intense the performance competition is.<br></p><p>Likewise for cost and date competitions. Most competitions are all three types, to varying degrees. Some competitions are none of the types; e.g. a &#x201C;competition&#x201D; where the winner is chosen randomly. <br></p><p>I briefly searched the AI alignment forum for uses of the word &#x201C;competitive.&#x201D; It seems that when people talk about competitiveness of AI systems, they <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/H5gXpFtg93qDMZ6Xn/aligning-a-toy-model-of-optimization#oGdcKrWwPfwGzXNjT\">usually</a> mean performance-competitiveness, but <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5Kv2qNfRyXXihNrx2/ai-safety-debate-and-its-applications\">sometimes</a> mean cost-competitiveness, and <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZHXutm7KpoWEj9G2s/an-unaligned-benchmark\">sometimes</a> both at once. Meanwhile, I suspect that <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/prosaic-ai-control-b959644d79c2\">this important post</a> can be summarized as &#x201C;We should do prosaic AI alignment in case only prosaic AI is date-competitive.&#x201D;</p><h2>Putting these distinctions to work</h2><p>First, I&#x2019;ll sketch some different future scenarios. Then I&#x2019;ll sketch how different AI safety schemes might be more or less viable depending on which scenario occurs. For me at least, having these distinctions handy makes this stuff easier to think and talk about.<br></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The three scenarios I sketch aren&#x2019;t supposed to represent the scenarios I think most likely; similarly, my comments on the three safety proposals are mere hot takes. I&#x2019;m just trying to illustrate how these distinctions can be used.</em><br></p><p><strong>Scenario: FOOM: </strong>There is a level of performance which leads to a localized FOOM, i.e. very rapid gains in performance combined with very rapid drops in cost, all within a single AI system (or family of systems in a single AI lab). Moreover, these gains &amp; drops are enough to give decisive strategic advantage to the faction that benefits from them. Thus, in this scenario, <em>control over the future is mostly a date competition.</em> If there are two competing AI projects, and one project is building a system which is twice as capable and half the price but takes 100 days longer to build, <em>that project will lose</em>.<br></p><p><strong>Scenario: Gradual Economic Takeover: </strong>The world economy gradually accelerates over several decades, and becomes increasingly dominated by billions of AGI agents. However, no one entity (AI or human, individual or group) has most of the power. In this scenario,<em> control over the future is mostly a cost and performance competition.</em> The values which shape the future will be the values of the bulk of the economy, and that in turn will be the values of the most popular and successful AGI designs, which in turn will be the designs that have the best combination of performance- and cost-competitiveness. Date-competitiveness is mostly irrelevant.<br></p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> <strong>Final Conflict: </strong>It&#x2019;s just like the Gradual Economic Takeover scenario, except that several powerful factions are maneuvering and scheming against each other, in a Final Conflict to decide the fate of the world. This Final Conflict takes almost a decade, and mostly involves &#x201C;cold&#x201D; warfare, propaganda, coalition-building, alliance-breaking, and that sort of thing. Importantly, the victor in this conflict will be determined not so much by economic might as by clever strategy; a less well resourced faction that is nevertheless more far-sighted and strategic will gradually undermine and overtake a larger/richer but more dysfunctional faction. In this context, having the most<em> capable </em>AI advisors is of the utmost importance; having your AIs be cheap is much less important. In this scenario,<em> control of the future is mostly a performance competition.</em> (Meanwhile, in this same scenario, popularity in the wider economy is a moderately intense competition of all three kinds.)<br></p><p><strong>Proposal: <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5eX8ko7GCxwR5N9mN/what-is-ambitious-value-learning\">Value Learning</a>: </strong>By this I mean schemes that take state-of-the-art AIs and train them to have human values. I currently think of these schemes as not very date-competitive, but pretty cost-competitive and very performance-competitive. I say value learning isn&#x2019;t date-competitive because my impression is that it is probably harder to get right, and thus slower to get working, than other alignment proposals. Value learning would be better for the gradual economic takeover scenario because the world will change slowly, so we can afford to spend the time necessary to get it right, and once we do it&#x2019;ll be a nice add-on to the existing state-of-the-art systems that won&#x2019;t sacrifice much cost or performance.<br></p><p><strong>Proposal: <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-157debfd1616\">Iterated Distillation and Amplification:</a></strong> By this I mean&#x2026; well, it&#x2019;s hard to summarize. It involves training AIs to imitate humans, and then scaling them up until they are arbitrarily powerful while still human-aligned. I currently think of this scheme as decently date-competitive but not as cost-competitive or performance-competitive. But lack of performance-competitiveness isn&#x2019;t a problem in the FOOM scenario because IDA is above the threshold needed to go FOOM; similarly, lack of cost-competitiveness is only a minor problem because if they don&#x2019;t have enough money already, the first project to build FOOM-capable AI will probably be able to attract a ton of investment (e.g. via being nationalized) without even using their AI for anything, and then reinvest that investment into paying the extra cost of aligning it via IDA.<br></p><p><strong>Proposal: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-side-effects-e1ac80ea6107\">Impact regularization:</a></strong> By this I mean attempts to modify state-of-the-art AI designs so that they deliberately avoid having a big impact on the world. I think of this scheme as being cost-competitive and fairly date-competitive. I think of it as being performance-uncompetitive in some competitions, but performance-competitive in others. In particular, I suspect it would be very performance-uncompetitive in the Final Conflict scenario (because AI advisors of world leaders need to be impactful to do anything), yet nevertheless performance-competitive in the Gradual Economic Takeover scenario.<br></p><h2>Putting these distinctions to work again</h2><p>I came up with these distinctions because they helped me puzzle through the following problem:<br></p><blockquote>Lots of people worry that in a vastly multipolar, hypercompetitive AI economy (such as described in Hanson&#x2019;s <em>Age of Em </em>or Bostrom&#x2019;s &#x201C;Disneyland without children&#x201D; scenario) eventually pretty much everything of merely intrinsic value will be stripped away from the economy; the world will be dominated by hyper-efficient self-replicators various kinds, performing their roles in the economy very well and seeking out new roles to populate but not spending any time on art, philosophy, leisure, etc. Some value might remain, but the overall situation will be Malthusian. <br>Well, why not apply this reasoning more broadly? Shouldn&#x2019;t we be pessimistic about <em>any </em>AI alignment proposal that involves using aligned AI to compete with unaligned AIs? After all, at least one of the unaligned AIs will be willing to cut various ethical corners that the aligned AIs won&#x2019;t, and this will give it an advantage.</blockquote><p>This problem is more serious the more the competition is cost-intensive and performance-intensive. Sacrificing things humans value is likely to lead to cost- and performance-competitiveness gains, so the more intense the competition is in those ways, the worse our outlook is.<br></p><p>However, it&#x2019;s plausible that the gains from such sacrifices are small. If so, we need only worry in scenarios of extremely intense cost and performance competition.<br></p><p>Moreover, the extent to which the competition is date-intensive seems relevant. Optimizing away things humans value, and gradually outcompeting systems which didn&#x2019;t do that, takes time. And plausibly, scenarios which are not at all date competitions are also very intense performance and cost competitions. (Given enough time, lots of different designs will appear, and minor differences in performance and cost will have time to overcome differences in luck.) On the other hand, aligning AI systems might take time too, so if the competition is <em>too </em>date-intensive things look grim also. Perhaps we should hope for a scenario in between, where control of the future is a moderate date competition.<br></p><h2>Concluding thoughts</h2><p>These distinctions seem to have been useful for me. However, I could be overestimating their usefulness. Time will tell; we shall see if others make use of them.<br></p><p>If you think they would be better if the definitions were rebranded or modified, now would be a good time to say so! I currently expect that a year from now my opinions on which phrasings and definitions are most useful will have evolved. If so, I&apos;ll come back and update this post.<br></p><br><p><em>Thanks to Katja Grace and Ben Pace for comments on a draft.</em></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<h2><em>1. Introduction</em></h2><p>This post outlines two models from the social epistemology of science explaining the emergence of the a particular openness norm within the sciences, and then looks at how such models can be utilised to understand research groups trying to develop AGI. In the rest of the introduction, I will try to provide some motivation for this post. Sections 2 &amp; 3 will briefly outline the two models I&apos;m looking at. Section 4 more directly tries to interpret such models in the context of AGI development. Section 5 concludes. </p><p>The social epistemology of science is an interdisciplinary subfield at the intersection of philosophy and economics, which utilises formal models to understand the incentive structure of science. Here, I focus on two models from this area which try to explain the emergence of one particular openness norm: the so-called &#x2018;communist norm&#x2019; in scientific research.  The communist norm is a norm to share all &#x2018;substantive findings&#x2019; with the scientific community. The existence of this norm seems to be taken for granted in this literature, although the best piece of evidence I can find for its existence comes from <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/27857685.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A3c373ac90ab40a2c1f0f162c4da8e04e\">Louis et. al (2001)</a>, who find, in a sample of nearly 2,000 geneticists, that 91% agree that one <em>should</em> share all of one&apos;s relevant data. I nevertheless take it for granted in this post.</p><p>I wanted to see whether understanding the emergence of the communist norm in science could be important for understanding the development of AGI. In many ways, one might think the incentive structures around the development of AGI (will, or does) parallel the incentive structures of academic science. Thus, one might think that looking at the incentive structures behind scientific research are a good starting point for looking at the incentive structures surrounding the development of AGI. </p><p>As the communist norm emerged in science, one can imagine the emergence of a similar &#x2018;communist norm&#x2019; across research groups involved in AGI development, where research groups share all relevant research with one another. In the context of AGI, one might worry that sharing <em>all </em>research would speed up development alongside safety, potentially leading to a suboptimal scenario where capabilities improve faster than safety. If the incentive structures surrounding the development of AGI are appropriately similar to the incentive structures of science, then the models offered by Heesen and Strevens<strong> </strong>give different analyses of what we should expect among research groups trying to build AGI. </p><p>In the end, I tentatively conclude that Strevens&apos; model is likely to be more useful for modelling AGI development races, and suggest that a social contract where AGI developers agree to share all safety-relevant information is incentive-compatible.  </p><h2><em>2.  Strevens&#x2019; Paper: The Communist Norm and The Social Contract</em></h2><p>Strevens aims to provide a &#x2018;Hobbesian vindication&#x2019; of the communist norm in science, assuming self-interested, credit-maximising scientists. That is, his paper aims to provide the following:</p><ul><li>A transformation of the communist norm into a social contract which behaviourally mirrors the norm.</li><li>A rationale for signing the social contract.</li></ul><p>Strevens&#x2019;

This is true whether the model involves a single time-period, or extended to involve a multiple-stage model of discovery (<a href=\"http://www.strevens.org/research/scistruc/Communicans.pdf#page=35\">Strevens 2017, Section 6</a>). </p><p>Strevens supplements his formal model with informal argumentation. In his model, Strevens shows that self-interested scientists should see positive value in sharing all information. This is because each program&apos;s probability of making the discovery increases through mutual information exchange, while not changing a program&apos;s race-clinching probability. Each program faces an increase in its discovery probability, while the probability that<em> no one</em> makes the discovery goes down.   </p><p>However, the results of his model do not show that sharing all information is uniquely optimal, rather than (for example) a system that asks higher-powered programs to share more information. Strevens anticipates this objection, arguing that there are only a small number of practical contracts which could be &#x2018;implemented at a reasonable cost given the scale&#x2019;, and claims that: (a) sharing everything is better than sharing nothing, and (b) contracts which are more complicated (e.g., share equal amounts of information) are less likely to be implemented given their practical costs (such as deciding what counts as an appropriate unit of information).</p><p>From the conjunction of his formal results and informal reasoning, Strevens thinks he has thereby shown that self-interested scientists have an incentive to sign a contract pledging them to share all information.</p><h2><em>3. Heesen&#x2019;s Paper: Communism and The Incentive to Share</em></h2><p>Heesen offers a game-theoretic model of sharing in science, called &#x2018;The Intermediate Results Game&#x2019;. In this model, an intermediate stage is any stage of a research project which, when completed, allows for a publishable result, and hence to some amount of credit for the scientist.</p><p>We assume <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"n \\geq 2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">n</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">&#x2265;</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span> scientists compete to complete a research project, which has <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"k\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">k</span></span></span></span></span></span> intermediate stages.

Thus, from Heesen&#x2019;s model we get the following conclusion: scientists have a credit incentive to share intermediate results, even though holding onto results allows one to have an advantage on completing the next research project. The conclusion of this model is therefore (at least in its original context) fairly optimistic: under a wide variety of situations, we do not need additional enforcement mechanisms to encourage scientific sharing, as that is what we should expect by default from rational, credit-maximising scientists.  </p><h2><em>4. Heesen, Strevens, and AGI Development</em></h2><p>We now look at how these models can be used to model AGI development races, and raise questions about the extent to which such models can be used for this purpose.</p><p><em>4.1. Heesen&#x2019;s Model</em></p><p>In Heesen&#x2019;s model, the two theorems we looked at made use of the assumption that credit for each stage is proportional to its difficulty, or earlier stages are awarded more credit than later ones relative to their difficulty. I think this assumption is likely to fail in AGI development, where there is likely to be a particularly large benefit in being the team who completes the final step. </p><p>The failure of Assumption 1 is most obvious in hard takeoff scenarios, where one final insight leads to a large qualitative leap in intelligence. In this case, the &#x2018;scientist&#x2019; (or, likely, research team in our scenario) who finished the last stage would get a huge share of the overall value, by being the research team who creates the AGI. This <em>may</em> be because the final step is more difficult, but there is no guarantee that this will be true. It is also plausible that Assumption 1 would fail in a variety of soft takeoff scenarios. Even under soft takeoff scenarios, it seems plausible to expect most of the value (or &apos;credit&apos; in the original model) to be captured towards the end of the research project, as capabilities continue improving. That alone would also be enough to falsify Assumption 1, as teams who complete later stages would gain a disproportionate share of overall value, purely because such stages are later (and not because they are more difficult). I thus think there are good reasons to believe that, in the context of AGI development, we would not expect sharing by default. </p><p>The failure of Heesen&#x2019;s model to apply to many cases of interest might be seen as positive, if we were initially worried that something like the communist norm naturally emerging in scenarios where credit was awarded for intermediate results. Obtaining credit for intermediate results seems plausible in the context of developing AGI, where, presumably, one would gain some level of outside prestige by through the contribution of (for example) novel mathematical results along the way to developing AGI. However, the failure of Heesen&apos;s model to be useful for (a sufficiently wide variety of) our purposes is likely to mean that, if we want to incentivise the sharing of safety techniques, we cannot expect this to emerge by default. The need to work on proposals to properly incentivise safety is (for most of us) unsurprising.  </p><p><em>4.2. Strevens&#x2019; Model</em></p><p>Like Heesen&#x2019;s model, some assumptions only questionably carry over to the case of AGI development: I focus here on the structure Strevens thinks information sharing should take: crucially, under Strevens&apos; model, race-clinching probabilities are changed under information sharing, on the condition that information sharing compresses or advances one program&#x2019;s discovery density more than another&#x2019;s. In other words, Strevens&apos; main result (that information sharing leaves race-clinching probabilities unchanged) fails to hold when information sharing unequally speeds up one research program&apos;s discovery density relative to another&apos;s.</p><p>In the context of AGI development, it seems plausible that one research program is likely to gain more from an information exchange than another. However, one might think that, even if this is true, each research program will, <em>ex ante</em>, have no reason to think they are the high-powered research program. Anecdotally, I think this is somewhat implausible. I imagine that successful groups tend to be lead by those who believe that they are more likely to succeed than average, and so a contract which relies on actively <em>not</em> believing that seems unlikely to emerge naturally.  </p><p>I think the considerations above undercut the case for the communist norm emerging as a game-theoretic equilibrium in the case of AGI development, or as a contract independently drawn up by AGI developers. I do not think this conclusion should bother us too much, as it is (at best) dubious as to whether total information sharing would be socially optimal, given that total information sharing would also be likely to speed up the development of AI capabilities. </p><p>However, I don&#x2019;t think my above criticisms of Strevens&apos; model threaten the attractiveness of a contracted commitment to share all safety-relevant information. This would be a <em>local</em> version of the communist norm, rather than (as is allegedly the case in science) a <em>global</em> version of the communist norm. While some exchanges of &#x2018;safety-relevant information&#x2019; might help another team improve their capabilities (hence changing the race-clinching probabilities), it seems unlikely that any research team would believe that sharing only information relevant to safety is likely to alter their <em>ex ante</em> estimates of the relative race-clinching probabilities. Assuming each research group has strictly positive concern for safety, each research team will be incentivised to commit to a safety-specific communist norm.</p><p>Strevens&apos; model licenses a further optimistic conclusion concerning the development of AI <em>capabilities </em>relative to safety; if developers signed a contract to share all safety relevant information, then, as sharing information does not (in general) maximise credit, we should be less concerned that developers will, of their own accord, decide to engage in a process of free information sharing about non-safety relevant information. Although there were doubts about other parts of Strevens&#x2019; model, the basic setup as a prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma seems to better capture the case of AGI development than Heesen&#x2019;s model. </p><p>If I am right in my interpretation of Strevens&#x2019; model, then there are still possible situations under which research teams would be incentivised to renege on their promises, such as a case where sharing relevant safety information involves something which would improve the capabilities of another team, making it comparatively less likely that they will be the first to develop AGI. The possibility of such cases speaks to the need to look for mechanisms to effectively enforce adherence to a contract committed to sharing all safety-relevant information, or (potentially) further research on robust mechanisms of cooperation. </p><p>One possible enforcement mechanism would be to have firms commit to an <u><a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/01/honest-organizations/\">underlined public statement</a></u>, as discussed by Christiano. If firms all signed a contract agreeing to have such a public statement (including statements about commitments to share all relevant safety information), then this might provide a way of easily enforcing commitment without the need for resource-intensive outside policing.</p><h2><em>5. Conclusions and Further Caveats</em></h2><p>Looking at these two models has given me some insight into AGI development races. In particular, I feel like I am now more confident in the following claims:</p><ul><li>An unrestricted version of the communist norm is unlikely to emerge endogenously in the course of AGI development.</li><li>A contract whereby all AGI developers agree to sign a pledge to share all safety relevant information is incentive compatible.</li></ul><p>I am unsure whether such claims were obvious to those more familiar with literature on macrostrategy. I would thus be thankful to commenters who can point out examples of these claims in the existing macrostrategy literature. Moreover, I should stress that, although such updates are positive, such views are still reasonably tentative.</p><p>I end with a caveat. This piece has discussed a variant of the &#x2018;communist norm&#x2019; applied to the development of AGI. I have suggested that the emergence of something like the communist norm in science (that is, the existence of a norm to share <em>all </em>relevant data) could be bad, but have mostly uncritically suggested that we could implement a safety-specific communist norm, where competing developers have to share all information relevant to <em>safety research</em>. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m saying anything too controversial here: as Bostrom (2017) says, &#x2018;<a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/openness.pdf\">openness about values, goals, and governance structures is generally welcome</a>&#x2019;. </p><p>That said, I feel compelled to mention that there is at least some tentative evidence that, among some network structures, less information can be better. For instance, Zollman (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/525605?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\">2007</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fitelson.org/few/few_07/zollman.pdf\">2010</a>) finds that, among rational Bayesian agents who communicate with each other on a network structure, sparsely connected networks can sometimes epistemically outperform more densely connected networks. While I am not convinced that such results are sufficiently robust to changes in parameter values (see, for example, (<a href=\"http://cailinoconnor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/In_Epistemic_Networks_Is_Less_Really_Mor-FINAL-VERSION.pdf\">Rosenstock et. al 2017</a>)), a review of related results would be useful, before committing to a contract to share all safety-relevant information. </p>",

Fortunately, it&apos;s not fair to ask you to meet it.</p><p>After all, you&apos;re not perfectly altruistic, and the other parts get to bargain too.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>In <a href=\"https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/qw3Z79HELMsmLkL9F/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable\">Nobody Is Perfect, Everything Is Commensurable</a>, Scott suggests that we deal with scrupulosity by letting ourselves be okay with the standard of giving 10% of our output to the most effective charitable causes. He runs into a bit of a problem when dealing with the fact that people are in different places in their careers (and that a tenth of one&apos;s income can be a large or small chunk of one&apos;s disposable income), and punts on the question a bit:</p><blockquote>If you make $30,000 and you accept 10% as a good standard you want to live up to, you can either donate $3000 to charity, or participate in political protests until your number of lives or dollars or DALYs saved is equivalent to that.</blockquote><p>I think this is the right place to introduce the alien gamer roleplaying your character. Are you building intangible expertise or career capital? Gurgeh notices the high payoff in later rounds of the game from these resources, and would be happy to forgo a little more short-term impact if your time/money/attention can translate into those resources more effectively. Are you torn between multiple opportunities to do good? Gurgeh checks once to see if there&apos;s a synergy between them (a way to get a higher combined total than he would optimizing for either alone), and if not, he ruthlessly picks the one that translates more efficiently into points, and doesn&apos;t feel bad about leaving behind a less efficient path.</p><p>So here&apos;s my suggestion:</p><p><strong>Figure out the expected score that you&apos;d actually expect Gurgeh to get in &quot;The Altruistic You Experience&quot;, then consider ways to <em>achieve at least one-tenth of that score</em>, and let <em>that</em> be your target for moral achievement.</strong></p><p>This is still a really high standard, one that few achieve! It almost surely isn&apos;t enough to take your default path in life while giving even 50% of your income to the best charity. It may require you to change your career, your social circles, your everyday habits. It may ask you to do lots of self-experimentation, with the corresponding expectation of frequent failure.</p><p>But it at least leaves more slack for your own flourishing than attempting to achieve the altruistic high score. It lets you seek a way of achieving excellence that satisfies your other wants and needs well. Maybe you don&apos;t take your altruistic best option if your second best is much more personally fulfilling; maybe you go ahead and splurge on something big every now and then. But you don&apos;t lose sight of your aspiration.</p><p>I just want to emphasize:</p><p>It&apos;s okay to give yourself more happiness and more leisure than you need in order to be effective. It&apos;s okay to care about your own well-being, and that of your family and friends, than that of strangers in far-off lands or times.</p><p><strong>It&apos;s okay to be mostly selfish. Just be <em>strategic</em> about the altruistic part.</strong></p>",

But the possibility of imminent apocalypse seemed plausible enough and important enough that I decided to prioritize investigating AGI timelines over trying to strike gold. I left the VC-backed startup I&apos;d cofounded, and went around talking to every smart and sensible person I could find who seemed to have opinions about when humanity would develop AGI.</p><p>My biggest takeaways after 3 years might be disappointing -- I don&apos;t think the considerations currently available to us point to any decisive conclusion one way or another, and I don&apos;t think anybody really knows when AGI is coming. At the very least, the fields of knowledge that I think bear on AGI forecasting (including deep learning, predictive coding, and comparative neuroanatomy) are disparate, and I don&apos;t know of any careful and measured thinkers with all the relevant expertise.</p><p>That being said, I did manage to identify a handful of background variables that consistently play significant roles in informing people&apos;s intuitive estimates of when we&apos;ll get to AGI. In other words, people would often tell me that their estimates of AGI timelines would significantly change if their views on one of these background variables changed.</p><p>I&apos;ve put together a framework for understanding AGI timelines based on these background variables. Among all the frameworks for AGI timelines I&apos;ve encountered, it&apos;s the framework that most comprehensively enumerates crucial considerations for AGI timelines, and it&apos;s the framework that best explains how smart and sensible people might arrive at vastly different views on AGI timelines.</p><p>Over the course of the next few weeks, I&apos;ll publish a series of posts about these background variables and some considerations that shed light on what their values are. I&apos;ll conclude by describing my framework for how they come together to explain various overall viewpoints on AGI timelines, depending on different prior assumptions on the values of these variables.</p><p>By trade, I&apos;m a math competition junkie, an entrepreneur, and a hippie.

A newly forged sword is ductile and tough. Then you bash the outgroup on the head with it and every bash creates a stress point in the sword: some part is bent, or stretched, or slightly cracked. Even elastic metal can&#x2019;t spring back perfectly to it&#x2019;s original shape, and the sword becomes brittle and stiff. To restore it, you heat the metal to the point where its microstructure breaks down, then let it slowly cool and crystallize into stable unstressed patterns again.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/heat-treating-hamon-sword-knife.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:98%\"></figure></span><p>Johnson, building on the work of Robin Carhart-Harris and others, proposes that the same process applies to brains. In the <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/\">predictive processing paradigm</a>, the brain starts a cycle from a stable state: neural activity is <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/12/11/predictable-identities-22-the-entropic-brain/\">low-entropy</a> and proceeds in fixed patterns. From the inside, this feels like confidence in your models of the world, and consistent affect in your reaction to things.</p><p>As more input comes in, the brain accumulates stress in the form of prediction errors. This manifests as confusion, anxiety, or unease: a person who reacted unexpectedly to something you said, news that upset you, an action that failed to achieve it&#x2019;s intended consequences.</p><p>An ideal Bayesian brain would immediately update all of its model in light of every new bit of information, but our brains cannot physiologically do that. The stress of prediction error accumulates in the form of electrical energy in particular neural circuits, but can&#x2019;t propagate everywhere (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq\">or even reach consciousness</a>) until it crosses a particular threshold of excitation. Your conscious and unconscious models of reality live in silos with their own accumulated errors, separated from the rest of the brain by potential energy barriers (Scott Alexander calls them <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/26/mental-mountains/\">mental mountains</a>).</p><p>To update, your brain needs to&#xA0;<em>heat up</em>, to build up too much energy at once to route through the habitual <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/11/20/predictable-identities-21-enlightenment/\">circuits of thought</a>. Meditation and psychedelics are powerful tools for achieving that, but anything that fills your brain with new and unusual inputs can do the trick like a retreat into the woods or &#x201C;mindblowing&#x201D; sex. From the inside, a brain pumped full of entropy feels like a trip: unusual and novel thoughts without strong affect, creative excitement, or nothing at all if your mind is too chaotic to make any sense of it at all.</p><p>Once past a critical point, the mental mountains flatten out and all the modules of the brain can &#x201C;talk to each other&#x201D; and update at once. They can settle into a new equilibrium that would globally minimize the prediction errors accumulated so far and those expected in the future. This feels like insight or enlightenment, depending on the magnitude of the update.</p><h2>Curing Jealousy</h2><p>That was the theory, but I&#x2019;ve had some powerful first hand experience with the process as well.</p><p>When I first began experimenting with open relationships, I didn&#x2019;t think I was someone particularly immune to romantic or sexual jealousy. My partner at the time and I adopted a don&#x2019;t-ask-don&#x2019;t-tell policy. We treated jealousy as something to be circumvented, an ultimately useful emotion that needs to be suppressed in some novel contexts, similar to anger or fear. Even famous polyamory advocates like Geoffrey Miller carefully tiptoe around jealousy and <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2018/06/20/miller-3-polyamory-mating/#distract\">distract themselves with utilitarianism and TV</a>.</p><p>But as I read more books about evolutionary psychology, especially those by Geoffrey Miller himself, I began to question the utility of jealousy altogether in my life. Jealousy served the genes of my ancestors who needed to secure reproductive and resource exclusivity, considerations that aren&#x2019;t relevant in 2020 and for my actual well-being.</p><p>The two models of jealousy inhabited my brain simultaneously &#x2014; the evolved instinct to feel it, and the conscious idea that I&#x2019;d be happier without it. Both models were accumulating error signals: the latter every time my wife went out on a date and I felt anxious and jealous, the former every time she came back happy to see me again and not pregnant. I lived with this internal conflict for the seven years since my first open relationship.</p><p>And then, I went on a retreat in the woods with friends. I meditated, had sex, and took psychedelics. With my brain as full of entropy as it&#x2019;s ever been, I saw my wife cuddling with a male friend, both of them smiling at me. And I realized that the usual pang of jealousy that I expected to feel was completely gone, released like a muscle knot under massage.</p><p>I tried to summon the pro- and anti-jealousy parts of mind to hash their differences out in an <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2018/03/30/internal-diet-crux/\">internal double crux</a>, but I was past that point already. Only the unjealous part showed up. I spent seven years contemplating jealousy and seven hours neural annealing, and by the end of it the jealousy was gone and remained gone.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/terese-memorial-day.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:64%\"></figure></span><h1>Societal Annealing</h1><p>It&#x2019;s an irresistible temptation for anyone writing about neural annealing to apply the same model to society, particularly those coming from the view of an individual brain as comprising a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind\">society</a> of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip\">multiple agents</a>. Johnson writes about &#x201C;social annealing&#x201D; that happens in a shared context of religious service or sporting event. <a href=\"http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/71/3/316?fbclid=IwAR36UzFla5Lfx7-4LTr6R8N0XdUSOnbg3gnRPXn806cPKO7Zsas2EsJJhDs#sec-25\">Carhart-Harris and Friston</a> talk about psychedelics destabilizing social order and discomfiting the ruling elite in the same way they shake up the dominant thought patterns ruling the rigid brain.</p><p>The model, broadly speaking, is the same. Individuals in a society have their own worldviews and theories of reality, making their own individual predictions (implicit or explicit) and accumulating successes and errors. But in the normal course of things, good ideas don&#x2019;t propagate and bad ideas aren&#x2019;t dislodged very rapidly.</p><p>The world runs its course, people go to work and drink beer and watch TV regardless of the wrongness of prevailing ideologies. Almost everyone&#x2019;s lives is governed <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/\">not by physical reality but by the social reality</a> around them, and unlike physical reality which is one, there can be as many coexisting social realities as social groups willing to courteously ignore each other.</p><p>In our brains, conscious awareness <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory\">is the central stage</a> on which mental agents can broadcast their models to the mind at large. Communication between mental modules occurs outside of awareness as well, but in a much more limited capacity. In society, the spread and proliferation of ideas is controlled and gated by central sensemaking institutions: the government and mass media. In a world not constrained by physical reality, these institutions can spin narratives full of errors and contradictions that go unnoticed.</p><p>But once in a while, physical reality grabs the world by the shoulders and gives it a hard shake.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/global-covid-cases-march-26.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>In social-reality times, government can make bad policy, schools can teach bad ideas, newspapers can print nonsense, and they would not be found out for many years if at all. In an exponentially growing pandemic, bad policy and fake news get found out within days if not hours. Ideas that held center stage through sheer inertia and suppression get swept away by the tide, and smart ideas that were locked in a dark corner can spread and propagate at the speed of Twitter.</p><h2>Government</h2><p>No matter what happens in the news, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1242107268793065473\">a predictable consequence</a> is political ideologists of all stripes will claim that the latest thing is proof of their wisdom courage and a complete refutation of their opponents. Progressives and conservatives, statists and liberatarians, are equally convinced that COVID validates their ideology and supports their pet policy prescriptions.</p><p>But I think that more and more people are realizing that political ideology has very little to do with how the state is governed. Political parties are merely coalitions of convenience, and the response of elected officials has nothing to do with their team colors and everything to do with their personality and circumstance.</p><p>A Republican president just signed America&#x2019;s largest ever welfare bill, approved by a Republican senate. Their Democrat colleagues supported the travel restrictions and border closures. <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-andrew-cuomo-pro-life-hero-20200326-pbqsrz5ugrh6nht3xmgm3cbp5q-story.html\">The governor of New York</a> is deservedly getting praise for his decisive and informed action while <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/nevada-governor-bars-use-of-malaria-drug-for-coronavirus/\">the governor of Nevada</a> is deservedly getting shit for banning doctors from prescribing hydroxychloroquine &#x2014; they are both &#x201C;moderate Democrats&#x201D;, and that fact has zero bearing on their policy decisions.</p><p>The same is true on a global scale. Taiwan&#x2019;s response has been exemplary and Spain&#x2019;s abysmal; they are both democracies. Vietnam&#x2019;s single party has managed to contain the disease so far while Iran&#x2019;s single party is digging mass graves. Elected and unelected rulers are responding to the virus according to their whims, personal interests, whatever advice they may or may not be receiving, and circumstances that are mostly outside their control.</p><p>I hope that this will mark a reversal in partisan polarization, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/primalpoly/status/1243201521463902208\">a marginalization of partisans</a> who continue to twist everything into their pet causes. Inshallah we shall see an abatement of the culture wars as the nature of the crisis beclowns identity politics on both the right and the left. But some people have been making a living stoking the culture war flames, and I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re going to adjust well to a world of physical reality.</p><h2>Media</h2><p>While political ideology seems to matter little in how governments respond to a real crisis, the response by many media outlets showed that they contain little else.</p><p>Opinions of a given media outlet usually fall into two camps:</p><ol><li>They are good people who tell the truth.</li><li>They are bad people who lie for personal gain.</li></ol><p>This was my default implicit model&#xA0; &#x2014; I thought of the truth I would print if I was a journalist, and attributed the falsehoods I saw in print to dishonesty.</p><p>In early February, when &#x201C;prestige media&#x201D; were churning out daily misinformation about the virus, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/webdevMason/status/1226706896880455681\">Mason Hartman attributed their behavior</a> to camp #2. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1226707820659269633\">I noticed that I was confused</a>: wouldn&#x2019;t the personal gain come to the alarmists who get lucky?

They were written by people who don&#x2019;t know what truth is, who lost sight of the fact that reality exists and will pass judgment on their articles based on physical outcomes and not pure intentions.</p><p>They were written by people who don&#x2019;t have the intelligence and scientific literacy to comprehend the mathematics of exponential growth, the physics of droplets in the air and on fabric, the difference between a study failing to show significance for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1241216339261431808\">an intervention</a> because of a small sample size and a study &#x201C;disproving&#x201D; its effectiveness. These &#x201C;explainer&#x201D; articles are simply pattern-matching whatever news was printed elsewhere into a small set of affect-laden narrative templates: orange man &#x2013; bad, big government &#x2013; good, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/23/21191147/medical-masks-coronavirus-shortage-silicon-valley-donations-salesforce-apple-facebook-tesla\">Silicon Valley &#x2013; bad</a>. (Most major media outlets have stumbled onto <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/kelsey-piper\">at least a few people</a> who start from truth-seeking and not from narrative matching. I wonder how these writers are feeling about their &#x201C;colleagues&#x201D;.)</p><p>Most of these articles are neither truth nor lies, they have practically no information content aside from a few cherry-picked numbers floating free of context. You cannot learn anything by either taking Vox at face value or by flipping the affective sign on what they write. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qNZM3EGoE5ZeMdCRt/reversed-stupidity-is-not-intelligence\">You cannot reverse stupidity to produce intelligence</a>, which is another thing that a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1242917215801946112\">Vox correspondent is too stupid to understand</a>.</p><h2>Novel Sensemaking</h2><p>Coronavirus has broken sensemaking for a large chunk of society. Some people interpreted events outside their immediate lives through a lens of partisan ideology, but partisan ideology turned out to be little relevant to the crisis. Some people relied on explainer media, but explainer media turned out to do little more than dress up partisan ideology in prettier language. Some people ignored world events completely, but now world events are making their way into your city, your job, into your lungs.</p><p>And this is the blessing of the COVID disruption &#x2014; it&#x2019;s an opportunity to learn new ways of making sense of the world. We should do it the same way our brains do it, by seeing which models make correct predictions and which ones go wrong. The novelty of the situation and the speed of unfolding events have tightened the feedback loops between our beliefs and reality, and the internet allows us to update together without relying on central authorities.</p><p>This doesn&#x2019;t apply just to the virus itself. People are unlearning old ways of looking at education (was it just daycare all along?), the markets (aren&#x2019;t they supposed to be efficient?), and the actual economy (why can the US make space rockets but not paper masks?) People are learning new things about their families, friends, roommates, and landlords.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re feeling anxious and overwhelmed, that is a sign that the annealing has started. Old useless patterns have broken, entropy has replaced the semblance of order. But don&#x2019;t hide away from the confusion, use it to build new ways of understanding, alone and with people you trust.</p><p>Make predictions and track them, and make a note of when you were <a href=\"https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/\">right</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yashkaf/posts/10219467669335350\">wrong</a>. Track the implicit predictions made by others, and whether they admit their mistakes or refuse to update. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences\">Make beliefs pay rent</a>.</p><p>Give the <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Absurdity_heuristic\">absurdity heuristic</a> a rest &#x2014; the world is absurd. Downgrade credentials and titles, they are indicators of social reality. Recognize people who show tangible results, those come from physical reality.</p><p>And finally: meditate, have sex, work out, do drugs, whatever is available to you. Don&#x2019;t escape completely into Netflix and video games, artificial worlds designed by clever writers to be easily made sense of in predictable ways. Absorb information and let your brain anneal, then spread the word to others. The world is not any stranger today than it was a month ago. <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reality_is_normal\">Since the beginning not one unusual thing has ever happened</a>. It is only our minds that fell behind. Now is the time to catch up.</p>",

Of course, the recovered patients blood contains enough antibodys to make them immune, but I don&apos;t know how big an effect a fraction of the concentration would have. Of course given exponential growth rates, there might be far more critically ill patients than recovered patients.

At one end you're dancing to an\nentirely premixed track, while at the other all the sounds are\ntriggered in the moment by the musicians:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Fully pre-mixed: Lisa Greenleaf, Emily Rush (<a href=\"https://www.rushfestcontra.com/\">Rushfest</a>), and several\nother callers come to the dance with fully mixed-down recordings.\nSome \"DJ\"s are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCawU6BE8P8\">here</a>, doing all\ntheir composition ahead of time.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Mostly pre-mixed: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dJimproper/\">DJ Improper</a> and some\nother contra DJs prepare their sets in advance, but can remix them\nsome on the fly.  This is what a live DJ traditionally does.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Hybrid: Julie Vallimont's various bands [1], Phase X, and <a href=\"https://www.benjamindaysmith.com/dr-shadow-electro-contra\">D. R. Shadow</a>\ncombine live elements (fiddle, piano, jawharp, accordion, sax, banjo)\nwith loops, beats, samples, and mashups.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Live looping: Perpetual e-Motion would come in with nothing\npre-recorded, and would build up a complex texture with loops.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Fully live: this is mostly not a thing, though <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuKwcWR9sQg\">this</a> is close.\nIt's very hard to make the full sound of a modern electronic dance\ntrack with a reasonable number of live musicians.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nAnother axis of variation is originality, in the sense of \"from\nscratch\".  At one end you have music that is based around commercial\nrecordings, with edits, remixes and mashups, while at the other end\nyou have musicians writing their own music.  This is separate from the\nprevious axis: you can make pre-mixed tracks from club hits or your\nown compositions; you can play faithful pop covers live or figure out\nyour own arrangements.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nEven though it's separate, they do tend to go together: people who\nwork pre-mixed are mostly remixing and editing recordings, while\npeople who work hybrid, looped, or fully live are mostly making their\nown thing.  I've been thinking some about why.  Part of this is that\nthe easiest way to get started is to find existing recordings that <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/techno-contra-and-phrasing\">support the structure of the\ndance</a>, or make small edits to them to get it to fit.  The <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/instrument-complexity-and-automation\">tradeoff</a>, though,\nis that you have much less control.  You can very occasionally get\nmultitrack versions (\"stems\") of songs, but usually you have a\nfully-mixed track.  If you pick tracks you like this will sound good,\nbut you're at a bit of a musical local maximum.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOver time, as people get more experience, they tend to move farther\nalong the \"originality\" axis.  Comparing Vallimont's work in Double\nApex (2010-2012) vs <a href=\"https://buddysystemband.com/\">Buddy\nSystem</a> (2014-), or Jacoby's in Phase X (2012-2013) vs <a href=\"https://groundliftcontra.bandcamp.com/\">Ground Lift</a> (2019-),\nearlier work involved a lot of mashups but they've both moved on to a\n\"fully original\" approach.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWith <a href=\"https://www.kingfisherband.com/\">Kingfisher</a> and my\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/news/jammer\">rhythm stage setup</a> I've been exploring the\nedges of this from a live direction.  I want to keep the full control\nand ability to improvise that I have on the mandolin or piano, but\nwith the full sound of a large band or modern produced recording.\n(For example, here's something I was working on yesterday which is\nfully live and uses only my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKgaD3xSDIo\">feet and\nbreath</a>.)  Looking over what parts of the space have been explored\nor not and how that has gone is useful for figuring out what things I\nwant to try.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n[1] Double Apex with <a href=\"http://www.brendancareyblock.com/\">Brendan Carey Block</a>, <a href=\"http://andyreiner.nfshost.com/firecloud/Firecloud/About.html\">Firecloud</a>\nwith <a href=\"https://www.andyreiner.com/\">Andy Reiner</a>, Delta Wave\nwith <a href=\"http://joncannon.net/bands/\">Jon Cannon</a>, Cosmic Echo\nwith <a href=\"http://sopaudio.com/musician\">Ed Howe</a>, and <a href=\"https://buddysystemband.com/\">Buddy System</a> with Noah\nVanNorstrand.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100151516970612\">facebook</a></i></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>TL;DR: This is an argument that (1) Talking is a major way that COVID-19 transmits from person to person (at least when people aren't wearing facemasks and goggles, and possibly to a much lesser extent even if they are), right up there with coughing, and probably more important than touching contaminated surfaces; (2) The public is not generally aware of this, at least where I am; plus (3) Sketchy ideas for what to do about it.</p>\n<p><em>Epistemic status: Low confidence, open to criticism.</em></p>\n<h2>Background: Why think that talking (at least without facemasks) is a major transmission risk?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzARpgx8cvE\">This NIH video</a> shows how talking creates droplets and aerosols, just like coughing does, and strongly advocates that everyone should avoid face-to-face conversations. They also made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OSz5Gr7gG0\">a follow-up video</a> showing that facemasks help, even the kind of DIY facemask made from old T-shirts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html\">This CDC webpage</a> emphasizes respiratory droplets and avoiding close proximity, adding that \"contaminated surfaces or objects … [are] not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\" The <a href=\"https://medium.com/@balajis/the-official-chinese-government-guide-to-diagnosing-and-treating-the-novel-coronavirus-9d06868f8df4\">Chinese government guide</a> concurs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/commentary-covid-19-transmission-messages-should-hinge-science\">This article by a domain expert</a> argues that the main way people catch it is probably if someone is talking or coughing nearby, and agrees with the CDC that touching contaminated surfaces is probably less of a big deal, albeit with considerable uncertainty from the lack of data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(She gets really pedantic in arguing that we should use the terminology \"short-range aerosols\" for what's going on, while the CDC, WHO, and everyone else seems to call the same thing \"inhaled droplets\". I really don't care about the terminology. Everyone agrees about what's going on. But to be clear, the term \"aerosol\" usually refers to long-range aerosol transmission, like measles, and there seems to be a consensus that this type of traditional long-range aerosol transmission is <em>not</em> a major part of COVID-19 transmission, for reasons discussed <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/\">here</a>, including observations about who catches it from whom. (ETA: ok, maybe the word \"consensus\" is too strong, see <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00974-w\">here</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9GyKccaJdLEbdhyTi/a-significant-portion-of-covid-19-transmission-is\">As jimrandomh and others have argued</a>, there is a lot of asymptomatic transmission—so it’s not just people coughing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Super-spreader events seem to involve singing indoors and/or face-to-face conversations</h2>\n<p>Two known COVID-19 super-spreader events may have involved the infected person singing indoors for an extended period:</p>\n<p>First, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-usa-03-26#a-choir-group-had-60-people-show-up-for-practice-now-45-are-sick\">the Skagit Valley Chorale case</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...The virus has devastated the Skagit Valley Chorale, based in the rural valley north of Seattle... Of the 60 people who attended a March 10 practice, 45 have developed symptoms and 27 so far have tested positive, officials said. One of the group’s members has died, another has been hospitalized and others have struggled to overcome their illness.</p>\n<p>Ruth Backlund, a co-president at the Skagit Valley Chorale, said the group was monitoring public health guidelines at the time of the practice and had asked people to stay home if they showed even minor signs of illness. The group gathered in rows facing a piano and a choir director. They were all in individual chairs and had space to keep separated. Ms. Backlund had made sure there were extra soap dispensers in the bathrooms for people to wash their hands.</p>\n<p>\"Nobody was sick. Nobody touched anybody. Nobody shook hands. Nobody hugged everybody like you might do in a group. There was none of that,\" Ms. Backlund said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Second, maybe the case of the Shincheonji religious sect in South Korea. I don't know the details, but in general, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-21/in-south-korea-an-opaque-sect-draws-scrutiny-with-virus-spike\">\"Attendants remain seated on their knees throughout the service, chanting Amen and singing en mass\"</a>.</p>\n<p>Other super-spreader events seem to be consistent with face-to-face conversations with asymptomatic individuals:</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/coronavirus-westport-connecticut-party-zero.html\">Connecticut party</a> presumably involved face-to-face conversations, though it seems that few details have been published. The infected person is said to have been asymptomatic.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/27/nation/realities-coronavirus-super-spreading/\">Boston Biogen Conference</a> involved people milling around with hors d’oeuvres and drinks—again, presumably consistent with spread by face-to-face conversation. It seems that nobody was coughing there, though I could be wrong.</p>\n<h2>What can we do?</h2>\n<p>I think public health messaging has not gotten through about this. I propose a motto / meme:</p>\n<p><em><strong>When someone talks to you, they're spitting on your face!</strong></em></p>\n<p>This message would help people understand viscerally why they're being asked to stay 2 meters apart. It would also help people understand viscerally why people are telling them to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1242894378441506816?s=19\">make and wear DIY facemasks &amp; goggles</a>. (I just made myself a mask yesterday!)</p>\n<p>Beyond that, awareness by itself would be really valuable in directing people's decisions and actions. For example, where I live (USA), many of my local businesses (grocery stores, take-out restaurants, etc.) are going above and beyond in frequently sanitizing surfaces, non-contact e-payments, staff washing hands and wearing clean gloves, etc. etc. ... <em>yet shopping there still involves a face-to-face conversation with the salesperson</em> (who does not have a mask)!!</p>\n<p>I want every boss of every essential business to tell their employees: <em>Don't try to start a face-to-face conversation with your coworkers or customers (especially without facemasks), it's just as rude and reckless as coughing on them, or pushing them into a busy street.</em> I want a cultural norm that says that if someone tries to start a face-to-face conversation, the other person is entitled to run away!</p>\n<p>Again, I could be wrong altogether ... and if this <em>is</em> a message worth promoting, I'm not sure how to get lots of celebrities etc. to say \"When someone talks to you, they're spitting on your face!\", instead of \"wash your hands\" (which is still a good idea but everyone has already heard that a million times).</p>\n</body></html>",

I'm publishing it with minimal polishing for Daniel's </i><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ctXqQiCYkPsiLoqQj/reminder-blog-post-day-ii-today\"><i>Blog Post Writing Day II</i></a><i>. Sorry that it's not as clear as it could be.]</i></p><p>A while back I was chatting with someone about representing themself and their organisation on the internet - they're someone at an org in the EA/Rationality professional network who sometimes comments on various public online platforms. They were encouraging a colleague at their org to include a few sentences of disclaimer to tell everyone that they're not speaking on behalf of their org and that they're speaking for themselves.</p><p>Here are some messages I wrote back:</p><blockquote><p>I think there's something weirdly formal and slightly bad about the way most people write those sorts of sentences, but I've not been able to put my finger on it.</p><p>I think people often signal something like \"You're supposed to pretend to not believe things about my organisation as a result of things I say here\", and that's often not quite true, because if you're in the core 5-10 people or something it actually is evidence, but you don't know if it's a consensus view in the org.&nbsp;</p><p>I think folks should try to say something more like \"The causal process behind my comment/post is I wrote down my thoughts and answered in a way that is representative of my thinking. I did't run this past my colleagues, I'm not actually sure what they think, and I'm not <strong>trying</strong> to report consensus views here.\"</p></blockquote><p>They replied</p><blockquote><p>I think you’ve hit the nail on the head on why I’ve always disliked ‘I’m speaking in my personal capacity’ comments. It feels like it’s requesting that we pretend not to update on something that by all rights has to be evidence.</p><p>It feels a bit contentless or allowing of too many interpretations.</p><p>Whereas ‘I didn’t run this by my colleagues’ feels helpful, and perfectly reasonable given how costly it is to run everything you publicly say by everyone on your team.</p><p>I'm not a fan of boilerplate disclaimers on message boards, since they force you to keep re-disclaiming on each new comment. Otherwise, you leave the disclaimer off and potentially imply that your new comment <strong>is</strong> 'the organization's belief', whatever that means.</p></blockquote><p>Let me use an example that's on LessWrong. Vaniver, in his brilliant post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zbf2L4ZJf4ykZqmPA/public-positions-and-private-guts\">Public Positions and Private Guts</a>, has the following disclaimer:</p><blockquote><p>[Note: the concept for this post comes from a talk given by Anna Salamon, and I sometimes instruct for CFAR, but the presentation in this post should be taken to only represent my views.]</p></blockquote><p>And I actively feel a little lurch reading it, because when I read \"should not\" I feel like I'm supposed to go along with the claim under social pressure (\"you should not show up late to work\") but the thing I'm being told I should not do is to not believe something that is bayesian evidence – when it clearly is. I should indeed take the post to have some representation of the other person's views, because this post was inspired by them.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the truth here is that when Vaniver wrote the post he was trying to write his own perspective, he wasn't trying to faithfully represent Anna's, Anna probably didn't give much feedback on the post, and all of the consequences of this state of affairs. This is a more accurate description to me.</p><p>...I feel like I should try to offer an alternative here.</p><p>My current plan is to mostly just talk for myself, and try to signal deviations from this clearly (which I expect to be much rarer than the baseline of my comments). I think this equilibrium mostly works out, though there's been a few times it's not quite worked out great, and I might change to adding lots of disclaimers. But for now I'm still holding onto the hope that I can stick to the equilibrium where I just write off-the-cuff thoughts on the internet all the time without disclaimers.</p><p>I replied in the conversation above:</p><blockquote><p>I mostly have always just been speaking for myself at LW. The main problem I've run into is, when I obviously always say \"I think\" and never \"we think\", and am just speaking the same as normal, people have made the false assumption that I'm speaking on behalf of the team or the mod team or something, so I have updated on the need to solve this even though I am against disclaimers.&nbsp;</p><p>I have been thinking about making sure it's easy to create very blunt common knowledge of when I <strong>am</strong> trying to speak from consensus (e.g. might make mod comments a different colour or something) so as to throw into relief all the other comments.</p></blockquote><p>But I know some people feel they're in an equilibrium with a strong expectation that they're speaking for the org, and so feel a constant need to disclaim. In which case, I will try to helpfully offer what I think is a more truthful disclaimer:</p><blockquote><p>I wrote this comment from my perspective, I'm speaking for myself, and am not attempting to represent a consensus at any organisation I'm connected to.</p></blockquote><p>That's the simplest one. If you'd like something more general, you could try this:</p><blockquote><p>I write comments from my own perspective, and am speaking for myself. When I write comments, I don't try to represent organisations I'm connected with, other than when I explicitly say that's what I'm doing.</p></blockquote><p>I'm not sure these are clear and snappy enough to get widely used, but they do feel to me more like they're true, which I like.</p><p><i>(Related: I basically don't think anyone should be writing in an official capacity in their own account. I mean, they should sometimes, but they shouldn't do it here on LessWrong. We're not that kind of place. Don't make accounts where the name of the account is the name of your organisation. I want to speak to individuals, not faceless entities. I don't mean to say that writing in the passive voice isn't acceptable, or that the person should always be front and centre, just that most of the ways orgs do this are pretty bad for clear and open discourse.)</i></p><p>So yeah, I think the correct thing is to just state clearly that you're not <i>attempting to represent anyone's perspective other than your own</i>. It's easy for readers to make the correct inferences about how representative the comment is about you and your orgs once they have this information about how you wrote the comment.</p><p>I do think that my alternatives will feel to many people like it doesn't sufficiently distance what they wrote from the organisation - they want to make sure that nobody forms beliefs about the organisation from that comment. Unfortunately, I think that's not a fair expectation to ask of others, because you really do work at that org, this is a real thought you had, and it's actual bayesian evidence about how you think and about what decision-making is like in the org.</p><p>I think it's basically still pretty fine to write such things publicly. I mean, if you think that your org cannot survive people knowing the random sh*t its staff say in their off-hours, then that's a problem. It either means that working with the org is incompatible with freely speaking in public which is a red flag, or it means you need to talk within your org and make a plan to have a clear space for the org to speak for itself so that people are able to build good and clear separate models.</p><p>Related thought: I think it's important when you're considering being hired by an org, to ask yourself whether the org will put these kinds of constraints on you, and weigh it as a factor. Such restraints are both common and very strong and will hold you back from (not to speak too grandly) contributing to and engaging with the accumulation of knowledge and the broader process of science. Make sure you're still able to think for yourself in public.</p></body></html>",

They were one of the first countries to get coronavirus cases, around the same time as South Korea and Italy. And their response has been somewhere between terrible and nonexistent. A friend living in Japan says that &#x201C;Japan has the worst coronavirus response in the world (the USA is second worst)&#x201D;, and gets backup from commenters, including a photo of still-packed rush hour trains. [...]</em></p><p><em>But actually their case number has barely budged over the past month. It was 200 a month ago. Now it&#x2019;s 1300. This is the most successful coronavirus containment by any major country&#x2019;s, much better than even South Korea&#x2019;s, and it was all done with zero effort.</em></p><p><em>The obvious conclusion is that Japan just isn&#x2019;t testing anyone. This turns out to be true &#x2013; they were hoping that if they made themselves look virus-free, the world would still let them hold the Tokyo Olympics this summer.</em></p><p><em>But at this point, it should be beyond their ability to cover up. We should be getting the same horrifying stories of overflowing hospitals and convoys of coffins that we hear out of Italy. Japanese cities should be defying the national government&#x2019;s orders and going into total lockdowns. Since none of this is happening, it looks like Japan really is almost virus-free. The Japan Times is as confused about this as I am. [...]</em></p><p><em>Also, what about Iran? The reports sounded basically apocalyptic a few weeks ago. They stubbornly refused to institute any lockdowns or stop kissing their sacred shrines. Now they have fewer cases than Spain, Germany, or the US. A quick look at the data confirms that their doubling time is now 11 days, compared to six days in Italy and four in the US. Again, I have no explanation. [...]</em></p><p><em>The third world &#x2026;is in really deep trouble, isn&#x2019;t it?</em></p><p><em>The numbers say it isn&#x2019;t. Less developed countries are doing fine. Nigeria only has 65 cases. Ethiopia, 12 cases. Sudan only has three!</em></p><p><em>But they probably just aren&#x2019;t testing enough. San Diego has 337 diagnosed cases right now. The equally-sized Mexican city of Tijuana, so close by that San Diegans and Tijuanans play volleyball over the border fence, has 10. If we assume that the real numbers are more similar (can we assume this?), then Mexico is undercounting by a factor of 30 relative to the US, which is itself undercounting by a factor of 10 or so. This would suggest Mexico has the same number of cases as eg Britain, which doesn&#x2019;t seem so far off to me (Mexico has twice as many people). [...]</em></p><p><em>Nigeria and Mexico and so on make me confused in the same way as Japan &#x2013; why aren&#x2019;t they already so bad that they can&#x2019;t hide it? If the very poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa were suffering a full-scale coronavirus epidemic, would we definitely know? In Liberia, only 3% of people are aged above 65 (in the US, it&#x2019;s 16%). It only has one doctor per 100,000 people (in the US, it&#x2019;s one per 400) &#x2013; what does &#x201C;hospital overcrowding&#x201D; even mean in a situation like that? I don&#x2019;t think a full-scale epidemic could stay completely hidden forever, but maybe it could be harder to notice we would naively expect.</em></p><p>Tyler Cowen also asks <u><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/where-does-all-the-heterogeneity-come-from.html\">&#x201C;Where does all the heterogeneity come from?&#x201D;</a></u>: <em>&#x201C;Can anyone shed light on why the death rate is not higher in Iceland?

In its early stages, the Covid-19 crisis in Italy looked nothing like a crisis. [...] Threats such as pandemics that evolve in a nonlinear fashion (i.e., they start small but exponentially intensify) are especially tricky to confront because of the challenges of rapidly interpreting what is happening in real time.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;The most effective time to take strong action is extremely early, when the threat appears to be small &#x2014; or even before there are any cases. But if the intervention actually works, it will appear in retrospect as if the strong actions were an overreaction. This is a game many politicians don&#x2019;t want to play.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;The systematic inability to listen to experts highlights the trouble that leaders &#x2014; and people in general &#x2014; have figuring out how to act in dire, highly complex situations where there&#x2019;s no easy solution.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;Avoid partial solutions. A second lesson that can be drawn from the Italian experience is the importance of systematic approaches and the perils of partial solutions. The Italian government dealt with the Covid-19 pandemic by issuing a series of decrees that gradually increased restrictions within lockdown areas[... I]t backfired for two reasons. First, it was inconsistent with the rapid exponential spread of the virus. [...] Second, the selective approach might have inadvertently facilitated the spread of the virus.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;Consider the decision to initially lock down some regions but not others. When the decree announcing the closing of northern Italy became public, it touched off a massive exodus to southern Italy, undoubtedly spreading the virus to regions where it had not been present.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;An effective response to the virus needs to be orchestrated as a coherent system of actions taken simultaneously.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;These rules also apply to the organization of the health care system itself. Wholesale reorganizations are needed within hospitals (for example, the creation of Covid-19 and non Covid-19 streams of care).&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;Finding the right implementation approach requires the ability to quickly learn from both successes and failures and the willingness to change actions accordingly. Certainly, there are valuable lessons to be learned from the approaches of China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, which were able to contain the contagion fairly early. But sometimes the best practices can be found just next door. Because the Italian health care system is highly decentralized, different regions tried different policy responses. The most notable example is the contrast between the approaches taken by Lombardy and Veneto, two neighboring regions with similar socioeconomic profiles.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>Good policies: &#x201C;Extensive testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases early on. Proactive tracing of potential positives. If someone tested positive, everyone in that patient&#x2019;s home as well as their neighbors were tested. If testing kits were unavailable, they were self-quarantined. A strong emphasis on home diagnosis and care. Whenever possible, samples were collected directly from a patient&#x2019;s home and then processed in regional and local university labs. Specific efforts to monitor and protect health care and other essential workers.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;It is especially important to understand what does not work. While successes easily surface thanks to leaders eager to publicize progress, problems often are hidden due to fear of retribution, or, when they do emerge, they are interpreted as individual &#x2014; rather than systemic &#x2014; failures.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;Collecting and disseminating data is important. Italy seems to have suffered from two data-related problems. In the early onset of the pandemic, the problem was data paucity. More specifically, it has been suggested that the widespread and unnoticed diffusion of the virus in the early months of 2020 may have been facilitated by the lack of epidemiological capabilities and the inability to systematically record anomalous infection peaks in some hospitals.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;More recently, the problem appears to be one of data precision. In particular, in spite of the remarkable effort that the Italian government has shown in regularly updating statistics relative to the pandemic on a publicly available website, some commentators have advanced the hypothesis that the striking discrepancy in mortality rates between Italy and other countries and within Italian regions may (at least in part) be driven by different testing approaches.&#x201D;</em></li><li><em>&#x201C;In an ideal scenario, data documenting the spread and effects of the virus should be as standardized as possible across regions and countries and follow the progression of the virus and its containment at both a macro (state) and micro (hospital) level.&#x201D;</em></li></ol><p>~</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/rhode-island-police-to-hunt-down-new-yorkers-seeking-refuge\">Rhode Island essentially declares war on New York City</a></u>:</p><p><em>Rhode Island police began stopping cars with New York plates Friday.

By identification and isolation of the majority of infectious individuals, including the estimated 86% who are asymptomatic or undocumented, the reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be reduced well below 1.0, and the epidemic would collapse. This testing regime would be additive to other interventions, and allow individuals who have respiratory symptoms due to other causes to return to work, but would have to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available. Unlike sampling-based tests, population-scale testing does not need to be very accurate: false negative rates up to 15% could be tolerated if 80% comply with testing, and false positives can be almost arbitrarily high when a high fraction of the population is already effectively quarantined.&#x201D;</p><br><h3>And Now a Word From the Lamestream Media</h3><p><u><a href=\"https://medium.com/@vryeung/thanks-kelsey-piper-cb06f0a05846\">Kelsey Piper is the best</a></u>.

The\n\"level 2\" and \"level 3\" jargon are from my <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when\">previous\npost</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skip to <a href=\"#Answers_and_lessons\">answers and lessons</a> for my (incomplete\nand tentative) answers.</p>\n<p>NOTE: My original post was based on data till 2020-03-27 (row 17 in\nthe\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L8xJs1YNn3iMHHohgtTLhcvUULEj-crwupB72QAJJLg/edit#gid=0\">spreadsheet</a>). On\n2020-04-01 (April 1, 2020) I made edits to this post of two kinds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language improvements, based on feedback in the comments, without\nany substantive changes to the model.</li>\n<li>Addenda at the end of some sections giving updates based on data\nseen since I originally published the post. I used data till\n2020-03-31 (row 21).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A simple model from true currently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases to confirmed cases to deaths or recoveries</h2>\n<h3>The model</h3>\n<p>For simplicity, I will use the shorthand \"true\ncurrently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases\" only for cases where a\nperson is already infected and will <em>eventually</em> become symptomatic\n(so this will include both currently symptomatic cases and cases that\nare presymptomatic, i.e., will become symptomatic later). I expect\nthat most asymptomatic cases (i.e., cases that <em>never</em> become\nsymptomatic) won't get diagnosed, and therefore won't count in the\nnumber of confirmed cases either, so this seems a reasonable\napproximation for the model I will present below. However, if\nincorrect, this could cause estimates to be off by a factor of two or\nmore, depending on the fraction of cases that are asymptomatic.</p>\n<p>The simplistic model identifies the following flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get infected</li>\n<li>Start showing symptoms</li>\n<li>Get a test</li>\n<li>Get test results</li>\n<li>Recover or die</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Technically, 5 can happen before 3 or 4; the logical dependencies are\n1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 5 and 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4. It's also possible (and probably\nmore likely) that 5 happens after 3 but before 4.</p>\n<p>To keep this post focused, I will not discuss 5 here, though it's\nobviously very important.</p>\n<h3>Time lags in the model (1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4)</h3>\n<p>The total time lag from 1 to 4 shows up as the lag between any trend\nchange in the number of true currently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases, and the\ncorresponding trend change in the number of confirmed cases. The more\naccurately we can estimate and measure this total time lag, the more\naccurately we can relate the timing of social distancing measures and\nthe timing of case growth flatlining. Herei s what I know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 1 -&gt; 2 lag is in the range of 2 to 14 days, according to\n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html\">CDC</a>.\nI'll use a median estimate of 1 week.</li>\n<li>The 2 -&gt; 3 lag depends on the queue/backlog for tests. It looks like\nthere is no single queue for tests, but rather, different kinds of\ncases are in different queues (those showing severe symptoms or\nthose who need to do essential work may get a priority for being\ntested). For simplicity, I'll use a median estimate of 1 week. See\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/test-for-coronavirus.html\">here</a>\nfor reasonably up-to-date information on the experience of getting\ntested.</li>\n<li>The 3 -&gt; 4 lag seems to be between 5 and 10 days. Again, I'll use a\nmedian estimate of 1 week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using median estimates for each suggests that there is a lag of <em>3\nweeks</em> between trend changes in true currently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases and\ntrend changes in confirmed cases. If this 3 weeks were precise, then\nthe trend in confirmed cases will be a 3-week time translation of the\ntrend in true cases. In practice, however, because each transition has\na variable time range, varying across individuals, the true time range\nis more like 2 to 6 weeks. And rather than a crisp time translation,\nwe see a fuzzy smear -- even if true currently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases\nflatline immediately after the escalation from level 2 to level 3\n(flexible lockdown), the confirmed case count will show no such sharp\ntrend change, instead showing a leveling off over time.</p>\n<h2>Looking at the California data</h2>\n<h3>Description of the data</h3>\n<p><em>Original version written 2020-03-29, possibly edited for clarity but\nwith no substantive model changes.</em></p>\n<p>The California Department of Public Health publishes <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx\">daily\nreleases</a>\non coronavirus case counts as of the previous date. The reports have\nalways included data on the number of confirmed positive cases and the\nnumber of deaths. Starting with the release for March 18 (published\nMarch 19), the release includes data on the total number of tests and\nthe total number of test results returned.</p>\n<p>I put the data together in a\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L8xJs1YNn3iMHHohgtTLhcvUULEj-crwupB72QAJJLg/edit#gid=0\">spreadsheet</a>\nwhere I added columns for the daily increments to each value, as well\nas some percentages and comparisons of interest. <em>ETA 2020-04-01: I\nhave been updating the spreadsheet daily since writing this post;\nplease see up to row 17 for 2020-03-27 in the spreadsheet to\nunderstand the part of it I had in front of me when writing the post.</em>\nA few notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There are two dates with sharp changes to the incremental number of\nconfirmed positive cases (i.e., the \"second derivative\" of the\nconfirmed positive case count is high; see column E for confirmed\npositive cases, column I for the first derivative and column O for\nthe second derivative): the transition from March 18 to March 19,\nand the transition from March 25 to March 26. Outside of these days,\nthe second derivative is low; the growth seems to be closer to\npiecewise linear or quadratic than exponential. The increase from\nMarch 18 to March 19 may be due to more testing capacity -- it's\nhard to say because we have test counts only starting March 18. The\nincrease from March 25 to March 26 is off by a few days from an\nincrease in the number of test results. However, if there is a lag\nbetween test results and confirmed cases showing up, that might\nexplain the jump.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The total number of tests jumped a lot from March 23 to March 24\n(see column D for the number of tests and column G for the first\nderivative). Looking at language in the CDPH report pages, this\nseems to be because tests from some state and local health labs that\nwere previously not included have started getting included.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Extrapolating the number and timeline of confirmed positive cases for people already tested</h3>\n<p><em>Original version written 2020-03-29, possibly edited for clarity\nlater but with no substantive model changes.</em></p>\n<p>Let's go back to our simple model:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get infected</li>\n<li>Start showing symptoms</li>\n<li>Get a test</li>\n<li>Get test results</li>\n<li>Recover or die</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is quite hard to measure 1 and 2 from the data we have, but we can\nshed light on 3 and 4 based on the data collected here.</p>\n<p>First, as noted in the previous section, the data seems consistent\nwith a 3 -&gt; 4 lag of 5 days or a little more. Specifically, the number\nof test results on a given day is around 75% to 90% of the number of\ntests about five days before that. This is consistent with test\nresults taking five days, but some results getting delayed. See column\nM.</p>\n<p>However, as the number of tests has increased quite a bit recently ,\nthe lag might increase a lot in the next few days if processing\ncapacity has not kept pace.</p>\n<p>Second, we see that right now, the majority of tests don't yet have\nresults (i.e., there is a lot in the 3 -&gt; 4 transition). Therefore,\neven assuming that there are no more true currently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases\ncoming through 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 any more, there's still a lot in 3 -&gt; 4 and\nmuch of it may be confirmed positive.</p>\n<p>Third, at least so far, the cumulative confirmed positive rate\n(confirmed positive cases as a percentage of test results; see column\nL) has been going up, albeit slowly. The incremental confirmed\npositive rate (incremental confirmed positive cases as a percentage of\nincremental test results; see column K) is more noisy, but is also\ngenerally higher in recent days than it was in the beginning. The\nincrease in confirmed positive rate could be because (a) the selection\nof who takes the test is getting more precise, as people better\nunderstand the right symptoms, flu test screening is instituted, and\ntest criteria are improved, or (b) the false negative rate of tests is\nreduced as tests become more accurate.</p>\n<p>With all these, we can make the following loose predictions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We expect to see results for about 64,000 currently pending tests in\nthe next 5 to 7 days, assuming test processing capacity keeps pace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the confirmed positive rate of the remaining tests matches that\nof the tests so far, we will see about 16,514 confirmed positive\ncases from the people who have already been tested (cell N17).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here is an argument that the confirmed positive rate will be\ndramatically lower for the still-pending tests, even though it's\nbeen increasing so far: We have just recently hit the point where\nthe people getting tested now are testing \"too late\" to have\nactually gotten the disease, because this is just about the right\namount of lag after we went to level 2 or level 3.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here is an argument that the confirmed positive rate will be higher\nfor the still-pending tests: Since the confirmed positive rate has\nbeen generally increasing, it may be better to extrapolate from the\nconfirmed positive rate of the last 2 or 3 days.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on these considerations, I estimate that, just from the people\nwho have gotten tested so far, we should expect a total of 10,000 to\n40,000 cases in California. This is inclusive of the already-diagnosed\n4,643 cases. I also expect that, if testing capacity keeps pace with\nthe number of tests done, we will hit this number (somewhere between\n10,0000 and 40,000) by around Friday, April 3, along with the number\nof test results getting to equal or exceed the current total number of\ntests (~89,000).</p>\n<p>Further, I expect that (again assuming that test processing capacity\nroughly keeps pace) we will see another sharp increase in the\nincremental confirmed positive case count in the transition from March\n28 to March 29 or March 29 to March 30. This will lag by about 5 days\nthe sharp increase from March 23 to March 24 in the total number of\ntests. More specifically, I expect that the incremental number of\nconfirmed positive cases will go up from its current daily value of\n~800 to a few thousand.</p>\n<p><em>Addendum 2020-04-01</em>: Based on data from a few more days of tests (up\nto row 21 for 2020-03-31 in the spreadsheet), here are my updated\nthoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I had not explicitly thought about this possibility, but it seems\nlike the CDPH reports have become a bit more erratic over the\ndays. This has complicated some analysis for the days after I\npublished the original post. I had also not thought explicitly about\nthe possibility of the test count needing to be adjusted downward,\nthough I had been subconsciously suspicious of the huge jump in test\ncount.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Setting that aside, I still stand by my general prediction range of\n10,000 to 40,000 confirmed cases from the first ~90,000 tests. In\nfact, in light of the new data, I narrow the range to 15,000 to\n40,000. That's because the\ncumulative confirmed positive rate (columns K and L) has continued\nto go up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My caveat of \"assuming that test processing capacity roughly keeps\npace\" was important because, judging from data till 2020-03-31, test\nprocessing capacity has not kept pace with the increase in the\nnumber of tests a week ago. This means that I expect that the\nresults for the first ~90,000 tests won't be out by the end of this\nweek. My guess is it will take another 1 or 2 weeks. This means that\nthe count of confirmed positive cases will continue to rise for the\nnext 1 or 2 weeks purely from clearing the backlog on test\nprocessing, even if no new tests happen.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Thinking about the transitions till testing (1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3)</h3>\n<p><em>Original version written 2020-03-29, possibly edited for clarity\nlater but with no substantive model changes.</em></p>\n<p>The data here doesn't give a clear idea of how the transitions from 1\nto 2, or from 2 to 3 are proceeding. Nonetheless, it may offer some\nclues. So first, let's backtrack and think: let's say California going\nto level 2 or level 3 did in fact effectively stop coronavirus in its\ntracks. What should we see?</p>\n<p>First, keep in mind that there's a time lag 1 -&gt; 2 and a time lag 2 -&gt;\n3. When describing the model, we estimated these time lags as 1 week\neach, so that's a total of 2 weeks. This means that, about 2 weeks\nafter coronavirus is stopped in its tracks, we should see a\ncorresponding change in the trend of the number of true\ncurrently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases that are getting tests.</p>\n<p>One complication is that, because there is huge variation between\npeople and between regions in the 1 -&gt; 2 time lag and in the 2 -&gt; 3\ntime lag, we won't see a sharp trend change after 2 weeks. Rather,\nwe'll see the trend change happening a little more gradually.</p>\n<p>Another complication: even if the rate at which true\ncurrently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases are getting to the testing\nstage drops, the number of other cases (e.g., people with a\ncold, flu, or allergy) that's getting the test may increase. In that\ncase, we may not see a decrease in the number of tests being done. So,\nmore accurately, we should see at least one of these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A drop in the incremental number of tests each day. This will happen\nif the growth of true currently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases\nslows down, but any increase in tests from other cases does not\nincrease to compensate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A drop in the confirmed positive rate on tests (but this metric is\navailable at a further 3 -&gt; 4 lag of about a week). This will happen\nif the growth of true currently-or-eventually-symptomatic cases\nslows down, and proportionally more people who don't have\ncoronavirus are getting the tests.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, we aren't seeing the second yet. As for the first, the\ntransition data from March 26 to March 27 suggests that yes, we are\nseeng a drop in the incremental number of tests (the increment went\ndown from 10,600 to 1,200). But that's just one day of data. If we see\na similar drop persist, that might mean that we are finally seeing the\nlagged effects of escalating to level 2 or level 3. A week after that\nwe should see a drop in the growth rate of confirmed positive cases.</p>\n<p><em>Addendum 2020-04-01</em>: In the above para, I noted a sharp drop in the\nincremental number of tests a day. The reduced number has been\nsustained over the days since then, but it's hard to get a clear idea\nbecause CDPH is also making adjustments to address double-counting of\ntests. Nonetheless, tentative evidence is consistent with (but\ndoesn't strongly support) the idea that the growth of true\neventually-asymptomatic cases slowed down a few weeks ago.</p>\n<h3>Is the data good enough to know whether level 2 is sufficient, or whether we need level 3?</h3>\n<p>My rough estimate is that California achieved level 2 starting around\nMarch 11 to March 13, and escalated to level 3 around March 17 to\nMarch 19. The gap is about one week. This is a really small gap, and\nis dwarfed by the range of variation in the time lag. If case counts\nlevel off in the next one or two weeks, we won't have good enough data\nto say whether level 2 was sufficient, or the escalation to level 3\nwas necessary.</p>\n<p>Of course, while aggregate data may not say much, it is still possible\nthat more detailed analysis of individual cases will answer the\nquestion. Specifically, we would need to identify the number of\nindividual cases where we expect that they got the infection in the\ntime period when California was level 2. However, because of the long\nperiod between getting exposed and showing symptoms, we may have a\nlarge number of cases where we are pretty uncertain.</p>\n<h2>Answers and lessons</h2>\n<h3>Answers</h3>\n<p>I summarize the predictions from this post here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The super-optimistic scenario is that almost all people who had the\ndisease are already tested, and confirmed positive rates for the\npending tests will be lower than those for the tests so far.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In this super-optimistic scenario, I expect something like 10,000\nconfirmed cases and, assuming test processing capacity keeps pace, I\nexpect the number to be hit by around April 3. For comparison, there\nare currently 4,643 cases.</p>\n<p><em>Addendum 2020-04-01</em>: The super-optimistic case seems pretty much\nruled out; I now expect at least 15,000 confirmed cases, and at\nleast April 10 to hit that number.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My estimate range for the number of confirmed positive cases from\npeople already tested is 10,000 to 40,000. With the optimistic (but\nnot super-optimistic) assumption that almost all people who had the\ndisease are already tested, I expect us to hit this number by around\nApril 3, after which the growth rate of confirmed positive cases\nwill slow down to a trickle.</p>\n<p><em>Addendum 2020-04-01</em>: Due to what appears to be test processing\nbacklog, I expect an additional 1 to 2 weeks for the test\nprocessing backlog to clear. So, rather than April 3, I will give\nan estimate of ~April 17.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Given the huge time lags and variation in time lags, it will be\nhard, even after case growth stops, to know whether level 2 was\nsufficient or level 3 was neceessary to arrest case growth.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lessons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cutting down time lags (as well as variation in time lags) is\ncrucial to being able to reason clearly about cause and effect\nbetween social distancing measures and infection growth rates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In particular, cutting down the time spent waiting to get a test\n(the 2 -&gt; 3 transition), and cutting down the time taken to process\ntest results (the 3 -&gt; 4 transition), is absolutely critical.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Better heuristics for people to identify themselves as needing to\nget tested, even before they start feeling sick, would be great (it\nwould speed up the 1 -&gt; 2 transition). For instance, if loss of\nsmell is an early indicator, even before a person otherwise feels\nsick, that could help people get 1 -&gt; 2 faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Getting more detailed data on each case, to gauge the expected true\nstart date of infection, is very important to be able to determine\nthe true growth rate of an infection. I hope some people are doing\nthis, because the publicly available aggregate statistics are not of\nmuch use for that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I personally found it more helpful to model confirmed case trends as\nlinear, quadratic, or piecewise linear/quadratic than\nexponential. This is because at least at present, the bottlenecks\nare around testing capacity, which is growing linearly or\nquadratically, not exponentially.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Update (April 28th 2020)</strong>: <a href=\"http://reasonableapproximation.net/2020/04/28/chris-masterjohn-on-coronavirus-part-2.html\">Part 2</a> published. I've also made at least one minor update to the <a href=\"http://reasonableapproximation.net/2020/03/29/chris-masterjohn-on-coronavirus-part-1.html\">original text</a> that hasn't been reflected here, because keeping them in sync is a minor hassle.\n\n</p><p><strong>Update (April 5th 2020):</strong> Chris released version two of his recommendations on April 2nd. There are some fairly major revisions. In particular, Chris now thinks <a href=\"https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/the-covid-19-coronavirus-infects-the-throat-covid-19-updates\">Coronavirus infects the throat, not just the lungs</a>. He was already making recommendations just in case this turned out to be true, so he hasn't specifically added anything, but it's still an important update. The other thing of note is that he no longer recommends using copper spray or taking echinacea until you get sick, except (for the copper) before and after potential exposure. I've updated this post accordingly. You can still read <a href=\"http://reasonableapproximation.net/history/chris-masterjohn-on-coronavirus-part-1-v1.html\">version 1</a>.</p> <p>Chris Masterjohn is a nutritionist who has some <a href=\"https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/what-im-doing-for-the-coronavirus\">advice on supplements</a> to take to help protect against Covid-19, and some to avoid. The raw advice is available for free, but the full report with explanation and references costs $10. I bought a copy. (The public advice has not been updated to reflect version 2.)</p> <p>Should we trust him? On the one hand, \"nutritionist\" is not a profession I necessarily hold much respect for (it's not a protected term). Nor do I tend to think highly of people emphasizing that they have a PhD. Also, <a href=\"https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/\">his website</a> looks super sketchy to my eyes. Also also, something that costs money gets fewer eyeballs than something free, and so mistakes are less likely to be discovered.</p> <p>(Only the last one of those should be considered a problem with the report; the rest are just priors.)</p> <p>On the other hand, Chris previously turned me on to <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/un2fgBad4uqqwm9sH/is-this-info-on-zinc-lozenges-accurate\">zinc</a> so he has some credibility with me. Also, although I'm out of my depth in actually evaluating the science, I do think I have a decent bullshit detector, and the report is superficially very convincing to me.<sup><a href=\"#fn:bullshit\">1</a></sup> I get the sense that he actually really knows what he's doing, is weighing the evidence appropriately and making claims that are justified by it. He admits to uncertainty, and some of his recommendations are \"this probably won't help, but just in case\"; but he does speak precisely enough to be falsifiable. This doesn't mean he's right, of course. But I think he's worth some people paying some attention to.</p> <p>My intention here is mostly to summarize his reasoning, in more detail than is on the linked page but less detail than is in the full report. You can make up your own minds. Much of it I haven't even checked how actionable it is right now (i.e. are these things available in stores or for delivery, and how much do they cost). I do have some questions and commentary of my own that I've scattered about, possibly not always well-flagged.</p> <p>The report makes fifteen recommendations about fifteen supplements (some supplements are in multiple recommendations, and some recommendations are about multiple supplements):</p> <ul> <li>Four everyday \"essentials\": elderberry, nutritional zinc, ionic zinc, and copper.</li> <li>Two everyday \"potential add-ons\": garlic or stabilized allicin, and vitamin C. Chris takes allicin, and plans to take a low-dose supplement of vitamin C if he runs out of fresh food.</li> <li>Two things to use before and after every potential exposure: copper spray, and more ionic zinc.</li> <li>Two additional \"essentials\" only when you get sick: again, copper spray and more ionic zinc.</li> <li>One \"optional add-on\" only when you get sick: echinacea. Chris used to take this daily, but has since decided against that.</li> <li>Four \"things to limit or avoid\": these are much less pithy. \"Don't take high doses of vitamins A or D\" (but don't get deficient either); \"Limit Calcium and Don't Use Calcium Supplements That Aren't Balanced by Phosphorus\"; \"Don't Use Monolaurin\"; \"Don't Use High-Dose Vitamin C, Pelargonium Sidoides (Umcka), or Bee Propolis\".</li> </ul> <p>\"Potential exposure\" is quite broad, including:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>Going into public spaces to perform essential errands.</li> <li>Accidentally encountering someone you don’t live with face-to-face within six feet, or making physical content with such a person.</li> <li>Touching any surfaces that someone you don’t live with may have touched in the last nine days without any personal protective equipment.</li> <li>Incorrect use of personal protective equipment (for example, taking gloves off your hands in any other way than <a href=\"https://www.globus.co.uk/how-to-safely-remove-disposable-gloves\">explained here</a> or reusing a mask without following <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hcwcontrols/recommendedguidanceextuse.html#respreuse\">these guidelines</a>).</li> <li>Putting your fingers into your mouth or nose, regardless of whether you washed them beforehand.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>I think he's mostly expecting these won't happen very often. Personally, I'm doing most of them about once a week to go shopping, and the last one probably several times a day.</p> <p>It includes any physical contact with someone you don't live with, coming face-to-face with such a person within six feet, and putting your fingers in your mouth or nose even if you washed them first.</p> <p>In this post I'm going to focus on elderberry, zinc and copper; my current plan is to do the rest in future posts.</p> <p>So far, I've followed this advice to the extent of:</p> <ul> <li>I've stopped taking daily vitamin D supplements, and advised my partner to do the same. (Somewhat to my embarassment, as they'd only started taking them on my recommendation. I've been taking it 5x/week for years.) He says not to supplement with vitamin D at all, but he also says to get normal amounts from sunshine and vitamin D-rich foods, and we're not doing that. So maybe we should take one a week instead of one a day.</li> <li>I bought a bulb of garlic, but I haven't done anything with it yet.</li> <li>I took one of the zinc capsules that came free with my last order of zinc lozenges. Then I had a bad gastrointesinal day. Possibly unrelated, but they also had something of an unpleasant smell that I don't know whether it was normal. I haven't tried again. Maybe I will. They're 50mg, which is more than Chris recommends at one time.</li> <li>I recently started developing cold symptoms, so I would have been taking ionic zinc anyway. But I've probably taken more than I would have done otherwise. (I'm down to about 40 lozenges and they're currently out of stock, so I may not use them daily.)</li> </ul> <p>If you're going to follow any of it yourself, you should at least read his public post, and ideally also the full report.</p> <h3>General info: ACE2</h3> <p>SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes the disease Covid-19) is not like the common cold or the flu, and things which work against those may not be helpful here. On the other hand, it's very like SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS). The genomes are 80% identical, and \"the majority of its proteins are 85-100% homologous, with an average homology of 87%\".</p> <p>(Question: That seems like a really low average, given that range? Though I guess it includes the ones below 85%.)</p> <p>The two main things the report focuses on are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2\">ACE2</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon\">interferon</a>.</p> <p>ACE2 is an enzyme used in regulating blood pressure. SARS-CoV-2 enters our cells by docking to ACE2<sup><a href=\"#fn:ace2-receptor\">2</a></sup>. It has this in common with just two other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63\">HCoV-NL63</a>. So heightened levels of ACE2 could increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.</p> <p>(Question: \"The binding of SARS-CoV to ACE2 is thought to downregulate ACE2 expression, leading to a loss of the anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic actions of ACE2 in the lung, thereby contributing to the lung damage that occurs in SARS.\" That seems to point in favor of increasing levels of ACE2, so that it getting downregulated is not such a big deal. How to weigh these two concerns? I haven't read it closely, but <a href=\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/vir.0.043919-0#tab2\">this</a> sounds like NL63 only affects ACE2 on infected cells, and doesn't so much \"downregulate\" it as \"obliterate\" it. So my super tentative take is: even if we start with high levels, that may not be sufficient to be protective if the infection gets bad; it would be more important to focus on stopping it from getting bad. But followup questions would be: what percent of cells express ACE2? What percent of those get infected, in a (light/moderate/bad) infection? When we do things that increase/decrease ACE2, does that increase the amount of ACE2 on individual cells, or the number of cells with any ACE2, or both? If a cell has lots of ACE2, does it do more of the sorts of things that ACE2 is good for?)</p> <p>I'll talk about interferon in a future post, because it's not relevant to anything in this post.</p> <h3>Daily essential: Elderberry</h3> <p>\"In rhesus monkey kidney cell culture, elderberry has virucidal, anti-plaque, anti-replication and anti-attachment activity toward HCoV-NL63\". Most of the effect seems to come from caffeic acid. That binds directly to ACE2, which suggests elderberry would be similarly effective against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</p> <p>(Question: is that in vitro? Doesn't seem very reliable in general, but maybe the specific mechanism makes it moreso.)</p> <p>As a bonus, elderberry is also effective against avian infectious bronchitis virus through compromising the lipid envelope. Since all coronaviruses have one of those, that effect might generalize to SARS-CoV-2.</p> <p>Other foods include caffeic acid, but only black chokeberries have anything like a comparable amount. And elderberry extract is the thing that's been actually studied, so that's what Chris recommends.</p> <p>There are studies using elderberry in humans to treats colds, the flu, and cardiovascular disease, but Chris doesn't mention their results. He just uses them to determine a safe dose.</p> <h3>Daily essential: Nutritional zinc</h3> <p>This is zinc from food or most supplements (including tablets or capsules).</p> <p>Zinc \"inhibits at least two proteins required for SARS-CoV replication, papain-like protease-2 and helicase.\" So it probably inhibits the homologous proteins in SARS-CoV-2. (In version 1 Chris thought it also inhibited the protein helicase, but he no longer believes that.)</p> <p>(Question: how similar do proteins need to be for this to be a decent guess? <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/post/When_do_you_consider_two_proteins_to_be_homologous\">This</a> suggests proteins called \"homologous\" might be only 40% similar in sequence. If I guess that \"homologous\" means this is likely to be a decent guess; and that these ones are &gt;85% similar (based on base rates of similarity between the viruses)… that suggests it's probably a pretty good guess? But I'm not at all cofident in this thinking.)</p> <p>So we should try to deliver zinc to the relevant tissues. What are those?</p> <p>The infection would begin somewhere between the nose or throat (where the virus mostly enters our body) and lungs (where it primarily infects), wherever the virus first encounters ACE2.</p> <p>(Question: this seems to assume that the virus doesn't first infect something outside of this path, and then move on to the lungs. Is that a safe assumption? I would guess so.)</p> <p>In version one, Chris thought the virus wouldn't find any ACE2 until it reached the lungs. To quote the previous version of this post:</p> <blockquote> <p>There are two papers trying to answer this question, and they give different opinions. …</p> <p>Hamming et al (2004)<sup><a href=\"#fn:cite-hamming\">3</a></sup> suggests that the virus wouldn't find any ACE2 until it reached the lungs. They did find ACE2 in the oral and nasal mucous membranes, but on the wrong side to be any use to the virus.</p> <p>Xu et al (2020)<sup><a href=\"#fn:cite-xu\">4</a></sup> argues that ACE2 is highly expressed through the surface of the mouth, especially the tongue.</p> <p>The two used different methods. Xu had better resolution, down to single-cell. But Hamming could tell where on the cells the ACE2 was expressed. The second thing matters, and the first doesn't. Xu's results are what Hamming would have predicted, they just aren't relevant. (The symptoms are also what Hamming would predict: a cough suggests lung infection, and is present. A runny nose or other cold symptoms would suggest throat infection, but they aren't present.)</p> </blockquote> <p>But now there's direct evidence that <a href=\"https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/the-covid-19-coronavirus-infects-the-throat-covid-19-updates\">the virus infects the throat too</a>. (Note that the \"not-yet peer reviewed\" paper <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2196-x\">is now peer reviewed</a>.)</p> <p>So it seems that although the main infection site is the lungs, the infection starts in the mouth, nose or throat. We can specifically target those with ionic zinc, for which see below.</p> <p>We don't have a specific mechanism to target the lungs with zinc. We just have to take it orally in the normal way (that is, in food or supplements) and let it be distributed there.</p> <p>Chris recommends 7-15mg of zinc four times a day, away from sources of phytate (\"whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes\") which can inhibit zinc intake.</p> <p>(At one point he says 10-15mg, and at one point 7-10, but I think this is just bad proofreading. Mostly he says 7-15.)</p> <p>Conventional wisdom says we can't absorb nearly that much, but Chris thinks we just need <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/z8usYeKX7dtTWsEnk/more-dakka\">more dakka</a>: \"the relevant studies have been limited to less than 20 mg/d. Supplementation with 100 mg/d zinc sulfate has been shown to more than double total zinc absorbed from 4.5 to 10.5 mg/d, while decreasing the fraction absorbed from 43% to 9%.\"</p> <p>At such high doses, side effects have been observed. \"Zinc at 50 mg/d has been shown to lower superoxide dismutase, and at 85 mg/d increased self-reported anemia. Both of these could probably have been averted by proper balancing with copper, which is addressed in the section below. However, the increased need for copper at high zinc intakes reflects increased expression of metallothionein, which can bind to many positively charged metals besides copper.\" I confess I'm not sure what this \"however\" is meant to mean. It kind of sounds like \"so we still probably shouldn't go that high\", but then we go that high anyway. I'm a bit concerned about this.</p> <p>(I also confess that I have no idea what superoxide dismutase is.)</p> <p>If you take zinc, you should balance it with copper.</p> <h3>Multi essential: Ionic zinc</h3> <p>This specifically means zinc from <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/un2fgBad4uqqwm9sH/is-this-info-on-zinc-lozenges-accurate\">the kind of lozenges that work for a cold</a>, or failing that from an ionic zinc throat spray.</p> <p>(The mechanism that makes this work against a cold will not help with SARS-CoV-2.)</p> <p>It delivers ionic zinc to the mouth, nose and throat tissues, like we couldn't do with the lungs. Chris recommends using one lozenge a day preventatively; plus several a day on the first sign of symptoms; plus an extra one before and after any potential exposure.</p> <p>(Question: to be effective against the cold, this delivers ionic zinc to the surfaces of these tissues. Here we want it on the inside. Will that work?)</p> <h3>Daily essential: Copper</h3> <p>Copper surfaces work great against coronaviruses. This knowledge is not super helpful, since we are not copper surfaces.</p> <p>It does suggest that copper ions in our cells might be toxic to the virus. But this has never been well studied.</p> <p>Like zinc, copper inhibits papain-like protease 2 of SARS CoV. But it's much less effective at it.</p> <p>The main reason to take copper is to keep the zinc-to-copper ratio acceptable. It should be between 10:1 and 15:1. (At one point he says 2:1 - 15:1, but again, I think that's bad proofreading.)</p> <h3>Essential if you get sick, before and after exposure: Copper spray</h3> <p>He doesn't actually have loads of detail on this in the report. That was less of a problem in version 1, when he considered it a hedge. Now that he calls it essential, it feels lacking. Fortunately, he's actually written about it <a href=\"https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/taking-advantage-of-the-covid-19-throat-infection-study-with-zinc-and-copper-covid-19-updates\">publicly</a> in more detail. (Though I think still less detail than the report usually contains.)</p> <p>He recommends also using an ionic copper spray for the throat infections. This is similar to his recommendation for ionic zinc as well as nutritional zinc, but he doesn't say anything about copper lozenges. I assume those don't exist and/or wouldn't work for some reason. The goal in this case is to get the copper to the surface of the relevant tissues, in hopes that this destroys the virus in much the same way copper surfaces do. It's not clear whether he has specific evidence for this effect (even against other viruses), or just expects it to work based on theory (and if so how robust he considers that theory). Based on what he's written I don't think I'd put this in \"essentials\" (even acknowledging that \"essential\" is already an exaggeration).</p> <p>He doesn't recommend using it daily. Partly because he thinks the effects wouldn't last long enough for that to be worthwhile. (Question: why is zinc different here?) But also partly because he's not convinced it's safe long term. Stop if you notice irritation.</p> <p>He recommends a specific brand (named in the above link) that seems to have some evidence for short-term safety.</p> <div> <ol> <li> <p>There are some things that kind of smell like bullshit to me. Most notably, I feel like at times, the report goes into a lot of detail on things that aren't super relevant, like the renin-angiotensin system that ACE2 plays a part in. As far as I've seen so far, the precise mechanics of that don't really matter. Meanwhile, a lot of the important claims are speculative - necessarily so, because things are moving too fast to have good evidence here, but speculative all the same. In combination, this can kind of feel like… \"throw a lot of impeccably researched, uncontroversial and unimportant science at the reader; then try to sneak in the difficult bits under the radar\"? I'm sure there's a term for this that I'm forgetting.</p> <p>I don't actually think this is what's happening. My sense is that it's more likely to be bad editing, and I'm not even confident it's that. But it seemed important to note.</p> <p>I've also noticed some inconsistencies that I chalk up to bad proofreading. <a href=\"#fnref:bullshit\">↩</a></p> </li> <li> <p>Some papers talk about \"ACE2 receptors\". I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/fudhkp/vitamin_d_supplementation_to_prevent_acute/fmec3zp/?context=3\">currently think</a> they're being imprecise, and there's no such thing.</p> <p>By comparison, the common cold is mostly caused by rhinoviruses, and most of those dock to ICAM-1. Some colds are caused by coronaviruses, but those dock to aminopeptidase N or sialic acid. The flu docks to sialic acid. So if something protects against those by preventing them from docking, it's likely to have no effect on Covid-19. <a href=\"#fnref:ace2-receptor\">↩</a></p> </li> <li> <p>Hamming, I. et al.

At that point he&apos;s in the Valley of Bad Rationality: education made him worse than where he started. But then when he received more education, he took two steps forward.

Some key claims:</p><ul><li>To get infected, you plausibly need to be exposed to ~1000+ SARS-CoV2 viral particles (<a href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-questions-about-covid-19-and-viral-load/\"><u>source</u></a>) ⁠— either all at once, or over minutes or hours. The more viral particles are present, and the more time you spend exposed to them, the greater your infection risk.</li><li>“[T]he droplets in a single cough or sneeze may contain as many as 200,000,000 virus particles.” A single cough releases ~3000 (mostly large) droplets traveling at 50 mph (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143281/\"><u>source</u></a>). A single sneeze releases ~30,000 (mostly small) droplets traveling up to 200 mph (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143281/\"><u>source</u></a>). Smaller particles hang in the air longer. If someone sneezes or coughs, \"even if that cough or sneeze was not directed at you, some infected droplets — the smallest of small — can hang in the air for a few minutes, filling every corner of a modest sized room with infectious viral particles. All you have to do is enter that room within a few minutes of the cough/sneeze and take a few breaths and you have potentially received enough virus to establish an infection.\"</li><li>In contrast, \"a single breath releases 50 - 5000 droplets\", most of which fall to the ground quickly; nose-breathing releases even fewer droplets (<a href=\"https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(06)00286-6/fulltext\"><u>source</u></a>). \"We don't have a number for SARS-CoV2 yet, but we [...] know that a person infected with influenza releases about 3-20 virus RNA copies per minute of breathing\" (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2442192/\"><u>source</u></a>). This suggests that if your <i>only</i> exposure to an infected person is via them silently breathing on the other side of a room, it will probably take an hour or longer for them to infect you.</li><li>Speaking releases “~200 copies of virus per minute. Again, [pessimistically] assuming every virus is inhaled, it would take ~5 minutes of speaking face-to-face to receive the required dose” (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30787335/\"><u>source</u></a>).</li><li>A toilet flush aerosolizes droplets (which might contain viable virus), so “treat public bathrooms with extra caution (surface and air)” (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2271-3\"><u>source</u></a>).</li><li>“[P]lease don't forget surfaces. Those infected respiratory droplets land somewhere. Wash your hands often and stop touching your face!”</li><li>“We know that at least 44% of all infections — and the majority of community-acquired transmissions — occur from people without any symptoms (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people) (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5\"><u>source</u></a>). You can be shedding the virus into the environment for up to 5 days before symptoms begin. [...] Viral load generally builds up to the point where the person becomes symptomatic. So just prior to symptoms showing, you are releasing the most virus into the environment.”</li><li>“The main sources for infection are home, workplace, public transport, social gatherings, and restaurants. This accounts for 90% of all transmission events.&nbsp; In contrast, outbreaks spread from shopping appear to be responsible for a small percentage of traced infections.” (<a href=\"http://html.rhhz.net/zhlxbx/028.htm\"><u>source</u></a>). “The biggest outbreaks are in [nursing homes,] prisons, religious ceremonies, and workplaces, such [as] meat packing facilities and call centers.” Outbreaks seem to happen disproportionately often in colder indoor environments, and at larger and more social gatherings like weddings, funerals, birthdays, and networking events.</li><li>“Indoor spaces, with limited air exchange or recycled air and lots of people, are concerning from a transmission standpoint. We know that 60 people in a volleyball court-sized room (choir) results in massive infections. Same situation with the restaurant and the call center. Social distancing guidelines don't hold in indoor spaces where you spend a lot of time, as people on the opposite side of the room were infected.<br><br>“The principle is viral exposure over an extended period of time. In all these cases, people were exposed to the virus in the air for a prolonged period (hours). Even if they were 50 feet away (choir or call center), even a low dose of the virus in the air reaching them, over a sustained period, was enough to cause infection and in some cases, death.<br><br>“Social distancing rules are really to protect you with brief exposures or outdoor exposures. In these situations there is not enough time to achieve the infectious viral load when you are standing 6 feet apart or where wind and the infinite outdoor space for viral dilution reduces viral load. The effects of sunlight, heat, and humidity on viral survival, all serve to minimize the risk to everyone when outside.”</li><li>You shouldn’t worry especially about “[brief visits to] grocery stores, bike rides, inconsiderate runners who are not wearing masks”. “[F]or a person shopping: the low density, high air volume of the store, along with the restricted time you spend in the store, means that the opportunity to receive an infectious dose is low.” If you have to <i>work</i> in a grocery store, or spend lots of time in an office or classroom — especially one with more people sharing the same space and/or air, or one that requires \"face-to-face talking or even worse, yelling\" — you should be much more worried.</li></ul><p>Bromage says grocery stores aren't \"places of concern\", but I gather he means they’re <i>relatively</i> safe <i>if</i> you’re keeping a good distance from everyone, going when the store is pretty empty, etc. If a single cough from someone a few feet away who isn’t facing in my direction can give me COVID-19 within a few seconds, that still seems “concerning” to me!</p><p>Additionally, Jim Babcock comments on “infections while shopping appear to be responsible for 3-5% of infections”:</p><blockquote><p>The source for this covers Ningbo from January 21 to March 6. My main worry, when looking at this number, is that Ningbo's mitigations may have been more effective for stores than they were for other places, in ways that don't generalize to the US. For example, I'm pretty sure they would have been screening people for fever on entry, and enforcing mask usage. I haven't been hearing of fever-screens in Berkeley (though I haven't really been out of the house), and while we do now have a mask ordinance, it's mostly cloth masks (which are less effective) and compliance doesn't seem to be very good.</p></blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote><p>The specific number for the ~1000 virus-particle claim is cited to <a href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-questions-about-covid-19-and-viral-load/\"><u>a pretty sketchy source</u></a>; it leads to a couple epidemiologists speculating with no data, and what they actually say is:</p><p>&gt; \"The actual minimum number varies between different viruses and we don’t yet know what that ‘minimum infectious dose’ is for COVID-19, but we might presume it’s around a hundred virus particles.\"</p><p>and</p><p>&gt; \"For many bacterial and viral pathogens we have a general idea of the minimal infective dose but because SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen we lack data. For SARS, the infective dose in mouse models was only a few hundred viral particles. It thus seems likely that we need to breathe in something like a few hundred or thousands of SARS-CoV-2 particles to develop symptoms. This would be a relatively low infective dose and could explain why the virus is spreading relatively efficiently.\"</p><p>So there's uncertainty of about an order of magnitude, here. On the other hand, the broader claim--that exposure size matters--is almost certainly true, and the implications of the specific number 1000 are mostly screened off by more-specific observations of which places people are getting it.</p></blockquote><p>Bromage has softened the grocery store claim to “In contrast, outbreaks spread from shopping appear to be responsible for a small percentage of traced infections.”, and now cites an additional two studies for the 1000-particle claim: <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/110/41/16598.full.pdf\"><u>1</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/425915a\"><u>2</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>B. If you do need to be around people, face away from them, minimize talking, etc.</strong></p><p>Added Jun. 2: Jonathan Kay <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2020/04/23/covid-19-superspreader-events-in-28-countries-critical-patterns-and-lessons/\"><u>writes</u></a> on Apr. 23,</p><blockquote><p>According to the binary model established in the 1930s, droplets typically are classified as either (1) large globules of the Flüggian variety—arcing through the air like a tennis ball until gravity brings them down to Earth; or (2) smaller particles, less than five to 10 micrometers in diameter (roughly a 10th the width of a human hair), which drift lazily through the air as fine aerosols.</p><p>[...] Despite the passage of four months since the first known human cases of COVID-19, our public-health officials remain committed to policies that reflect no clear understanding as to whether it is one-off ballistic droplet payloads or clouds of fine aerosols that pose the greatest risk—or even how these two modes compare to the possibility of indirect infection through contaminated surfaces (known as “fomites”).</p><p>Gaining such an understanding is absolutely critical to the task of tailoring emerging public-health measures and workplace policies, because the process of policy optimization depends entirely on which mechanism (if any) is dominant:</p><p>1. If large droplets are found to be a dominant mode of transmission, then the expanded use of masks and social distancing is critical, because the threat will be understood as emerging from the <i>ballistic</i> droplet flight connected to sneezing, coughing, and laboured breathing. We would also be urged to speak softly, avoid “coughing, blowing and sneezing,” or exhibiting any kind of agitated respiratory state in public, and angle their mouths downward when speaking.</p><p>2. If lingering clouds of tiny aerosol droplets are found to be a dominant mode of transmission, on the other hand, then the focus on sneeze ballistics and the precise geometric delineation of social distancing protocols become somewhat less important—since particles that remain indefinitely suspended in an airborne state can travel over large distances through the normal processes of natural convection and gas diffusion. In this case, we would need to prioritize the use of outdoor spaces (where aerosols are more quickly swept away) and improve the ventilation of indoor spaces.</p><p>3. If contaminated surfaces are found to be a dominant mode of transmission, then we would need to continue, and even expand, our current practice of fastidiously washing hands following contact with store-bought items and other outside surfaces; as well as wiping down delivered items with bleach solution or other disinfectants.</p></blockquote><p>Zvi Mowshowitz <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/riB8m9PBvXJziFYMv/on-covid-19-superspreader-events-in-28-countries-critical\"><u>comments</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><u>Identified Super Spreader Events are Primarily Large Droplet Transmission</u></p><p>The article makes a strong case that <i>in identified super spreader events</i> [SSEs] the primary mode of transmission is large droplets. And that large droplets are spread in close proximity, by people talking (basically everything) or singing (several choir/singing practices) frequently or loudly, or laughing (many parties) and crying (funerals), or otherwise exhaling rapidly (e.g. the curling match) and so on.</p><p>There is a highly noticeable absence of SSEs that would suggest other transmission mechanisms. Subways and other public transit aren’t present, airplanes mostly aren’t present. Performances and showings of all kinds also aren’t present. Quiet work spaces aren’t present, loud ones (where you have to yell in people’s faces) do show up. University SSEs are not linked to classes (where essentially only the professor talks, mostly) but rather to socializing. [...]</p></blockquote><p>Zvi argues that surfaces and small aerosolized droplets are unlikely to be major infection vectors for COVID-19. He discusses methods for avoiding large droplet transmission:</p><blockquote><p><u>Large Droplets: Six Foot Rule is Understandable, But Also Obvious Nonsense</u></p><p>For large droplets, there is essentially zero messaging about angling downwards or avoiding physical actions that would expel more droplets, or avoiding being in the direct path of other people’s potential droplets.</p><p>Instead, we have been told to keep a distance of six feet from other people. We’ve told them that six feet apart is safe, and five feet apart is unsafe. Because the virus can only travel six feet.</p><p>That’s obvious nonsense. It is <i>very</i> clear that droplets can go <i>much</i> farther than six feet. Even more than that, the concept of a boolean risk function [i.e., one that sharply divides everything into either \"risky\" or \"risk-free\", with no shades of grey] is insane. People expel virus at different velocities, from different heights, under different wind conditions and so on. The physics of each situation will differ. The closer you are, the more risk.</p><p>Intuitively it makes sense to think about something like an inverse square law until proven otherwise, so six feet away is about 3% of the risk of one foot away. That’s definitely not right, but it’s the guess I feel comfortable operating with.</p><p>Alas, that’s not the message. The message is 72 inches safe, 71 inches unsafe.</p><p><a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/11/seemingly-popular-covid-19-model-is-obvious-nonsense/\"><u>Unlike the previous case of obvious nonsense</u></a>, there is a reasonable justification for this one. I am sympathetic. You get about five words. “Always stay six feet apart” is a pretty good five words. There might not be a better one. Six feet is a distance that you can plausibly mandate and still allow conversations and lines that are moderately sane, so it’s a reasonable compromise.</p><p>It’s a <i>lie</i>. It’s <i>not real</i>. As a pragmatic choice, it’s not bad.</p><p>The problem is <i>it is being treated as literally real</i>.</p><p>Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders met on a debate stage. The diagram plans had them <i>exactly six feet apart</i>.</p><p>In an article, someone invites the author, a reporter, to their house to chat. Says he’s prepared two chairs, six feet apart. “I measured them myself,” he says. [...]</p><p>And so on. People <i>really are</i> trying to make the distance <i>exactly six feet</i> as often as possible.</p><p>[...] This is society sacrificing bandwidth to get a message across. Again, <i>I get it</i>. The problem is we are <i>also</i> sacrificing <i>any ability to convey nuance</i>. We are incapable, after making this sacrifice, of telling people there is a physical world they might want to think about how to optimize. There is only a rule from on high, The Rule of Six Feet.</p><p>Thus, we may <i>never</i> be able to get people to talk softly into the ground rather than directly looking at each other and loudly and forcefully to ‘make up for’ the exact six foot distance, which happens to be the worst possible orientation that isn’t closer than six feet.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, we can go beyond this. You get infected because droplets from an infected person travel out of their face and touch your face.</p><p>Thus, a <i>line</i> is remarkably safe if everyone faces the same way, modulo any strong winds. The person behind you has no vector to get to your face. And we can extend that. We can have one sidewalk where people walk north, and another on the other side of the street where people walk south. If you see someone approaching from the other direction, <i>turn around and walk backwards</i> while they ensure the two of you don’t collide. If necessary, stand in place for that reason. Either way, it should help – <i>if</i> this is the mechanism we are worried about.&nbsp;</p><p>[...] Yes, it’s annoying to not face other people, but you absolutely can have a conversation while facing away from each other. It’s a small price to pay.</p><p>In similar fashion, it seems a small price to pay to <i>shut the hell up</i> whenever possible, while out in public. Talking <i>at all</i>, when around those outside your household, can be considered harmful and kept to a bare minimum outright (and also it should be done while facing no one).</p></blockquote><p>Zvi emphasizes that there’s much more benefit to slightly reducing the risk from the largest infection sources (including large droplets as a category), than from hugely reducing the risk from fairly unlikely infection sources:</p><blockquote><p><u>Focus Only On What Matters</u></p><p>[...] Within those big risks, <i>small changes matter</i>. They matter more than avoiding small risks entirely.</p><p>A single social event, like a funeral, birthday party or wedding, might well <i>by default</i> give any given person a <i>30%+ rate</i> to infect any given other person at that event if the event is small, and a reasonably big one even if large. You only need one. Keeping <i>slightly</i> more distance, speaking <i>slightly</i> less loudly, and so on, at one such event, is a big risk reduction. [...]</p><p>Whereas a ‘close contact’ that doesn’t involve talking or close interaction probably gives more like (spitballing a guess, but based on various things) an <i>0.03% rate</i> of infection if the other person is positive, and likely with a lower resulting viral load. Certainly those contacts add up, but not that fast. Thus, a subway car full of “close contact” might give you 10 of them per day, most of whom are not, at any given time, infectious. If this model is correct.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In another post, Zvi <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P7crAscAzftdE7ffv/covid-19-my-current-model\"><u>writes</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><u>Risks Follow Power Laws</u></p><p>[...] Slight reductions in the frequency and severity of your <i>very risky </i>actions is <i>much more important </i>than reducing the frequency of nominally risky actions.</p><p>The few times you end up talking directly with someone in the course of business, the one social gathering you attend, the one overly crowded store you had to walk through, will dominate your risk profile. Be paranoid about that, and think how to make it less risky, or ideally avoid it. Don’t sweat the small stuff.</p><p>And think about the physical world and what’s actually happening around you!</p></blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote><p>My best guess is there is something like 5-10 times as much risk indoors versus the same activity outdoors. [...]</p><p>The combination of quick and outdoors and not-in-your-face probably effectively adds up to safe, especially if you add in masks. During the peak epidemic in New York things were so intense that it would have been reasonable to worry about miasma. Now, I would do my best to keep my distance and avoid talking at each other, but mostly not worry about incidental interactions.</p><p>I do expect there to be a spike in cases as the result of protests and civil unrest..

But on surfaces including metal, glass, and plastic, they can persist for hours or even days. (That’s where the bleach wipes come in; clean your sink handles, especially, in case someone comes in with the virus and washes it off.)</p><p>The biggest danger, then [if you're avoiding social contact with others], is that you will touch a surface with coronaviruses on it, and then (before washing your hands thoroughly) touch your mouth, nose, or eyes. Once the virus is in one of those, you’re likely to get sick.</p><p>So the number one tip is to learn, now, to stop touching your face with your hands.</p></blockquote><p>PBS <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-long-do-cold-and-flu-viruses-stay-contagious-on-public-surfaces\">says</a> (<i>added Mar. 30</i>):</p><blockquote><p>What’s the best surface for killing viruses? Our skin. In the cases of both flu and cold-causing viruses, infectious particles on our hands are usually gone after 20 minutes.</p><p>Between its pH and its porous nature, our body’s natural barrier to the word does a great job at killing viruses, Greatorex explained. “Our hands are quite antimicrobial themselves,” she said. “They have their own bacteria that live on them — no matter how clean you are — and they don’t actually harbour viruses that well.”</p></blockquote><p>So I could imagine it being quite helpful to switch from touching your mucous membranes once every few minutes to doing so once every few hours.</p><p>I hear that surface transmission wasn't the primary way SARS spread, so I'm not sure how worth worrying about surfaces are. A lot of people have noted that coronavirus can survive on surfaces up to 9 days in certain conditions (or even longer if it's cold), but Will Eden says: \"<a href=\"https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/abstract\">This paper </a>is the source of the 9 day figure. However that’s the maximum length on any surface under ideal conditions. In some cases it only lasts hours. And it doesn’t establish whether any of that is infectious!\"</p><p>Regardless, my other three main recommendations are: spend less time touching surfaces that a large number of other people touch (<i>added: or talk near</i>); try to minimize how much you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth; and wash your hands more often, using full medical hand-washing protocol (<a href=\"https://jagermo.sabic.uberspace.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Clipboard021.jpg\">image</a>; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BecauseIdeas/photos/a.214444909938310/214446503271484/\">mnemonic</a>; <a href=\"https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HappygoluckyFormalEuropeanfiresalamander-size_restricted.gif\">animated version</a>).

We don’t have concrete examples of infection via surfaces. At all. It increasingly seems like while such a route is <i>possible, </i>and must occasionally happen, getting enough virus to cause an infection, in a live state, via this route, is very hard. When you wash your hands and don’t touch your face, it’s even harder than that.</p><p>Meanwhile, those who refuse to touch surfaces like a pizza delivery box end up in more crowded locations like grocery stores, resulting in orders of magnitude more overall risk.</p><p>[...] Until I get very unexpected evidence, surfaces are <i>mostly </i>not a thing anymore. If lots of people touch stuff and then you touch it, sure, wash your hands after and be extra careful to not touch your face in the interim. Otherwise, stop worrying about it.</p><p>[... Food] is at most minimally risky, even if it doesn’t get heated enough to reliably and fully kill the virus. You don’t have to ruin all your food. People are often avoiding foods that seem risky. Once again, it makes sense that it <i>could </i>be risky, but in practice it’s been months and it does not seem to work that way. The precautions people are taking will incidentally be more than good enough to guard against contamination of food at sufficient levels to be worth worrying about. I mean, sure, don’t eat at a buffet, but it’s not like any of them are going to be open, and even then the (also mostly safe) surfaces are likely scarier than the food.</p><p>[...] Your risk is from the waiter, or from the other diners, being in that room with you for a while. Thus, takeout, delivery and/or eating outdoors.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with Zvi that it seems increasingly likely that surface transmission is rare, though he seems to be wrong that there are <i>no</i> examples (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P7crAscAzftdE7ffv/covid-19-my-current-model#comments\"><u>see comments</u></a>), and I haven’t seen a clear argument for whether the number of COVID-19 cases caused by surface transmission is closer to 1/10 of all cases versus, say, 1/10,000. Given my own circumstances, I’m likely to do things like “order delivery pizza” more often in the weeks to come, but I’ll also likely make use of <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/27/coronalinks-3-27-20/#comment-871536\"><u>Yao Lu’s tips</u></a> while infections are still commonplace in my part of the US:</p><blockquote><p>I’m a chemo nurse, this is what I tell my high-risk patients:</p><p>I personally don’t trust takeout that much because I think a lot of restaurant workers don’t have sick leave, so it’s more likely your food was prepared by someone symptomatic. But you can cut the risk to near zero by doing this:</p><p>1. Wash your hands well</p><p>2. Put your own bowl on your kitchen counter</p><p>3. Pick up the restaurant container, and pour the food into your own bowl</p><p>4. Throw away the restaurant container</p><p>5. Wash your hands well</p><p>6. Thoroughly heat up the food. (at least 70C for a minute, or whatever the best current guideline says)</p><p>If you do this, in this order, you are extremely safe even if someone coughed viruses all over the food and the container. Heat would kill the virus, and handwashing would prevent indirect transmission from the bag/container.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>E. Have emergency supplies.</strong></p><p>I would recommend stockpiling at least a month of non-perishable food. 2-3 months is even better.

So if it's not too much trouble for you, or if you're unusually at risk, it probably makes sense to sanitize packages too.</p><p>The easy version of this is letting packages sit in direct sunlight for a while before opening them.

The duration of C19 seems to be one of the unusual things about it – in Isabel’s case it peaked around day 8 (the worst of the fever), then again on day 10 (the worst of the breathing issues, which luckily were still mild).

It took her until Day 11 to say “I’m feeling a bit better”, and as an observer there were clear rallies and declines along the way, which made everything particularly nerve-racking: you never quite know if things have improved, and declines are especially frightening.</p><p>THE BEST-KNOWN SYMPTOMS MIGHT NOT BE THE WORST: If you’re like me, when you think of Coronavirus you think fever, dry cough and changes in breathing, which are the signature symptoms. Isabel had all of those, but for her the worst effects were exhaustion, nausea, aches and dehydration. She was weakened by it to a degree I’ve never seen outside very old and ailing relatives, well beyond any flu either of us have had. She needed a constant supply of painkillers and water (which she was often too weak to actually lift to her lips) and had zero appetite. In a non-pandemic – or if she was on her own – she would definitely have been in hospital. As it was, fortunately her breathing was never bad enough to need that.</p></blockquote><p>The \"ebbs and flows\" aspect of COVID-19 seems very common in anecdotal reports.

Throat is irritated.</p><p>3/18 - Day 10 - No more cough, no more chest tightness, no trouble breathing. Throat is slightly irritated but feels like I’m getting better</p><p>3/19-20 - Days 11-12 - Uh oh. Fever comes and goes throughout the day, much harder to breath, cough is back and is worse. The shortness of breath was sudden and very unpleasant.</p><p>3/21 - Day 13 - Today. Right now I feel better than I did all week. No fever, no difficulty breathing, and no cough.

I’m moving toward thinking of COVID-19 as a <i>vascular </i>or <i>clotting</i> disease at least as much as a respiratory one. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/coronavirus-asthma-risk.html\"><u>Asthma</u></a> <i>isn’t</i> a major risk factor for COVID-19 death; <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/why-covid-19-coronavirus-deadly-for-some-people.html\"><u>age, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension</u></a> are.</p><p>From the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/10/coronavirus-attacks-body-symptoms/?arc404=true\"><i><u>Washington Post</u></i></a> May 10:</p><blockquote><p>In the initial days of the outbreak, most efforts focused on the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 infects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, eventually working its way deep into the lungs, filling tiny air sacs with cells and fluid that choke off the flow of oxygen.</p><p>But many scientists have come to believe that much of the disease’s devastation comes from two intertwined causes. The first is the harm the virus wreaks on blood vessels, leading to clots that can range from microscopic to sizable. [...] The second is an exaggerated response from the body’s own immune system, a storm of killer “cytokines” that attack the body’s own cells along with the virus as it seeks to defend the body from an invader.</p><p>[...] “What this virus does is it starts as a viral infection and becomes a more global disturbance to the immune system and blood vessels — and what kills is exactly that,” Mehra said. “Our hypothesis is that covid-19 begins as a respiratory virus and kills as a cardiovascular virus.”</p><p>[...] ACE2 receptors, which help regulate blood pressure, are plentiful in the lungs, kidneys and intestines — organs hit hard by the pathogen in many patients. That also may be why high blood pressure has emerged as one of the most common preexisting conditions in people who become severely ill with covid-19.</p></blockquote><p>Oncologist Tatiana Prowell describes (on May 5) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aiims1742/status/1257541385999302656\"><u>a Swiss autopsy series</u></a> on Twitter:</p><blockquote><p>[...] pathologists who did autopsies on these 21 people who died of #COVID19 think lung damage &amp; blood clots in the smallest blood vessels (capillaries) of the lungs were the major cause of death. They found clots even in [patients] on blood thinners, which should’ve prevented them.</p></blockquote><p>And quoting <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nRX7uwT2wNvvmd2Yd/coronavirus-justified-key-insights-thread?commentId=hRzw8sejgnb5C8C7B&amp;fbclid=IwAR2yAsBi8eWjJ-2dQdO6VbE9CmAJfNn-W_h-re6coPQjouJrA3A5_jPibs0\"><u>CellBioGuy</u></a> (Apr. 13, Apr. 22):</p><blockquote><p>ACE2 is expressed on endothelial cells lining blood vessels. If you get bad viremia the inner sheath of blood vessels, especially in heavily infected organs, probably just gets all messed up.</p><p>[...] The virus may be causing abnormal inflammation and a whole-body, but especially concentrated in the lungs, hyper-coagulable state that is triggering microscopic blood clots in the lungs that are one of the main contributors to morbidity and mortality and ineffectiveness of ventilation.</p><p>[...] This hyper-coagulable state <i>might</i> explain the reports of anomalously low oxygen measurements in people that would ordinarily indicate death or [unconsciousness]. They might have small clots in the finger the sensor is on triggering temporary sporadic low blood flow. It also could explain more of the fact that ventilators are less useful than they thought - some people going on them probably didn't actually need them.</p><p>[...] Additionally, there are two bits of immunology that explain parts of this virus's behavior and suggest ways of hurting it. First, the virus evolved in bats in which the interferon response is on an absolute hair trigger, and accordingly in human cells it almost completely escapes the interferon response. This allows it to replicate to absurd viral loads before the immune system notices it, explaining the extreme infectiousness shortly before symptoms develop. Then when the immune system notices it, it goes all out on a huge viral infection, triggering an inflammatory response that is all out of whack and can do a lot of damage. This means that it is <i>vulnerable to inhaled interferon</i> pretreatment (<a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.982264v1\"><u>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.982264v1</u></a>). On top of this, it may be that anything that reduces the replication of the virus in this period before the adaptive immune system mounts a robust response could reduce the probability of progression to severe disease. If antivirals work out or if chloroquine is effective (given the biochemistry I am very hopeful!), <i>they will probably be most effective early via reducing the fraction of patients that progress to severe disease</i>.</p><p>Second, there is evidence that the virus is able to enter and destroy (but not replicate within) T-cells using the same receptor it uses everywhere else, triggering immune suppression and altering the inflammatory profile (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9\"><u>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9</u></a>). It lacks HIV's obscene dirty tricks and isn't actually replicating within them, so this would be a temporary thing until recovery.</p></blockquote><p>I want to emphasize that you may need to go to the hospital <i>on very short notice</i>. Serious COVID-19 cases appear to not-infrequently progress from 'little or no care needed' to 'serious care needed immediately' on very short timescales. E.g., from <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-medical-worker-describes--terrifying-lung-failure-from-covid19-even-in-his-young-patients\"><i>ProPublica</i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>I have patients in their early 40s and, yeah, I was kind of shocked. I’m seeing people who look relatively healthy with a minimal health history, and they are completely wiped out, like they’ve been hit by a truck. This is knocking out what should be perfectly fit, healthy people. Patients will be on minimal support, on a little bit of oxygen, and then all of a sudden, they go into complete respiratory arrest, shut down and can’t breathe at all.</p></blockquote><p>The second week of symptom presentation seems like it may be particularly dangerous. Please monitor symptoms carefully, even if your symptoms were relatively mild in the first week. From the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html\">CDC</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness. In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea [labored breathing] a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5–13 days). In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.</p></blockquote><p>Depending on how serious your symptoms are, and on how crowded nearby hospitals are at the time, you may want to go to the hospital even if your breathing is OK. If possible, talk to a doctor over the phone/video to get their recommendations. The above is meant to be advice about when you definitely <i>should</i> receive hospital-level care; but it's not necessarily smart to wait until the last moment.</p><p>All that said, for several reasons, it's often a bad idea to go to a hospital during a pandemic when it isn't absolutely necessary:</p><ul><li>You might not have COVID-19. Going to a hospital may then expose you to COVID-19, on top of your other illness. (Catching COVID-19 is much more dangerous for people who have another illness.)</li><li>You might have COVID-19 and end up exposed to much greater viral load early in your disease progression, which is likely to seriously worsen your symptoms.

How could this be?</p><p>We are just beginning to recognize that Covid pneumonia initially causes a form of oxygen deprivation we call “silent hypoxia” — “silent” because of its insidious, hard-to-detect nature.</p><p>Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs in which the air sacs fill with fluid or pus. Normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with breathing and other breathing problems. But when Covid pneumonia first strikes, patients don’t feel short of breath, even as their oxygen levels fall. And by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest X-rays). Normal oxygen saturation for most persons at sea level is 94 to 100 percent; Covid pneumonia patients I saw had oxygen saturations as low as 50 percent.</p><p>To my amazement, most patients I saw said they had been sick for a week or so with fever, cough, upset stomach and fatigue, but they only became short of breath the day they came to the hospital. Their pneumonia had clearly been going on for days, but by the time they felt they had to go to the hospital, they were often already in critical condition. [...]</p><p>We are only just beginning to understand why this is so. The coronavirus attacks lung cells that make surfactant. This substance helps the air sacs in the lungs stay open between breaths and is critical to normal lung function. As the inflammation from Covid pneumonia starts, it causes the air sacs to collapse, and oxygen levels fall. Yet the lungs initially remain “compliant,” not yet stiff or heavy with fluid. This means patients can still expel carbon dioxide — and without a buildup of carbon dioxide, patients do not feel short of breath.</p><p>Patients compensate for the low oxygen in their blood by breathing faster and deeper — and this happens without their realizing it. This silent hypoxia, and the patient’s physiological response to it, causes even more inflammation and more air sacs to collapse, and the pneumonia worsens until oxygen levels plummet. In effect, patients are injuring their own lungs by breathing harder and harder. <a href=\"https://www.esicm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/684_author-proof.pdf\"><u>Twenty percent</u></a> of Covid pneumonia patients then go on to a second and deadlier phase of lung injury. Fluid builds up and the lungs become stiff, carbon dioxide rises, and patients develop acute respiratory failure.</p><p>By the time patients have noticeable trouble breathing and present to the hospital with dangerously low oxygen levels, many will ultimately require a ventilator.</p><p>Silent hypoxia progressing rapidly to respiratory failure explains cases of Covid-19 patients dying suddenly after not feeling short of breath. [...]</p><p>There is a way we could identify more patients who have Covid pneumonia sooner and treat them more effectively — and it would not require waiting for a coronavirus test at a hospital or doctor’s office. It requires detecting silent hypoxia early through a common medical device that can be purchased without a prescription at most pharmacies: a pulse oximeter.</p></blockquote><p>Relatedly, Paul Bohm <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulbohm/status/1252977663796371458\"><u>notes</u></a>, “54% of asymptomatic cases and 79% of COVID-19 symptomatic cases on the Diamond Princess had ground-glass abnormalities in their CT scans.”</p><p>This suggests that even if you seem completely asymptomatic (or have very mild symptoms), you should periodically use a home pulse oximeter if there’s a nontrivial risk you recently caught the virus. Additionally, unusually fast and deep breathing is a thing to watch out for, even in otherwise asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people.</p><p>Added May 12: <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-analysis-recommends-less-reliance-on-ventilators/\"><i><u>Stat</u></i><u> reports Apr. 21</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>[...] The new analysis [... suggests that] unusual features of the disease can make mechanical ventilation harmful to the lungs.</p><p>[...] “In our personal experience, hypoxemia … is often remarkably well tolerated by Covid-19 patients,” the researchers wrote, in particular by those under 60. “The trigger for intubation should, within certain limits, probably not be based on hypoxemia but more on respiratory distress and fatigue.”</p><p>Absent clear distress, they say, blood oxygen levels of coronavirus patients don’t need to be raised above 88%, a much lower goal than in other causes of pneumonia.</p><p>[...] Covid-19 affects the lungs differently than other causes of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, the researchers point out, confirming what physicians around the world are starting to realize.</p><p>For one thing, the thick mucus-like coating on the lungs developed by many Covid-19 patients impedes the lungs from taking up the delivered oxygen.</p><p>For another, unlike in other pneumonias the areas of lung damage in Covid-19 can sit right next to healthy tissue, which is elastic. Forcing oxygen-enriched air (in some cases, 100% oxygen) into elastic tissue at high pressure and in large volumes can cause leaks, pulmonary edema (swelling), and inflammation, among other damage, contributing to “ventilator-induced injury and increased mortality” in Covid-19, the researchers wrote.</p><p>[...] There is a growing recognition that some Covid-19 patients, even those with severe disease as shown by the extent of lung infection, can be safely treated with simple nose prongs or face masks that deliver oxygen.The latter include CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) masks used for sleep apnea, or BiPAP (bi-phasic positive airway pressure) masks used for congestive heart failure and other serious conditions. CPAP can also be delivered via hoods or helmets, reducing the risk that patients will expel large quantities of virus into the air and endanger health care workers.</p><p>[...] “We use CPAP a lot, and it works well, especially in combination with having patients lie prone,” Schultz said.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>E. Take care of yourself.</strong></p><p>From Duncan Sabien:</p><blockquote><p>Symptom mitigation seems extremely likely to be extremely important, especially those related to the respiratory tract.

Temperature regulation.</p><p>The biggest thing I'm worried about is permanent post-recovery respiratory problems, and it seems to me that most of those are caused by symptomatic damage rather than by the direct actions of the virus itself.</p></blockquote><p>I believe that most (though not all!) sources these days think fevers are good by default, and you shouldn't try to lower your fever unless it gets dangerously high.

Based on a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CewTrCRfyCgW4NJQM/rob-bensinger-s-covid-19-overview?commentId=pCRS4sXaXG533YvYe\"><u>comment</u></a> from John Maxwell, I’m no longer recommending that:</p><blockquote><p>I just finished a video appointment with a cardiologist where we discussed the clotting thing. Even though he seemed to think I had COVID, and I recently had an abnormal EKG and some mild chest tightness, he thought it was better to avoid blood thinners. Apparently he has been receiving Cochrane reports on COVID before they are publicly available. He said that the increased clotting is usually in patients w/ some kinda predisposition and tends to be worse with more severe symptoms. Even for low-dose aspirin, he thinks the risk of bleeding is larger than the potential benefits. \"I've seen all these complications from blood thinners.\" (I'm 28 FYI.)</p><p>Note that despite <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7b3njJqE7fzurhFTM/daily-low-dose-aspirin-round-2\"><u>previous speculation</u></a> on LW regarding prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin for longevity, a <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/daily-low-dose-aspirin-found-have-no-effect-healthy-life-span-older-people\"><u>large clinical trial</u></a> found it wasn't useful in older folks (age 65+). Note this bit:</p><p>\"Significant bleeding—a known risk of regular aspirin use—was also measured. The investigators noted that aspirin was associated with a significantly increased risk of bleeding, primarily in the gastrointestinal tract and brain. Clinically significant bleeding—hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding in the brain, gastrointestinal hemorrhages or hemorrhages at other sites that required transfusion or hospitalization—occurred in 361 people (3.8 percent) on aspirin and in 265 (2.7 percent) taking the placebo.\"</p><p>At the very least, I suggest you change your recommendation from \"aspirin\" to \"low-dose aspirin\". Overall, I'm more inclined to trust secondhand accounts of Cochrane preprints than collections of anecdotes in the media.</p></blockquote><p>Added Jun. 2: Jim Babcock said on Apr. 28,</p><blockquote><p>My first-pass literature review turned up some claimed mechanisms by which platelets and clotting may serve an immune purpose. I don't know if that's what happening here, but there's a possibility that this works like fever reduction: helpful in extreme cases, bad in minor cases and early in the progression.</p><p>Low-dose heparin seems to be common hospital protocol now, so data should be forthcoming for that scenario. I don't know what recommendation to give to minor cases self-treating at home, though.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>H.

    "htmlBody": "<h2>Introduction</h2><p>This is aimed at those interested in a biological understanding of the basic features of a coronavirus, but who do not have a biological/chemical background to speak of&#x2014;if you haven&#x2019;t done biology or chemistry since high school, this should be for you. It starts at square one and it oversimplifies many things. That said, I hope it is at least clear, and allows you to read scientific papers on the features of SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) without getting too much of a headache. </p><p>Viruses mostly just use their host&#x2019;s (that&#x2019;s you) metabolism to make more viruses. To understand how that occurs, we will begin with some basic (host) cell physiology&#x2014;how DNA, RNA, and proteins relate to one another, and what a lipid bilayer is&#x2014;before moving on to look at the anatomy of a coronavirus, and then finally a handful of specific features that make SARS-CoV-2 so dangerous. </p><p><em><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: There should be nothing controversial or disputed here, and I have specifically avoided giving information that is contested. This is not least because I am a medical student, <strong>not </strong>a virologist or epidemiologist. The aim of this guide is <strong>just </strong>to introduce the basic science, nothing more. </em></p><p><em>Many thanks to Jaden Kimura for comments and proof-reading. </em></p><h2>How does a cell work, anyway?</h2><p>In your own cells, DNA codes for all of the proteins you produce, which determines how you build cells and, eventually, a body. Think of it as the source code. Short stretches of it are &#x2018;compiled&#x2019; (transcribed) onto RNA, which is a very similar but less stable molecule. Only RNA can be actually &#x2018;run&#x2019; by translating it into functional proteins. </p><p>DNA is double-stranded, but the two strands are not the same&#x2014;they&#x2019;re kind of chemical mirror images of one another. One is &#x2018;positive sense&#x2019; and the other &#x2018;negative sense&#x2019;. Because of the way that they mirror one another, they bind tightly together. When new RNA is made, it is &#x2018;copied&#x2019;, through a similar binding, from the negative sense strand&#x2014;it looks just like the <strong>positive sense </strong>strand. This means that your protein-making machinery (<strong>ribosomes</strong>) is all used to reading <strong>positive sense</strong> <strong>RNA</strong>. </p><p>The outside &#x2018;wall&#x2019; of a cell is made of a <strong>lipid bilayer</strong>. The bilayer is made up of molecules with a small polar &#x2018;head&#x2019; and a long non-polar tail. Because water is very polar (the electrons are clustered near the oxygen nucleus, making the hydrogens slightly positively charged), the polar &#x2018;head&#x2019; can form very stable relationships with water&#x2014;it is &#x2018;hydrophilic&#x2019;. As the opposite is true of the very non-polar part of the molecule (lipophilic/hydrophobic tail), the molecules arrange themselves to stable states where the tails are touching one another, and the heads are touching the water&#x2014;a bilayered sphere. Into this bilayer, different proteins can be &#x2018;inserted&#x2019; if they have a non-polar section (or sections) and polar regions such that they stably localise inside or through the lipid bilayer. </p><h2>How does a coronavirus work?</h2><p>Coronaviruses are <strong>positive sense, RNA, enveloped </strong>viruses. Hopefully you recognise some of those terms, but we&#x2019;ll just highlight the consequences of this particular structure. </p><p>The genetic material in a coronavirus consists only of positive sense RNA. It can therefore be shoved directly into your ribosomes to produce coronavirus proteins, without ever having to be modified by enzymes. This means that coronavirus RNA <strong>on its own </strong>is theoretically infectious&#x2014;if you injected it into human cells, it would use your ribosomes to assemble new virus particles.</p><p>In some viruses, the genetic material is basically the entire virus, packaged into some proteins (a <strong>nucleocapsid</strong>). Coronaviruses, however, also have an external <strong>envelope</strong> surrounding them. This envelope is made up of host cell membrane&#x2014;a fatty lipid bilayer, just like your own cells, but with a couple of viral proteins inserted into it. </p><p>Because the bilayer relies on the polar/non-polar relations to remain stable, molecules that are similarly structured-- with a polar and non-polar area (<strong>amphiphilic </strong>molecules) -- can disrupt the stability of this arrangement at sufficiently high concentrations. They insert into the membrane and pull the lipids apart into much smaller, now more stable, arrangements. Without a lipid bilayer, the viral particle cannot insert itself into cells effectively, and is inactive. Alcohol and soap are precisely such molecules, which is why they are so effective against coronaviruses. </p><p>The final feature worth noting about the coronavirus is the <strong>spike protein</strong>. This is a protein which binds to a host protein (on the cell surface) and causes the envelope to <strong>fuse </strong>with the cell surface membrane, releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm (the inside of the cell). Because different species, and different cell lines in a given species, express different cell surface proteins, this leads to the majority of both species specificity and &#x2018;type-of-infection&#x2019; specificity&#x2014;only some viruses are capable of causing respiratory infections, to take a completely random example. </p><h2>Why is SARS-CoV-2 so dangerous?</h2><p>There are essentially only two things that make a virus dangerous: how infectious it is, and how serious it is once you have it. The first is roughly described by the <strong>R0 </strong>(basic reproduction rate), and the second by <strong>the infection fatality rate</strong>. </p><p>The first major point is just how bluntly infectious SARS-CoV-2 is. The R0 is a measure of, on average, how many people an infected person will go on to infect (in a population where immunity is negligible). Seasonal flu has an R0 of ~1.5 &#x2013; each person infects, on average, 1-2 further people. MERS&#x2019; R0 was just ~0.7&#x2014;less than one person was infected per person, meaning it isn&#x2019;t really capable of spreading among humans. Current estimates of SARS-CoV-2 R0 vary a lot, but it looks like it&#x2019;s between 3 and 5. Exponential growth means that the difference between 1.5 and 3 is phenomenal&#x2014;over only 5 &#x2018;generations&#x2019;, a virus with an R0 of 3 will have infected ~245 people; a virus with R0=1.5 only ~8. </p><p>However, this clearly isn&#x2019;t the whole story&#x2014;SARS had a similar R0, and only infected around 8,000 people worldwide. Why? SARS cannot be transmitted from people who are asymptomatic. This means that isolation of people with symptoms is highly effective&#x2014;following containment measures, the effective R0 is thought to have dropped to around 0.4. However, as has <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9GyKccaJdLEbdhyTi/a-significant-portion-of-covid-19-transmission-is\">been discussed already on LW</a>, this doesn&apos;t seem to be true of SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, it seems that people are infectious for as much as 48 hours in advance of any symptoms. Secondly, it&#x2019;s likely (though, for obvious reasons, hard to prove) that a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases are either totally or mostly asymptomatic, particularly in children. Combined with a relatively long incubation period (averaging 5 days but likely up to 13 or 14 in the young), this means that by the time cases are presenting to hospitals in large numbers, the disease is already running rampant in the general population.</p><p>The other half of the equation&#x2014;severity of disease&#x2014;is fairly self-evident, not to mention well-discussed. Note that the <strong>Case fatality Rate (CFR)</strong> measures the % of those <strong>formally diagnosed </strong>with the disease who die. As it seems a significant number of those infected are asymptomatic (and therefore never diagnosed), the actually important number is the <strong>Infection fatality rate (IFR), </strong>which counts all those infected. Unfortunately this is almost impossible to assess accurately except in  specific circumstances (like where you have enough tests to do regular whole-cohort testing, to catch the asymptomatic cases), so CFR is used more commonly. </p><p>Current estimates of the CFR are around 2-3%. This is much lower than, for instance, SARS&#x2014;11%, as well as a number of other diseases in humans (TB; 43%, tetanus 50%, Ebola 83%). The real problem is, of course, that these diseases are much less infectious. Not only do they affect fewer people, but they affect fewer people <em>at one time</em>. Much higher numbers of people will require critical care beds and ventilators, which will not be available through the peak of the epidemic. This seems set to push the deaths into the millions over the coming months, particularly in poorer countries.</p><br><h1>Further Resources/Bibliography</h1><p><a href=\"https://research.fhcrc.org/content/dam/stripe/emerman/files/COVID-19%20Lecture.mp4?fbclid=IwAR28MoE82I51w_R4VmBELmZy_zukNVfLrdpzGeDJiSY-eFm2RC6bwZ8EdnU\">A talk with more in depth discussion of previous epidemics and SARS-CoV-2</a> (excellent not least because it&apos;s free)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mims-Medical-Microbiology-STUDENT-CONSULT/dp/0723436010/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mims+medical+microbiology&amp;qid=1585428250&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2\">Mims&apos; Medical Microbiology </a>(Chapter one in particular is likely to be useful if you can find a PDF)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Principles-Virology-Molecular-Biology-Books-ebook/dp/B084JJ5WVZ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=virology&amp;qid=1585428291&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\">Principles of Virology</a> (an excellent textbook if you&apos;re looking to go further; useful throughout for this topic)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Biocalculus-Calculus-Probability-Statistics-Sciences/dp/1305114035\">Biocalculus-- Stewart and Day</a>  (probably the least useful listed here)</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Update 11/09/2021:  Over a year later, Iceland now <a href=\"https://www.covid.is/data\">reports</a> 34 total deaths / 14757 total infections for a naive IFR of 0.23%, or a least 50% higher than the mean of this old simple estimate, and roughly 2x seasonal flu.</p><p>EDIT: updated with wider estimates to reflect potential sample bias</p><p>deCODE Genetics has<a href=\"https://nordiclifescience.org/covid-19-first-results-of-the-voluntary-screening-in-iceland/\"> tested a random-ish sample</a> of about ~5K Icelanders for COVID-19 and about 0.9% tested positive, which naively indicates ~3K true infections in a population of ~330K.</p><p>However, if we consider that the volunteer based sample is perhaps biased (the article suggests they would control for this but doesn't describe if/how), that suggests an estimate closer to the ~1k confirmed cases - say 2K. </p><p>On the other hand, if we consider the potential of false negatives from failed tests for those who already recovered, that suggests a higher range, perhaps up to ~5k. (The PCR test is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nataliexdean/status/1238518203736903680\">highly specific</a>, so we can ignore false positives)</p><p>Iceland has only 2 deaths so far for a naive IFR in the range of 0.04% to 0.2% to (we can probably ignore false negatives for deaths - as they are harder to miss in Iceland). Iceland's cumulative case count is clearly in a linear growth regime (past midpoint of sigmoid). They have 6 patients in ICU (<a href=\"https://www.covid.is/data\">Iceland data</a>), which has about a 30% fatality rate, and 19 in hospital with a 10% fatality rate so we can estimate the future total death count in the 2 to 8 range.</p><p>This results in a mean predicted IFR of 0.17% (6/3500)and a range of 0.04% to 0.4% (2/5k to 8/2k), similar to influenza but potentially a bit (2x) higher. The uncertainty range will eventually tighten as we know more about survival in their current hospitalizations.</p><p>This agrees with the Diamond Princess data which rules out IFR much higher than influenza. (see my analysis <a href=\"https://entersingularity.wordpress.com/2020/03/23/covid-19-vs-influenza/\">here</a>, or a more detailed analysis <a href=\"https://judithcurry.com/2020/03/25/covid-19-updated-data-implies-that-uk-modelling-hugely-overestimates-the-expected-death-rates-from-infection/\">here</a>) In that same post I also arrived at a similar conclusion by directly estimating under-reporting (the infection/case ratio) by comparing the age structure of confirmed cases to the age structure of the population and assuming uniform or slightly age-dependent attack rates similar to other viruses.  That model predicts under-reporting of ~20X or more in the US, so it's not surprising that the under-reporting in Iceland is still in the ~4X range.</p><p>The infection hospitalization rate of COVID-19 in Iceland is also in the vicinity of ~1%, similar to influenza.</p><p>This also puts bounds on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ittEKJuwcSyMYuFxo/the-case-for-c19-being-widespread\">how widespread C19</a> can be - with IHR and IFR both similar to influenza, there couldn't be tens of millions of infected in the US as of a few weeks ago or we would be seeing considerably more hospitalizations and deaths than we do.</p><p>The 'common cold' is actually caused by over 200 virus strains of different orders, so I wonder if years from now SARS-CoV-2 will be lumped in as a non-influenza virus strain in the 'flu' category.</p>",

Is this a serious enough problem to keep R0 above 1, and prevent successful suppression? </p><p>I have about a 4-week supply of food but I want to save it for the worst 4 weeks of the pandemic. I will take my chances with delivery/the local convenience store until then, both of which involve lower exposure risk than the grocery store by 1-2 orders of magnitude. According to <a href=\"https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections?sfns=mo\">some projections</a>, the worst 4 weeks are about to start. But that seems extremely optimistic to me. My naive expectation was that without social distancing the peak would be in June. Distancing should reduce how bad the peak is, but also extend it, assuming distancing is not sufficient to lower R0 below 1. </p><p>I can extend the life of the stockpile if Amazon Fresh ever becomes operational again. This involves non-zero risk, but one delivery a month from them is much less risky than daily uber eats/convenience store runs. </p><p>In an extended-peak scenario it doesn&apos;t really matter when I eat the stockpile because I am going to have to get at least some deliveries during the peak. But in a high and short peak scenario, both my ability to avoid all deliveries and the desirability of doing so are a lot higher. In a low and short peak (i.e. successful suppression), the desirability of avoiding all deliveries is less, but I maintain the ability to do so and I might as well, if I can predict it correctly. </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Consider two simple, non-exhaustive theories.</p><p><strong>Theory 1, Strong Materialism:</strong> The only ontological primitive is matter. This is to say that there is nothing but physical things, and everything that happens can be reduced down to the material. Minds and consciousness must then be some emergent phenomenon based on matter. For example, some people who take this view speculate that consciousness may be &#x201C;what an algorithm implemented on a physical machine (like your brain) feels like from the inside.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Theory 2, Strong Solipsism:</strong> The only ontological primitive is my own mind. This is to say that there is nothing (or at least nothing worth believing in) but mental phenomena. Someone who takes this view might say that they have no good reason to believe that their experiences have a physical antecedent, and everything that exists is just what&#x2019;s going on for them mentally. People with this view might point out that perceptions of things outside themselves don&#x2019;t actually indicate those things &#x2014; just the perceptions themselves.</p><p>There are also <em>dualistic</em> theories which assert the existence of both physical and mental primitives, but I don&#x2019;t want to focus on them here, and they&#x2019;re not too popular among the LessWrong crowd anyway. There are a series of problems with different forms of dualism involving the prior complexity of believing in multiple ontological primitives as well some curious means by which the physical and mental interact. It&apos;s generally agreed that dualistic theories would force us to believe in more unlikely phenomena than either materialism or solipsism and aren&#x2019;t comparatively plausible.</p><p>My impression is that most people who I&#x2019;ve listened to or read from who have discussed these ideas (including Brian Tomasik and Eliezer Yudkowsky), seem to prefer materialism. There are two good reasons people have for this. First, even though when I perceive something, it does not with certainty imply the existence of that thing (only of that perception), it is perfectly consistent with the existence of that thing. Second, I observe many people other than myself, and their behavior and feelings seem to be a lot like my own. Given both of these observations, the <em>likelihood</em> in Bayes rule for materialism is relatively high, while for solipsism, it&#x2019;s not.</p><p>I think that these two points are strong reasons to suspect that materialism is a good theory and may have an advantage over solipsism. But it seems to me that when many people discuss the question, they mention these two points, miss applying a crucial counterpoint, and go along discussing metaphysics as if solipsism weren&#x2019;t worth much consideration. I think this is a mistake.</p><p>Anyone who supports materialism has to bite a bullet. It implies that somehow, someway consciousness and qualia are phenomena that reduce down to the activity of physical systems. From a Newtonian perspective, atoms are much like billiard balls, bouncing around together, and from a quantum perspective, they are waves/particles interacting through forces and entanglements. But using either interpretation, how puzzling is the view, that the activity of these little material things somehow is responsible for conscious qualia? This is where a lot of critical thinking has led many people to say things like &#x201C;consciousness must be what an algorithm implemented on a physical machine feels like from the &#x2018;inside.&#x2019;&#x201D; And this is a decent hypothesis, but not an explanatory one at all. The emergence of consciousness and qualia is just something that materialists need to accept as a spooky phenomenon. It&apos;s not a very satisfying solution to the hard problem of consciousness. This belief in some mysterious ability for the mental to supervene on the physical is almost as <em>ad hoc</em> as the belief that dualists have in immaterial minds!</p><p>Suppose that you update on the evidence that you experience conscious qualia and your various perceptions about the world. How do the two theories compare? Both of them assume only a single primitive, be it the material or the mental (a huge advantage of either of these theories over dualism). But conditioning on the existence of consciousness, materialism must assume the existence of a strange phenomenon whereby physical things somehow cause qualia, and solipsism doesn&#x2019;t do a good job of accounting for much of the structure in observations and your perception of other people much like yourself. In this sense, materialism has a relatively low <em>prior</em> and solipsism has a relatively low <em>likelihood</em> &#x2014; qualitatively, at least.</p><p>Comparing these two posteriors quantitatively is hard, but it&#x2019;s not a lopsided debate like I think many people assume. There&#x2019;s definitely a huge advantage that solipsism has over materialism. So I recommend taking it seriously.</p>",

This is sampled from a set of 15 questions, some of the others aren&apos;t this bad, some are guessing the teachers password. One of the questions requires that you know that statistically significant means p&lt;0.05 and can look at a table of p values and say which numbers are less than 0.05. </p><blockquote>An educational psychologist believes that an individual&apos;s reading speed (in words per minute) and general comprehension abilities (scored out of 10) may be related to how well they do on a timed exam. To study the relative importance of these variables and the association between them, she runs a multiple regression and produces the following predictive model for exam score: </blockquote><blockquote>Exam Score =7.78 + (0.05*Reading Speed)+(5.77*Comprehension) </blockquote><blockquote>What exam score would you expect students to achieve if they have a reading speed of 120 w.p.m and a comprehension score of 5?<br>Select one:<br>o 4726<br>o 55.67<br>o 66.44<br>o 42.63</blockquote><p>What level of understanding is necessary to fully understand the question? </p><p>From a mathematicians perspective, Multiple linear regression is an algorithm based on variational calculus (Optimizing over a space of functions), to select the function that maximizes the probability density that a model consisting of a linear function from the vector space <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

You need continuus probability spaces, but probability isn&apos;t defined over arbitrary sets of real numbers, so you need sigma algebras, which brings you to set theory. You need to prove that the integrals exist, that the optimum slope exists and is unique, ect.</p><p>In short you need to understand a lot of maths to deeply understand what is going on. </p><p>How much understanding do you need to get the answer right. Suppose you have basic English comprehension, but all you know about the symbols &quot;385+*)&quot; is that they are some mysterious code that you can type into a calculator and it will reply in the same code.</p><p>You know that the answer has to be in this mysterious code, and the calculator doesn&apos;t have buttons for letters. You know its asking for an exam score,  so you type in the code for &quot;Exam score&quot;, but replacing the word &quot;Reading speed&quot; with the mysterious symbols &quot;120&quot;, and the word &quot;Comprehension&quot; with the symbol &quot;5&quot;.</p><p>Your calculator spits out an answer, it is one of the options available, you put it down. (You get an exact answer, no rounding needed)</p><p>Lets suppose your grasp of English was little better than your grasp of arithmetic. </p><p>You have no idea what an &quot;educational psychologist&quot; is. </p><p>You have a rough grasp of capital letters, you know that the first letter in words sometimes looks big or funny, enough to suspect that &quot;Reading Speed&quot; and &quot;reading speed&quot; are the same thing. None of the mysterious numbery things in the question match any of the answers, so you try typing the big numbery thing into a calculator. The calculator doesn&apos;t have any lettery buttons, so you replace the lettery things with the numbery things that are near them in the text. If you guess the wrong numbery thing the first time, you don&apos;t get an answer on the list, so if you know what a multiple choice test is, you will know to try another. </p><p>Maybe I am being a little scathing there, I am certainly assuming that the hypothetical person answering the question knows some exam technique, and are able go along with plausible guesses. But I would expect most people who knew basic English and arithmetic to be able to answer it correctly. </p><p>The basic problem is </p><p><strong>An exam question only measures if you have enough understanding to answer it correctly.</strong></p><p><strong>The amount of understanding needed to answer a question can be lower than it appears. </strong></p><p>The question references all sorts of advanced maths, giving the appearance of serious academic learning, but instead of asking you to show an understanding of that maths, it asks you something much simpler. </p><p>This is like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NMoLJuDJEms7Ku9XS/guessing-the-teacher-s-password\">guessing the teachers password</a>, except that the password is a procedure, not a direct answer.</p>",

Information intake must be triaged.</b></p><p>There is a very large amount of <i>new</i> publicly available information every day.  There are no slow news days.  “Keeping up with the story” in the way one would keep up with an evolving news story would be a full-time job.  </p><p>Many of us do not have time to do this, and I imagine many of those who do have time cannot tolerate the experience in practice.  In fact, there can be a tradeoff between one’s level of personal involvement in the crisis and one’s ability to “follow it” as a news story.</p><p>(I work for a telemedicine company, and after a day of dealing with the ever-changing impacts of Covid-19 on my work, I have relatively little patience left to read about its ever-changing impacts on absolutely everything else.  That’s just me, though, and I realize some people’s mental bandwidth does not work like this.)</p><p><b>2. Abstractions are needed, and the relevant abstractions are novel and contested.</b></p><p>Crucial and time-sensitive decisions must be made on the basis of simulations, abstract mental models, and other intellectual tools.</p><p>In some sense this is true of everything, but in most cases we have a better sense of how to map the situation onto some large reference class of past intellectual work.  When there is an economic downturn, the standard macroeconomic arguments that have existed for many decades pop back up and make the predictable recommendations they always make; even though there is no expert consensus, the two or three common expert stances are already familiar.</p><p>With Covid-19, this is not so.  All the intervention types currently under discussion would be, in their own ways, unprecedented.  As it struggles to follow the raw facts, the general public is also struggling to get its head around terms and concepts like “suppression,” “containment,” “contact tracing,” etc. which were (in the relevant senses) not part of our mental world at all until recently.</p><p>Thus, relative to most policy debates, this one has a strange frontier energy, a sense that we’re all discovering something for the first time.  Even the professional epidemiologists are struggling to translate their abstract knowledge into brief-but-clear soundbites.  (I imagine many of them have never needed to be public communicators at this kind of scale.)</p><p><b>3. There is no division of labor between those who make ideas and those who spread them.</b></p><p>There is a hunger for a clear big picture (from #1).  There are few pre-established intellectual furnishings (#2).  This means there’s a vacuum that people very much want to fill.  By ordinary standards, no one has satisfying answers, not even the experts; we are all struggling to do basically the same intellectual task, simultaneously.</p><p>None of us have satisfying answers – we are all the same in that respect.  But we differ in how good we are at public communication.   At communicating things that <i>sound like they could be answers</i>, clearly, pithily.  At optimizing our words for maximum replication.</p><p>It is remarkable to me, just as a bare observation, that (in my experience) the best widespread scientific communication on Covid-19 – I mean <i>just</i> in the sense of verbal lucidity and efficiency, effective use of graphs, etc., <i>not</i> necessarily in the sense of accuracy or soundness – has been done by Tomas Pueyo, a formerly obscure (?) expert on … <i>viral marketing</i>.<br /></p><p>(To be clear, I am not dismissing Pueyo’s opinions by citing his background.  I am hypothesizing his background explains the spread of his opinions, and that their correctness level has been causally inert, or might well have been.)<br /><br />The set of ideas we use to understand the situation, and the way we phrase those ideas, is being determined from scratch as we speak.  Determined by all of us.  For the most part, we are passively allowing the ideas to be determined by the people who determine ideas in the absence of selection – by people who have specialized, not in creating ideas, but in<i> </i>spreading them<i>.</i></p><p><b>4. Since we must offload much of our fact-gathering (#1) and idea-gathering (#2) work onto others, we are granting a lot on the basis of trust.</b></p><p>Scott’s latest coronavirus links post contains the following phrases:</p><blockquote><p>Most of the smart people I’ve been reading have converged on something like the ideas expressed in […]<br /></p><p>On the other hand, all of my friends who are actually worried about getting the condition are […]<br /></p></blockquote><p>These jumped out at me when I read the post.  They feel worryingly like an “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade\">information cascade</a>” – a situation where an opinion seems increasing credible as more and more people take that opinion partially on faith from other individually credible people, and thus spread it to those who find them credible in turn.</p><p>Scott puts some weight on these opinions on the basis of trust – i.e. not 100% from his independent vetting of their quality, but also to some extent from an outside view, because these people are “smart,” “actually worried.”  Likelier to be right than baseline, as a personal attribute.  So now these opinions get boosted to a <i>much</i> larger audience, who will take them again partially on trust.  After all, Scott Alexander trusts it, and <i>he’s</i> definitely smart and worried and keeping up with the news better than many of us.</p><p>What “most of the smart people … have been converging on,” by the way, is Tomas Pueyo’s latest post.</p><p>Is Tomas Pueyo right?  He is certainly good at seeming like a “smart” and “actually worried” person whose ideas you want to spread.  That in itself is enough.  I shared his first big article with my co-workers; at that time it seemed like a shining beacon of resolute, well-explained thought shining alone in a sea of fog.  I couldn’t pull off that effect as well if I tried, I think – not even if the world depended on it.  I’m not that good.  Are you?</p><p>My co-workers read that first post, and their friends did, and their friends.  If you’re reading this, I can be almost sure you read it too.  Meanwhile, what I am <i>not</i> doing is carefully reading the many scientific preprints that are coming out every week from people with more domain expertise, or the opinions the same people are articulating in public spaces (usually, alas, in tangled twitter threads).  That’s hard work, and I don’t have the time and energy.  Do you?</p><p>I don’t know if this is actually an effective metaphor – after all, I’m not a viral marketer – but I keep thinking of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation\">privilege escalation attacks</a>.</p><p>It is not a bad thing, individually, to place trust some in a credible-sounding person without a clear track record.  We can’t really do otherwise, here.  But it is a bad thing when that trust spreads in a cascade, to your “smartest” friends, to the bloggers who are everyone’s smartest friends, to the levers of power – all on the basis of what is (in every individual transmission step) a tiny bit of evidence, a glimmer of what might be correctness rising above pure fog and static.  We would all take 51% accuracy over a coin flip – and thus, that which is accurate 51% of the time becomes orthodoxy within a week.</p><p><i>Most of the smart people you’ve been reading have converged on something like … </i><br /></p><h2>#FlattenTheCurve: a case study of an imperfect meme</h2><p><b>Keeping up with the lingo</b></p><p>A few weeks ago – how many? I can’t remember! – we were all about flattening the curve, whatever that means.<br /></p><p>But this week?  Well, most of the smart people you’ve been reading have converged on something like: “flattening” is insufficient.  We must be “squashing” instead.  And (so the logic goes) because “flattening” is insufficient, the sound byte “flatten the curve” is dangerous, implying that all necessary actions fall under “flattening” when some non-flattening actions are also needed.</p><p>These are just words.  We should be wary when arguments seem to hinge on the meaning of words that no one has clearly defined.</p><p>I mean, you surely don’t need me to tell you that!  If you’re reading this, you’re likely to be a veteran of internet arguments, familiar from direct experience and not just theory with the special stupidity of merely semantic debates.  That’s to say nothing of the subset of my readership who are LessWrong rationalists, who’ve <i>read the sequences</i>, whose identity was formed around this kind of thing long before the present situation.  (I’m saying: <i>you if anyone should be able to get this right.  You were made for this.</i>)</p><p><b>It’s #FlattenTheCurve’s world, we just live in it</b></p><p>What did “flatten the curve” mean?  Did it mean that steady, individual-level non-pharmaceutical interventions would be enough to save hospitals from overload?  Some people have interpreted the memetic GIFs that way, and critiqued them on that basis.</p><p>But remember, #FlattenTheCurve went viral back when fretting about “coronavirus panic” was a mainstream thing, when people actually needed to be <i>talked into </i>social distancing.  The <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif\">most viral of the GIFs</a> does not contrast “flattening” with some other, more severe strategy; it contrasts it with <i>nothing</i>.  Its bad-guy Goofus character, the foil who must be educated into flattening, says: “Whatever, it’s just like a cold or flu.”</p><p><i>No one </i>is saying that these days.  Why?  How did things change so quickly?  One day people were smugly saying not to panic, and then all of a sudden they were all sharing a string of words, a picture, something that captivated the imagination.  A meme performed a trick of privilege escalation, vaulted off of Facebook into the NYT and the WaPo and the WSJ and the public statements of numerous high officials.  Which meme? – <i>oh, yes, that one</i>.</p><p>We are only able to have this conversation about flattening-vs-squashing because the Overton Window has shifted drastically.  Shifted due to real events, yes.  But also due to #FlattenTheCurve.  The hand you bite may be imperfect, but it is the hand that feeds you.</p><p><b>Bach, the epidemiologists, and me</b></p><p>Joscha Bach thinks #FlattenTheCurve is a “lie,” a “deadly delusion.”  Because the GIF showed a curve sliding under a line, yet the line is very low, and the curve is very high, and we may never get there.</p><p>Is he right?  He is definitely right that the line is very low, and we may not slide under it.  Yet <a href=\"https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/612592471097147392/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion\">I was unimpressed</a>.</p><p>For one thing, Bach’s argument was simply not formally valid: it depended on taking a static estimate of total % infected and holding it constant when comparing scenarios across which it would vary.</p><p>(This was one of several substantive, non-semantic objections I made.  One of them, the point about Gaussians, turned out to be wrong, in the sense that granting my point could not have affected Bach’s conclusion – not that Bach could have reached his conclusion anyway.  This argument was my worst one, and the only one anyone seemed to notice.)</p><p>Something also seemed fishy about Bach’s understanding of “flatten the curve.”  The very expert from whom he got his (misused) static estimate was still tweeting about how we needed to flatten the curve.  <i>All</i> the experts were tweeting about how we needed to flatten the curve.  Which was more plausible: that they were all quite trivially wrong, about the same thing, at once?  Or that their words meant something more sensible?<br /></p><p>The intersection of “world-class epidemiologists” and “people who argue on twitter” have now, inevitably, weighed in on Bach’s article.  <a

and semantic objections.  In fact, theirs are a strict superset of mine (see that last Bergstrom thread re: Gaussians!).<br /></p><p>I am not saying “look, I was right, the experts agree with me, please recognize this.”  I mean, I <i>am</i> saying that.</p><p>But I’m also saying – look, people, none of this is settled.  None of us have satisfying answers, remember.  We are all stressed-out, confused glorified apes with social media accounts yelling at each other about poorly defined words as we try to respond to an invader that is ravaging our glorified-ape civilization.  Our minds cannot handle all this information.  We are at the mercy of viral sound bites, and the people who know how to shape them.</p><p>What is it the rationalists like to say?  “We’re running on corrupted hardware?”</p><p>Carl Bergstrom championed a meme, #FlattenTheCurve.  He believed it would work, and I think it in fact did.  But Carl Bergstrom, twitter adept though he may be, is still someone whose primary career is science, not consensus-making.  In a war of memes between him and (e.g.) Tomas Pueyo, I’d bet the bank on Pueyo winning.</p><p>And that is frightening.  I like Pueyo’s writing, but I don’t want to just let him – or his ilk – privilege-escalate their way into effective command of our glorified ape civilization.</p><p>I want us to recognize the kind of uncertainty we live under now, the necessity for information and idea triage, the resulting danger of viral soundbites winning our minds on virality alone because we were too mentally overwhelmed to stop the spread … I want us to recognize all of that, and act accordingly.</p><p>Not to retreat into the comfort of “fact-checking” and passive consultation of “the experts.”  That was always a mirage, even when it seemed available, and here and now it is clearly gone.  All of us are on an equal footing in this new frontier, all of us sifting through Medium articles, twitter threads, preprints we half understand.  There are no expert positions, and there are too many facts to count.</p><p>Not to trust the experts – but to exercise caution.  To recognize that we are letting a “consensus” crystalize and re-crystalize on the basis of cute dueling phrases, simplified diagrams and their counter-simplified-diagrams, bad takes that at least seem better than pure white noise, and which we elevate to greatness for that alone.  Maybe we can just … stop.  Maybe we can demand better.  Wash our minds’ hands, too.</p><p>Our intellectual hygiene might end up being as important as our physical hygiene.  Those who control the levers of power are as confused and stressed-out as you are, and as ready to trust viral marketers with firm handshakes and firm recommendations.  To trust whichever sound byte is ascendant this week.</p><p>Thankfully, you have some measure of control.  Because we are all on flat ground in this new frontier, your social media posts are as good as anyone’s; you can devote your mind to making ideas, or your rhetorical skill to promoting <i>specifically those ideas you have carefully vetted.  </i>You can choose to help those with power do better than the status quo, in your own little way, whatever that may be.  Or you can choose not to.</p><h2>Okay, words aside, does the right strategy look like the famous GIF taken literally, or like a feedback system where we keep turning social distancing on and off so the graph looks like a heart rate monitor, or like a “hammer” reset followed by a successful emulation of South Korea, or</h2><p>I don’t know and you don’t know and Tomas doesn’t know and Carl doesn’t know.  It’s hard!  I’m hadn’t even heard of “R_0” until like two months ago!  Neither had you, probably!</p><p><a href=\"https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/covid-19/\">Marc Lipsitch’s group at Harvard</a> has been putting out a bunch of preprints and stuff that look reputable to me, and are being widely shared amongst PhDs with bluechecks and university positions.  Their <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041079v1\">most recent preprint</a>, from 3 days ago, appears to be advocating the heart rate monitor-ish thing, so yay for that, maybe.  But … this sounds like the same information cascade I warned against, so really, I dunno, man.</p><p>However, I will suggest that perhaps the marginal effect of sharing additional reputable-seeming takes and crystalizing weekly orthodoxies is negative in expectation, given an environment saturated with very viral, poorly vetted words and ideas.</p><p>And that your best chance of a positive marginal impact is to be <i>very </i>careful, like the people who won’t trust any medical intervention until it has 50+ p-hacked papers behind it, has been instrumental in the minting of many PhDs, and has thereby convinced the strange beings at the FDA and the Cochrane Collaboration who move at 1/100 the speed of you and me.  Not because this is globally a good way to be, but because it locally is – given an environment saturated with very viral, poorly vetted words and ideas.</p><p>That you should sit down, take the outside view, think hard about whether you can make a serious independent intellectual contribution when literally everyone on earth, basically, is trying to figure out the same thing.</p><p>And you know, maybe you are really smart!  Maybe the answer is yes!  If so, do your homework.  Read everything, more than I am reading, and more carefully, and be ready to show your work.  Spend more time on this than the median person (or me) is literally capable of doing right now.  <i>This is the value you are claiming to provide to me.</i></p><p>If you can’t do that, that is fine – I can’t either.  But if you can’t do that, and you still boost every week’s new coronavirus orthodoxy, you are an intellectual disease vector.  Don’t worry: I will hear it from other people if I don’t hear it from you.  But you will lend your credibility to it.  Whatever trust I place in you will contribute to the information cascade.</p><p>This work, this hard independent work collecting lots of raw undigested information, is actually what Tomas Pueyo seems to be doing – I mean, apart from framing everything in a very viral way, which is why you and I know of his work.  We are saturated with signal-boosts of the few such cases that exist.  We do not need more signal-boosts.  We need more <i>independent work like this</i>.  Please do it.  Or, if not that, then be like the lady in that very problematic GIF: don’t panic, but be <i>careful</i>, wash your mind’s hands, and (yes) flatten the intellectual curve.</p>",

I am new to both communities so I apologize in advance if I overstep any rules. If I have, please let me know! </em></p><p>Looking at <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/25-03-2020-who-urges-countries-to-ensure-the-continuity-of-malaria-services-in-the-context-of-the-covid-19-pandemic\">WHO&apos;s recommendation</a> to maintain malaria interventions and <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/newsitem.aspx?newsitem=Coronavirus-Covid-19-and-increased-AMF-funding-need-Update-25-Mar-2020\">AMF&apos;s response to COVID-19</a>, it sounds like reducing mortality of malaria can and will reduce mortality of COVID-19.</p><p>This seems to be based on the assumption that if you prevent a malaria patient from having to go to the hospital, then that frees up resources for them to focus on saving a COVID-19 patient.</p><p>So if we were to oversimplify this as an example:</p><blockquote>Let&apos;s say a hospital has 50 beds. There are 50 COVID patients and 50 malaria patients. Thus, you can only save half of them. If we were able to prevent malaria in those 50 patients, then the hospital can allocate all 50 beds to the 50 COVID patients - <strong>thus, saving everyone.</strong></blockquote><p>Now, I&apos;m very sure there&apos;s much more to consider than my oversimplification - so I would love to hear people&apos;s thoughts and be proven wrong!</p><p>---</p><p>EDIT: I reached out to AMF for further clarification and here is their response.</p><blockquote>There are several ways in which reducing malaria &#x2013; both morbidity and mortality &#x2013; helps reduce the impact of COVID-19.</blockquote><blockquote>First, if people are ill with malaria their immune system is less able to cope with the effect of COVID-19 so the impact of COVID-19 can be expected to be greater. This is consistent with those most at risk being people with &#x2018;underlying health issues&#x2019;. Increased malaria leads to a greater strain on already fragile health systems including taking up more intensive care beds.</blockquote><blockquote>Second, if people are ill will malaria, whose symptoms are very similar to those of COVID (high fever), (&#x201C;&#x2026;.the early symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, myalgia, and fatigue, might be confused with malaria and lead to challenges in early clinical diagnosis.&#x201D; Source: <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30561-4/fulltext\">Lancet article</a>) the identification and management of COVID-19 is made more difficult. There is a greater risk of mis/under-diagnosis (treated as malaria when in fact COVID-19) or over-diagnosis (treated as COVID-19 and perhaps a bed in a hospital allocated, when malaria is the illness), which makes the management of COVID-19 more challenging.</blockquote><blockquote>Third, if we delay desperately needed universal net coverage campaigns, and bednets are the most effective mechanism of preventing malaria, as well as other malaria control interventions, there is a significant risk, indeed a likelihood, that malaria will increase leading to further loss of life, illness, a greater strain on health systems trying to deal with COVID-19 as well as increased negative economic impact - if people are ill, they cannot farm, drive, teach, function.</blockquote><blockquote>For these reasons and as the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/25-03-2020-who-urges-countries-to-ensure-the-continuity-of-malaria-services-in-the-context-of-the-covid-19-pandemic\">WHO advises</a>, it is important that malaria control activities continue. These activities are likely to require sensible operational adjustments, including increased sanitizing measures and social distancing, to limit transmission risk.</blockquote>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Peter Hurford wrote a large, very comprehensive, research agenda over on the EA Forum. Here are all the questions:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Meta-Research</strong></p><p>1.) Just how bad are things right now? How bad might we expect it to get? What is the current state of play and what are various plausible scenarios forward? [PRIORITY]</p><p>2.) What paths to impact are available to us with regard to coronavirus related work? What is our rough guess of how this impact might compare to typical EA work?</p><p>3.) An insane amount of research is being produced at a rapid pace. How can we best consolidate and synthesize this information and get people up to speed quickly? [PRIORITY]</p><p>4.) An insane number of people are working hard on this, both inside and outside the EA movement. How should we best coordinate? [PRIORITY]</p><p>5.) What else could and should EAs do, other than these research questions?</p><p>6.) Are there places EAs should donate that focus on coronavirus response that are particularly promising to donate to, relative to existing charities EAs like?</p><p>7.) Does EA need a rapid response task force to coordinate inevitable future catastrophes? How can we be better prepared to respond to the next one?</p><p>8.) What do our biosecurity and pandemic prevention specialists think the rest of us should be doing right now?</p><p><strong>Policy Response</strong></p><p>9.) What, more precisely, is the “endgame scenario” for getting out of the coronavirus situation with minimal deaths? What kind of timeline might we be looking at?</p><p>10.) Will there be some situations or risks that could arise that make some of the desired endgames impossible or much more difficult to implement?</p><p>11.) How have various countries, states, counties, cities, private companies, non-profits, civil societies, etc. successfully or unsuccessfully handled the coronavirus policy response so far?</p><p>12.) How might we expect COVID to change policy advocacy over 2020-2022?</p><p>13.) What, if anything, can be done to change coronavirus response policy for the better? What about for future pandemics / crises?</p><p>14.) Low- and middle-income countries seem at particular risk of not being able to handle the coronavirus problem. How bad will this situation be? What should be done to mitigate it? Do we have any viable paths to impact?</p><p>15.) What is the actual cost-benefit of various pandemic responses? [PRIORITY]</p><p>16.) What opportunities does this give for us to improve institutions and policies more broadly?</p><p>17.) Are there any ballot initiatives we should consider for 2022 and 2024?</p><p>18.) Polling could be very valuable right now. What questions should we be asking the general public and how can we leverage their responses to effect change?</p><p><strong>EA Community Health</strong></p><p>19.) Does coronavirus pose a risk to the cohesion and stability of effective altruism movement? If so, how should we mitigate this? [PRIORITY]</p><p>20.) Are local groups still able to operate ok? What implications does this have for EA local groups strategy? Are any local groups at risk of collapse?</p><p>21.) A recession is something EA has never faced before. Could an associated fundraising shortfall lead to the collapse of any EA orgs? What can we do to mitigate this? [PRIORITY]</p><p>22.) Much EA-aligned “direct work” is severely disrupted or cannot happen. How does that affect these orgs? What should these orgs do differently? [PRIORITY]</p><p>23.) Many EAs and EA orgs are now suddenly working remotely for the first time. Do they have the resources they need to be effective?</p><p>24.) Are there other risks EAs should be preparing for that we aren’t?</p><p>25.) Could the EA movement use the existing groundswell of altruistic action to form better partnerships with non-EAs?</p><p><strong>Existential Risk Implications</strong></p><p>26.) Is this pandemic a catastrophic risk threat multiplier? How should this change EA’s approach to risk mitigation?</p><p>27.) How does this pandemic affect the balance of great powers? What implications does this have? Is this important to look into right now?</p><p>28.) What are the implications of widespread expansion of surveillance? Are there ways we can mitigate any risks?</p><p>29.) Could massive expansion of largely unrestricted funding to biolabs and other research produce any “dual-use” concerns?</p><p>30.) It seems like the world is now aware, perhaps for the first time in modern history, that catastrophic risks can happen. How should we seize this moment?</p><p>31.) What biosecurity policies should we try to implement?</p><p>32.) What does the COVID outbreak teach us retrospectively about how we should’ve handled this risk? Were the right systems in place?</p><p><strong>Animal Welfare Implications</strong></p><p>33.) It seems like the world is now aware, perhaps for the first time, that factory farming might pose severe health risks. This could be the biggest opportunity for a pro-animal campaign in modern history. However, mistiming this campaign could risk the biggest backlash to the animal welfare movement in modern history. Given this, how should we respond to this moment? [PRIORITY]</p><p>34.) How do we shift animal welfare work to the new online-only world and keep the animal movement from being curtailed?</p><p>35.) COVID has had implications for animal welfare. Does this create any new sources of animal suffering that we should take action on? Does it threaten to create any new risks that we can try to get ahead of?</p><p>36.) What will be the medium-term effect of COVID-19 and associated economic consequences on the demand for and growth of plant-based products?</p><p><strong>Other Implications</strong></p><p>37.) Does having widespread lockdowns change the balance of cause areas or create a “Cause X”?</p></blockquote></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>It&#x2019;s been a couple of weeks since I <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJBQ7GiyvFTBnSEEC/growth-rate-of-covid-19-outbreaks\">posted</a> regarding the growth rates of COVID-19 cases in various countries. Now, after these countries have implemented various control measures it is more clear how each measure effects growth rate. This post looks at the 10 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases.</p><h1>Death growth rates roughly match confirmed case growth rates</h1><p>Firstly, to check whether the confirmed case growth rates roughly reflect the actual growth rates, they can be compared to death rates (suggested in a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJBQ7GiyvFTBnSEEC/growth-rate-of-covid-19-outbreaks?commentId=sufWySv4cKZS7YACv\">comment</a> by Unnamed on my previous post). This doesn&#x2019;t show what the ratio is between the number of cases and the number of detected cases, it only shows whether the fractional growth per day in detected cases roughly represents the actual growth rate of the virus. </p><p>Obviously the death growth rate doesn&#x2019;t perfectly indicate the spread of the virus but it has different biases so if the two are similar then they probably at least somewhat reflect the actual growth rate.</p><p>A graph to compare growth rates of confirmed cases &amp; deaths of the 10 worst affected countries is <a href=\"https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~Bucky13/7\">here</a>. (Select country at the top)</p><p>(Note: For the y-axis I have used doubling time of infectious cases, which I&#x2019;ve defined as 10 days fairly arbitrarily. The actual length of time doesn&#x2019;t matter too much to the results but it&#x2019;s important to have some limit otherwise the recent China and South Korea results particularly make less sense. This makes the definition of doubling time for deaths a bit odd but it&apos;s good enough for the purposes of comparing the rates.)</p><p>Generally the rates match well. Iran and USA are the main ones where there is significant divergence (and both look more reasonable recently), the others all seem sensible.</p><p>In theory there should be a lag between cases and deaths which we seem to see in Italy and Spain but the data is too noisy to say for sure.</p><h1>Growth rates vs interventions</h1><p>I&#x2019;ve created <a href=\"https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~Bucky13/8\">4 different displays</a> of the cases data:</p><p>1. Cumulative confirmed cases</p><p>2. New cases per day</p><p>3. Doubling time for infectious cases</p><p>4. Fractional change in infectious cases per day</p><p>This last one is analagous to the effective reproduction number (<span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block; line-height: 0; text-indent: 0; text-align: left;

I don&#x2019;t really have much to add here, only that my initial calculations of doubling time had a small error so the doubling times are actually slightly lo (i.e. growth faster) than I initially reported.</p><h2>Growth with improved hygiene and social distancing has a doubling time of 3-5 days</h2><p>I also mentioned in that post that it seemed as though the doubling time for each country was increasing over time. This seems to me to represent additional simple precautions starting to be taken - such as improved hygiene and social distancing (short of a lockdown). </p><p>4-5 days is probably the best that can be achieved by these methods. Many countries have put these in place but none have been able to slow the spread of the virus sufficiently without taking additional actions.</p><h2>Growth of virus with partial lockdown has doubling time &gt;4 days</h2><p>Different countries have enacted different strictness levels in their lockdowns. These haven&apos;t been in place long enough to know exactly what&apos;s happening but they have had an effect and in Italy&apos;s case especially this has started to strongly increase doubling times.</p><h2>Growth with virus under control has halving time as low as 2-5 days</h2><p>The indication of having <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

This is probably seen better in the daily growth factor graph where a value &lt;1 indicates shrinkage.</p><p>We have 2 examples of countries which have had significant outbreaks and brought them under control &#x2013; China and South Korea. In both cases the doubling time starts climbing and keeps going until the active cases starts to decrease.

Possibly as China and South Korea loosen their restrictions they are starting to find that point.</p><h1>Country summaries</h1><p>The above is based on looking at the performances of various countries as described below.</p><h2>China</h2><p>China successfully applied a quarantine in Wuhan which reduced a rapidly growing epidemic to a handful of new cases per day. This quarantine was very strict compared to other countries on this list and the halving rate was 2-5 days. Other, less strict quarantines are likely to shrink more slowly.</p><p>More recently (11th March), the restrictions in Wuhan <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2020/0311/In-Wuhan-a-cautious-return-to-work-after-coronavirus-ebbs\">were eased</a> to allow citizens to go back to work. Since 18th March the virus has started growing again, so far averaging a doubling rate of 7 days or so. So far they are performing <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56\">the dance</a> successfully.</p><p>This seems to me the most likely next stage for Western countries. Exactly what rate the virus is managed to before it needs to be suppressed again is unclear. China at the moment should have plenty of tests and protective equipment so whatever they achieve is likely to be fairly close to the best possible scenario. Successful contact tracing could allow it to pause indefinitely without a full lockdown.</p><h2>Italy</h2><p>Doubling times have been increasing as the government has implemented additional control measures.</p><p>Lombardy (main outbreak in Italy) was locked down fairly early on. This increased the doubling time to 3-4 days. Later lockdowns which eventually covered the entire country increased this further such that the number of new cases per day appears to be levelling off. Most recently the Lombardy lockdown was tightened to decrease spread rate further. I don&#x2019;t think it will be long before the number of live cases starts to decrease.</p><h2>USA</h2><p>The growth rate in the USA shows the least evidence of slowing down. The growth rate in deaths is less so there may be something confounding the data on confirmed cases, such as increasing coverage of testing.</p><p>Many states, including the main centres appear to have implemented lockdowns in recent days so these should start having an effect shortly. Some counties in the Bay area implemented a lockdown earlier but John Hopkins have started aggregating by state and any effects haven&#x2019;t shown up in the California figures yet.</p><h2>Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, UK</h2><p>These have all followed fairly similar paths. Schools have closed between 2k and 5k cases (Switzerland ~1k). Lockdowns have happened between 5k and 10k cases.</p><p>Some countries seem very keen to say there is no lockdown (e.g. Germany, Switzerland) and their actions are correspondingly less strict. However they do entail a large curtailment of freedoms even if they are less strictly enforced.</p><p>France seems to have been most strict with their measures in enacting fines for violators although I don&#x2019;t know how effective these are.</p><p>If I borrow VipulNaik&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pBPiZQYBF9niRAMSq/coronavirus-the-four-levels-of-social-distancing-and-when\">taxonomy</a>, all of them are somewhere between level 2 and level 3 lockdown.</p><p>The UK and Switzerland are a bit behind the other countries in terms of cases but their actions have similarly lagged so haven&apos;t taken advantage of their initial advantage.</p><h2>Iran</h2><p>Iran is a strange one in that their total number of new cases per day has been fairly flat for a couple of weeks. I&#x2019;m not sure whether they have achieved a perfect <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R_0=1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">0</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> or whether their data is a bit funny &#x2013; their deaths data don&#x2019;t really reflect their confirmed cases although more recently they start to match more closely.</p><h2>South Korea</h2><p>South Korea are my favourite COVID-19 dealing country.</p><p>They essentially had it under control until the infamous patient 31 infected a large number in his church who then went on to infect more until there were &gt;5k cases associated with the church (more than half of the total number of cases in the country).</p><p>Despite the government never imposing any particularly strict orders, the entire city of Daegu was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-southkorea-cases/like-a-zombie-apocalypse-residents-on-edge-as-coronavirus-cases-surge-in-south-korea-idUSKBN20E04F\">deserted</a> within a couple of days of the patient 31 outbreak being confirmed. Between that and the intensive contact tracing and testing program the outbreak was quickly brought under control so that the hospitals weren&#x2019;t overrun and the fatality rate was kept down to 1.3%.</p><p>In 2015 South Korea experienced the second worst outbreak of MERS. There were 168 confirmed infections and 38 people died. <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2020/03/south-korea-learned-its-successful-covid-19-strategy-from-a-previous-coronavirus-outbreak-mers/\">This article</a> has an interesting summary of how the lessons from that outbreak fed into the COVID-19 response.</p><p>The halving time during the reduction phase was 3-5 days.</p><p>Arguably they have now entered their dance phase as <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R_0\\approx1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">0</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">&#x2248;</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p><h2>Japan</h2><p>I haven&#x2019;t included Japan on the graphs as nothing much has happened there which is pretty amazing. Japan is probably what South Korea would look like if there had been no patient 31.</p><p>They have taken precautions similar to Western countries before the latter implemented stricter lockdown. However they have managed to contain every cluster of cases before any have got out of control.</p><p>There has been a lot of talk about Japan not doing enough testing and that their numbers are artificially suppressed. My prior for this is pretty low &#x2013; this seems like an unlikely thing for a government to do, especially as it wouldn&#x2019;t take long before the truth came out as the death toll rose. </p><p>As for evidence against that hypothesis, Japan have done a lot of testing compared to the number of cases - 19 out of 20 tests come back negative (even if the absolute numbers are low). If they are deliberately suppressing their numbers then they&#x2019;re doing a really good job at testing the wrong people.</p><p>Japan&#x2019;s cases started to get serious in mid-Feb. I think it&#x2019;s clear that they managed to avoid any out of control outbreaks until at least the beginning of March, otherwise there would be so many cases by now that it would be obvious. If they can keep the virus in control for 3 weeks then they can probably keep it in control for a couple more up until now. If a cluster does get out of control in Japan then I expect it to go the same way as South Korea.</p><p>Of course the Japanese government could be lying about everything but again if they are I would expect better evidence from citizens/journalists by now. </p><h1>Summary</h1><p><u>Doubling times</u></p><p>Unmitigated spread: 2-3 days</p><p>Improved hygiene and basic social distancing: 3-5 days</p><p>Lockdown with work allowed: 5+ days (possibly cases decreasing)</p><p><u>Halving times (single sample each)</u></p><p>Full lockdown: 2-5 days</p><p>Flexible lockdown + Epic contact tracing: 3-5 days</p>",

I can't figure out when the change happened.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>I briefly look into the timelines of several technologies, with the hope of becoming marginally less confused about potential A(G)I developments.</p>\n<p>Having examples thus makes some scenarios crisper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(AGI will be like perpetual motion machines: proven to be impossible)</li>\n<li>AGI will be like flying cars: possible in principle but never in practice.</li>\n<li>AI will overall be like contact lenses, weather forecasts or OCR; developed in public, and constantly getting better, until one day they have already become extremely good.</li>\n<li>AI will overall be like speech recognition or machine translation: Constant improvement for a long time (like contact lenses, weather forecasts or OCR), except that the difference between 55% and 75% is just different varieties of comedy material, and the difference between 75% and 95% is between \"not being usable\" and \"being everywhere\", and the change feels extremely sudden.</li>\n<li>AGI will be like the iPhone: Developed in secret, and so much better than previous capabilities that it will blow people away. Or like nuclear bombs: Developed in secret, and so much better than previous capabilities that it will blow cities away.</li>\n<li>(AGI development will be like some of the above, but faster)</li>\n<li>(AGI development will take an altogether different trajectory)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I did not use any particular method to come up with the technologies to look at, but I did classify them afterwards as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After the event horizon: Already in mass production or distribution.</li>\n<li>In the event horizon: Technologies which are seeing some progress right now, but which aren't mainstream; they may only exist as toys for the very rich.</li>\n<li>Before the event horizon: Mentioned in stories by Jules Verne, Heinlein, Asimov, etc., but not yet existing. Small demonstrations might exist in laboratory settings or by the DIY community</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I then give a summary table, and some highlights on weather forecasting and nuclear proliferation which I found particularly interesting.</p>\n<h2>After the event horizon</h2>\n<h3>Weather forecasting</h3>\n<p>A brief summary: Antiquity's weather forecasting methods lacked predictive power in the short term, though they could understand e.g., seasonal rains. Advances were made in understanding meteorological phenomena, like rainbows, in estimating the size of the stratosphere, but not much in the way of prediction. With the advent of the telegraph, information about storms could be relayed faster than the storm itself traveled, and this was the beginning of actual prediction, which was, at first, very spotty. Weather records had existed before, but now they seem to be taken more seriously, and weather satellites are a great boon to weather forecasting. With time, mathematical advances and Moore's law meant that weather forecasting services just became better and better.</p>\n<p>Overall, I get the impression of a primitive scholarship existing before the advent of the telegraph, followed by continuous improvement in weather forecasting afterwards, such that it's really difficult to know when weather forecasting \"became good\".</p>\n<p>A brief timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"1835\">\n<li>Invention of the electric telegraph: Information could travel faster than the wind.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>1854 – The French astronomer Leverrier showed that a storm in the Black Sea could be followed across Europe and would have been predictable if the telegraph had been used. A service of storm forecasts was established a year later by the Paris Observatory.</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"1861\">\n<li>The first daily weather forecasts were published in The Times in 1861; weather forecasting was spurred by the British Navy after losing ships and men to the Great storm of 1859</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>1900s. Advances in numerical methods. Better models of cyclones (1919) and huricanes (1921), global warming from carbon emissions is first postulated as a hypothesis (1938); hurricanes are caught on radar (1944), first correct tornado prediction (1948). Weather observing stations now abound.</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"1944\">\n<li>D-Day (Allied invasion of Normandy during WW2) postponed because of a weather forecast.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>1950s and onwards. The US starts a weather satellite program. Chaos theory is discovered (1961). Numerical methods are implemented in computers, but these are not yet fast enough. From there on, further theoretical advances and Moore's law make automated weather forecasting, slowly, more possible, as well as advanced warning of hurricanes and other great storms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_meteorology\">Link to Wikipedia: Timeline</a>.

What happens when a certain kind of technological development is banned or restricted in one country but not in other countries where technological development sees heavy investment? <a href=\"http://lukemuehlhauser.com/some-studies-which-could-improve-our-strategic-picture-of-superintelligence/\">Source</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A brief summary:  Of the 34 countries which have attempted to obtain a nuclear bomb, 9 have succeeded, whereas 25 have failed, for a base rate of ~25%. Of the latter 25, there is uncertainty as to the history of 6 (Iran, Algeria, Burma/Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Spain). Excluding those 6, those who succeeded did so, on average, in 14 years, with a standard deviation of 13 years. Those who failed took 20 years to do so, with a standard deviation of 11 years. Three summary tables are available <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGnPaDIE01VWyowIxLkfzBBt-8OrcwdzJ3clqLpU10g/edit#gid=0\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Caveats apply. South Africa willingly gave up nuclear weapons, and many other countries have judged a nuclear program to not be in their interests, after all. Further, many other countries have access to nuclear bombs or might be able to take possession of them in the event of war, per NATO's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_sharing\">Nuclear sharing agreement</a>. Additionally, other countries, such as Japan, Germany or South Korea, would have the industrial and technological capabilities to produce nuclear weapons if they were willing to</p>\n<p>Overall, although of course the discoveries of, e.g., the Curies were foundational, I get the impression that the discovery of the possibility of nuclear fission, followed by \"let's reveal this huge infohazard to our politicians\" and the beginning of a nuclear program in the US was relatively rapid.</p>\n<p>I also get the impression of a very large standard deviation in wanting nuclear weapons badly enough. For example, Israel or North Korea <em>actually got nuclear weapons</em>, whereas Switzerland or Yugoslavia were vaguely gesturing in the direction of attempting it; the Wikipedia page on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Military_nuclear_program\"><em>Switzerland and weapons of mass destruction</em></a> is almost comical in the amount of bureaucratic steps and committees and reports, recommendations and statements, which never get anywhere.</p>\n<p>A brief timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1898: Pierre and Marie Curie commence the study of radioactivity</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>1934: Leó Szilárd <strong>patents</strong> the idea of a nuclear chain reaction via neutrons.</li>\n<li>1938: First fission reaction.</li>\n<li>1939: The idea of using fission as a weapon is floating around</li>\n<li>1942: The Manhattan Project starts.</li>\n<li>1945: First nuclear bomb.</li>\n<li>1952: First hydrogen bomb.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_nuclear_weapons_development#Before_1930\">Link to Wikipedia</a></p>\n<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>\n<p>A brief summary:  Wikipedia's history of cryptocurrencies doesn't mention any cyberpunk influences, and mentions a 1983 ecash antecedent. I have the recollection of PayPal trying to solve the double-spending problem but failing, but couldn't find a source. In any case, by 2009 the double-spending problem, which had previously been considered pretty unsolvable, was solved by Bitcoin. Ethereum (2013) and Ethereum 2.0 (2021?) were improvements, but haven't seen widespread adoption yet. Other alt-coins seem basically irrelevant to me.</p>\n<p>A brief timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1983: The idea exists within the cryptopunk community, but the double-spending problem can't be solved, and the worldwide web doesn't exist yet.</li>\n<li>2009: Bitcoin is released; the double-spending problem is solved.</li>\n<li>2015: Ethereum is released</li>\n<li>2020-2021: Ethereum 2.0 is scheduled to be released.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nuclear_weapons#Physics_and_politics_in_the_1930s_and_1940s\">Link to Wikipedia</a></p>\n<h3>Mobile phones</h3>\n<p>A brief summary: \"Mobile telephony\" was telephones installed on trains, and then on cars. Because the idea of mobile phones was interesting, people kept working on it, and we went from a 1kg beast to the first iPhone in less than twenty years. Before that, there was a brief period where Nokia phones all looked the same.</p>\n<p>A brief timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1918: Telephones in trains</li>\n<li>1946: Telephones in cars.</li>\n<li>1950s-1960s: Interesting advances are made in the Soviet empire, but these don't get anywhere.

Recognizing different fonts was a problem until it wasn't anymore.</p>\n<p>A brief timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1870: First steps. The first OCR inventions were generally conceived as an aid for the blind.</li>\n<li>1931: \"Israeli physicist and inventor Emanuel Goldberg is granted a patent for his \"Statistical machine\" (US Patent 1838389), which was later acquired by IBM. It was described as capable of reading characters and converting them into standard telegraph code\". Like many inventions of the time, it is unclear to me how good they were.</li>\n<li>1962: \"Using the Optacon, Candy graduated from Stanford and received a PhD\". \"It opens up a whole new world to blind people. They aren't restricted anymore to reading material set in braille.\"</li>\n<li>1974: American inventor Ray Kurzweil creates Kurzweil Computer Products Inc., which develops the first omni-font OCR software, able to recognize text printed in virtually any font. Kurzweil goes on the Today Show, sells a machine to Stevie Wonder.</li>\n<li>1980s: Passport scanner, price tag scanner.</li>\n<li>2008: Adobe Acrobat starts including OCR for any PDF document</li>\n<li>2011: Google Ngram.

Hidden Markov models (1980s) proved to be an important theoretical advance, and commercial systems soon existed (1990s), but they were different degrees of clunky. Cortana, Siri, Echo and Google Voice search seem to be the first systems in which voice recognition was actually good.</p>\n<p>A brief timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1877: Thomas Edison's phonograph.</li>\n<li>1952:\tA team at Bell Labs designs the Audrey, a machine capable of understanding spoken digits</li>\n<li>1962: Progress is slow.

The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A brief summary: Since the 50s, various statistical, almost hand-programmed methods were tried, and they don't get qualitatively better, though they can eventually translate e.g. weather forecasts. Though in my youth google translator was sometimes a laughing stock, with the move towards neural network methods, it has become exceedingly good in the last years.</p>\n<p>Socially, although translators are in denial and still maintain that their four years of education are necessary, and maintain a monopoly through bureaucratic certification, in my experience it's easy to automate the localization of a commercial product and then just edit the output.</p>\n<p>A brief timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1924: Concept is proposed.</li>\n<li>1954: \"The Georgetown-IBM experiment, held at the IBM head office in New York City in the United States, offers the first public demonstration of machine translation. The system itself, however, is no more than what today would be called a \"toy\" system, having just 250 words and translating just 49 carefully selected Russian sentences into English — mainly in the field of chemistry. Nevertheless, it encouraged the view that machine translation was imminent — and in particular stimulates the financing of the research, not just in the US but worldwide\". Hype ends in 1966.</li>\n<li>1977: The METEO System, developed at the Université de Montréal, is installed in Canada to translate weather forecasts from English to French, and is translating close to 80,000 words per day or 30 million words per year.</li>\n<li>1997: <a href=\"http://babelfish.altavista.com\">babelfish.altavista.com</a> is launched.</li>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"2006\">\n<li>Google translate is launched; it uses statistical methods.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Onwards. Google translate and other tools get better. They are helped by the gigantic corpus which the European Union and the United Nations produce, which release all of their documents in their official languages. This is a boon for modern machine learning methods, which require large datasets for training; in 2016, Google translate moves to use an engine based on neural networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_machine_translation\">Link to Wikipedia</a></p>\n<h3>Contact lenses</h3>\n<p>A brief summary:</p>\n<p>Leonardo da Vinci speculated on it in 1508, and some heroic glassmakers experimented on their own eyes. I'll take 1888 to be the starting date.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He experimented with fitting the lenses initially on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on a small group of volunteers, publishing his work, \"Contactbrille\", in the March 1888 edition of Archiv für Augenheilkunde.[citation needed] Large and unwieldy, Fick's lens could be worn only for a couple of hours at a time.[citation needed] August Müller of Kiel, Germany, corrected his own severe myopia with a more convenient blown-glass scleral contact lens of his own manufacture in 1888</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many distinct improvements followed during the next century, each making contact lenses less terrible. Today, they're pretty good. Again, there wasn't any point at which contact lenses had \"become good\".</p>\n<p>A brief timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1508: Codex of the Eye. Leonardo da Vinci introduces a related idea.</li>\n<li>1801: Thomas Young heroically experiments with wax lenses.</li>\n<li>1888: First glass lenses. German ophthalmologist experiments on rabbits, then on himself, then on volunteers.</li>\n<li>1939: First plastic contact lens. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and other plastics will be used from now onwards.</li>\n<li>1949: Corneal lenses; much smaller than the original scleral lenses, as they sat only on the cornea rather than across all of the visible ocular surface, and could be worn up to 16 hours a day</li>\n<li>1964:  Lyndon Johnson became the first President in the history of the United States to appear in public wearing contact lenses</li>\n<li>1970s-1980s: Oxygen-permeable lense materials are developed, chiefly by chemist Norman Gaylord. Soft lenses are also developed</li>\n<li>More developments are made so that lenses become more comfortable and more disposable. From this point onwards, it's difficult for me to differentiate between lense companies wanting to hype up their marginal improvements and new significant discoveries being made.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens#History\">Link to Wikipedia</a></p>\n<h2>In the event horizon</h2>\n<p>Technologies which are seeing some progress right now, but which aren't mainstream:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virtual Reality. First (nondigital) prototype in 1962, first digital prototype in 1968. Moderate though limited success as of yet, though VR images made a deep impression on me and may have contributed to me becoming vegetarian.</li>\n<li>Text generation. ELIZA in 1968. 2019's GPT-2 is impressive but not perfect.</li>\n<li>Solar sails. First mention in 1864-1899. Current experiments, like the IKAROS 2010, provide proof of concept. Anders Sandberg has a bunch of cool ideas about space colonization, some of which include solar sails.</li>\n<li>Autonomous vehicles. \"In 1925, Houdina Radio Control demonstrated the radio-controlled \"American Wonder\" on New York City streets, traveling up Broadway and down Fifth Avenue through the thick of a traffic jam. The American Wonder was a 1926 Chandler that was equipped with a transmitting antenna on the tonneau and was operated by a person in another car that followed it and sent out radio impulses which were caught by the transmitting antenna.\" It is my impression that self-driving cars are very decent right now, if perhaps not mainstream.</li>\n<li>Space tourism. Precursors were the Russian's INTERKOSMOS, starting as early as 1978. Dennis Tito was the first space tourist in 2001 for 20 million; SpaceX hopes to make it cheaper in the coming decades.</li>\n<li>Prediction systems. Systems exist such as PredictionBook, Betfair, Metaculus, PredictIt, Augur, Foretold, The Good Judgement Project, etc. but they haven't found widespread adoption yet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Before the event horizon</h2>\n<p>For the sake of completeness, I came up with some technologies which are \"beyond the event horizon\". These are technologies mentioned in stories by Jules Verne, Heinlein, Asimov, etc., but which <em>haven't</em> been implemented yet. Small demonstrations might exist in laboratory settings or by the DYI community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flying cars. Though prototypes could be found since at least the 1926, fuel efficiency, bureaucratic regulations, noise concerns, etc., have prevented flying cars from being successful. Companies exist which will sell you a flying car if you have $100,000 and a pilot's license, though.</li>\n<li>Teleportation. \"Perhaps the earliest science fiction story to depict human beings achieving the ability of teleportation in science fiction is Edward Page Mitchell's 1877 story The Man Without a Body, which details the efforts of a scientist who discovers a method to disassemble a cat's atoms, transmit them over a telegraph wire, and then reassemble them. When he tries this on himself...\". \"An actual teleportation of matter has never been realized by modern science (which is based entirely on mechanistic methods). It is questionable if it can ever be achieved because any transfer of matter from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them violates Newton's laws, a cornerstone of physics.\" No success as of yet.</li>\n<li>Space colonization. \"The first known work on space colonization was <em>The Brick Moon</em>, a work of fiction published in 1869 by Edward Everett Hale, about an inhabited artificial satellite\".

What follows is a summary table; below it are some quotes on the history of weather forecasting and nuclear proliferation which I found particularly interesting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NunoSempere/nunosempere.github.io/master/rat/TechTimelinesTable.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Highlights from the history of weather forecasting.</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is some evidence that Democritus predicted changes in the weather, and that he used this ability to convince people that he could predict other future events</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Several years after Aristotle's book (350 BC), his pupil Theophrastus puts together a book on weather forecasting called <em>The Book of Signs</em>. Various indicators such as solar and lunar halos formed by high clouds are presented as ways to forecast the weather. The combined works of Aristotle and Theophrastus have such authority they become the main influence in the study of clouds, weather and weather forecasting for nearly 2000 years</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During his second voyage Christopher Columbus experiences a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean, which leads to the first written European account of a hurricane</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was not until the invention of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 160 kilometres per day (100 mi/d), but was more typically 60–120 kilometres per day (40–75 mi/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But calculated by hand on threadbare data, the forecasts were often awry. In April 1862 the newspapers reported: \"Admiral FitzRoy's weather prophecies in the Times have been creating considerable amusement during these recent April days, as a set off to the drenchings we've had to endure. April has been playing with him roughly, to show that she at least can flout the calculations of science, whatever the other months might do.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction. In 1922, English scientist Lewis Fry Richardson published \"Weather Prediction By Numerical Process\", after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised, to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, and the size of the grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sadly, Richardson’s forecast factory never came to pass. But twenty-eight years later, in 1950, the first modern electrical computer, eniac, made use of his methods and generated a weather forecast. The Richardsonian method proved to be remarkably accurate. The only downside: the twenty-four-hour forecast took about twenty-four hours to produce. The math, even when aided by an electronic brain, could only just keep pace with the weather.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Highlights from the history of nuclear proliferation.</h2>\n<p>The webpage of the Institute for Science and Internation Security has this <a href=\"https://isis-online.org/nuclear-weapons-programs\">this compendium</a> on the history of nuclear capabilities. Although <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Science_and_International_Security\">the organization as such </a> remains influential, the ressource above is annoying to navigate, and may contain factual inaccuracies (e.g., Spain's nuclear ambitions both during the dictatorship and during the democratic period). Improving that online ressource might be a small project for an aspiring EA.</p>\n<p>On the origins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 1934, Tohoku University professor Hikosaka Tadayoshi's \"atomic physics theory\" was released. Hikosaka pointed out the huge energy contained by nuclei and the possibility that both nuclear power generation and weapons could be created.[3] In December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to Naturwissenschaften reporting that they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons;[4] simultaneously, they communicated these results to Lise Meitner. Meitner, and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, correctly interpreted these results as being nuclear fission[5] and Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939.[6] Physicists around the world immediately realized that chain reactions could be produced and notified their governments of the possibility of developing nuclear weapons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Modern country capabilities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like other countries of its size and wealth, Germany has the skills and resources to create its own nuclear weapons quite quickly if desired\nSouth Korea has the raw materials and equipment to produce a nuclear weapon but has not opted to make one\nToday, Japan's nuclear energy infrastructure makes it capable of constructing nuclear weapons at will. The de-militarization of Japan and the protection of the United States' nuclear umbrella have led to a strong policy of non-weaponization of nuclear technology, but in the face of nuclear weapons testing by North Korea, some politicians and former military officials in Japan are calling for a reversal of this policy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In general, the projects of Switzerland and Yugoslavia were characterized by bureacratic fuckaroundism, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Military_nuclear_program\">Wikipedia page on their nuclear efforts</a> is actually amusing because of the abundance of committees which never got anywhere:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The secret Study Commission for the Possible Acquisition of Own Nuclear Arms was instituted by Chief of General Staff Louis de Montmollin with a meeting on 29 March 1957.[8][12][13] The aim of the commission was to give the Swiss Federal Council an orientation towards \"the possibility of the acquisition of nuclear arms in Switzerland.\"[12] The recommendations of the commission were ultimately favorable.[8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The authors complained that the weapons effort had been hindered by Yugoslav bureaucracy and the concealment from the scientific leadership of key information regarding the organization of research efforts. It offers a number of specific illustrations about how this policy of concealment, “immeasurably sharper than that of any country, except in the Soviet bloc,” might hamper the timely purchase of 10 tons of heavy water from Norway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, the heterogeneity is worrying. Some countries (Israel) displayed ruthlessness and competency, whereas others got dragged down by bureaucracy. I suspect that this heterogeneity would also be the case for new technologies.</p>\n<p>Cooperation between small countries:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some scholars believe the Romanian military nuclear program to have started in 1984, however, others have found evidence that the Romanian leadership may have been pursuing nuclear hedger status earlier than this, in 1967 (see, for example, the statements made toward Israel, paired with the minutes of the conversation between the Romanian and North Korean dictators, where Ceauşescu said, \"if we wish to build an atomic bomb, we should collaborate in this area as well\")</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The same report revealed that Brazil's military regime secretly exported eight tons of uranium to Iraq in 1981</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In accord with three presidential decrees of 1960, 1962 and 1963, Argentina supplied about 90 tons of unsafeguarded yellowcake (uranium oxide) to Israel to fuel the Dimona reactor, reportedly creating the fissile material for Israel's first nuclear weapons.[11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Syria was accused of pursuing a military nuclear program with a reported nuclear facility in a desert Syrian region of Deir ez-Zor. The reactor's components were believed to have been designed and manufactured in North Korea, with the reactor's striking similarity in shape and size to the North Korean Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. The nuclear reactor was still under construction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Veto powers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These five states are known to have detonated a nuclear explosive before 1 January 1967 and are thus nuclear weapons states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. They also happen to be the UN Security Council's permanent members with veto power on UNSC resolutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>China:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>China[6] became the first nation to propose and pledge NFU policy when it first gained nuclear capabilities in 1964, stating \"not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time or under any circumstances.\" During the Cold War, China decided to keep the size of its nuclear arsenal small, rather than compete in an international arms race with the United States and the Soviet Union.[7][8] China has repeatedly reaffirmed its no-first-use policy in recent years, doing so in 2005, 2008, 2009 and again in 2011. China has also consistently called on the United States to adopt a no-first-use policy, to reach an NFU agreement bilaterally with China, and to conclude an NFU agreement among the five nuclear weapon states. The United States has repeatedly refused these calls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Russia recently <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/21/europe/putin-coronavirus-russia-intl/index.html?fbclid=IwAR2Jv0AnJuBFcydJXzg2TyqgfqpO_WTMBI_wHokez-30t-z_vh2q_l-EOkU\">attracted</a> attention as it reported fewer CV cases than other countries. Probably the best explanation is under-reporting and under-testing.  Other explanations are shorter life expectancy and higher home temperature.</p><p>Russia government is taking some measures against coronavirus, but they seem to be not radical or effective. Testing is not widespread, though some private companies are allowed to test now, as of March 26. Before it, only 3 consequent positive tests including the one in Novosibirsk Vector (the military bio lab where was an explosion in fall 2019 and which preserves a collection of deadly viruses) were needed to establish &#x421;ovid-19 officially. It created a backlog of testing. Also, mostly the people returned from abroad were tested, not locals, which created an illusion of no local transmission.&#xA0;</p><p>One may expect that Putin would act cruelly to stop the pandemic, maybe even put <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-putin-lions-coronavirus-loc/false-claim-putin-released-lions-on-the-streets-of-russia-to-enforce-coronavirus-lockdown-idUSKBN21C371\">lions</a> on the streets as in one meme, but he acted very mildly, not in Modi style.</p><p>From 28 of March national holiday is declared, which is not lockdown (lockdown requires to waive rents and the state may have to pay for it, which it doesn&#x2019;t want). Many people are parting on warmer areas, and the spring is surprising early and warm. Cafe and parks will be closed from tomorrow. From my observations, only starting from today, I can see a significant number of people in masks on streets (like 10-20 per cent). People above 65 are not allowed to go out and some were fined, but many still out. Schools are online.&#xA0;</p><p>Several facts about CV in Russia:</p><ul><li>As of 27 of March: Russia: 1036 cases, <a href=\"https://www.mos.ru/city/projects/covid-19/\">703</a> in Moscow.</li><li>Age of recent CV deaths in Russia: 45m (abroad, in Cuba, diabetic), 70, 73, 79f (died from clot), 88, 56f (+cancer).</li><li>The reaction to the pandemic was delayed because they didn&#x2019;t want to spoil important voting on new constitution April 22. Now it postponed.</li><li>The official number is growing, but not as a quick exponent like in NY. May grow more after testing will be expanded.</li><li>Male median life expectancy in Russia (not median age) is 67. vs 80 in Italy. May result in fewer deaths.&#xA0;</li><li>Russia typically has a warmer temperature in houses: 25 C is the norm. It may kill virus indoors. Italy doesn&#x2019;t have heating in winter.</li></ul><p>Russia decided to go in the oil war with Saudi and US shale which was an obvious mistake. Global demand failed 15 Mb because of CV, and Russia&#x2019;s export of 5 Mb could be completely replaced by export from Arab countries. Oil prices could be even negative short term. It also means no investment in oil production in the world and could result in oil shortages in 3-5 years from now, as existing wells decline 5-10 per cent a year. Not clear, how CV will affect renewables.&#xA0;</p><p>Russia has <a href=\"https://www.rbc.ru/business/27/03/2020/5e7de7ca9a7947d226ca6b26?from=from_main\">limited</a> the export of grain and some outs to keep internal prices lower. Russia is <a href=\"https://blogs.platts.com/2019/12/27/russia-global-wheat-exports/\">exporting</a> 10-20 per cent of world wheat.&#xA0;There is a long term tradition of hoarding in Russia and many people bought 1-3 month supply of food including flour. <a href=\"flour.&#xA0;https://www.rbc.ru/business/27/03/2020/5e7de7ca9a7947d226ca6b26?from=from_main\n\"><br></a></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Note: the original article has been split into two since I think the two points were only vaguely related, I will leave it as is here, since I&apos;d rather not re-post stuff and I think the audience on LW might see the &quot;link&quot; between the two separate ideas presented here.</p><h2>A pragmatic guide</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s begin with a gentle introduction in to the field of AI risk -  possibly unrelated to the broader topic, but it&#x2019;s what motivated me to  write about the matter; it&#x2019;s also a worthwhile perspective to start the  discussion from. I hope for this article to be part musing on what we  should assume machine learning can do and why we&#x2019;d make those  assumptions, part reference guide for &#x201C;when not to be amazed that a  neural network can do something&#x201D;.</p><h2>The Various hues of AI risk</h2><p>I&#x2019;ve often had a bone to pick against &#x201C;AI risk&#x201D; or, as I&#x2019;ve referred  to it, &#x201C;AI alarmism&#x201D;. When evaluating AI risk, there are multiple views  on the location of the threat and the perceived warning signs.</p><h3>1. The Bostromian position</h3><p>I would call one of these viewpoints the &#x201C;Bostromian position&#x201D;, which seems to be mainly promoted by <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a>, philosophers like Nick Bostrom and on forums such as <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/\">AI Alignment</a>.</p><p>It&#x2019;s hard to summarize without apparently straw-man arguments, e.g.  &#x201C;AIX + Moore&#x2019;s law means that all powerful superhuman intelligence is  dangerous, inevitable and close.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s partly because I&#x2019;ve never seen a  consistent top-to-bottom reasoning for it. Its proponents always seem  to start by assuming things which I wouldn&#x2019;t hold as given about the  ease of data collection, the cost of computing power, the usefulness of  intelligence.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve tried to argue against this position, the summary of my view can probably be found in <a href=\"https://blog.cerebralab.com/Artificial_general_intelligence_is_here,_and_it%27s_useless\">&#x201C;Artificial general intelligence is here, and it&apos;s useless&#x201D;</a>.  Whilst - for the reasons mentioned there - I don&#x2019;t see it as  particularly stable, I think it&#x2019;s not fundamentally flawed; I could see  myself arguing pro or con.</p><h3>2. The Standard Position</h3><p>Advocated by people ranging from my friends, to politicians, to  respectable academics, to CEOs of large tech companies. It is perhaps  best summarized in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell\">Stuart Russell&#x2019;s</a> book <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44767248-human-compatible\">Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control</a>.</p><p>This viewpoint is mainly based around real-world use cases for AI  (where AI can be understood as &#x201C;machine learning&#x201D;). People adopting this  perspective are not wrong in being worried, but rather in being worried  about the wrong thing.</p><p>It&#x2019;s wrong to be upset by Facebook or Youtube using an algorithm to  control and understand user preferences and blaming it on &#x201C;AI&#x201D;, rather  than on people not being educated enough to use TOR, install a tracking  blocker, use Ublock Origin and not center their entire life around  conspiracy videos in their youtube feed or in anti-vaccination facebook  groups.</p><p>It&#x2019;s wrong to be alarmed by Amazon making people impulse-buy via a  better understanding of their preferences , and thus getting them into  inescapable debt, rather than by the legality of providing unethically  leveraged debt so easily.</p><p>It&#x2019;s wrong to fuss about automated trading being able to cause sudden  large dips in the market, rather than about having markets so unstable  and so focused on short-term trading as to make this the starting point  of the whole argument.</p><p>It&#x2019;s wrong to worry about NLP technology being used to implement  preventive policing measures, rather than about governments being  allowed to steal their citizens&#x2019; data, to request backdoors into devices  and to use preventive policing to begin with.</p><p>It&#x2019;s wrong to worry about the Chinese Communist Party using facial  recognition and tracking technology to limit civil rights; Worry instead  about CCP ruling via a brutal dictatorship that implements such  measures without anybody doing something against it.</p><p>But I digress, though I ought to give a full rebuttal of this position at some point.</p><h3>3. The misinformed position</h3><p>A viewpoint distinct from the previous two. It stems from  misunderstanding what machine learning systems can already do. It  basically consists in panicking over &#x201C;new developments&#x201D; which actually  have existed for decades.</p><p>This view is especially worth fighting against, since it&#x2019;s based on  misinformation. Whereas with categories 1 and 2 I can see valid  arguments arising for regulating or better understanding machine  learning systems (or AI systems in general), people in the third  category just don&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s going on, so they are prone to  adopt any view out of sheer fear or need of belonging, without truly  understanding the matter.</p><p>Until recently I thought this kind of task was better left to PBS. In  hindsight, I&#x2019;ve seen otherwise smart individuals being amazed that &#x201C;AI&#x201D;  can solve a problem which anyone that has actually worked with machine  learning would have been able to tell you is obviously solvable and has  been since forever.</p><p>Furthermore, I think addressing this viewpoint is relevant, as it&#x2019;s  actually challenging and interesting. The question of &#x201C;What are the  problems we should assume can be solved with machine learning?&#x201D;, or even  narrower and more focused on current developments &#x201C;What are the  problems we should assume a neural network should be able to solve?&#x201D;, is  one I haven&#x2019;t seen addressed much.</p><p>There are theories like PAC learning and AIX which at a glance seem  to revolve around this, as it pertains to machine learning in general,  but if actually tried in practice won&#x2019;t yield any meaningful answer.</p><h2>How people misunderstand what neural networks can do</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s look at the general pattern of fear generated by misunderstanding the machine learning capabilities we&#x2019;ve had for decades.</p><ul><li>Show a smart but relatively uninformed person - a philosophy PhD  or an older street-smart businessman - a deep learning party trick.<br> </li><li>Give them the most convoluted and scary explanation of why it  works. E.g. Explain Deep-Dream by using incomplete neurological data  about the visual cortex and human image processing, rather than just  saying it&#x2019;s the outputs of a complex edge detector overfit to recognize  dog faces.<br> </li><li>Wait for them to write an article about it in VOX &amp; co<br> </li></ul><p>An example that originally motivated this article is Scott Alexander&#x2019;s article post about <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/\">being amazed that GPT-2 is able to learn how to play chess, poorly</a>.</p><p>It seems to imply that GPT-2 playing chess well enough not to lose  very badly against a medicore opponent (the author) is impressive and  surprising.</p><p>Actually, the fact that a 1,500,000,000-parameter model designed for  sequential inputs can be trained to kind of play chess is rather  unimpressive, to say the least. I would have been astonished if GPT-2  were unable to play chess. Fully connected models a hundred times  smaller ( https://github.com/pbaer/neural-chess) could do that more than  2 years ago.</p><p>The successful training of GPT-2 is not a feat because if a problem  like chess has been already solved using various machine learning models  we can assume it can be done with a generic neural network architecture  (e.g. any given FC net or a FC net with a few attention layers)  hundreds or thousands of times larger in terms of parameters.</p><h2>When to assume a neural network can solve a problem</h2><p>In the GPT-2 example, transformers (i.e. the BERT-like models inspired by the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf\">&#x201C;Attention is all you need&#x201D;</a>  paper&#x2019;s proposed design) are pretty generic as far as NN architectures  go. Not as generic as a fully connected net, arguably; they seem to  perform more efficiently (in terms of training time and model size) on  many tasks, and they are much better on most sequential input tasks.</p><p>So when should we assume that such generic NN architectures can solve a problem?</p><p>The answer might ease uniformed awe and might be relevant to actua  problems &#x2013; the kind for which &#x201C;machine learning&#x201D; might have been  considered, but with doubt whether it&#x2019;s worth bothering.</p><p>Playing chess decently is also a problem already solved. It can be  done using small (compared to GPT-2) decision trees and a few very  simple heuristics (see for example: <a href=\"https://github.com/AdnanZahid/Chess-AI-TDD\">https://github.com/AdnanZahid/Chess-AI-TDD</a>).  If a much smaller model can learn how to play &#x201C;decently&#x201D;, we should  assume that a fairly generic, exponentially larger neural network can do  the same.</p><p>The rule of thumb is:</p><h2>1.A neural network can almost certainly solve a problem if another ML algorithm has already succeeded.</h2><p>Given a problem that can be solved by an existing ML technique, we  can assume that a somewhat generic neural network, if allowed to be  significantly larger, can also solve it.</p><p>This assumption doesn&#x2019;t always hold because:</p><ul><li>a) Depending on the architecture, a neural network could easily  be unable to optimize a given problem. Playing chess might be impossible  for a conv network with large windows and step size, even if it&#x2019;s very  big.<br> </li><li>b) Certain ML techniques have a lot of built-in heuristics that  might be hard to learn for a neural network. The existing ML technique  mustn&#x2019;t have any critical heuristics built into it, or at least you have  to be able to include  the same heuristics into your neural network  model.<br> </li></ul><p>As we are focusing mainly on generalizable neural network  architectures (e.g. a fully connected net, which is what most people  think of initially when they hear &#x201C;neural network&#x201D;), point a) is pretty  irrelevant.</p><p>Given that most heuristics are applied equally well to any model,  even for something like chess, and that size can sometimes be enough for  the network to be able to just learn the heuristic, this rule basically  holds almost every time.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t really think of a counter example here&#x2026; Maybe some specific types of numeric projections?</p><p>This is a rather boring first rule, yet worth stating as a starting point to build up from.</p><h3>2. A neural network can almost certainly solve a problem very similar to ones already solved</h3><p>Let&#x2019;s say you have a model for predicting the risk of a given  creditor based on a few parameters, e.g. current balance, previous  credit record, age, driver license status, criminal record, yearly  income, length of employment, {various information about current  economic climate}, marital status, number of children, porn websites  visited in the last 60 days.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s say this model &#x201C;solves&#x201D; your problem, i.e. it predicts risk better than 80% of your human analysts.</p><p>But GDPR rolls along and you can no longer legally spy on some of  your customers&#x2019; internet history by buying that data. You need to build a  new model for those customers.</p><p>Your inputs are now truncated after and the customer&#x2019;s online porn history is no longer available (or rather admittedly usable).</p><p>Is it safe to assume you can still build a reasonable model to solve this problem ?</p><p>The answer is almost certainly &#x201C;yes; given our knowledge of the  world, we can safely assume someone&#x2019;s porn browsing history is not that  relevant to their credit rating as some of those other parameters.</p><p>Another example: assume you know someone else is using a model, but their data is slightly different from yours.</p><p>You know a US-based snake-focused pet shop that uses previous  purchases to recommend products and they&#x2019;ve told you it&#x2019;s done quite  well for their bottom line. You are a UK-based parrot-focused pet shop.  Can you trust their model or a similar one to solve your problem, if  trained on your data ?</p><p>Again, the right answer is probably &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, because the data is  similar enough. That&#x2019;s why building a product recommendation algorithm  was a hot topic 20 years ago, but nowadays everyone and their mom can  just get a wordpress plugin for it and get close to Amazon&#x2019;s level.</p><p>Or, to get more serious, let&#x2019;s say you have a given algorithm for  detecting breast cancer that - if trained on 100,000 images with  follow-up checks to confirm the true diagnostics - performs better than  an average radiologist.</p><p>Can you assume that, given the ability to make it larger, you can  build a model to detect cancer in other types of soft tissue, also  better than a radiologist ?</p><p>Once again, the answer is yes. The argument here is longer, because  we aren&#x2019;t so certain, mainly because of the lack of data. I&#x2019;ve spent  more or less a whole article <a href=\"https://blog.cerebralab.com/If_Van_der_Waals_was_a_neural_network\">arguing that the answer would still be yes</a>.</p><p>In NLP the exact same neural network architectures seem to be  decently good at doing translation or text generation in any language,  as long as it belongs to the Indo European family and there is a  significant corpus of data for it (i.e. equivalent to that used for  training the extant models for English).</p><p>Modern NLP techniques seem to be able to tackle all language  families, and they are doing so with less and less data. To some extent,  however, the similarity of the data and the amount of training examples  are tightly linked to the ability of a model in quickly generalizing  for many languages.</p><p>Or looking at image recognition and object detection/boxing models,  the main bottleneck consists in large amounts of well-labeled data, not  the contents of the image. Edge cases exist, but generally all types of  objects and images can be recognized and classified if enough examples  are fed into an architecture originally designed for a different image  task (e.g. a conv residual network designed for imagenet).</p><p>Moreover, given a network trained on imagenet, we can keep the  initial weights and biases (essentially what the network &#x201C;has learned&#x201D;)  instead of starting from scratch, and it will be able to &#x201C;learn&#x201D; on  different datasets much faster from that starting point.</p><h2>3. A neural network can solve problems that a human can solve with small-sized datapoints and little to no context</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s say we have 20x20px black and white images of two objects never  seen before; they are &#x201C;obviously different&#x201D;, but not known to us . It&#x2019;s  reasonable to assume that, given a bunch of training examples, humans  would be reasonably good at distinguishing the two.</p><p>It is also reasonable to assume, given a bunch of examples (let&#x2019;s say  100), that almost any neural network of millions of parameters would  ace this problem like a human.</p><p>You can visualize this in terms of amounts of information to learn.  In this case, we have 400 pixels of 255 values each, so it&#x2019;s reasonable  to assume every possible pattern could be accounted for with a few  million parameters in our equation.</p><p>But what &#x201C;small datapoints&#x201D; means here is the crux of this definition.</p><p>In short, &#x201C;small&#x201D; is a function of:</p><ul><li>The size of your model. The bigger a model, the more complex the patterns it can learn, the bigger your possible inputs/outputs.<br> </li><li>The granularity of the answer (output). E.g 1,000 classes vs 10  classes, or an integer range from 0 to 1,000 vs one from 0 to 100,000.  In this case 2.<br> </li><li>The size of the input. In this case 400, since we have a 20x20 image.<br> </li></ul><p>Take a classic image classification task like MNIST. Although a few  minor improvements have been made, the state-of-the-art for MNIST <a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-mnist\">hasn&#x2019;t progressed much</a>. The last 8 years have yielded an improvement from ~98.5% to ~99.4%, both of which are well within the usual <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-human-accuracy-on-the-MNIST-test-set-Are-there-any-quotable-sources\">&#x201C;human error range&#x201D;</a>.</p><p>Compare that to something much bigger in terms of input and output size, like ImageNet, <a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet\">where the last 8 years have seen a jump from 50% to almost 90%</a>.</p><p>Indeed, even with pre-CNN techniques, <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Efficient-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-based-on-of-Ebrahimzadeh-Jampour/b44c7a87888b46e37bae571db7e2355a1eeca46d\">MNIST is basically solveable</a>.</p><p>But even having defined &#x201C;small&#x201D; as a function of the above, we don&#x2019;t  have the formula for the actual function. I think that is much harder,  but we can come up with a &#x201C;cheap&#x201D; answer that works for most cases -  indeed, it&#x2019;s all we need:</p><ul><li>A given task can be considered small when other tasks of equal or  larger input and output size have already been solved via machine  learning with more than one architecture on a single GPU</li></ul><p>This might sound like a silly heuristic, but it holds surprisingly  well for most &#x201C;easy&#x201D; machine learning problems. For instance, the reason  many NLP tasks are now more advanced than most &#x201C;video&#x201D; tasks is size,  despite the tremendous progress on images in terms of network  architecture (which are much closer to the realm of video). The input  &amp; output size for meaningful tasks on videos is much larger; on the  other hand, even though NLP is in a completely different domain, it&#x2019;s  much closer size-wise to image processing.</p><p>Then, what does &#x201C;little to no context&#x201D; mean ?</p><p>This is a harder one, but we can rely on examples with &#x201C;large&#x201D; and &#x201C;small&#x201D; amounts of context.</p><ul><li>Predicting the stock market likely requires a large amount of  context. One has to be able to dig deeper into the companies to invest  in; check on market fundamentals, recent earning calls, the C-suite&#x2019;s  history; understand the company&#x2019;s product; maybe get some information  from it&#x2019;s employees and customers, if possible, get insider info about  upcoming sales and mergers, etc.</li></ul><p>You can try to predict the stock market based purely on indicators  about the stock market, but this is not the way most humans are solving  the problem.</p><ul><li>On the other hand, predicting the yield of a given printing machine  based on temperature and humidity in the environment could be solved via  context, at least to some extent. An engineer working on the machine  might know that certain components behave differently in certain  conditions. In practice, however, an engineer would basically let the  printer run, change the conditions, look at the yield, then come up with  an equation. So given that data, a machine learning algorithm can also  probably come up with an equally good solution, or even a better one.</li></ul><p>In that sense, an ML algorithm would likely produce results similar to a mathematician in <a href=\"https://blog.cerebralab.com/If_Van_der_Waals_was_a_neural_network\">solving the equation</a>, since the context would be basically non-existent for the human.</p><p>There are certainly some limits. Unless we test our machine at 4,000 C  the algorithm has no way of knowing that the yield will be 0 because  the machine will melt; an engineer might suspect that.</p><p>So, I can formulate this 3rd principle as:</p><p>A generic neural network can probably solve a problem if:</p><ul><li>A human can solve it<br> </li><li>Tasks with similarly sized outputs and inputs have already been solved by an equally sized network<br> </li><li>Most of the relevant contextual data a human would have are included in the input data of our algorithm.<br> </li></ul><p>Feel free to change my mind (with examples).</p><p>However, this still requires evaluating against human performance.  But a lot of applications of machine learning are interesting precisely  because they can solve problems humans can&#x2019;t. Thus, I think we can go  even deeper.</p><h2>4. A neural network might solve a problem when we are reasonably  sure it&#x2019;s deterministic, we provide any relevant context as part of the  input data, and the data is reasonably small</h2><p>Here I&#x2019;ll come back to one of my favorite examples - protein folding.  One of the few problems in science where data is readily available,  where interpretation and meaning are not confounded by large amounts of  theoretical baggage, and where the size of a datapoint is small enough  based on our previous definition. You can boil down the problem to:</p><ul><li>Around 2,000 input features (amino acids in the tertiary  structure), though this means our domain will only cover 99.x% of  proteins rather than literally all of them.<br> </li><li>Circa 18,000 corresponding output features (number of atom  positions in the tertiary structure, aka the shape, needing to be  predicted to have the structure).<br> </li></ul><p>This is one example. Like most NLP problems, where &#x201C;size&#x201D; becomes  very subjective, we could easily argue one-hot-encoding is required for  this type of inputs; then the size suddenly becomes 40,000 (there&#x2019;s 20  proteinogenic amino acids that can be encoded by DNA) or 42,000 (if you  care about selenoproteins and 44,000 if you care about niche proteins  that don&#x2019;t appear in eukaryotes).</p><p>It could also be argued that the input &amp; output size is much  smaller, since in most cases proteins are much smaller and we can mask  &amp; discard most of inputs &amp; outputs for most cases.</p><p>Still, there are plenty of tasks that go from an, e.g. 255x255 pixel  image to generate another 255x255 pixel image (style alternation,  resolution enhancement, style transfer, contour mapping&#x2026; etc). So based  on this I&#x2019;d posite the protein folding data is reasonably small and has  been for the last few years.</p><p>Indeed, resolution enhancement via neural networks and protein  folding via neural networks came about at around the same time (with  every similar architecture, mind you). But I digress; I&#x2019;m mistaking a  correlation for the causal process that supposedly generated it. Then  again, that&#x2019;s the basis of most self-styled &#x201C;science&#x201D; nowadays, so what  is one sin against the scientific method added to the pile ?</p><p>Based on my own fooling around with the problem, it seems that even a <a href=\"https://github.com/George3d6/focusfold\">very simple model</a>,  simpler than something like VGG, can learn something &#x201D;meaningful&#x201D; about  protein folding. It can make guesses better than random and often  enough come within 1% of the actual position of the atoms, if given  enough (135 millions) parameters and half a day of training on an  RTX2080. I can&#x2019;t be sure about the exact accuracy, since apparently the  exact evaluation criterion here is pretty hard to find and/or understand  and/or implement for people that aren&#x2019;t domain experts&#x2026; or I am just  daft, also a strong possibility.</p><p>To my knowledge the first widely successful protein folding network <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery\">AlphaFold</a>,  whilst using some domain-specific heuristics, did most of the heavy  lifting using a residual CNN, an architecture designed for categorizing  images, something as widely unrelated with protein folding as one can  think of.</p><p>That is not to say any architecture could have tackled this problem  as well. It rather means we needn&#x2019;t build a whole new technique to  approach this type of problem. It&#x2019;s the kind of problem a neural network  can solve, even though it might require a bit of looking around for the  exact network that can do it.</p><p>The other important thing here is that the problem seems to be deterministic. Namely:</p><ul><li>a) We know peptides can be folded into proteins, in the kind of  inert environment that most of our models assume, since that&#x2019;s what  we&#x2019;ve always observed them to do.<br> </li><li>b) We know that amino acids are one component which can fully describe a peptide<br> </li><li>c) Since we assume the environment is always the same and we  assume the folding process itself doesn&#x2019;t much alter it, the problem is  not a function of the environment (note, obviously in the case of  in-vitro folding, in-vivo the problem becomes much harder)<br> </li></ul><p>The issue arises when thinking about b), that is to say, we know that  the universe can deterministically fold peptides; we know amino acids  are enough to accurately describe a peptide. However, the universe  doesn&#x2019;t work with &#x201C;amino acids&#x201D;, it works with trillions of interactions  between much smaller particles.</p><p>So while the problem is deterministic and self-contained, there&#x2019;s no  guarantee that learning to fold proteins doesn&#x2019;t entail learning a  complete model of particle physics that is able to break down each amino  acid into smaller functional components. A few million parameters  wouldn&#x2019;t be enough for that task.</p><p>This is what makes this 4th most generic definition the hardest to apply.</p><p>Some other examples here are things like <a href=\"https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/df7c518dcba7407fb855377339d6589f\">predictive maintenance</a> where machine learning models are <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/projects/machine-learning/\">being actively used</a>  to tackle problems human can&#x2019;t, at any rate not without mathematical  models. For these types of problems, there&#x2019;s strong reasons to assume,  based on the existing data, that the problems are partially (mostly?)  deterministic.</p><p>There are simpler examples here, but I can&#x2019;t think of any that, at  the time of their inception, didn&#x2019;t already fall into the previous 3  categories. At least, none that aren&#x2019;t considered reinforcement  learning.</p><p>The vast majority of examples fall within reinforcement learning,  where one can solve an impressive amount of problems once they are able  to simulate them.</p><p>People can find optimal aerodynamic shapes, design weird antennas to  provide more efficient reception/coverage, beat video games like DOT and  Starcraft which are exponentially more complex (in terms of degrees of  freedom) than chess or Go.</p><p>The problem with RL is that designing the actual simulation is often  much more complicated than using it to find a meaningful answer. RL is  fun to do but doesn&#x2019;t often yield useful results. However, edge cases do  exist where designing the simulation does seem to be easier than  extracting inferences out of it. Besides that, the more simulations  advance based on our understanding of efficiently simulating physics (in  itself helped by ML), the more such problems will become ripe for the  picking.</p><h2>In conclusion</h2><p>I&#x2019;ve attempted to provide a few simple heuristics for answering the  question &#x201C;When should we expect that a neural network can solve a  problem ?&#x201D;. That is to say, to what problems should you apply neural  networks, in practice, right now. What problems should leave you  &#x201C;unimpressed&#x201D; when solved by a neural network ? For which problems  should our default hypothesis include their solvability, given enough  architecture searching and current GPU capabilities.</p><p>I think this is fairly useful - not only for not getting impressed  when someone shows us a party trick and tells us it&#x2019;s AGI - but also for  helping us quickly classify a problem as &#x201C;likely solvable via ML&#x201D; and  &#x201C;unlikely to be solved by ML&#x201D;</p><p>To recap, neural networks can probably solve your problem:</p><ol><li>[Almost certainty] If other ML models already solved the problem.<br> </li><li>[Very high probability] If a similar problem has already been  solved by an ML algorithm, and the differences between that and your  problem don&#x2019;t seem significant.<br> </li><li>[High probability] If the inputs &amp; outputs are small enough  to be comparable in size to those of other working ML models AND if we  know a human can solve the problem with little context besides the  inputs and outputs.<br> </li><li>[Reasonable probability] If the inputs &amp; outputs are small  enough to be comparable in size to those of other working ML models AND  we have a high certainty about the deterministic nature of the problem  (that is to say, about the inputs being sufficient to infer the  outputs).<br> </li></ol><p>I am not certain about any of these rules, but this comes back to the  problem of being able to say something meaningful. PACL can give us  almost perfect certainty and is mathematically valid but it breaks down  beyond simple classification problems.</p><p>Coming up with this kind of rules doesn&#x2019;t provide an exact degree of  certainty and they are derived from empirical observations. However, I  think they can actually be applied to real world problems.</p><p>Indeed, these are to some extent the rules I do apply to real world  problems, when a customer or friend asks me if a given problem is  &#x201C;doable&#x201D;. These seem to be pretty close to the rules I&#x2019;ve noticed other  people using when thinking about what problems can be tackled.</p><p>So I&#x2019;m hoping that this could serve as an actual practical guide for  newcomers to the field, or for people that don&#x2019;t want to get too  involved in ML itself, but have some datasets they want to work on.</p>",

First it loads <code>messageChannelResponse</code> in an\niframe, waits for it to <code>load</code>, and then times how long it\ntakes to pass in a <code>MessagePort</code> and receive a response on\nit.  Then it does the same basic operation\n<code>postMessageResponse</code> with plain <code>postMessage</code>.\nThis is a worst-case for <code>MessageChannel</code>, since I stand up\nthe while channel only to use it a single time.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI ran 1,000 iterations, interleaved, on Chrome (80.0), Firefox (74.0),\nand Safari (13.1).

I then talk about how likely each is to succeed, how\nsustainable it is, and the relative economic and social cost. I then\ntalk about the likely time periods that we'll transition between these\nlevels. The purpose here is to simply help think systematically about\ntrade-offs and transitions and identify points of agreement. I've\ntried to indicate confidence levels for various claims, but am\nprobably overconfident about many specific things.</p>\n<h2>The four level of social distancing</h2>\n<h3>The levels</h3>\n<p>What exactly falls in a given level is subject to debate, but is not\nthe focus here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level 1 (avoid large gatherings)</strong> Avoid sporting events, large\nlectures, conferences, political rallies, demonstrations, rave\nparties, cinema halls, cruise ships, prisons, and other\nenvironments that involve close contact with large numbers of\npeople.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level 2 (do all work and recreation remotely where feasible, and\navoid crowding when meeting in person)</strong>: Run schools,\nuniversities, and workplaces remotely, except those that need\nin-person interaction (for instance, retail storefronts and\nrestaurants). Postpone recreational travel and substitute virtual\nentertainment for physical entertainment where feasible. Go to\nrestaurants and cinema halls sparingly and when they are less\ncrowded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level 3 (flexible lockdown, \"stay home except for essential\nneeds\")</strong>: Whatever workplaces can be run remotely, run\nremotely. For others, shut them down unless they serve \"essential\nneeds\". For instance, shut down nail salons, spas, gyms, etc. Only\nthings like grocery stores, convenience stores, hardware stores,\nand takeout food are allowed. Restrict travel, both regional and\nacross cities, to essential needs. Go out only for exercise and\nbuying essentials.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level 4 (strict curfew-style lockdown, with police\nenforcement)</strong>: Similar to Level 3, but with stricter\nrestrictions. Mass transit, both intra-city and inter-city, may be\nstopped for everybody except essential workers. Even takeout food\nmay not be allowed. If you leave the house, you may be stopped by\nlockdown enforcers and may have to submit documentation or show an\nidentity card to justify yourself.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Chart 15 in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56\">the hammer and the\ndance</a>\nis somewhat similar in that it lays out various levels of social\ndistancing. However, it's much more complicated. If you are familiar\nwith the jargon of that post, levels 3 and 4 are probably the only\nlevels that deserve the \"hammer\" moniker, whereas levels 1 and 2 can\nbe the relatively relaxed portions of the \"dance\".</p>\n<h3>TL;DR: timelines</h3>\n<p>Note that the gradation from optimistic to pessimistic for one\ntransition may not correlate with the super-optimistic case for\nanother transition (e.g., perhaps going down from level 3 to level 2\nearlier increases the expected delay in going down from level 2 to\nlevel 1). The use of \"summer\" in the table below refers to the\nnorthern hemisphere summer.</p>\n<p>Translations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Super-optimistic case ~ 84th percentile of distribution</li>\n<li>Reasonably optimistic case ~ 68th percentile of distribution</li>\n<li>Median case ~ 50th percentile of distribution</li>\n<li>Pessimistic but non-catastrophic case ~ 16th percentile of distribution</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Transition</th>\n<th>Super-optimistic case</th>\n<th>Reasonably optimistic case</th>\n<th>Median case</th>\n<th>Pessimistic but non-catastrophic case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Most of the world goes down from level 3 to level 2</td>\n<td>mid-April</td>\n<td>mid-May</td>\n<td>mid-June</td>\n<td>mid-August</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Most of the world goes down from level 2 to level 1</td>\n<td>end of June</td>\n<td>mid-August</td>\n<td>summer 2021</td>\n<td>summer 2022</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Most of the world goes down from level 1 to business-as-usual</td>\n<td>end of September</td>\n<td>summer 2021</td>\n<td>summer 2022</td>\n<td>summer 2023</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>More about each level</h2>\n<h3>Level 1 (avoid large gatherings)</h3>\n<p><em>Avoid sporting events, large lectures, conferences, political rallies,\ndemonstrations, rave parties, cinema halls, cruise ships, prisons, and\nother environments that involve close contact with large numbers of\npeople.</em></p>\n<p>Despite the wide range of uncertainty around coronavirus, my guess is\nthat Level 1 is the bare minimum necessary till coronavirus is fully\nunder control (for instance, through a widely available vaccine that\nhas been administered to a large proportion of the population,\nincluding the individuals who want to be part of large gatherings).</p>\n<p>Expected duration that we need to maintain at least level 1, and that\nthere will be a general social consensus that we need to do so:\nSomewere between 6 months (super-optimistic) and 3 years (pessimistic).</p>\n<p>My confidence in this range: Reasonably high (around 70%)</p>\n<p>I expect this to not be too controversial with the LessWrong\nreadership.</p>\n<p>Predictions about businesses: Sports stadiums, cruise ships, and\ncinema halls are in for a very difficult time.</p>\n<h3>Level 2 (do all work and recreation remotely where feasible, and avoid crowding when meeting in person)</h3>\n<p><em>Run schools, universities, and workplaces remotely, except those that\nneed in-person interaction (for instance, retail storefronts and\nrestaurants). Postpone recreational travel and substitute virtual\nentertainment for physical entertainment where feasible. Go to\nrestaurants and cinema halls sparingly and when they are less crowded.</em></p>\n<p>In the last few weeks, large parts of the world, including many places\nin United States, Europe, and South Asia, transitioned from level 1 to\nlevel 2, and some quickly sped to level 3, after staying in level 2\nfor less than two weeks. Places that have had strong systems of\ndiagnosis, testing, and contact tracing have been able to stick to\nlevel 2 and not escalate to level 3 (South Korea, Hong Kong,\nSingapore, and Taiwan arguably fit this description). Other areas,\nwhere diagnosis, testing, and contact tracing were not in place early\nenough, did not have confidence that they could contain the epidemic\nat level 2 and escalated to level 3 or level 4.</p>\n<p>I believe there's a good chance that the next few months of data will\nshow that we need to maintain at least level 2 until coronavirus is\nmostly conquered (through a proven treatment or vaccine that has\nstarted being administered). My reason for believing that at least\nlevel 2 is needed: as far as I can make out, a lot of the transmission\nof coronavirus happened outside of contexts that can be avoided\nthrough level 1 of social distancing. If the world had followed level\n1 consistently, the outbreak may not have reached pandemic\nproportions, but it would probably still be growing in numbers.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the data, once colllected and studied, will show\nthat level 1 of social distancing, combined with some specific\nprecautions gleaned from the data, are enough. However, even if ours\nis a world where the ground truth is that level 1 of social distancing\nis enough, I expect that rigorously demonstrating this will take at\nleast a few months. And I expect that nothing short of a rigorous\ndemonstration will lead to a general social consensus to go down to\nlevel 1.</p>\n<p>Expected duration that we need to maintain at least level 2, and that\nthere will be a general social consensus that we need to do so:\nSomewhere between 3 months (super-optimistic) and 2 years\n(pessimistic).</p>\n<p>My confidence in this range: Reasonably high (around 70%)</p>\n<p>I expect this to be a little more controversial with the LessWrong\nreadership, but not too much.</p>\n<p>Predictions about businesses: Distance education and remote work will\nthrive relative to their brick-and-mortar counterparts, and the tools\nthat enable these have tremendous growth potential. Similarly, home\nentertainment will make big strides relative to meatspace\nentertainment.</p>\n<p>Comparing level 1 and level 2 for the economy: Neither level 1 nor\nlevel 2 completely cripples the economy. With that said, level 1\naffects only very specific industries, whereas level 2 has\nwide-ranging effects, creating both winner and losers.</p>\n<h3>Level 3 (flexible lockdown, \"stay home except for essential needs\")</h3>\n<p><em>Whatever workplaces can be run remotely, run remotely. For others,\nshut them down unless they serve \"essential needs\". For instance, shut\ndown nail salons, spas, gyms, etc. Only things like grocery stores,\nconvenience stores, hardware stores, and takeout food are\nallowed. Restrict travel, both regional and across cities, to\nessential needs. Go out only for exercise and buying essentials.</em></p>\n<p>In the last few weeks, large parts of the world transitioned from\nlevel 1 to level 2 to level 3, or even directly from level 1 to level\n3. Some East Asian countries were able to avoid going all the way to\nlevel 3, or needed to go there only for brief periods of\ntime. Examples of regions that <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/20/understanding-what-works-how-some-countries-are-beating-back-the-coronavirus/\">didn't need to go to level\n3</a>\n(outside of very specific geographies or short time periods) <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/03/13/south-korea-sees-coronavirus-slowdown-without-a-lockdown-but-with-nearly-250000-tests/\">South\nKorea</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-singapore-will-not-rule-out-lockdown-but-not-on-the-cards-for-now-says\">Singapore</a>,\nHong Kong, and Taiwan. A region that went to level 3 or 4 and is on\nthe path to returning to level 2 is China's Hubei province.</p>\n<p>Data in the coming weeks, particularly data on the mostly East Asian\ncountries that have managed to either avoid escalating to, or\nde-escalated from level 3, will be crucial in figuring out how long we\nneed to sustain level 3.</p>\n<p>One question might be: why would the answer to \"does it make sense to\nde-escalate from level 3 to level 2?\" change over time? There are\ntwo mechanisms by which the answer might change:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Preparation time: Staying in level 3 for a little while slows down\nthe rate of infection a lot, which gives people time to ramp up on\nproduction of medical equipment, and catch up with the backlog in\ntesting and contact tracing work. Once that catch-up is complete,\nquarantining infected or at-risk individuals is good enough, and the\nrest of us can go down to level 2.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information value: Maybe it actually makes sense to stay in level 2\nall along, and an omniscient being would know it. But, we don't know\nit yet. From a risk perspective, it makes sense for any part of the\nworld that has crossed some threshold of infection to escalate to\nlevel 3. Later, when the data on new infection rates is in, it may\nturn out that level 2 was \"good enough\", and that even with level 2,\nthe basic reproduction number (R0) was already much less than 1. But\nright now, we can't risk it. Note in particular that this argument\nbenefits a lot from the fact that some parts of the world are only\nat level 2; the data from these regions over the next few weeks and\nmonths will be crucial to making that case that level 2 is\nsustainable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expected duration that we need to maintain at least level 3, and that\nthere will be a general social consensus to do so: This is the part I\nam most uncertain about, and also the one that I feel has the most\ncross-region variation. Loosely, here is what I expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I expect that it will take at least till the end of April for there\nto be enough data to make a confident case that level 2 is enough in\nequilibrium (i.e., the \"information value\" side of the argument).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I expect that regions where coronavirus can be contained (i.e.,\nthere are either no cases, or all cases are caught through contact\ntracing and there are no unexpected cases) will not need to go to\nlevel 3 at all. But that regions that have needed to go to level 3\nwill take at least a month to return to level 2, and possibly two to\nthree months, or even longer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Concretely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I expect that already-overwhelmed regions such as New York City and\nItaly will stay in level 3 till at least the end of May, and\npossibly till July or August.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, I expect that other regions that are <strong>actually</strong> not\noverwhelmed, will be able to get out of level 3 around mid-June\n(super-optimistic: mid-April, pessimistic: August). I emphasize the\n\"<strong>actually</strong>\" there because there could be many regions that\nalready have a lot of undiagnosed cases, and are already\noverwhelmed; it just isn't showing up in their statistics yet.</p>\n<p>The time range of late April to mid-May is under the optimistic\nassumption that level 2 is actually sustainable (and that the\nexperiences of China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan\ncontinue to show this) <em>and</em> that the preparation time is\nsufficient.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Predictions about businesses: Restaurants, nail salons, spas, gyms,\netc. will see a huge hit for the next few months. Even after flexible\nlockdown ends, traffic to them will probably rebound slowly. Those\nthat lack the cash to get through the few months may go bankrupt, or\nget sold.</p>\n<p>Comparing level 2 and level 3 for the economy: Level 3 has a much\nhigher impact on the economy than level 2. Not only does it hurt a\nbunch of retail storefront businesses, it also massively shifts\nconsumer demand patterns, which require a lot of supply chain\nreconfiguration (for instance, moving food demand away from\nrestaurants and toward groceries). The uncertainty of duration of\nlevel 3 further complicates matters; normally, supply chain\nreconfiguration takes more time. Thus, even after we de-escalate from\nlevel 3, the reconfigured supply chain may make it harder to go back\nto normal.</p>\n<h3>Level 4: strict curfew-style lockdown, with police enforcement</h3>\n<p>Level 4 is similar to Level 3, but with stricter restrictions. <em>Mass\ntransit, both intra-city and inter-city, may be stopped for everybody\nexcept essential workers. Even takeout food may not be allowed. If you\nleave the house, you may be stopped by lockdown enforcers and may have\nto submit documentation or show an identity card to justify yourself.</em></p>\n<p>The lockdowns in Wuhan (China), India, and many European countries are\nat level 4; some European countries straddle the line between level 3\nand level 4.</p>\n<p>I think the case for level 4 as opposed to level 3 is unclear;\nhowever, this might be a hard matter to study. A justification offered\nfor level 4 is low compliance with level 3. This may be more of an\nissue in some places than others, which makes cross-region comparisons\nharder. For instance, reading articles like\n<a href=\"https://qz.com/india/1823105/india-hits-street-in-gratitude-amid-modis-social-distance-curfew/\">this</a>\nmight lead one to argue that strict enforcement is necessary for\nsocial distancing to be successful in India, making the case for level\n4 instead of level 3. However, articles like\n<a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/what-comes-before-a-curfew-in-india/articleshow/74791285.cms\">this</a>\nsuggest that the threat or fear of a strict lockdown may itself cause\npeople to crowd more as they rush to stock up on food or return to\ntheir home town, whereas a commitment to a more flexible lockdown\nwould lead to less panic and less crowding.</p>\n<p>Other than compliance levels, I think there is very little to say in\nfavor of level 4 instead of level 3. I believe that if level 3 is not\nsufficient to bring the basic reproduction number (R0) to less than 1,\nand to generally keep the pandemic under control, level 4 will not be\nenough either.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Posting for the first time -- please LMK if this is the wrong format for a question. </p><p>I like Elizabeth&apos;s idea that we are still in the &quot;throw things against the wall and see what sticks&quot; phase of coronavirus response, so even very messy and non-expert questions can be helpful. </p><p>So here&apos;s a question. Tl:dr version: what are possible mask alternatives that are more easily scalable than standard N95 masks and have better coronavirus protection than surgical masks? If promising materials do exist, what are good ways to test promising materials without endangering doctors? Long version below.</p><p>I have been reading about the shortage of PPE (personal protective equipment) for doctors: hospitals are planning for re-using masks, substituting the more effective N95 masks for much less effective surgical masks (SSC compares effectiveness here <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/23/face-masks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/).\">https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/23/face-masks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/).</a> I have friends who are doctors or work with doctors and are absolutely miserable about this, and this strikes me as one of the biggest short-term problems we&apos;ll be facing. </p><p>Many companies and individuals have donated their stock of N95 masks, but there simply doesn&apos;t seem to be enough to go around. To be safe a medical professional needs to put on a fresh N95 mask for each shift that might involve coronavirus exposure. For most doctors and nurses in affected wards, this corresponds to (bare minimum) two masks per day, which will most likely mean 2-4 million masks per day for the US alone in the coming months. </p><p>From what I understand, this kind of production is nigh-impossible in the short term, because of the shortage of melt-blown fabric. From <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/16/814929294/covid-19-has-caused-a-shortage-of-face-masks-but-theyre-surprisingly-hard-to-mak\">this NPR source</a> </p><blockquote>making a single machine line takes at least five to six months.</blockquote><p>(Though the same source discusses Chinese factories that have gotten around this time limit.) </p><p>So a reasonable next question is to ask whether there are alternative materials/designs for masks that do not use melt-blown fabric or other difficult-to-scale materials and offer better protection against n-CoV exposure than flimsy fabric or surgical masks. A cursory literature search shows a bit of promise:</p><ul><li>T<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956 experimented with salt-coated filters for virus filtration and found significant results for H1N1 flu. Note that the article has serious issues (for example its in vivo section seems to me to be complete garbage: the sample size is awful, and it tests virus growth *on the mask medium* rather than aerosol filtration\">his nature article </a>claims that adding a layer to a mask which is coated in dried salt significantly improves H1N1 flu virus filtration. The article has problems, and its *in vivo* mouse section strikes me as mostly garbage (sample size is too small, and they test by incubating virus on the mask rather than filtering through it), but the approach seems promising. </li><li>There is a plethora of different materials with filtration properties that are effective at removing virus aerosols. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=0612OFOD4aYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">This handbook</a> mentions that certain glass fiber materials in (non-wearable) air filters reduce virus levels by 9 orders of magnitude, and has this tantalizing, though unfortunately reference-less quote: </li></ul><blockquote>It is normally intended that very fine (&apos;absolute&apos;) air cleaning filters should remove bacteria and viruses by direct filtration, so that air can be sterilized by such action. However, there is now a growing range of combination media where the fibres have been treated in some way with a range of anti-bacterial coatings, to provide an alternative (or supplementary) means of pathogen removal. These treatments may work by physical action (damaging the impinging cells) or chemical destruction on the pathogen particles, and may be  178 Handbook of Filter Media &apos;permanent&apos; or have a definite active life, after which the filter is discarded or retreated.</blockquote><p>BTW, a curious fact from the same handbook, probably not very applicable: old filters from WW2 and Russian early cold-war filters achieved particle filtration approaching the virus level using asbestos filters. This is obviously not a good idea in modern times (old Soviet asbestos-based gas masks are weirdly available to buy on the internet, but keep in mind if an outer filter layer is damaged they will result in you breathing asbestos, which is probably worse than getting coronavirus). Still, this can be taken as a datapoint that other cheap materials (which are not asbestos) with decent virus filtration properties might exist.</p><p>The big problem I see with trying new materials is that there do not seem to be that many good studies measuring viral filtration qualities of different materials for viral material in general, and, worse, studies for n-CoV filtration specifically are non-existent and probably not very realistic for the time scales involved.</p><p>So here are some specific questions that seem to me like they have a chance of being useful:</p><ul><li>What are the most promising and quickly scalable materials one could test as alternatives for mask filtration?</li><li>What are fast-track ways of determining efficiency of different materials in filtering n-CoV particles? Are there any useful natural experiments that have happened or will happen, and ways to carefully gather data about them? Are there other quick preliminary ways to find promising candidates which do not involve endangering doctors? </li></ul>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Update 2020-06-07: I have done more in-depth investigations into TikTok, whose results can be found at <a href=\"http://tiktokodds.com\">tiktokodds.com</a>.</p><h1> Summary</h1><p>The communities I am part of rely heavily on longform text for communication. The world seems to be moving away from text (and especially longform text).</p><p>One clear example is TikTok, which is the <u><a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/tiktok-continues-to-lead-social-app-download-rankings-in-september/565692/\">most downloaded</a></u> social media application. It centers around sharing short videos. I&#x2019;m interested in whether important concepts can be communicated via this medium.</p><p>As part of that, I researched more about the recommendation algorithm. This has led me to some success (e.g. a coronavirus video with 400,000+ views). Because I found it very hard to get useful information about TikTok when I was doing this research, and because I want the sort of person who would read this post to get wider visibility for their ideas, I am writing this summary.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>Most TikTok videos are viewed through the &#x201C;for you page&#x201D;, roughly analogous to the Twitter feed. The TikTok algorithm recommends videos for you to view on this page. Note that, unlike with Twitter or Instagram, a large fraction of the content comes from creators that the user does not follow.</p><p>The TikTok recommendation algorithm is proprietary and mostly confidential. We know only a few things through information that employees have leaked to the press.</p><p>The TikTok recommendation algorithm consists of two components: an automated component and a manual component.</p><h2>Automated</h2><p>When a user creates a video, TikTok analyzes the video to identify the target audience for the video. They claim to use a combination of discrete fields (namely the hashtags used by the author and the sound chosen), natural language processing (presumably analyzing any text which is overlaid in the video), and computer vision. For example, they might analyze your video to find that contains images of a cat, has text like &#x201C;meow&#x201D; and the hashtag &#x201C;#catsoftiktok&#x201D;. They will use this information to identify an audience of people who like cat videos.</p><p>They then create a small sample audience of cat-video-lovers who get shown this video. If this audience likes the video, it will be shown to a larger audience. If that audience likes it, it will be shown to a still larger audience, etc.</p><p>Whether the audience likes the video is some function of how they engage with it: do they watch it the whole way through, like it, comment, share, etc. A common heuristic is that a video needs at least 10% of the viewers to like it in order to advance to the next stage.</p><h2>Manual</h2><p><u><a href=\"https://netzpolitik.org/2019/cheerfulness-and-censorship/\">Reportedly</a></u>, moderators manually review videos, once after the video has ~100 views, again after it has ~8,000 views, and a third time after it has ~20,000 views. At each stage, the moderator <u><a href=\"https://netzpolitik.org/2019/discrimination-tiktok-curbed-reach-for-people-with-disabilities/\">can set</a></u> different levels of visibility, which determine how widely the video will be shown. These levels of visibility are not visible to the author.</p><p> <figure><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ijsI3WXwM_ddTP-2io0SYJbMh2WYjrRzCHNmqm5HUf9sxkW1D1on0h8WLrfXQO8IvtHa44QgI28Ntd-PWrvz1JEnS6858Dg-y_EM-uQJN3hidQkp8MkIU0lzal7wyO-QPoxN4GohnUWP_i7Uug\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:624%\"></figure> </p><p><u><a href=\"https://netzpolitik.org/2019/discrimination-tiktok-curbed-reach-for-people-with-disabilities/\">Early leaks</a></u> of the moderation guidelines showed that they included limiting the visibility of videos containing disabled and possibly also LGBT+ actors, as well as politically sensitive content like protests.</p><p>The Intercept <u><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/\">recently obtained</a></u> a more full leak of TikTok&#x2019;s moderation guidelines. The guidelines mostly attempt to limit sexually &#x201C;explicit&#x201D; content (&#x201C;explicit&#x201D; in scare quotes because the guidelines include things like banning people for wearing bikinis when not swimming) and politically &#x201C;controversial&#x201D; content (notably content that makes China look bad).</p><h2>Moderation Goals</h2><p>Interestingly, moderators are also instructed to prohibit &#x201C;ugly&#x201D; people and environments (slums etc.). The motivation here seems to be that new users will bounce if they are presented with videos of ugly people/places.</p><p>On the other side of things, TikTok <u><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/\">apparently hired</a></u> contractors to steal content of &#x201C;nice-looking&#x201D; videos from Instagram and repost it on TikTok. The #BeachGirl hashtag was specifically mentioned as a source contractors should use.</p><p>My guess is that there are two separate moderation goals at play: one is politically motivated (e.g. limiting videos about Tiananmen Square), and the second is targeted towards increasing engagement (e.g. displaying videos from more attractive users). TikTok&#x2019;s <u><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/\">official party line</a></u> seems to be that these guidelines are &#x201C;locally&#x201D; produced (implying that the political censorship only happens in China).</p><h1>Implications</h1><h2>Statistical Modeling</h2><p>It seems likely that the number of views any video can expect to receive should be modeled as 4 separate models: one which is applicable when the video has less than 100 views, one for the 100-8000 regime, one for 8000-20,000, and one for 20,000+. (Corresponding to the thresholds where manual review takes place.)</p><p>For simplicity, I will just assume there is a single model. The process of iteratively showing videos to larger audiences implies a distribution like: 1/2 chance of being shown to 10 people, 1/4 chance of 100, 1/8 chance of 1000, etc. More generally, this implies some distribution like</p><p><span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

(As one intuition pump: TikTok wants to create videos which are popular among its target audience, and probably the empirical evidence about whether a video is popular among its target audience is better correlated with this metric than the opinions of some random moderator.) This implies that it&#x2019;s more important to focus on automated algorithm optimizations.</p><h3>Brainstorm</h3><p>This section is a brainstorm of ways one can optimize their video for wider spread distribution. They all seem like reasonable hypotheses to me based on the above information, but I have no real evidence to support them.</p><p>Also, it&#x2019;s worth pointing out that TikTok has fascist moderation policies and optimizing for fascist moderation is maybe a bad idea. </p><ol><li><strong>Optimizing things the recommendation algorithm can easily</strong> <strong>calculate</strong>. Machine learning engineers routinely overuse data fields which are easy to measure, even if those data fields are not the most important. Therefore, it&#x2019;s reasonable to assume that TikTok&#x2019;s algorithm also prioritizes these.</li><ol><li><strong>Camera resolution</strong>. Probably better to use the backward facing camera on a phone, and use a phone with a better camera. Possibly the algorithm might penalize you for having too high of a resolution (e.g. by using a professional camera), since TikTok wants to maintain an &#x201C;amateur&#x201D; aesthetic.</li><li><strong>Use trending sounds</strong>. TikTok can tell which music is more or less popular, and recommend videos based on that. Using sponsored sounds is even better than using ones which are trending organically.</li><li><strong>Use trending hashtags</strong>. Same idea, although note that the sample audience will also be chosen based on your hashtag. (And it&#x2019;s crucial to get engagement from the sample audiences.) So if you make a video about video games, using hashtags related to makeup is probably a bad idea, even if those makeup hashtags are trending, because your sample audience will be people who want to watch makeup videos (and therefore won&#x2019;t engage with your videogame content).</li><li><strong>Use trending keywords in text</strong>. Even though TikTok claims they do &#x201C;natural language processing&#x201D;, I&#x2019;m skeptical it&#x2019;s very advanced. Similar to search engine optimization, you probably want to explicitly list out key terms in either your caption or in the video itself.</li><li><strong>Use good lighting</strong>. TikTok doesn&#x2019;t want videos that are too dark or oversaturated, and I suspect they can at least partially identify this algorithmically.</li></ol><li><strong>Making your content more easily understandable for the algorithm</strong>.</li><ol><li><strong>Use contrasting backgrounds</strong>. Computer vision is still in its infancy, and algorithms would probably struggle to recognize an object in front of a complex background. Using single-color backdrops with bright lighting let the algorithm more easily identify the content of your video. (Of course, the content in your video has to also be the sort of thing TikTok wants to recommend, otherwise them being able to identify the content of your video doesn&#x2019;t help.)</li></ol><li><strong>(Pretend to) Be the person TikTok wants you to be.</strong></li><ol><li><strong>Be physically attractive</strong>. See above information about how moderators filter out &#x201C;ugly&#x201D; people.</li><li><strong>Don&#x2019;t be bully-able</strong>. TikTok suppresses videos by creators who moderators think could be bullied. Be cautious sharing problems in your life or controversial opinions. Political opinions seem especially dangerous.</li><li><strong>Purchase, use, and mention sponsored products</strong>. TikTok makes money through sponsors paying to promote videos containing their products. It seems quite likely that e.g. mentioning a sponsored hairspray will increase your views relative to mentioning a non-sponsored hairspray.</li><li><strong>Live the lifestyle Gen Z wants to live</strong>. TikTok wants to highlight videos that showcase the lifestyle its target audience (primarily 13-16-year-olds) want to live in order to attract and retain these users. This includes being successful (or at least participating) in desired careers like being a social media influencer or twitch streamer. General wealth, beauty, and success is probably also good.</li><ol><li><u><a href=\"https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~luzhc/media/HCII2019-lu.pdf\">Lu and Lu 2019</a></u>: &#x201C;We found that 21 [of 28] interviewees use Douyin for following the perceived stylish and up-to-date lifestyle, because they consider using Douyin as &#x201C;a fashionable lifestyle&#x201D;. Further, 16 interviewees reported that they used Douyin to be able to talk with people around them with interesting and trending topics, because peer students or workers often talk about content on Douyin.&#x201D;</li></ol><li><strong>Have upper-class and clean backdrops.</strong> Moderation guidelines include hiding videos that have broken pipes or cracks in the wall.</li></ol><li><strong>Timing. </strong>As with all social media platforms that prioritize recent content, it&#x2019;s important to publish content when your audience is most active. (TikTok Pro accounts display a histogram about when your followers are active.)</li><li><strong>Focus on quantity.</strong> Power law distributions have the counterintuitive property of having expected values that are significantly higher than the median value. The expected number of views on your next video is probably higher than you intuitively expect.</li></ol><h2>Broader idea: steal ideas from China/Douyin</h2><p><u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok#Douyin\">Douyin </a></u>is a sister product to TikTok. Several trends on Douyin do not seem popular on TikTok yet. For example:</p><blockquote>Interestingly, several young users reported that they like watching and sharing videos in which the creator is sharing good-looking profile images for them to adopt for their social accounts, fancy nicknames for online social accounts, and creative animated mobile phone wallpapers for individuals or couples (Figure 1). This shows a trend that the content of some short videos can be easily &#x201C;materialized&#x201D; and adopted in other social channels, and the videos penetrate into users&#x2019; real life. As noted by P28, a male student who was in a relationship: </blockquote><blockquote>&#x201C;My girlfriend really likes to adopt the profile images recommended by a content provider as her WeChat account. She says that those profile images are beautiful and can fit with her personality well. She also likes to adopt animated mobile phone wallpapers shared on Douyin. Sometimes those wallpapers are for a couple, which are very creative in that two phones can create a holistic story when put together, and she always urges me to adopt those wallpapers together with her. It is a way to show to her friends that we are in a sweet relationship. &#x201D;</blockquote><blockquote><u><a href=\"https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~luzhc/media/HCII2019-lu.pdf\">Lu and Lu 2019</a></u></blockquote><p>Academic literature presumably lags trends by a significant amount, so if you have direct access to Chinese or other markets where you can copy trends more rapidly, that&#x2019;s probably better.</p><h2>Click Farms/Vote Brigading</h2><p>TikTok&#x2019;s recommendation process makes coordinated voting hard. Because the decision about promoting a video is based on how a randomly selected audience interacts with it, having your friends all like your video doesn&#x2019;t do much.</p><p>One possibility is that you could ensure that your friends are disproportionately represented in the randomly selected audience. For example, you could have some hashtag that only you and your friends use, and TikTok might therefore automatically choose your friends to be in the sample audience.</p><p>This is just a hypothesis, and I have low confidence it will work.</p><p><em>I would like to thank JP Addison for discussions that led to this work, particularly the observation that EA is heavily tied to longform text. </em></p>",

The coronavirus situation gives us extra reason to roll it out now: some people might wish to filter out the deluge of coronavirus related content and view posts on other topics. To this end, we’ve rolled out a limited version of tagging with just the “Coronavirus” tag.</p><p>Raemon describes the feature fully in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XHKc98mpeojdWQF9q/tagging-click-gear-icon-to-filter-coronavirus-content\"><u>this post here</u></a>.

Thus was the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread\"><u>Justified Practical Advice (JPA) Thread</u></a> born. The thread is long, contains many interesting and hopefully useful ideas, but can also take a while to read. So we’ve also got the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B9qzPZDcPwnX6uEpe/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-summary\"><u>Justified Practical Advice Thread </u><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></a><strong> </strong>which contains the best advice from the thread.</p><h2>Coronavirus Open Thread</h2><p>If you have something to say on coronavirus that’s not worth a top-level post, please share in the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ACyGvQchWzGjGkKgS/coronavirus-open-thread\"><u>Coronavirus Open Thread</u></a>.</p><h2>House Coordination Spreadsheet &amp; Isolation Levels</h2><p>Raemon with the assistance of others put a great deal of effort into developing a spreadsheet template for houses within a community to coordinate on their health and quarantine status.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13VeevdKiAJVmOfVYE2mhuF9tis285WePnRgW_8B9fvM/edit#gid=677593842\"><strong><u>Coronavirus Household Isolation Coordination 1.2</u></strong></a></p><p>The spreadsheet can be an excuse to think about isolation plans, discuss them with roommates, and create common knowledge of them. Subgoals include:</p><ul><li>establishing guidelines for level-of-isolation (see second tab)</li><li>help with contract tracing</li><li>facilitate roommate swapping between higher-caution and lower-caution households</li><li>facilitate creation of multi-house cells that share an isolation level (where permitted by local quarantine laws, e.g. not California)</li></ul><p>I find the second tab with “isolation levels” useful for thinking about exposure, risk, and various precautions.</p><h2>Direct Research</h2><p>Jim, Elizabeth, and others have been putting out some great direct research. Notable contributions include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h4vWsBBjASgiQ2pn6/credibility-of-the-cdc-on-sars-cov-2\"><u>Credibility of the CDC on SARS-CoV-2</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9GyKccaJdLEbdhyTi/a-significant-portion-of-covid-19-transmission-is\"><u>A Significant Portion of COVID-19 Transmission Is Presymptomatic</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QdfD3bbMYAbCLv4aB/covid-19-s-household-secondary-attack-rate-is-unknown\"><u>COVID-19's Household Secondary Attack Rate Is Unknown</u></a></li></ul><h1>Upcoming Projects</h1><p>I expect the team will want to remain agile in coming weeks and move our efforts to wherever seems most useful. Given that, I think it’s hard to commit specifically to what we’ll work on.</p><p>A project I’d like to work on if possible is moving us towards some kind of Wiki tech.

    "htmlBody": "<p>I don&apos;t think finite-state MDPs are a particularly powerful conceptual tool for designing strong RL algorithms. I&apos;ll consider the case of no function approximation first.</p><p>It is certainly easier to do RL in a finite-state MDP. The benefit of modeling an environment as a finite-state MDP, and then using an MDP-inspired RL algorithm, is that when the agent searches for plans to follow, it doesn&apos;t evaluate the same plans twice.</p><p>Instead, it caches the (approximate) &quot;value&quot; for each possible &quot;state&quot;, and then if a plan would take it to a state that it has already evaluated, it doesn&apos;t have to re-evaluate what the plan would be from that point on. It already knows, more or less, how much utility it could get thereafter. Compare that to na&#xEF;ve approach of using a world-model to do full expectimax search at each timestep.</p><p>The model-the-environment-as-finite-state-MDP-then-do-dynamic-programming approach, or just &quot;the MDP approach&quot; for short, is, I think, <em>all about</em> not searching the same region of the planning search space twice. This is clearly a good thing, but I don&apos;t think the MDP approach in RL contains much more conceptual progress toward AGI than that. If I were to try to do a pre-natum of a fairly advanced RL agent, that is, if I tried to anticipate a response to &quot;things went well; why did that happen?&quot;, my guess would be that a big part of the answer would be:</p><p>It avoids searching much of the planning search space even once, certainly not twice.</p><p>The MDP approach with function approximation is more powerful, depending on how good the function approximation is. There&apos;s no upper bound on how good the MDP approach with function approximation could be, because buried inside the function approximation (whether that&apos;s approximation of the value, or the optimal policy, or both) could be some clever RL algorithm that does most of the work on its own. A good function approximator that is able to generate accurate predictions of the value and/or the optimal policy might appear to us to &quot;generalize&quot; well across &quot;similar states&quot;. But it&apos;s not clear to me to what extent it is a useful abstraction to say that the function approximator thinks in terms of the agent bouncing around a set of states that it classifies as more or less similar to each other.</p><p>I don&apos;t mean to say that the MDP approach is useless. I&apos;m certainly not against using a TD-style update instead of a full Monte Carlo rollout for training a function approximator; it&apos;s better than not using one and effectively searching parts of planning search space many times over. I just don&apos;t think it&apos;s a hugely big deal conceptually.</p><p>I think this is one small, very disputable argument against defaulting to a finite-state MDP formalism in AGI safety work. A natural alternative is to consider the agent&apos;s entire interaction history as the state, and suppose that the agent is still somehow using clever, efficient heuristics for approximating expectimax planning, with or without built-in methods for caching plans that have already been evaluated. None of this says that there&apos;s any cost to using a finite-state MDP formalism for AGI safety work, only that the benefits don&apos;t seem so great as to make it a &quot;natural choice&quot;.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><span>\n\nLet's say you see a potential pandemic coming, and you produce a\nproduct that could be critical.  Maybe you make respirator masks,\nmaybe you make ventilators, maybe you make PCR test reagents.  You can\nsee that if you and your competitors don't ramp up production and the\npandemic happens, there will be a shortage.  What do you do?\n\n</span>\n\n</p><p>\n\nOne option is to do nothing: keep producing at your regular rate.  If\nthe pandemic fears were overblown then you're fine.  If the pandemic\nhappens you quickly sell out, and start scrambling to ramp up\nproduction.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnother option is to ramp up production now, speculatively.  Start\npaying workers extra to work longer shifts and run your assembly lines\naround the clock.  Train extra workers.  Find what you're bottlenecked\non and figure out how to get that ramped up too.  If the pandemic\nfears were overblown you lose a lot of money, but if the pandemic\nhappens people need what you have so much that you can charge high\nprices.  How much to ramp up production in advance depends on how\nlikely you think the pandemic is, and how much you'd be able to\nincrease prices if it does happen.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nExcept we have laws and customs against price gouging: if the\npandemic does happen, you are going to have a lot of trouble raising\nyour prices.  The laws <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/price-gouging-and-increased-costs\">generally do allow passing\nalong increased costs</a>, but the problem here is that your costs\nwere speculative.  Let's work an example.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nImagine your ventilators normally cost $35k to make, and the market\nprice is $40k each.  If you push really hard to ramp up production you\ncan make a lot more, but your cost goes up to $90k/each.  In New\nJersey, the state I looked at <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/price-gouging-and-increased-costs\">last time</a>, you're\nallowed to pass along costs but can't increase your profit on\n\"merchandise which is consumed or used as a direct result of an\nemergency or which is consumed or used to preserve, protect, or\nsustain the life, health, safety or comfort of persons or their\nproperty\" by more than 10% (<a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-56/chapter-8/section-56-8-107/\">56:8-107</a>,\n<a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-56/chapter-8/section-56-8-108/\">108</a>,\n<a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-56/chapter-8/section-56-8-109/\">109</a>).\nYour normal profit is 14%, so you would be allowed to sell them for $104k. Your possibilities are:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>No pandemic: you spent $90k each, but the market\nprice is $40k.  You lose $50k each.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Yes pandemic: you spent $90k each, and the market price is way\nabove that, but you can legally only charge $104k.  You make $14k\neach.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIf you think the pandemic is &gt;78% likely to happen then you'll\nexpect to make money by ramping up production, otherwise you'll lose\nmoney.  So even if a pandemic looks, say, 75% likely, you don't ramp\nup.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ventilator-production-decisions-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ventilator-production-decisions.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ventilator-production-decisions.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/ventilator-production-decisions-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSimilarly, imagine you make respirator masks and you know that every\nso often there's an emergency where demand spikes.  Could be a\npandemic, but could also be widespread fires, or many other things.\nSince melt-blown fabric is a major bottleneck, you could decide to\nkeep a large stockpile of it so you can easily ramp up production in\nan emergency.  The same unfavorable math applies here: you're heavily\nlimited in how much you can increase prices in an emergency, so\nkeeping a large stockpile to be prepared for even a reasonably likely\nevent is a money-loosing proposition.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn the current crisis people are likely to die because we don't have\nenough ventilators, and the marginal person probably needs one for\nabout a week, and the peak lasts maybe two months, so the marginal\nventilator saves about eight lives.  At the US <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life\">statistical value\nof life</a> of ~$9M, that's $72M per ventilator.  We're heading into a\ndisaster where we don't have enough machines that we would value at\n~$72M/each and normally cost ~$35k/each to make.  This is really bad.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt's too late to fix this for the current situation, but I see three\nmain ways out of this for the future:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Allow price gouging: don't restrict what prices people can sell\nthings at.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Allow speculative production: require companies to disclose and\ndocument production plans, require them to share their probability\nestimates of how likely they think things are to be needed, keep them\nhonest by allowing third parties to bet against them at their\npublished probabilities.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Have a government that will put in emergency ventilator orders\nat an early stage of the crisis even when they may not be needed, stockpile\nmasks for potential pandemics, and generally stay on top of\nthings.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThese three approaches require increasing levels of government\ncompetence and foresight, and given <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/authorities-and-amateurs\">recent performance</a> I'm pretty\nskeptical.  But the current approach where the government doesn't\nhandle the problem and also does not allow industry to make a profit\nhandling the problem is a disaster.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100150623566002\">facebook</a></i></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I’ve been thinking about a class of AI-takeoff scenarios where a very large number of people can build dangerous, unsafe AGI before anyone can build safe AGI. This seems particularly likely if:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It is considerably more difficult to build safe AGI than it is to build unsafe AGI.</li><li>AI progress is software-constrained rather than compute-constrained.</li><li>Compute available to individuals grows quickly and unsafe AGI turns out to be more of a straightforward extension of existing techniques than safe AGI is.</li><li>Organizations are bad at keeping software secret for a long time, i.e. it’s hard to get a considerable lead in developing anything.<ul><li>This may be because information security is bad, or because actors are willing to go to extreme measures (e.g. extortion) to get information out of researchers.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another related scenario is one where safe AGI is built first, but isn’t defensively advantaged enough to protect against harms by unsafe AGI created soon afterward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intuition behind this class of scenarios comes from an extrapolation of what machine learning progress looks like now. It seems like large organizations make the majority of progress on the frontier, but smaller teams are close behind and <a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/2018/04/30/dawnbench-fastai/\">able to reproduce impressive results with dramatically fewer resources</a>. I don’t think the large organizations making AI progress are (currently) well-equipped to keep software secret if motivated and well-resourced actors put effort into acquiring it. There are strong openness norms in the ML community as a whole, which means knowledge spreads quickly. I worry that there are strong incentives for progress to continue to be very open, since decreased openness can hamper an organization’s ability to recruit talent. If compute available to individuals increases a lot, and building unsafe AGI is much easier than building safe AGI, we could suddenly find ourselves in a <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\">vulnerable world</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not sure if this is a meaningfully distinct or underemphasized class of scenarios within the AI risk space. My intuition is that there is more attention on incentives failures within a small number of actors, e.g. via arms races. I’m curious for feedback about whether many-people-can-build-AGI is a class of scenarios we should take seriously and if so, what things society could do to make them less likely, e.g. invest in high-effort info-security and secrecy work. AGI development seems much more likely to go existentially badly if more than a small number of well-resourced actors are able to create AGI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Asya Bergal</em></p>",

Here are some good handles:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eb2E5Eg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Let's think about rocks and hills. <em>Unstable</em> equilibria have the rock rolling away forever lost, no matter how lightly the rock is nudged, while <em>locally stable</em> equilibria have some level of tolerance within which they'll settle back down. For a <em>globally stable</em> equilibrium, no matter how hard the perturbation, the rock comes rolling back down the parabola.</p>\n<h2>Resonance</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A familiar example is a playground swing, which acts as a pendulum. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the swing's natural oscillations. ~ Wikipedia</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mclp9QmCGs\">And that's also how the Tacoma bridge collapsed in 1940</a>. The second-order differential equations underlying this allow us to solve for the forcing function which could induce catastrophic resonance.</p>\n<p>Also note that there is only at most <em>one</em> resonant frequency of any given system, because even lower octaves of the natural frequency would provide destructive interference a good amount of the time.</p>\n<h3>Random notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This book gave me great chance to review my calculus, from integration by parts to the deeper meaning of Taylor's theorem: that for many functions, you can recover all of the global information from the local information, in the form of derivatives. I don't fully understand why this doesn't work for some functions which are infinitely differentiable (like <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\log x\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">log</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char\"></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space1\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span></span></span></span>), but apparently this becomes clearer after some complex analysis.</li>\n<li>Bifurcation diagrams allow us to model the behavior, birth, and destruction of equilibria as we vary parameters in the differential equation. I'm looking forward to learning more about bifurcation theory. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk\">In this video, Veratasium highlights stunning patterns behind the bifurcation diagrams of single-humped functions</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Forwards</h1>\n<p>I supplemented my understanding with the first two chapters of Strogatz's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Dynamics-Chaos-Applications-Nonlinearity/dp/0738204536\"><em>Nonlinear Dynamics And Chaos</em></a>. I might come back for more of the latter at a later date; I'm feeling like moving on and I think it's important to follow that feeling.</p>\n</body></html>",

I spent a good deal in that uniform patrolling a border. Perhaps I went beyond. You must be familiar with that time since your ad found me, but allow me to share some details anyway. A young man sees and learns many things while on guard duty.</p><p>My country is small, shaped like a long chef’s knife, and surrounded by hostile neighbors. It has a very high ratio of miles-of-border-that-need-to-be-watched to teenagers. So on any given day many of its teenagers are employed by watching its borders. Demand creates its own supply, as they say.</p><p>I just turned 18 when they gave me a rifle and two sets of uniforms. One crisp and clean that I would almost never wear, one grimy and rough and suitable for the work of infantry boot camp: running, push-ups, shooting, washing toilets, catching naps, guard duty.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2HwonzuM5PgSXhMDn/jo9gkumbgygxrbhfkllq\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:99%\"></figure></span><p>Guard duty is no one’s main job in the army, but almost everyone has to do a lot of it throughout their service. It has a lot in common with Vipassana meditation — a quiet, solitary affair whose ultimate goal is “seeing”. One’s practice starts in boot camp doing 30 minute stints, then one graduates to practicing for 4 or 8 hours in a row and going on retreats.</p><p>I wish I knew about Vipassana when I enlisted, I surely would have been enlightened twice over for all the hours I spent standing guard. Instead, I mostly entertained myself by singing Russian pop songs in my head. I learned the lyrics to hundreds of those, along with the entire Marshall Mathers LP and an eclectic selection of French hip hop and German metal. It has always been my gift and curse: I have a perfect memory for song lyrics in any language, but I can’t carry a tune to save my life. I sing often to myself, but at karaoke I’m resigned to cringing as my vocally talented friends butcher the lyrics to what are supposedly their favorite tracks.</p><p>One night the list of shifts came out; I had the terrible fourth slot: 12:30-1:00 AM. It meant that I would just be falling asleep when the third shift would wake me to stand guard groggily, and afterward I wouldn’t have enough time to get a full night’s sleep before reveille at 5 AM. I climbed onto my field bed at 11 PM, sullen. I woke up at 5, confused.</p><p>The third shift never woke me up because the second shift guy never woke&nbsp;<em>him</em> up. Instead, the second shift got up at 11:30, went to the guard post, put his his uniform and rifle in a neat pile, climbed the fence, and set off in his boxers toward the southwest. Military police picked him up at sunrise, parched and exhausted, a couple of miles from the border with Egypt.</p><p>I never saw that guy again. I assume he was sent to military prison for a month or two until the cell had to be vacated for fresh offenders. Then he was discharged and let loose, having demonstrated to the army’s satisfaction that he is not fit to be a GI. Today he is probably eating falafel somewhere in Tel Aviv, reminiscing about the night he ran through the desert to allow me to a get a good night’s sleep.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2HwonzuM5PgSXhMDn/qqiyfit96y96fi0cpkm3\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Four years later, I was back at the Egyptian border for my final week-long guard retreat. No longer a fresh-faced recruit, I was a fresh-faced Sergeant First Class with a degree in mathematics. But guard duty doesn’t care about honorifics and academics, the border still needs watching.</p><p>This particular outpost consists of a small barracks with a bed and six bunks, a toilet, a fence, a gate in the fence, a tower. Around the fence the lone and level sands stretch far away, boundless and bare. The six soldiers are guarding 4/8: 4 hours at the gate, 8 hours to sleep, 4 hours at the tower, 8 hours to play cards or backgammon. Repeat x7 and you’re done. The officer is usually sleeping 12 hours a day and reading weeks-old magazines left by previous rotations of guards.</p><p>Aside from your six fellow men, the only living beings you’d see are one fox and twenty billion flies. The Egyptians guard towers and patrol routes are out of sight. The Bedouin smugglers, transporting drugs from Latin America and prostitutes from Eastern Europe and contraband from Asia, know exactly where the outposts are and easily avoid them. If you think you see someone while on tower duty, you can assume that you’re hallucinating from the heat.</p><p>The first five days passed uneventful. The officer was chill, and the daily inspection consisted of little more than making sure the number of soldiers and rifles stayed at six. I passed the 8 AM – noon slot at the gate solving math puzzles in my head. I spent the 8 PM – midnight tower watch listening to music in one earphone, the ear that wasn’t visible from the barracks.</p><p>At 1 AM on Friday I just tucked in to bed when the radio suddenly came alive.</p><p>– “Base, this is tower. I see three figures approaching from the west.”</p><p>– “Everyone up! Tower, do you see weapons?”</p><p>– “Negative, sir. I turned the spotlight on them and they froze and lay still.”</p><p>– “Stay on them and look for more hostiles. Everyone wake the fuck up and get your fucking gear!”</p><p>– “Base, they’re standing up.”</p><p>– “Take cover, soldier! What are they doing?”</p><p>– “Sir, the’re shouting and hugging each other. One of them is dancing. I think the other one is praying.”</p><p>It turned out that the three men were refugees from Darfur, having just walked the last mile of a 3,000 mile trek. The South Sudanese make their way north across Sudan to the Sudan-Egypt border, then they pay everything they own for smugglers to take them across Egypt to Israel.</p><p>But the Egyptian Army patrols the Israeli border, and the smugglers don’t want to get close to it. They drop the refugees ten miles from Israel and tell them: “Keep walking east, you’ll be fine. Unless the Egyptians see you, then they’ll probably shoot you. But if you don’t get shot, you’ll be in Israel before dawn. Inshallah!”</p><p>So when the three dudes got spotted but no one was shooting, they knew that they had made it to the promised land. As the other guys stood in a circle “guarding” the three thin men in ragged clothes, I went to the barracks to get them sandwiches and the cold bottle of Coke we were saving for Saturday. Half an hour later a military police jeep picked them up.</p><p>I don’t know what happened to them afterward. Most likely they were sent to a detention center for a week or two until the cell had to be vacated for fresh refugees. Then they were discharged and let loose. Today they are probably washing dishes at a falafel joint somewhere in Tel Aviv, reminiscing about the night they ran through the desert to prevent me from getting a good night’s sleep.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2HwonzuM5PgSXhMDn/x38nnjevucfqghs13har\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>There are many other stories I could tell you, my dear United States Customs and Border Protection agency. The time I was guarding in the West Bank and spent the week smoking shisha with an Arab friend. The time I guarded the border with Lebanon during the war, when what kept me alert were the rockets and artillery instead of the usual threat of being written up by a stickler officer for slouching. The time I was guarding a checkpoint and saw first-hand that the politics of Israel and Palestine you read about in the New York Times have less than nothing to do with how Israelis and Palestinians actually live together and deal with each other in that small patch of land. The time that other guy went on guard duty and didn’t come back.</p><p>But I think I have made a strong enough case for my application. I spent four years watching the border, and the border was still there when I left. I never ran half-naked into the desert. I only dozed off once or twice, and was never caught. The one time people came across the border illegally we let them in and I gave them sandwiches, but in my defense it wasn’t my watch anyway and they looked real hungry.</p><p>I look forward to hearing back from you about my candidacy,</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Jacob</p>",

Find all Alignment Newsletter <strong><a href=\"http://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter/\">resources here</a></strong>. In particular, you can look through <strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PwWbWZ6FPqAgZWOoOcXM8N_tUCuxpEyMbN1NYYC02aM/edit?usp=sharing\">this spreadsheet</a></strong> of all summaries that have ever been in the newsletter.</p><p>Audio version <strong><a href=\"http://alignment-newsletter.libsyn.com/alignment-newsletter-92\">here</a></strong> (may not be up yet). \t\t\t  </p><h1>HIGHLIGHTS </h1><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748\">Representation Learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding</a></strong> <em>(Aaron van den Oord et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper from 2018 proposed Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC): a method of unsupervised learning that has been quite successful. At its core it is quite simple: it simply combines the ideas of predictive coding and contrastive losses, both of which have been significantly studied in the past.</p><p>The simplest form of unsupervised learning would be data compression via generative models (as in e.g. VAEs), in which, to model the data <strong>p(x)</strong>, you attempt to encode <strong>x</strong> into a latent (hidden) state <strong>z</strong> in such a way that you can then recover the original data point <strong>x</strong> from <strong>z</strong>. Intuitively, we want <strong>z</strong> to have high mutual information with <strong>x</strong>.</p><p>For sequential data in a partially observed setting, you need to deal with the full sequence. Consider natural language: in this setting, each x would be a single word. Consider the sentence &quot;I sat on the chair&quot;. If the <strong>z</strong> corresponding to the word &quot;the&quot; only has to reconstruct the word &quot;the&quot;, it&apos;s not going to &quot;remember&quot; that the past context involved sitting, and so that <strong>z</strong> would be terrible at predicting that the next word will be chair. To fix this, we can use predictive coding, where we instead require that we can <em>predict</em> future words using <strong>z</strong>. This now incentivizes <strong>z_t</strong> to have high mutual information with <strong>x_{t+k}</strong>.</p><p>There is still a problem: reconstructing the entire input <strong>x</strong> would require a lot of irrelevant information, such as e.g. the background color of the environment in RL, even if that never changes. How can we get rid of these irrelevant features? Contrastive losses allow us to do this: intuitively, since the irrelevant features are the ones that are common across all the <strong>x</strong>s (and so are fully captured by <strong>p(x)</strong> ), if we train the neural net to <em>distinguish</em> between various <strong>x</strong>s, we can incentivize only the relevant features. In particular, given a latent state <strong>z_t</strong>, we take the true <strong>x_{t+k}</strong>, and throw in a bunch of other <strong>x</strong>s sampled from <strong>p(x)</strong> (known as <em>negative samples</em>), and train the network to correctly classify <strong>x_{t+k}</strong>. The authors show that the optimum of this loss function is indeed for the neural net to compute <strong>p(x | z) / p(x)</strong>, which implies that it is maximizing a lower bound on the mutual information between X and Z.</p><p>This gives us a pretty simple overall algorithm. Take a sequence <strong>x_1 ... x_T</strong>, compute <strong>z_t</strong> using a recurrent model on <strong>x_1 ... x_t</strong>, put <strong>x_{t+k}</strong> and some negative samples into a set, and train a classifier to correctly predict which of the samples is the true <strong>x_{t+k}</strong>. In practice, we do batches of these at the same time, and for every data point in the batch we use all of the other data points as our negative examples. The features you learn are then the ones that help <em>distinguish</em> between <strong>x_{t+k}</strong> and the negative samples, and you&apos;ll ignore any features that are common across all the samples. This means that the results depend quite a lot on how you choose your samples (this effectively determines what <strong>p(x)</strong> you are using).</p><p>The authors evaluate their algorithm on several domains and show that it achieves or surpasses state of the art on them.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I like this paper: the intuition makes sense, the math is straightforward, and the empirical results are strong, and have continued to be strong when looking at later work that builds on it.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06922\">On Variational Bounds of Mutual Information</a></strong> <em>(Ben Poole et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper is a pretty dense and technical explanation of various ways in which we can estimate and/or optimize the mutual information between two variables. I specifically want to highlight that it provides a proof that the Contrastive Predictive Coding objective (summarized above) is a lower bound on the mutual information between the input and the representation, and compares it to other lower bounds on mutual information.</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>TECHNICAL AGENDAS AND PRIORITIZATION </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/8GdPargak863xaebm/an-analytic-perspective-on-ai-alignment\">An Analytic Perspective on AI Alignment</a></strong> <em>(Daniel Filan)</em> (summarized by Asya): In this post, Daniel Filan presents an analytic perspective on how to do useful AI alignment research. His take is that in a world with powerful AGI systems similar to neural networks, it may be sufficient to be able to detect whether a system would cause bad outcomes before you deploy it on real-world systems with unknown distributions. To this end, he advocates for work on transparency that gives <strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3kwR2dufdJyJamHQq/mechanistic-transparency-for-machine-learning\">mechanistic understandings</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/4920e52dd61b/alignment-newsletter-15\">AN #15</a></strong>) of the systems in question, combined with foundational research that allows us to reason about the safety of the produced understandings.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> My broad take is that I agree that analyzing neural nets is useful and more work should go into it, but I broadly disagree that this leads to reduced x-risk by increasing the likelihood that developers can look at their trained model, determine whether it is dangerous by understanding it mechanistically, and decide whether to deploy it, in a &quot;zero-shot&quot; way. The key difficulty here is the mechanistic transparency, which seems like far too strong a property for us to aim for: I would expect the cost of making a neural network mechanistically transparent to far exceed the cost of training that neural network in the first place, and so it would be hard to get developers to mechanistically understand trained models to detect danger.</p><p>Right now for e.g. image classifiers, some people on OpenAI&apos;s Clarity team have spent multiple years understanding a single image classifier, which is orders of magnitude more expensive than training the classifier. My guess is that this will become superlinearly harder as models get bigger (and especially as models become superhuman), and so it seems quite unlikely that we could have mechanistic transparency for very complex AGI systems built out of neural nets. More details in <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/8GdPargak863xaebm/an-analytic-perspective-on-ai-alignment?commentId=c8vogpyjgoXEspX8z\">this comment</a></strong>. Note that Daniel agrees that it is an open question whether this sort of mechanistic transparency is possible, and thinks that we don&apos;t have much evidence yet that it isn&apos;t.</p><h2>ROBUSTNESS </h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05379\">The Conditional Entropy Bottleneck</a></strong> <em>(Ian Fischer)</em> (summarized by Rohin): While I&apos;ve categorized this paper under robustness because it can apply to most forms of training, I&apos;ll talk about it specifically in the context of unsupervised learning (and in particular its relation to Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), summarized in the highlights).</p><p>One potential problem with deep learning is that there might be too <em>much</em> information in the input, causing the model to learn spurious correlations that do not actually generalize well (see <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11979\">Causal Confusion in Imitation Learning</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/8d9e3703fbde/an-79-recursive-reward-modeling-as-an-alignment-technique-integrated-with-deep-rl\">AN #79</a></strong>) as an example). The idea with the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB) is to penalize the model for learning irrelevant information, using a form of <em>information bottleneck</em>.</p><p>We consider a setting where we want to learn a representation <strong>Z</strong> of some input data <strong>X</strong> in order to predict some downstream data <strong>Y</strong>. In CPC, <strong>X</strong> would be the inputs from time 1 to t, <strong>Z</strong> would be the latent representation <strong>z_t</strong>, and <strong>Y</strong> would be the future data <strong>x_{t+k}</strong>. Then, we want <strong>Z</strong> to capture the <strong>minimum necessary information</strong> needed for <strong>Z</strong> to predict <strong>Y</strong> as best as possible. The <em>necessary</em> information is <strong>I(Y; Z)</strong>, that is, the mutual information between Z and Y: we want to maximize this to maximize our accuracy at predicting <strong>Y</strong>. Since <strong>Y</strong> depends on <strong>X</strong>, and <strong>Z</strong> is computed from <strong>X</strong>, any information about <strong>Y</strong> must come through mutual information between <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Z</strong>. Maximizing just this <strong>I(Y; Z)</strong> term gives us Contrastive Predictive Coding.</p><p>However, we don&apos;t want to capture any extra irrelevant information (the minimality criterion), which means that <strong>Z</strong> shouldn&apos;t capture any <em>more</em> information about <strong>X</strong> beyond what it captured to maximize <strong>I(Y; Z)</strong>. In information-theoretic terms, we want to <em>minimize</em> <strong>I(X; Z | Y)</strong>. Thus, we have the CEB objective: minimizing <strong>I(X; Z | Y) - &#x3B3; I(Y; Z)</strong>, where <strong>&#x3B3;</strong> is a hyperparameter controlling the tradeoff between the two terms. The authors then use some fairly straightforward math to reduce the objective to simpler terms which can be bounded using variational approximations, leading to an algorithm that can work in practice. </p><p>The authors perform experiments on Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10 (where Y corresponds to the labels for the images, so we&apos;re in the supervised learning setting). Since the main benefit of CEB is to remove unnecessary information from the model, they evaluate adversarial robustness and out-of-distribution detection in addition to standard performance checks. They find that models trained with CEB perform better than ones trained with a variational information bottleneck, or ones trained with vanilla SGD.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> While I&apos;m not sure to what extent models learn truly irrelevant information (see <strong><a href=\"http://gradientscience.org/adv/\">Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/4a1b3c4249ae/an-62are-adversarial-examples-caused-by-real-but-imperceptible-features\">AN #62</a></strong>)), it seems good to add an incentive against learning information that won&apos;t be useful for a downstream task, and the empirical results (especially of the next paper) suggest that it is providing some benefit.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05380\">CEB Improves Model Robustness</a></strong> <em>(Ian Fischer et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This empirical paper finds that ImageNet classifiers trained with the CEB objective (summarized above) are already somewhat adversarially robust, without having any decrease in accuracy, and without any adversarial training. Notably, since CEB does not rely on knowing the attack method ahead of time, its adversarial robustness generalizes to multiple kinds of attacks, whereas models that were adversarially trained tend to be fragile in the face of previously unseen attacks.</p><h1>OTHER PROGRESS IN AI </h1><h2>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10729\">Illuminating Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning through Procedural Level Generation</a></strong> <em>(Niels Justesen et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Deep reinforcement learning has been able to use high-dimensional input, such as images, to learn optimal policies. However, when neural networks are trained in a fixed environment, such as on a single level in a video game, they will usually over-fit and fail to generalize to new levels. This paper uses procedurally generated levels during training in an attempt to increase the generality of deep RL. They make use of the General Video Game AI framework (GVG-AI) which allows rapid design of video games through the specification of rewards, objects, etc. Moreover, they introduce Progressive PCG (PPCG) to smoothly control the difficulty of generated levels to build a curriculum for the agent. The authors show that for some games procedural level generation enables generalization to new levels within the same distribution.</p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> The GVG-AI framework seems like a useful tool to explore learning videogames. Setting up curriculum learning by using PPCG is also a clever idea. However, the results are a bit mixed. On two of the games they tested, training on a single difficult level works better than training on a variety of levels for generalization. Having said this, the method can learn the game Frogs (57% win rate) while DQN/A2C make zero progress even after 40 million steps. It seems as though certain conditions make PPCG a good method to use. It&apos;d be interesting to investigate what those conditions are in a future publication.</p><h2>DEEP LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03129\">SLIDE : In Defense of Smart Algorithms over Hardware Acceleration for Large-Scale Deep Learning Systems</a></strong> <em>(Beidi Chen et al)</em> (summarized by Asya): This paper presents an algorithmic technique called SLIDE (Sub-LInear Deep learning Engine) which takes advantage of sparsity in inputs and activations to speed up the training of large neural networks.</p><p>Suppose that activations at layer k are a_k. Then, the ith element of a_{k+1} is given by the dot product of a_k and w_i for some weight vector w_i. Call w_i the ith neuron of layer k + 1. The largest activations in a_{k+1} are the ones for whom w_i has high magnitude and points in the same direction as a_k. The core proposal of SLIDE is to only compute the largest elements of a_{k+1}, which they call the &#x201C;activated neurons&#x201D;, and approximate all of the others are zero, allowing us to avoid a lot of computation.</p><p>In order to do this, we maintain a data structure called a <em>locality-sensitive hash table</em>, which when given an activation a_k can tell us which neurons (w_is) are most similar. We can then compute the outputs for just those neurons to get a_{k+1}. In this way, we can effectively &#x2018;sparsify&#x2019; the network, calculating the activations and updating the weights of only a small subset of the neurons. This is what gives us our computational gains.</p><p>SLIDE randomly initializes weights in the network and generates the locality-sensitive hash table that maps activations to activated neurons. To take a gradient step on an input, it calculates the activated neurons in a forward pass, then backpropagates through the activated neurons, and then updates the locality-sensitive hash table. The hash table update is computationally expensive, and SLIDE uses several mechanisms to make it less costly, such as updating hash tables less frequently later in the training process since gradients are likely to change less then. Due to the sparsity, the gradients for different inputs are often changing different neurons, and so SLIDE asynchronously parallelizes gradient updates without worrying about race conditions, allowing for much better scaling with additional cores.</p><p>The paper evaluates SLIDE on large multi-label classification tasks, which must run on neural networks with extremely wide final layers. It finds that the CPUs running SLIDE are 1.8 times faster in clock-time than the GPU on the Delicious 200k dataset, and 2.7 times faster than the GPU on the Amazon-670K dataset, with an additional ~1.3x speed-up after performing cache optimization on SLIDE. Scalability tests suggest that the SLIDE CPUs beat GPU performance even when using only 8 cores. The paper claims that SLIDE&#x2019;s computational benefits come because the number of neurons sampled in the wide final layer is extremely small-- fewer than 0.5% of active neurons.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> The tasks they test on are <em>extremely</em> sparse: since there are hundreds of thousands of possible labels, even if you take the top ~thousand predictions in the final layer (which corresponds to most of the computation), that&#x2019;s only 1% of the total number of predictions, saving you 99% of the arithmetic you would have had to do. The input features are also very sparse: in both datasets, less than 0.06% (yes, percent) of features are non-zero. It&#x2019;s cool that under such conditions you can design an algorithm that is ~an order of magnitude better on cost, but it&#x2019;s not going to be &#x201C;the death of NVIDIA&#x201D; or anything like that &#x2014; without further optimizations, SLIDE will be worse than regular Tensorflow on GPU for something like ImageNet.</p><p>I&apos;m also not sure I agree with the &apos;thesis&apos; of the paper that smart algorithms beat hardware acceleration-- it seems to me like there are large gains from investing in the combination of the two. Even if GPUs aren&apos;t optimized to run SLIDE, I can imagine specialized hardware optimized for SLIDE creating even bigger performance gains.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05671\">Linear Mode Connectivity and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis</a></strong> <em>(Jonathan Frankle et al)</em> (summarized by Flo): Instability analysis looks at how sensitive neural network training is to noise in SGD. A network is called stable if the test error remains approximately constant along the line connecting network weights obtained by training on differently ordered data. </p><p>The authors find that most popular networks in image classification are unstable at initialization for more challenging tasks but become stable long before convergence. They also find that <strong><a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/understanding-the-generalization-of-lottery-tickets-in-neural-networks\">winning tickets</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/d2f2d15b7114/an-77-double-descent-a-unification-of-statistical-theory-and-modern-ml-practice\">AN #77</a></strong>) found by iterative magnitude pruning are usually stable, while unstable subnetworks don&apos;t manage to match the original network&apos;s performance after training. As the original network, pruned subnetworks become more stable when they are initialized with weights from later stages of the training process. This is consistent with previous results showing that resetting subnetwork weights to states in early training leads to increased performance after retraining, compared to resetting to the initial state. While stability seems to correspond to better accuracy for subnetworks, very sparse subnetworks perform worse than the unpruned network, even if they are stable.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> The correspondence between subnetwork stability and performance after retraining might just be an artefact of both (somewhat obviously) improving with more training. What is interesting is that small amounts of training seem to have disproportionate effects for both factors, although one should keep in mind that the same is true for the loss, at least in absolute terms.</p><h1>NEWS </h1><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.ai.mil/careers.html\">Careers at the Joint AI Center</a></strong> (summarized by Rohin) (H/T Jon Rodriguez): The Joint AI Center is searching for ML experts for a variety of roles.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> You might be wondering why I&apos;ve included these jobs in the newsletter, given that I don&apos;t do very many promotions. I think that it is reasonably likely that the US government (and the military in particular) will be a key player in the future of AI, and that there could be a lot to learn from their testing, evaluation, validation &amp; verification (TEV&amp;V) framework (which often seems more risk-averse to me than many alignment schemes are). As a result, I would be excited if readers of this newsletter interested in how the military thinks about AI filled these positions: it seems great to have a flow of ideas between the two communities (so that the government learns about alignment concerns, and so that we learn about TEV&amp;V).</p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p>I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=\"https://rohinshah.com/\">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

Many claims have been made! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get an awesome body? Habitify it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to become great at your studies? Place gummy-bears on each page to train your pesky mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get rid of stress? Sit in the same spot and breathe through your nose for 5 minutes, and to ensure you keep doing it, track it in a spreadsheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how well does this fit with the habit literature? And why don’t more people train themselves with gummy-bears? Let’s find out!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A note on “why now”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us are in unfamiliar contexts, being forced to work from home to reduce contagion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This presents to us both a challenge and an opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re forced to work in unfamiliar contexts and, if you’re anything like me, this means that your work time is now being intruded upon by a bunch of thoughts relating to habits that are great when you relax – but gaming isn’t going to get your thesis done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, habits are more easily changed when contexts change. If you want to get new, appropriate habits at home, or get rid of something you’ve been doing, the time is now!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(A short side-note: This will not be a review of all habit-literature, but rather small dives into results I’ve encountered that were interesting and/or ran counter to what I expected).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What defines a true habit?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re like me, you’re slightly provoked by the title. “True habits” you say? What are “false” habits?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to think that doing the same task repetitively would be sufficient to form habits, or was in fact, the entire definition of a habit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To question that assumption, we must first ask ourselves, “why do we prefer habits to to-do lists?”. If we can just do what we want, when we want to, without getting tired, why bother with this habit business at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer lies in automaticity. We want to be able to perform our morning routine without thinking too much about it, while tired, stressed and under time-pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that some actions that change behavior are detrimental to forming automaticity. This is (obviously) really important, and runs counter to much of what’s written in the pop-psych litterature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, what is automaticity?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the habit literature, it’s operationalised as a high score on the Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (SRBAI) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22935297\">Gardner 2012</a>). Once again, science excels at acronyms that are both impossible to pronounce and remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, the questionnaire is simple. Participants are asked to rate how much they agree with the statement: “Behavior X is something I”:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>do automatically</li><li>do without having to consciously remember</li><li>do without thinking</li><li>start doing before I realize I’m doing it</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Impressively, this explains a large amount of the variance in whether the behavior is executed (r+ = .47, 95% CI .39; .43), (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22935297\">Gardner 2012</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do habits work?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Habits work through a simple loop, Cue-&gt;Action-&gt;Feedback. You see popcorn (cue), you buy and eat popcorn (action), you taste the salty, buttery goodness of popcorn (feedback) (<a href=\"https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/\">Duhigg 2012</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cue initiates the action which is reinforced or weakened by the reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How come, then, that we don’t masturbate furiously when we see a sexy person on the street? After all, sexy features are a typical cue, and masturbation feels good (feedback). Few of us have tried it, so we haven’t gotten any negative feedback either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll turn to this question, and how to use the answer(s) to our advantage, in the next section.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Taking charge: Intentional (de)training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before undertaking any endeavour, we must consider the costs and the benefits. Changing habits, especially ones that don’t fit our goals, can obviously come with great benefits – but how much effort must we invest?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have heard that “it takes 66 days to form a habit”. Like any fact without confidence intervals or error bars, being skeptical of this number is good practice. Where does it come from?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turns out this is all from one study, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674\">Lally 2009</a>. They had 39 participants train a variety of habits, like doing 50 sit-ups after their morning coffee or going for a 10 minute walk after breakfast. Once each day, each participant filled out the Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (SRBAI).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fit a quadratic regression, measure time to 95% of asymptote (ie. when the curve flattens out) and hey presto, you’ve got yourself a pop-psych number!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/l-emWHCxDMDExR9vm4YRW5romad-4fBScsnm3OmIILS5iRms5Nx_Kh1A9tR6RPSDD6IQnsLE0v0ocUal1gEaN2f5LM5sF35zzq4pbzBLPrXmXkkh6GiiqLs7i3kzboiJPG7D_d-d\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MIlwVwS7i_NxIS3cGpnW-iqyg6_LNGHp667v4q0fEKm-m4fk54o5TvfABZA13E_61m2rn9AEp1zdeJQVvHNX-guoNLUn2ZCUd8_ECtkMIVhXatScpLHuaXJUPXbXWfCMIff3M0_W\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>66 is a pretty number, I’ll admit. And I think the methodology of the study is sound, if the Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (SRBAI) can be used sequentially. The authors acknowledge these limitations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what is often forgotten is the variance. The 25% and 75% percentile are at 39 and 102 days. This means that only 50% of participants reached 95% of “peak automaticity” somewhere between 39 days and 102 days after starting the habits. 25% took a shorter amount of time, 25% took a longer amount of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What can we take away from this? Habits are formed over <strong>weeks or months</strong>, so expect to wait some time before you can do them without paying attention. And don’t expect there to be a magic threshold; expect steady improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effort is often worth it, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad habits and good habits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The point of mastering your habits is, at least in my view, not to force ourselves to do things we don’t want, or to remove fun and pleasurable experiences. Guilty pleasures are still pleasures after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sometimes the cost of a habit is higher than the benefit. And sometimes a habit is activated in circumstances where it doesn’t bring much benefit at all! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider <a href=\"https://dornsifecms.usc.edu/assets/sites/545/docs/Wendy_Wood_Research_Articles/Habits/neal.wood.wu.kurlander.2011.the_pull_of_the_past.pdf\">Neal 2011</a>. Participants were sent to a theater to watch a movie and served either fresh or stale popcorn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the surprise of no one, participants liked fresh popcorn more than stale.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qrl7v-4ipyODPLOGNCP7pIHhQeWHluC_ygIcKq_76q3GpuMtuQRzJu3Lq_fdnEX3s4XafihNh7u9Pku3QylshjkS0G4ZvNnPE8XWIg5GM-fKeU9UkjBB3zsPjfx9oXJ5jokOZ5MA\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For participants with low habitual popcorn-eating, the stale popcorn was less attractive, so they ate less of it. But for participants with high habitual popcorn-eating, the taste of the popcorn had <strong>no effect</strong> on the amount consumed! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RIsmFA6eNt5edEOg597G6UdppO56QaiPIc2r7EV8D9Ara3ikdGtAiwsJKb1HZ-uoD3pmK9sn4eYgfeK3owj7Yj63ozksQ2jQ6XhOiFKKEzBEzne6KcwtOolHBNBrgmE3K_c27U1P\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first half of the answer to “why don’t we masturbate in the street”. For actions with low habituality or strong intentions, we choose what suits our goals best. Since very few of us enjoy a night in jail, masturbating doesn’t even enter consciousness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, gabitual behavior can clearly be maladaptive. How, then, do we take charge?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Breaking conflicting habits</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For strong habits, your intention is weak sauce. We saw this already with fresh vs. stale popcorn. What about something stronger than a taste cue, like Implementation Intentions (Trigger-Action-Plans)?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some success has been noted, but only 1 study was done outside of the lab. <a href=\"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1348/014466608X370591\">Webb 2009</a> randomised adolescent smokers who wanted to stop smoking to either implementation intentions or a control condition (listing advantages of seatbelt use).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They found a moderate effect of forming implementation intentions, moderated by habit strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QVPVe-0vPgKTgkLx_-oIDkBs3G2d9B2mIIQXNR9mDRXjwU1eYVB38pNmgzkEBHeAvx4ZvlToBSK5vmfO_teUU8m-dw9YXIsjZKPLkOm_F0dZVpnNYU06PDvlYxdi4W9D11TrYv17\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If intention is weak, what works, then?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Remove the cues/change the context</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Context-changes are a great time to change habits! Some habits don’t even generalize across contexts; for the popcorn eating experiment, no difference was found if the movie was shown in a meeting room rather than a theater.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Km0y5iqX54z8g6T1z4OHMk4hCPhD5RFN_LWTFrE5S-SJGGQBvOCQEpZ9rWgPbeXF4SDGyuK6K7LXknvYR9nirjtdkKWDpzxr_sXv-kej1CqO0PO1v0fYsA-O5n9LovQTuTBxjR3L\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Be it changing travel habits during office relocations (<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/tg57ws9\">Walker 2015</a>), optimising your commute during worker strikes (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjx020\">Larcom 2017</a>), or a host of other cases (<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/w4ztptl\">Verplanken 2016</a>, <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/w99h4nw\">Bamberg 2006</a>, <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/wt7bn7h\">Thøgersen 2012</a>), context-changes are where it’s at!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second half of why we don’t masturbate in the street: It’s an unknown (and inappropriate) context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can you implement this in your life? Personally, during the beginning of the COVID-19 quarantine I had tremendous difficulties focusing on work. Every time I was switching between tasks, I was tempted to “just play one game”. I had to fight urges all the time. This led to me getting much less work done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Armed with the insights above, I added two desks to my room; 1 for work, 1 for leisure. Two days later, my desire for gaming during work was completely gone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Make the habit harder to perform</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like gaming with your friends, but you find yourself gaming more than you’d like, why not change your password to something randomly generated and give it to your friend?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find that visiting reddit or hacker news has become encoded in muscle memory, you can break the cue-&gt;action-&gt;reward cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the Chrome add-on <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leechblock-ng/blaaajhemilngeeffpbfkdjjoefldkok\">Leechblock</a> to block websites. Or, if you want something stronger, don’t just block, redirect it to a website that’s aversive to you. I used a political party I’m strongly opposed to. This will break the near-unconscious habit in no time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&gt; Have you detrained habits? Which benefits did that bring you?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, the goal is not to remove all guilty pleasures. Leechblock allows manual overrides, so I can still access those sites when I choose to deliberately. But the habitual “this task is difficult” (cue) -&gt; browse reddit (action) -&gt; fun gifs (reward) loop has been broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Leechblock isn’t your cup of tea, you might consider <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leechblock-ng/blaaajhemilngeeffpbfkdjjoefldkok\">Crackbook</a> or <a href=\"https://www.inmotion.app/\">In Motion</a>. For Gmail, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://inboxwhenready.org/\">Inbox When Ready</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two rather simple strategies have been tremendously useful for me. Now we turn to how to add new habits to your stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Forming endorsed habits</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To intentionally form habits, we must change our behavior and/or our environment to facilitate habit formation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use Implementation Intentions as training wheels</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementation intentions are based on a trigger and an action, eg. “When I sit on the edge of my bed, I will do 10 push-ups”. They are pretty good at changing behavior, too! A 2006 meta-analysis (<a href=\"http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/10973/06GollwitzerSheeran_ImplementationIntentionsAndGoalAchievement.pdf?sequence=1\">Gollwitzer 2006</a>) found a medium-large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.65).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as implied in the techniques name, implementation intentions need intention. They’re dependent on you remembering to do the action based on the trigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you choose your trigger carefully, implementation intentions can transition into habits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which triggers are good, then? Most habit-apps would have you believe that you can rely on their reminders – but is that really a good idea?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278405715_Beyond_Self-Tracking_and_Reminders_Designing_Smartphone_Apps_That_Support_Habit_Formation\">Stawarz 2015</a> had participants send in a text with what they ate after each meal. The trigger group were told to do it right after lunch, and the reminder group received a text at a set interval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the reminder group were reminded to send the text and had higher adherence.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6PxV_KKGaIxMdaieGn7fsGZ6faEW7qdX1CJ2KquG44uk9Fy0a-TKRD-Js7Fo2RGpb0t2b1jxnG3ywUU202k6f2dzsS9IiLyUOOsYZhAg2tU1aZtbwuiOlisVjL0TYGcWaQ4-_Ixm\" /><figcaption>Error bars are standard-deviations.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, they also had a lower automaticity score, implying that they performed the action not out of habit, but because they were reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2AcT9W3lnb0xfd2fq596GZ1nmyyPHQzfsgu78ySOm-7-vrM8frPhdYtvXGx48jI2v1SrlANcvKCXDD6azc_VVyVg9Eq141Fi8d5vMzlk5eM-dhn9sGSvlOAusgu52_adkxj4Kx0F\" /><figcaption>Error bars are standard deviations.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This implies that acting on reminders requires intentionality. That’s all fine and good, but that’s not why we’re trying to habitify our actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, set a good trigger. Make it specific (rather “after finishing my plate” than “after dinner”), choose something that’s consistent (prefer “after getting dressed” to “after getting ready for work”) and preferably chain it to something else in your routine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a bunch more good advice out there for implementing habits. I’ve made a short spreadsheet <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kS2RNA9n6ObAZiLchwrAim17CRr6hitFebR5I8kGAWs/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>, with some added motivation from the <a href=\"https://woopmylife.org/\">WOOP-technique</a>. It’s definitely a little rough around the edges, but rather share something that isn’t perfect, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you found this interesting! We’ve talked about what separates habits from repeat intentional behavior, how long it takes to make or break a new habit, when habits are strong and weak and how to use these insights to your advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now is the time to put it to use. Which habits would you like to add? And which habits are standing in your way? They’re in your hands now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any questions/comments, I’d love to hear them below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

Search</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www.lsusr.com/lesswrong/blue-vials.jpg\" alt=\"blue vials\"></p>\n<p>You have 1000 saliva samples. Exactly 1 of them is from someone infected by COVID-19. You have unlimited testing strips. Each day the CDC has resources to process up to 10 testing strips for you. You must send all 10 testing strips to the CDC at the same time. The next day, the CDC will tell you which of the 10 strips has been exposed to infected saliva. What is the fewest number of days required to figure out which sample is infected?</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Answer: 1 day</p>\n</div>\n<h1>3. Cryptography</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www.lsusr.com/lesswrong/label_enigma.jpg\" alt=\"Enigma machine\"></p>\n<p>It is the year 1932. You work for the Polish government. They have captured a German Enigma machine. The Enigma machine has three rotating rubber rotors (disks). Each rotor has 26 copper wires feeding from one side to the other. At the back of the machine is a reflector, reflecting 13 of the contact points on the back of rotor 3 to the 13 other contact points on the back of rotor 3. In this way, the current gets scrambled forward through rotors 1, 2, and 3 and then scrambled backwards through rotors 3, 2 and 1. Each time someone presses a key, the first rotor rotates forward one letter. Every full rotation of the first rotor, the second rotor rotates one letter. Every full rotation of the second rotor, the third rotor rotates one letter.</p>\n<p>Each letter of the alphabet is thus mapped to another letter of the alphabet in a symmetric cipher. This cipher changes each keystroke. You can configure the Enigma machine by setting the dials with a 3-letter code. The Germans change this code once per day. Today the daily code might be SEC. Tomorrow it could be UNK. The Germans also create a unique 3-letter code separately for each message. The daily code is used to transmit the message code twice.</p>\n<p>For example, if the daily code is SEC and the message code is MES then the Germans will use the daily code SEC to encode MESMES. This might result in the ciphertext XFYZQM. Only these first 6 letters are encrypted with SEC. The rest of the message is encrypted with MES. The next message (on the same day) might have a message code COD. In this case, the daily code SEC is used to encode CODCOD which might result in the ciphertext IWVUBB.</p>\n<p>Design the cheapest machine you can to break the German cryptosystem. You have access to neither vacuum tubes nor transistors. You may assume the Germans always use the same three rotors and never use the plugboard.</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Hint: Marian Rejewski</p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The argument that we should be listening to experts and not\nrandom people would make a lot of sense if the \"armchair\" folks didn't\nkeep being right.\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\nLet's look at the articles they're criticizing for having non-expert\nauthors:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca\">Coronavirus:\nAct Today or People Will Die</a> (3/10): Argues that we need to get everyone\nto stay home immediately.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-cancel-everything/607675/\">Cancel\nEverything</a> (3/10): Argues essentially the same point.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727\">Flattening\nThe Curve Is a Deadly Delusion</a> (3/13): Argues that our medical\ncapacity is so much lower than the likely peak that we need an\nimmediate lockdown and a renewed focus on containment.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWith two weeks of perspective, however, these articles were exactly\nright.  They clearly laid out the case for decisive action, and if we\nhad followed their prescriptions more closely we would be in much\nbetter shape right now.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis goes beyond a few articles, however.  All the aspects of this\ncrisis that have involved planning more than a couple weeks out have\nbeen very poorly handled:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>People weren't told to stock up on food so that they'd be able to\n    reduce trips outdoors, and so that they'd have food in case they\n    were quarantined for 2+ weeks. Stores weren't told to prepare for\n    a rush.  A government that was on top of things could have started\n    advocating this in early February in an \"if you can afford to\"\n    way. This would have spread people's buying over a longer period\n    and avoided the empty shelves we see now. Instead, once\n    restaurants were closing and people realized that they could be\n    quarantined at any time, everyone simultaneously tried to buy\n    weeks worth of ingredients and we had widespread shortages of\n    basic goods starting in mid March.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Hospitals weren't told (or allowed?) to ration personal\n    protective equipment such as masks until they had shortages.  The\n    CDC didn't publish guidelines for sanitization and reuse, and\n    start telling people to conserve.  In weeks of handling initial\n    cases, hospitals burned through amounts that would have lasted\n    months with careful rationing.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The federal government, state governments, or even hospitals could\n    have placed emergency ventilator production orders in February,\n    but didn't. Because we don't allow price gouging, ventilator\n    companies can't ramp up production speculatively figuring that if\n    there is really an epidemic then they'll make their money back. By\n    mid March it was obvious that we were far short of where we needed\n    to be and the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200319005321/en/\">companies\n    started ramping up</a> but we lost about a month of production\n    increase.</p></li>\n    \n<li><p>Masks were sitting on shelves across the country, and the\n    government could have requisitioned them for emergency medical\n    use, or even just gone and bought them. Instead the Surgeon\n    General <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160\">tweeted\n    a request that people not buy them</a>.</p></li>\n      \n<li><p>Testing has been completely messed up, though it's hard to\n    tell how much was bad luck vs reasonable rationing of scarce\n    tests. But we should have been quarantining people who seemed\n    to have it based on symptoms, instead of saying \"well, since\n    we can't test you we have to assume you don't have it, so\n    you're welcome to continue living your life\".</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We could have planned and built out COVID-specific facilities\n    to reduce the risk of others getting sick and make more efficient\n    use of ventilators and personal protective equipment.  We're just\n    starting to do this now, much too late.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The passengers of the Grand Princess were <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Most-Grand-Princess-passengers-not-tested-for-15141731.php\">offered\n    testing</a> but told that if they tested positive they would be\n    required to undergo quarantine.  Of 858 passengers, 568 declined\n    testing and were released without even advice to self-isolate.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>The CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html\">is\n    still</a> (3/24) not recommending the general public avoid contact\n    with others unless you're sick, they're sick, or you know covid-19 is\n    spreading in your community.  They're only recommending people stay\n    home if they're sick.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nAnd I understand: this is moving very quickly, and authorities aren't\nused to needing to respond so rapidly.  But there was a meme going\naround:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<b>Neil Diamond</b>: touching hands<br />\n<b>CDC</b>: no don't touch hands<br />\n<b>Neil Diamond</b>: reaching out<br />\n<b>CDC</b>: please avoid that<br />\n<b>Neil Diamond</b>: TOUCHING YOU-<br />\n<b>CDC</b>: everyone is Boston is doomed<br />\n —<a href=\"https://twitter.com/actioncookbook/status/1233220136431124482\">@actioncookbook</a> (2/27)\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThis joke and its many copycats feature the CDC we wish we had.  A CDC\nthat would have been pushing social distancing a month ago, when it\nwould have helped so much more.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/google-trends-social-distancing-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/google-trends-social-distancing.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/google-trends-social-distancing.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/google-trends-social-distancing-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n<br />\n<i>Google Trends: \"social distancing\"</i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf we had listened to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/5/27/8660249/bill-gates-spanish-flu-pandemic\">the\nwarnings</a> and prepared better we would have the experts we need,\nwith the influence to get policies changed, and we wouldn't need the\nadvice of the armchair epidemiologists.  But that's not the world\nwe've found ourselves in, and the amateurs have been doing critical\nwork filling in for them in pushing policy.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\nA policy of \"listen to random experts\" is better than a policy of \"listen to random amateurs\". But rejecting the arguments of amateurs who were making clear arguments, solely on the grounds of their non-expert status, was harmful here.\n\n</p>",

Things are going along just fine until they point out to you that <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/803/\">your understanding of lift is wrong</a>, and that planes couldn&apos;t fly from the effect you thought was responsible.</p><p>Should you immediately panic in fear that the plane will plummet out of the sky?</p><p>Obviously not; clearly the plane has been flying just fine up until now, and countless other planes have flown as well. There has to be <em>something</em> keeping the plane up, even if it&apos;s not what you thought, and even if you can&apos;t yet figure out what it actually is. Whatever is going on, it all adds up to normality.</p><p>Yet I claim that we often do this exact kind of panicked flailing when there&apos;s a challenge to our philosophical or psychological beliefs, and that this panic is entirely preventable.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>I&apos;ve experienced and/or seen this particular panic response when I, or others, encounter good arguments for propositions including</p><ul><li>My religion is not true. (&quot;Oh no, then life and morality are meaningless and empty!&quot;)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Kqs6GR7F5xziuSyGZ\">Many-worlds makes the most sense.</a> (&quot;Oh no, then there are always copies of me doing terrible things, and so none of my choices matter!&quot;)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Brain-Hidden-Motives-Everyday/dp/0190495995\">Many &quot;altruistic&quot; actions actually have hidden selfish motives.</a> (&quot;Oh no, then altruism doesn&apos;t exist and morality is pointless!&quot;)</li><li>I don&apos;t have to be the best at something in order for it to be worth doing. (&quot;Oh no, then others won&apos;t value me!&quot;) [Note: this one is from therapy; most people don&apos;t have the same core beliefs they&apos;re stuck on.]</li></ul><p>(I promise these are not in fact strawmen. I&apos;m sure you can think of your own examples. Also remember that panicking over an argument in this way is a mistake even if the proposition turns out to be false.)</p><p>To illustrate the way out, let&apos;s take the first example. It took me far too long to leave my religion, partly because I was so terrified about becoming a nihilist if I left that I kept flinching away from the evidence. (Of course, the religion proclaimed itself to be the origin of morality, and so it reinforced the notion that anyone else claiming to be moral was just too blind to see that their lack of faith implied nihilism.)</p><p>Eventually I did make myself face down, not just the object-level arguments, but the biases that had kept me from looking directly at them. And then I was an atheist, and still I was terrified of becoming a nihilist (especially about morality).</p><p>So I did one thing I still think was smart: I promised myself not to change all of my moral rules at once, but to change each one only when (under sober reflection) I decided it was wrong. And in the meantime, I read a lot of moral philosophy.</p><p>Over the next few months, I began relaxing the rules that were obviously pointless. And then I had a powerful insight: I was so cautious about changing my rules <em>because I wanted to help people and not slide into hurting them</em>. Regardless of what morality was, in fact, based on, the plane was still flying just fine. And that helped me sort out the good from the bad among the remaining rules, and to stop being so afraid of what arguments I might later encounter.</p><p>So in retrospect, the main thing I&apos;d recommend is to <strong>promise yourself to keep steering the plane mostly as normal while you think about lift</strong> (to stretch the analogy). If you decide that something major is false, it doesn&apos;t mean that everything that follows from it has to be discarded immediately. (False things imply both true and false things!)</p><p>You&apos;ll generally find that many important things stand on their own without support from the old belief. (Doing this for the other examples I gave, as well as your own, is left to you.) Other things will collapse, and that&apos;s fine; that which can be destroyed by the truth should be. Just don&apos;t make all of these judgments in one fell swoop.</p><p>One last caution: <strong>I recommend against changing meta-level rules as a result of changing object-level beliefs</strong>. The meta level is how you correct bad decisions on the object level, and it should only be updated by very clear reasoning in a state of equilibrium. Changing your flight destination is perfectly fine, but don&apos;t take apart the wing mid-flight.</p><p>Good luck out there, and remember:</p><p>It all adds up to normality.</p><p>[EDIT 2020-03-25: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mmCDYzXfQpXq9xpru/adding-up-to-normality-1?commentId=QK5TfDjGW6bXqDc7p\">khafra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mmCDYzXfQpXq9xpru/adding-up-to-normality-1?commentId=RAwtMwLxfeLhAD5cJ\">Isnasene</a> make good points about not applying this in cases where the plane shows signs of <em>actually dropping</em> and you&apos;re updating on <em>that</em>. (Maybe there&apos;s a new crisis in the external world that contradicts one of your beliefs, or maybe you update to believe that the thing you&apos;re about to do could actually cause a major catastrophe.)</p><p>In that case, you can try and land the plane safely- focus on getting to a safer state for yourself and the world, so that you have time to think things over. And if you can&apos;t do that, then you have no choice but to rethink your piloting on the fly, accepting the danger because you can&apos;t escape it. But these experiences will hopefully be very rare for you, current global crisis excepted.]</p>",

Sometimes interesting ideas/quasi-problems/ways of looking at things come to mind during the study, and I think on them as well.</p><p>When I&#x2019;m solving a problem, I&#x2019;ll usually walk around and try to solve it mentally, because I have this uncertain belief that if my math needs paper and pencil, then I can hardly use it &#x201C;at will.&#x201D; I&#x2019;m the kind of person who forgets stuff and needs to repeatedly derive them from first principles when needed, and I can&#x2019;t quite do that if those derivations rely on writing stuff out. (I also hate memorizing theorems. It feels stupid. :D )</p><p>By the way, if the solution is not in the text and I&#x2019;m stumped, I websearch around. I hate the professors who give grades for the text&#x2019;s problems and thus disincentiviz solution manuals economically and socially. These take-home exercises correlate more with people&#x2019;s social skills and network than their effort or knowledge. Quizzing people instead is a much better choice.</p>",

(No)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s fairly hard to get raw data about covid-19 cases, the mos  comprehensive dataset of individual cases I could find is compiled by  the medical community at DXY.cn (a Chinese medical discussion board):</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jS24DjSPVWa4iuxuD4OAXrE3QeI8c9BC1hSlqr-NMiU/edit#gid=1187587451\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jS24DjSPVWa4iuxuD4OAXrE3QeI8c9BC1hSlqr-NMiU/edit#gid=1187587451</a></p><p>I find it curios that out of 397 cases with a reported age in the US, only 4 were under the age of 15.</p><p>I say I find this curios because based on the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/270000/age-distribution-in-the-united-states/\">2018 census data</a>, 18.71% of the US population is under 15 years of age.</p><p>This leads me to the clickbaity number in the title (<code>round(0.187/(4/397)) == 19</code>).</p><p>However, I did not pick the US specifically to get this high of a  number, indeed, China yields an even higher one. I simply thought 19 had  a nice ring to it considering the disease&#x2019;s name&#x2026; and the whole point  of this article is to explain why this observation is blatantly wrong  anyway.</p><p>While this particular coronavirus is indeed novel, coronaviruses in  general are a pretty wide spread species and some of them have symptoms  we label under &#x201C;common cold&#x201D;, together with the original SARS and the  MERS coronavirus, I think enough data to say with a very high certainty:</p><ul><li>The claim that it&#x2019;s less likely for a kid to get infected by a  coronavirus is bullshit, most certainly so when the number claimed is as  high as 19 times less likely.</li></ul><p>Even more so, kids are particularly bad at not licking random  surface, touching strangers, eating random stuff off the ground and  overall doing stuff that is unsafe in terms of not getting infected by  almost any given virus or bacteria.</p><p>So why are so few kids getting infected ?</p><p>Well, you could say:</p><ul><li>It&#x2019;s because kids are less likely to be in tightly packed places (e.g. nursing homes, planes)</li><li>It&#x2019;s because kids are less likely to be in places where infected people reside (i.e. hospitals and triage centers)</li><li>It&#x2019;s because the data of patients under 18 is less likely to be  made fully available (however, I could be making the same point for  people under 65 or under 40 here, it&#x2019;s just that the number would be  lower)</li></ul><p>But I could say:</p><ul><li>Kids are more likely to be in tightly packed places with some of  the lowest interpersonal sanitary norms on earth (e.g. kindergartens and  schools)</li><li>Newborns kids are very likely to be in hospitals (all be it in  the maternity wards) and there doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a bump for newborns</li><li>Kids, unlike adults, are almost always nearby other adults. I can  isolate myself alone in my house, but most kids in this demographic  would still need at least one guardian near them at all times.</li></ul><p>I think the real explanation is more along the lines of:</p><ul><li>Kids have a very well functioning immune system. Our impression  to the contrary comes partially from niche viruses ala influenza who  provoke symptoms via causing an over-reaction from the immune system.  Partially from the fact that kids don&#x2019;t have anti-bodies ready for a  host of infections to which we have built immunity. Partially because  kids are gross and don&#x2019;t understand the concept of personal space or not  eating dirt and are thus more prone to come into contact with large  quantities of pathogens. But overall I would trade and arm and a leg to  have the lymphatic system of a 14 year old again.</li><li>The tests used to monitor sars-covid-2 are usually the cheap and quick kind, which have <a href=\"https://blog.cerebralab.com/[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-020-00010-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-020-00010-2)\">sensitivities as low as 70% in the first 4-10 days of the infection</a>.  But of course, this measure is mainly based on testing adults (mainly  older adults), it might well be that a young person (read: an organism  with extremely well functioning in immune system, cell MHC1 and MHC2  protein presentation mechanism and cell apoptosis mechanism) is able to  stop the infection in it&#x2019;s tracks much quicker before IgM or IgG levels  get noticeably high.</li><li>Many of the people tested for the disease are those presenting to  hospitals, those people are presenting to hospitals because they are  having symptoms that bother them. Even if someone under 15 has a  noticeable raise in IgM or IgG levels, the immune reaction might be  enough in order for symptoms not to go past a mild fever and some  coughing&#x2026; which are basically omnipresent in young kids during the  spring, so nobody will bring them to a hospital for those reasons alone.</li></ul><p>However, if this is the case, this reasoning need not extent to  children alone. All of the reasons listed above are not specific to  children, it just so happens that well functioning immune system are  overly represented in children.</p><p>There&#x2019;s plenty of older people with well functioning organisms that  could react to an infection similar to how most children could. Although  this breaks down past a certain age, since our thymus is slowly  replaced by adipose tissue in the morbid, painful and not yet reversible  process we call &#x201C;aging&#x201D;.</p><p>In some ways this article is a &#x201C;layman&#x2019;s defense for the layman&#x201D; of  this analysis by Oxford&#x2019;s center for evidence-based medicine: <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/\">https://www.cebm.net/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/</a>.  Which claims CFRs (case fatality rates) way bellow what&#x2019;s being  currently reported and places much more of the blame or comorbidities.</p><p>That is to say, this is hopefully an intuition as to why &#x201C;A lot of  people in retirement homes dying in Bergamo&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t translate to &#x201C;This  virus will kill 1-5% of Earth&#x2019;s population&#x201D;.</p><p>It&#x2019;s also hopefully an explanation of why R0 (the basic reproductive  rate) ranges from 1.4 to 3.9 (which is huge, even compared to the ranges  we get for most seasonal influenza strains) and thus it could really be  anywhere from &#x201C;if left unchecked it will spread like a vengeful  medieval plague&#x201D; to &#x201C;it spreads more or less like the flu&#x201D;.</p><h2>Two things that keep me awake at night</h2><p>However, it does leave me curios as to two things.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve seen the CFR and R0, or various facts derived from them, used by  physicians and authorities in terms of communicating information to the  public and enacting quarantine measures.</p><p>These two things would heavily influence how that information is communicated and how said measures are encated.</p><p>1.</p><p>If the data for this disease is so poor (e.g. respectable  institutions have numbers order of magnitude different for the estimated  CFR), why go ahead and make claims based on R0 and CFR to being with ?</p><p>I&#x2019;m not claiming the diseases is not dangerous, on the contrary, I am  claiming that it could be potentially MUCH MORE dangerous than we think  or MUCH LESS dangerous than we think.</p><p>That&#x2019;s an issue, because that&#x2019;s how you get to under-reacting and  causing millions of deaths or over-reacting and causing millions of  death (due to a horrible recession, even though they won&#x2019;t be in Europe  or the USA, they will be in Africa, as people start tightening the belt  and donations to charities are among the first inessential things to go  away).</p><p>Would the wise thing here not be to try and gather more data as  aggressively as possible ? Rather than going on TV and making claims  around numbers for which no degree of certainty exists.</p><p>2.</p><p>If the current data indicates that kids and most likely healthy young  adults are not at risk, while old people and people with comorbidities  are at very high risk. Why not act along those lines:</p><p>Allow young people that want to break quarantine to do so, monitor  them closely and test them in order to figure out what the consequences  of spreading in a young demographic is&#x2026; after all, it seems that they  aren&#x2019;t very significant based on current numbers.</p><p>If the consequences seem worrisome, revert the measure before hospitals get overwhelmed.</p><p>If the consequences seem on par with a bad strain of rhinovirus or  influenza, progressively advise more and more people that they can break  isolation (but make sure to inform them that the risk of death exists  and that they will be assuming it), thus getting the economy partially  back on track and increasing the cohort you are monitoring.</p><p>On the other hand, if we are petty certain that old people and people  with certain comorbidities (e.g. diabetes and CVD) are at very high  risk. Why not target those people directly in terms of aid, quarantine  measures and messaging.</p><p>Why do we have broad sweeping messages about &#x201C;stay at home&#x201D;, which  seems to be mainly causing a panic in young well-educated adults (aka  the kind of healthy demographic that is prone to leading an  overly-healthy lifestyle which could lead them to not even noticing an  infection) whilst not at all disturbing grandma and grandpa (aka the  kind of people you really really really want to stay at home) ?</p><p>Wouldn&#x2019;t a functioning economy better allow for long-term quarantine of those at risk ?</p><p>I&#x2019;d personally be pretty glad to go around shopping for a few old  people in my local community and pass on the supplies to a guy wearing a  hazmat suit that will disinfect them to the best of his abilities and  then hand them over.</p><p>I feel like this kind of &#x201C;allow young volunteers to boost herd  immunity, keep the economy going and provide data, at least until our  data tells us otherwise&#x201D; approach would be preferable to the  progressively worsening quarantine that is not discriminating based on  age or comorbidities.</p><h2>But</h2><p>Again, I don&#x2019;t think based on current data I am qualified in terms of proposing the kind of measure we should enact.</p><p>I do however strongly think that any measures should revolve around  &#x201C;how do we gather better quality data and making it more widely  available for people to build models and hypothesis based on&#x201D;.</p><p>I also think that throwing anyone in the same bucket in terms of risk  and thus throwing them in the same bucket in terms of the measures we  enact is silly.</p><p>To me it seems that young healthy people are:</p><ul><li>An issue because of asymptomatic spread of the diseases</li><li>An asset because if they gain immunity they could help with blood donations for plasma therapy</li></ul><p>Whilst old or unhealthy people are:</p><ul><li>An issue because of the severity of symptoms and risk of death</li><li>An asset because they provide an easy way to track spread (since they are more likely to be symptomatic)</li><li>An ideal target for protective measures if our goals it to reduce cases with severe symptoms and fatality</li></ul><p>Obviously, &#x201C;young&#x201D; and &#x201C;old&#x201D; or &#x201C;healthy&#x201D; and &#x201C;unhealthy&#x201D; are pretty  vague terms, but we can pick some arbitrary limits, e.g. you are &#x201C;young  and healthy&#x201D; if you are bellow 25, exercise daily, have no diagnosis of  metabolic diseases, CVD, CVD risk factor or respiratory disease&#x2026; start  from there, and broaden or tighten the definition based on the data we  gather.</p><p>I think some people might read some form of &#x201C;moral hazard&#x201D;, after all  out of those people a few might still get severe symptoms or even die  from the disease&#x2026; but it&#x2019;s not like the current approach has stopped  deaths and it&#x2019;s not like there&#x2019;s an end in sight. We can&#x2019;t just  quarantine people forever and we can&#x2019;t hope that the kind of quarantine  measures we enact are going to completely empty all human and  (potential) animal reservoirs.</p><p>At most, what we are doing right now is stalling for time in order to get a cure&#x2026; but what is a cure ?</p><p>Antivirals seldom have the efficacy we&#x2019;d be looking for.</p><p>A vaccine seems to be 12 months away under the most optimistic estimates and is far from a guarantee.</p><p>The two things that everyone agrees would help are:</p><ul><li>Plasma from people with immunity</li><li>More data about the virus (sars-cov-2) and the disease (cov-19)</li></ul><p>Those are the very things the policies in the US and in most European countries are not going to help us with.</p><h1>DISCLAIMER !</h1><p>This is NOT an article claiming that we should stop caring about the  covid-19 pandemic, nor is it claiming that the number presented in the  title is actually correct, rather, it&#x2019;s a punny attempt to show the kind  of data-driven uncertainty that leads to us not fully understanding the  behavior of the disease in terms of spread and frequency of symptoms.</p><p>If you wish to crucify me for claiming &#x201C;Maybe the current measure we  are taking are not ideal based on what we know so far&#x201D;, please do me the  favor of actually reading the whole thing first.</p><p>NOR is this an article claiming that our current measures are  &#x201C;killing the economy at the cost of saving lives&#x201D;&#x2026; I find that position  almost absurd and lacking in understanding about this whole &#x201C;social  contract thing&#x201D; we have going that means we value life over material  goods.</p><p>The very uncertain hypothesis I am presenting here is that we are  engaging in a &#x201C;panic response&#x201D; which might be unjustified given current  data and could lead to both a higher number of people dying from  coivd-19, higher numbers of people dying overall and worse economic  damage than the proper response.</p><p>Lastly, and very importantly, I am not an MD nor an epidemiologist  and taking a though piece as a guide for deciding to isolate yourself or  to break quarantine is pretty stupid.

    "htmlBody": "<p>I&apos;m trying to get my current mental model of the Covid crisis in writing, to see both where it leads and where it is incorrect.  This is an economic model.  Section 1 is defining the problem and vocabulary, section 2 is a description of my mental model, and section 3 is comparing my model to reality.  </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>A couple assumptions I&apos;m making: I assume that we cannot over-isolate (i.e. we should social distance as much as possible, and not worry about overshooting); I assume that this crisis will last about 2 months in its current form, by which time (as in China right now) the situation will look different enough that there&apos;s no way to predict and no use in forecasting now; lastly, despite being generally fairly libertarian, I see a strong centralized government like owning Volcano Insurance in Iowa, it&apos;s generally a waste of money but when Yellowstone erupts it&apos;s a good time to soak them for every last dollar.  </p><p>Let&apos;s separate the American workforce into three groups.  The first group is remote-workers.  These people are generally able to maintain their economic output while maintaining heavy social isolation.  Not only can they work remotely, their customers can utilize their product remotely.  I imagine most in the LW community are in this category.  While output may be reduced by having to work from home, work continues to get done, and we can in principle ride this thing out for a few months without too much intervention or life-destroying change.  Note that e.g. retirees and the long-term unemployed count as remote-workers, vacuously.  </p><p>The second group is essential-workers.  These people can&apos;t stop working.  They are farmers, grocery-store cashiers, Amazon deliverymen.  I would hate to be one of them right now, because their needs will inevitably be the last consideration.  </p><p>The last group is non-essential non-remote workers, or Eloi (from H.G. Wells, I know Eloi are supposed to be upper class but the point is they are worthless and vulnerable and remnants of an obsolete economic model).  The Eloi will destroy our economy.  They are the 30% unemployment rate I&apos;ve heard predicted.  They can&apos;t have any economic output for the next two months.  </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>How should we deal with these different workers?  The optimal thing is for all the Eloi to go into hibernation for a while, neither working nor buying anything.  Everyone sits in the room they are currently in for two months, wait for this whole thing to blow over.  It&apos;s honestly kind of perfect, since they cannot labor but also can&apos;t buy much with their wages anyways, they can&apos;t go out to eat or catch a movie, they can&apos;t go on trips, they can&apos;t go shopping, so why not hibernate?  The problem of course is that humans need at least food and shelter.  Okay, so we shut down the whole economy for a while, where there used to be America there is now a bunch of farms making eggs and bread and milk, truck drivers transporting them to cities, and grocery workers handing them to Eloi.  The Eloi sit in bed and eat all day.  No one is paid, the essential-workers keep feeding the Eloi, and in two months the government snaps its fingers and everything goes back to the way it was.  Oh, the remote-workers keep working this whole time (why not?), for them everything is normal, and if the lack of customers makes them useless, we just keep designating more people as Eloi until there are no more remote-workers or until the crisis dies down/changes fundamentally.  </p><p>This model has problems, obviously.  What are they and how can we fix them?  Well, first of all, why do the essential-workers keep working?  They can just quit their jobs, stay at home, and the government will take care of them.  This is just the well-known welfare trap!  The solution is to give them free rent and groceries as well, and in exchange for working they are given access to some of the cushy remote-worker economy (e.g. they can order luxury goods on Amazon).  </p><p>This model seems roughly reasonable to me.  There are details about how to get the right number of people into the right categories, but we only have to hold it together for a couple months and in the worst case scenario, the government can just hold essential-workers at gunpoint.  I&apos;m not too worried about civil liberties, if the crisis lasts too long the government will be overthrown anyways (and any civil liberty they violate in the final days will definitely get covered by the new constitution, so there&apos;s kind of an upside).  </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Okay, so that&apos;s not actually all that reasonable.  The government isn&apos;t just gonna declare all groceries free.  That much radical change would have incalculable downstream costs.  How can we jerry rig our existing capitalist system to approximate this emergency-economy I&apos;ve described? Well, it looks roughly like what we&apos;re seeing out of Washington right now, so that&apos;s good.  </p><p>Imagine an Eloi that used to work at a bar that is now closed.  He needs to pay the Krogers and his landlord.  </p><p>1) Either the government demands that Krogers and the landlord give him free stuff, </p><p>2) or the government gives him free money, </p><p>3) or the government demands that the bar continue to pay him (but the government pays the bar).  </p><p>These are of course all equivalent, modulo details.  The second option looks like the payment-to-Americans plan that Congress is working on right now (remember, it&apos;s very important that they pay essential-workers as well to avoid the welfare trap, but phase-outs for remote-workers including the unemployed can be thought of with the normal economic frame).  The third option looks (as far as I understand it) like what the fed is doing with interest rates, or like the bailouts people are talking about.  </p><p>On a tangent, I&apos;m honestly not sure why we can&apos;t do option (1) with regard to rent, but for Chesterton&apos;s Fence reasons, I assume that landlords have to burn a certain amount of money per month in offering to the Elder Gods or else we will all die.  </p><p>Now, the bar that our hypothetical Eloi works at presumably has other costs.  The corporation needs to pay rent, it may need to keep up maintenance of some sort, though it won&apos;t be paying distributors.  For this reason we need to funnel some money into small businesses, even if government checks take over their payroll.  </p><p>A lot of the criticism of the government&apos;s response coming from certain circles seems to be predicated on the usual circumstance where the government&apos;s goal is to spur economic development.  The goal is to stop economic development in its tracks  (at least for the Eloi and, in part, the essential-workers) so the current strategy seems mostly spot-on to me.  The true goal is to maintain stasis in such a way that startup costs are minimized when the economy does get going again.  </p><p>My criticism of the government&apos;s response is that, if I were a small business owner right now, I wouldn&apos;t be sure if I should fire my employees so they can take advantage of unemployment, or keep them on with reduced wages supplemented by government checks (all of their wages are paid by the government, the only difference is an agreement that they will come back to work when it&apos;s over).  I think the most important thing now is for the government to articulate a clear plan so people know what they should be doing as we transition out of the economy and into the, well, whatever this is.  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>One of the earliest angles on the coronavirus pandemic was that this was a  story of the draconian extremes that an authoritarian government can  impose on its people. This angle on the events in Wuhan flourished  especially while the media and most governments were not taking the  pandemic seriously. So we&#x2019;ve had a lot of hand-wringing: what can  western governments do about this, because obviously we can&#x2019;t do <em>that</em>?</p><p>At  the worst extremes we have people throwing up their hands and saying,  &#x201C;well we&#x2019;re screwed, white people will never do what they&#x2019;re told,  unlike those obedient Asians &#x2014;  and it&#x2019;s not like we can <strong>make</strong> them,  right?&#x201D;. That attitude is completely crazy. It&#x2019;s not true, and it&#x2019;s part  of the general atmosphere of extremely mixed messages that have made  the crisis so bad.</p><p>For instance, consider the <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">Imperial College</a> report to the British government,<br>which modelled out the likely effects of different policies. Their model assumes that <strong>only 70%</strong> of people instructed to self-isolate <strong>after a coronavirus diagnosis</strong>  will comply, for a total reduction in contacts of 75%. For stricter  measures that quarantine entire households on one positive diagnosis,  they assume a compliance rate of <strong>only 50%</strong>.  We&#x2019;re shutting down entire economies, and yet we view ourselves as  helpless to enforce quarantine on confirmed or presumed positive cases?</p><p>People  who are tested or presumed positive will obey quarantine if they  understand that they might go to prison if they don&#x2019;t. This is in no way  an extreme or authoritarian response. It&#x2019;s completely consistent with  civil liberties. Any individual freedom is always constrained by  reasonable expectations of harm. None of us have a general-purpose  freedom to act however we want regardless of the risks to other people. The  specifics of the coronavirus pandemic are unusual, but the general  principle isn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Take  the most extreme case: someone has tested positive and been instructed  to self-isolate, but the person ignores the instruction and infects  someone else, who later dies of the infection. This is an act of extreme  and callous negligence. The person who left quarantine was informed of a  specific risk, they ignored that information, and they have caused  someone else&#x2019;s death for a frivolous purpose. It is not unreasonable to  imprison that person for many years in order to deter that sort of  negligence.</p><p>That&#x2019;s the <strong>general standard</strong> we have in our societies for actions that are <em>actually </em>negligent,  that really could cause foreseeable harms and risks of death. So what  message does it send to someone if they test positive for coronavirus,  and the state merely <em>asks them nicely</em> to comply with quarantine procedures? What reasonable inferences does that invite?</p><p>People aren&#x2019;t taking self-isolation and quarantine procedures seriously  because our governments aren&#x2019;t actually acting like they&#x2019;re serious.  We&#x2019;re all constantly presented with arguments that aim to persuade us to change our behaviour to reduce some remote risks, or achieve some  remote benefit. We&#x2019;ve all learned to pick over these arguments and weigh them against our own considerations. This also leads to a bit of an  arms race: arguments convincing us to recycle, practice safe sex, use less water, buy local, or whatever else are all competing, so we expect their claims  to be at least a little overstated.</p><p>We&apos;re <em>saying </em>that obeying quarantine orders is an urgent matter of life-and-death but we&apos;re not acting accordingly. Naturally, people notice the subtext. They don&#x2019;t bother  to argue. They&apos;ve played this game before. They&apos;re happy to agree that, sure that&#x2019;s a thing I <em>should</em> do&#x2026;There are  lots of things I <em>should.</em> If we act like obeying quarantine is just another optional supererogatory thing, it&apos;s no surprise that people weigh it up, and take it or leave  it.</p><p>Our society is built on both individual freedom <em>and</em> individual responsibility. If you fail to take due caution in your actions, and you cause easily  foreseeable harm, your actions may result in criminal penalties. The  simple problem is that we&#x2019;re not framing it this way, and that&apos;s hopelessly confusing. We&#x2019;re in the rare situation where it would actually <strong>help </strong>to have some zero-tolerance  rhetoric from governments and prosecutors. We desperately need guidance  from governments that the situation is grave, the risks are real, and  if you are not careful you could find yourself in prison for the rest of  your life, precisely because <em>other people</em> may well be found dead.</p><p>Think of it this way. If you get in your car and drive around drunk, the maximum  number of families you might kill is one. If you&#x2019;re confirmed or even  presumed positive for coronavirus and you just go about your day,  there&#x2019;s no real limit to how many additional deaths your actions could  eventually cause. Why should anyone have any sympathy if you&#x2019;re punished  for such extreme negligence? You weren&#x2019;t even drunk when you did it.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><span>\n\nIt's a bit weird to be writing a retrospective for an event that\ndidn't take place, but there was still a lot of planning and\norganizing, both before and after the decision to cancel.\n\n</span>\n\n</p><p>\n\nThe week after <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/beantown-stomp-retrospective\">Beantown\nStomp 2019</a> finished I started thinking about 2020.  I suggested it\nto the BIDA board, and people were positive.  I checked with the hall,\nwho had the weekends of 2020-03-14 and 2020-03-21 available, and they\npenciled us in.  I checked with other events to make sure we didn't\nhave conflicts, and both weekends looked good.  In early April I\nbooked Dereck Kalish to come back for sound, and started writing to\nbands and callers.  The weekend of 3/21 was better for performers, so\nin late April I confirmed with the hall and sent out a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bida-announcements/cLoAkxHlwFY\">save-the-date</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThen in early June the organizers of <a href=\"https://deffa.org/festival/\">DEFFA</a> let me know that the\nschool where they hold their event needed to move them from 3/28 to\n3/21.  While the two events don't have that much overlap and I wasn't\nworried that we'd have too few dancers to make the weekend worth it, I\nwas concerned about DEFFA's attendance.  Additionally, one of the\nmusicians we had booked had already committed to play at DEFFA.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOur hall happened to still have the 3/14 weekend available, and I\nstarted talking to performers to see if we could switch, but by this\ntime they had enough conflicts that moving wasn't going to work.\nAfter getting advice from a lot of people and talking more to the\nDEFFA organizers I decided to go ahead with the 3/21 weekend.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn March I had started talking to the JP organizers about whether they\nwould be interested in co-sponsoring again for 2020, and initially\nthey were too busy organizing their own late-Spring weekend to\ndecide.  Which was fine; I didn't need a decision from them until it\nwas time to start publicity in the fall.  In late June they decided\nthey did want to co-sponsor.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAt this point we had a date, hall, bands, callers, and sound, so I\ndidn't do much until the fall.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn late September I started trying to put together a committee.  Long\nterm I think Stomp should be run by a committee, but when starting\nthings up a \"one person just does things\" approach had been lower\nfriction.  I talked to several people who had been helpful in 2019 and\nhad expressed interest in maybe organizing, and ended up with five\npeople: me, Persis Thorndike, Sarah Hirsch, John Hawley, and Ruthan\nFreese.  I made us a mailing list to talk on, and put together a\nchecklist of everything I thought needed to happen:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A year out (April)\n    <ul>\n    <li>Find a date and hall\n       <ul>\n       <li>Avoid conflicts, especially with DEFFA</li>\n       <li>Send a save-the-date once you know the date</li>\n       </ul>\n</li>\n    <li>Book bands and callers</li>\n    <li>Book sound</li>\n    <li>Put information on the website as you go</li>\n    <li>Sort out who will be on the committee for next time</li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Six months out (September)\n    <ul>\n    <li>Make budget, decide on pricing</li>\n    <li>Make registration form</li>\n    <li>Make flyer</li>\n    <li>Choose registrar</li>\n    <li>Apply for entertainment license from the city</li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Four months out (November)\n    <ul>\n    <li>Open registration</li>\n    <li>Start publicity\n       <ul>\n       <li>FB event</li>\n       <li>Mailing list post</li>\n       <li>Print and distribute flyers</li>\n       </ul>\n</li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Two months out (January)\n    <ul>\n    <li>Decide schedule</li>\n    <li>Childcare\n       <ul>\n       <li>Decide when the family dance will be</li>\n       <li>Decide what times will have childcare</li>\n       <li>Figure out where childcare will be in the hall</li>\n       <li>Book childcare providers</li>\n       <li>Collect info from parents on what they need</li>\n       </ul>\n</li>\n    <li>Make sure we have all the big volunteer roles covered\n       <ul>\n       <li>Food manager</li>\n       <li>Housing coordinator</li>\n       <li>Transportation coordinator</li>\n       <li>Hall managers</li>\n       <li>Volunteer coordinator</li>\n       </ul>\n</li>\n    <li>See if we can borrow shelving from NEFSA again, or sort out something\n        else</li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n<li>One month out (February)\n    <ul>\n    <li>Line up volunteers</li>\n    <li>Housing coordination</li>\n    <li>Transport coordination</li>\n    <li>Order buttons</li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n<li>A week before (March)\n    <ul>\n    <li>Check the weather and see if any extraordinary actions are needed</li>\n    <li>Figure out how much everyone is going to be paid and sort out cash\n        flow, so you can give people checks at the weekend.

We decided to try a \"<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/hybrid-lottery-admission\">hybrid lottery</a>\" registration\nwhere if we sold more than half the tickets in the first week we'd\npause registration and plan a lottery for the rest.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn mid November we <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bida-announcements/1n0yJVPvc00\">opened\nregistration</a> and we got 122 registrations in the first week.  The\nspeed at which initial registrations came in, combined with that it\ntook us a few days to confirm with everyone, made me realize that <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/hybrid-lottery-update\">the hybrid lottery idea was\nsilly</a>.  For future years I'd like us to announce that we would\nstart processing registrations on a certain date, and any\nregistrations made before then would be given equal priority.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWe handled registrations the same way as <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/beantown-stomp-handling-registrations\">in 2019</a>, except\nthat as registrar Ruthan did most of the work.  I still collected the\nchecks and took electronic payments, but she did all the communicating\nwith people.  We made another email alias which we CC'd on all\nregistration-related communication, to spare the other committee\nmembers from the mess of emails.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn January some band aspects started to firm up.  Jesse Ball was\nbooked for both DEFFA and Stomp, and I was fine with him prioritizing\nhis DEFFA commitment.  We ended up deciding that his band, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CallunaTrio/\">Calluna</a>, would play\nSaturday morning only, and that he'd be done by 1:15pm at the latest.\nThis made some additional room, so I asked Julie Metcalf and Max\nNewman to play some as a duo and anchor the open band.  Another of our\nmusicians had been having health issues and had realized they\nwouldn't be able to play, and we were coordinating around subs.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn early February I started to put together a schedule.  I wrote a\ndraft, and shared it with everyone for feedback.  Amazingly, no one\nasked for changes, so this was pretty painless.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn mid February Sarah started sending out emails to coordinate housing\nand transportation, starting with performers.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAround this time Ruthan started following up with people who had\nregistered but not paid, and we realized we had a small problem.  Most\nchecks were mailed to my house where I marked the person as paid, and\nthen I brought them to the dance where the hall manager included them\nin the deposit but not the night's total.  A few people brought their\nchecks to the dance directly, however, and these accidentally got\ntreated like the checks I brought, which meant that we weren't marking\nthe person down as paid.  While we could have sorted this out from our\nbank statements this would have been enough work that we decided to\ninclude a note on our follow-ups: \"if you have already paid, either by\nVenmo or by bringing your check to a BIDA dance, please let us know so\nwe can update our records accordingly.\"\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/beantown-stom-2020-registrations-final-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/beantown-stom-2020-registrations-final.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/beantown-stom-2020-registrations-final.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/beantown-stom-2020-registrations-final-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nRegistrations continued to come in, and we were just about at capacity\nwhen I started <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/quarantine-preparations\">paying\nattention to the coronavirus</a> and realized this might be a problem\nfor Stomp. I wrote to the hall to start working on a 2021 date,\nbecause if we cancelled we wanted to be able to tell people when the\nnext time would be.  For the regular 3/1 BIDA dance we decided to go\nahead but implement <a href=\"https://blog.bidadance.org/2020/02/handwashing-plans.html\">mandatory\nhandwashing</a>.  I did a bit of multiplication and figured that at\n1,000 uses per gallon a weekend of 250 people would go through about\nfour gallons of hand sanitizer, and ordered eight gallons to be\nsure.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe covid-19 situation escalated very quickly.  On 3/4 I wrote to the\ncommittee that I thought we were going to need to cancel, but that we\ncould probably wait a few days while testing ramped up.  On 3/6\nI proposed that we ask people not to come if they would be coming from\nan area with community spread, like Seattle, SF, and NYC.  I made a <a href=\"https://beantownstomp.com/refund\">refund form</a> and on 3/7 we\nagreed to publish this.  Later that day Lisa wrote to me that she\ndidn't think it was safe to have the dance, and that she was not\nwilling to call.  I also thought about it a lot, and wrote to the\ncommittee advocating that we cancel.  CDSS <a href=\"https://www.cdss.org/covid19\">was not recommending groups\ncancel</a> unless local schools were closed, but I thought this was too\nconservative.  On 3/8 I confirmed the weekend of 2021-03-14 with the\nhall and <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/its-time-to-stop-dancing\">wrote up the argument\nfor canceling</a>.  On Monday 3/9 the committee agreed to cancel.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe hall very nicely let us forward our deposit to 2021, and we had\nminimal other mandatory expenses.  We weren't sure how to handle\nstaff payments, and decided to ask people to waive their refunds\nif they were able to.  The announcement we went with was:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nDue to the coronavirus, Beantown Stomp 2020 is cancelled. We know many\npeople have travel booked for this weekend, and we've all been looking\nforward to it for months. But we also know that reducing\nperson-to-person transmission is crucial for slowing the spread of\nthis disease, and social dancing is the opposite of social distancing.\n<p>\nIf you would like your money back we're happy to return it in full. As\ndances around the country are cancelling however, we're looking\ntowards a rough Spring for people who make their living playing and\ncalling for contra dances. If your financial circumstances allow,\nconsider waiving your refund so we have funds to pay our\nperformers. Please fill out <a href=\"https://beantownstomp.com/refund\">this form</a> to let us know\nhow we should \nhandle your payment. We'll be emailing everyone as soon as we can.\n</p>\n<p>\nBeantown Stomp 2021 will be March 12th-14th.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI wrote to staff to let them know the situation, and of the fifteen\nstaff (two callers, eleven musicians, one sound, one childcare) five\nsaid they would be waiving their payments.  Enough dancers decided to\nwaive all or part of their refunds that on 3/14 we had $4,383.  I\nwrote to the remaining ten staff about sending them $438 each, and\nthat I hoped as the rest of the refunds came through we would be able\nto send them a bit more.  Any unclaimed money we still have on\nApril 20th distribute to the performers.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt's now 3/23, and here's where things stand:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Collected: $15,678</li>\n<li>Refunded: $4,239</li>\n<li>Performers: $5,501</li>\n<li>Wheelchair Lift: $405</li>\n<li>No response yet: $5,533</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nHere's what our final finances would likely have looked like if the\nweekend had gone on as planned.  These are rough: many bits are\nbudgeted amounts, and 15% of people hadn't paid yet.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Income: $18,445</li>\n<li>Expenses $11,023 (+$3711 PS):\n  <ul>\n  <li>Performers: $4,000 (+$3056 PS)</li>\n  <li>Hall: $3,150</li>\n  <li>Snacks and supplies: $2,000</li>\n  <li>Sound: $900 (+$218 PS)</li>\n  <li>Childcare: $600 (+$436 PS)</li>\n  <li>Entertainment license: $150</li>\n  <li>Buttons, with optional magnets: $123</li>\n  <li>Insurance: $100</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThere would have been substantial profit sharing: $7,421 in profit,\nwith 1/4 to BIDA, 1/4 to JP, and the rest split among two callers,\ntwelve musicians, one sound person, and two childcare providers in\nshares of $218/each.  This makes me think that if things otherwise\nlook similar next year we can probably lower the price to something\nlike a $20-$120 sliding scale, with $70/person as the break even\nnumber.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHere's hoping that this is over soon and all clear by 2021!  We're\nbooked for March 12th-14th.\n\n  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Last week I announced the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wFTRgeaq5wceEfb2X/lesswrong-coronavirus-agenda\">LessWrong Coronavirus Agenda</a>, an attempt to increase knowledge by coordinating research between LW participants. This post is an update on that. If you want to skip to action items, check out the last section.</p><h1>Last Week&#x2019;s Spotlight Questions</h1><p>Last week I spotlighted three questions I hoped to answer. Here&apos;s how they went.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F3q7eL7pdQqhWFTYh/what-should-we-do-once-infected\">What should we do once infected?</a></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F3q7eL7pdQqhWFTYh/what-should-we-do-once-infected#FGJGqa9prTzyM6cLd\">Tragedyofthecomments</a> provided a great overall answer and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F3q7eL7pdQqhWFTYh/what-should-we-do-once-infected#FRNnfwDNXmkeyGevz\">Wei Dai</a> a speculative answer (much more likely to be wrong, but very valuable if correct). I did some additional research and incorporated these into an <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F3q7eL7pdQqhWFTYh/what-should-we-do-once-infected-with-covid-19?commentId=oq3EWhqGvQji9C95j\">overall answer</a>, which was improved by additional suggestions from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F3q7eL7pdQqhWFTYh/what-should-we-do-once-infected-with-covid-19?commentId=SYypDMZH3QBJjiLig\">Julia Wise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F3q7eL7pdQqhWFTYh/what-should-we-do-once-infected-with-covid-19?commentId=bkhzp962fyBzKdbqv\">steve2152</a>. This answer should still change as we learn more, but is in a more finished state than the first two questions.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TnboGnXjGQxmZFBky/how-can-we-estimate-how-many-people-are-c19-infected-in-an\">How can we estimate how many people are infected in an area?</a></h2><p>We failed to find a dashboard that made either me or habryka go &#x201C;yes, this is the one, I would be happy with just this.&#x201D;</p><p>Honorable mentions go to two dashboards that are at least trying to estimate true caseload rather than repeating official testing numbers: <a href=\"http://plagueplus.com/\">Plague Plus</a>, which uses reported COVID deaths to estimate prevalence, and to the Kinsa Smart Thermometer Dataset (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TnboGnXjGQxmZFBky/how-can-we-estimate-how-many-people-are-c19-infected-in-an?commentId=DEQRvzQLSKXgQma43\">suggested by Unnamed</a>), which uses smart thermometers&#x2019; phoned home data to estimate the number of &#x201C;excess&#x201D; fevers. </p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3BrnMMz2ExEKvBiGC/where-can-we-donate-time-and-money-to-avert-coronavirus\">Where can we donate time and money to avert coronavirus deaths?</a></h2><p>Neither of us found what we were hoping for here either. We&#x2019;ll continue to add opportunities to the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aXBq5edfzvOz22rot6JvMeKD0tRF9-w4fF500fIrvcs/edit#gid=1310906676\">link DB</a> as appropriate, and welcome additional suggestions. Until then I&#x2019;d suggest being on the lookout for high context opportunities that can&#x2019;t be captured in answers aimed at a broad audience.</p><h1>Other Highlights Of The Week</h1><p>This <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ra3L84yKwz3TU1xdRgDMQU3A0ZCGZmljeyqCI179KtQ/edit\">22 page document</a> on the biology, economics, and logistics of testing for COVID-19, by Jeffrey Ladish, Edward Perello, Sean Ward, and Tessa Alexanian..</p><p><a href=\"https://srconstantin.github.io/2020/03/19/oxygen-supplementation-101.html\">Oxygen Supplementation 101</a> from Sarah Constantin</p><p><a href=\"https://research.fhcrc.org/content/dam/stripe/emerman/files/COVID-19%20Lecture.mp4?fbclid=IwAR0C-3ufhEmvmbqo-Px02gO8Qa7_EHLsdOeryv-RWDElmDBks-IC-CVs8Lw\">This video</a> from virology professor Michael Emerman explain the basic biology of coronavirus and epidemics</p><h1>Changes To The Agenda</h1><p>All three spotlight questions are being retired from the spotlight, although they remain open to new answers and updates.</p><p>&#x201C;What is the basic science of coronavirus?&#x201D; is skipping its moment in the sun due to being provisionally answered by the video linked above. That one requires a fair amount of bio background knowledge, so the floor is still very open for content aimed at people starting from square one. And of course if you find a better advanced introductory video, please include that as well.</p><p>After thinking about it, several members of the LessWrong team (plus me) have gotten more concerned about the economic effects of coronavirus, and I&#x2019;ve added several economic questions to the list. Suggestions from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/romeostevensit\">Romeo Stevens</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wFTRgeaq5wceEfb2X/lesswrong-coronavirus-agenda?commentId=QunN7YQy2CL3tS8Pv\">Eli Tyre</a> have also been incorporated.</p><h1>This Week&#x2019;s Spotlight Questions</h1><h2>What is my prognosis (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pacxL5yyDsA9dFpgH/what-is-the-typical-course-of-covid-19-what-are-the-variants\">short term</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h4GFHbhxE2pfiadhi/will-ncov-survivors-suffer-lasting-disability-at-a-high-rate\">long term</a>) if I am infected with coronavirus? </h2><p>We&#x2019;ve attempted to answer these before, but that was weeks ago, and there&#x2019;s a lot more information accessible now so I&#x2019;d like to give it another shot.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/owk7eBzwjPHNQbNeL/what-will-the-economic-effects-of-a-3-week-quarantine-be-3\">What will the economic effects of a 3 week quarantine be? 3 months?</a></h2><p>This is a deliberately broad question, in part because it&#x2019;s not obvious what the right specific questions are yet, and in part because the right specific questions will vary a lot by locale and we want people to be free to answer for any locale they have information on.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>We, on behalf of<em> Open Longevity</em>, together with the <em>International Longevity Alliance, </em>wrote a letter to WHO about the need for open anonymized medical data on patients with COVID-19 and the risk factors associated with aging. If WHO listens to us, this will accelerate the development of therapies against coronaviruses and against risk factors, and help fight future epidemics. The letter was signed by scientists from the USA, Europe, Israel and Russia, as well as longevity activists. </p><p>We are confident that WHO is now receiving a lot of requests and our letter will be lost in the information noise if we do not make additional efforts to promote it. Therefore, we have prepared a petition to be signed by anyone, who agrees with us <a href=\"http://chng.it/cLwkxSsP\">http://chng.it/cLwkxSsP</a> </p><p>If the arguments presented in the petition seem reasonable to you, please sign it. Repost, send it to your friends directly. This will help fight coronavirus. </p><p>What kind of data are we requesting from WHO? Medical data: medical history, blood tests, x-ray, etc. (for example [1]). And the thing is that WHO does not want to share! Here&#x2019;s what they state [2]: </p><p><em>&#x201C;In accordance with Article 11(4) of the IHR (2005), WHO will not make the Anonymized-COVID-19 Data generally available to other State Parties until such time as any of the conditions set forth in paragraph 2 of such Article 11 are first met and following consultation with affected countries. </em></p><p><em>Pursuant to that same Article 11, WHO will not make Anonymized -COVID-19 data available to the public, unless and until Anonymized -COVID-19 data has already been made available to State Parties, and provided that  other information about the -COVID-19 epidemic has already become publicly available and there is a need for the dissemination of authoritative and independent information.&#x201D; </em></p><h2>For what we need open data? </h2><p>However, open medical data, simply speaking, medical history (of course, anonymized, without names and surnames), is needed to: </p><ul><li>Predict the severity of the disease course. If an anamnesis is provided, blood tests, age, questionnaire responses, etc. will be indicated, this will help with predictions;  </li><li>Develop therapies taking into account risk factors or directly aimed at eliminating risk factors; </li><li>For better machine learning. The predictive power of models is very much dependent on the number of samples on which they train. This is especially true for omics data, where the requirements for the minimum number of samples are much higher due to the large number of parameters in the models.   </li></ul><p>These were reasons for medical data to be useful today. But there are a number of other reasons, which are associated with future research, with preventive measures. But not only in the future: all this may come in handy, since the solution to the problem of high mortality in older ages may lie in the field of aging biology. This way, medical data is also needed for:</p><ul><li>Dealing with aging risk factors during future epidemics; </li><li>Creating open medical datasets with annotation of patients age parameters; </li><li>Existing national health systems cannot cope with the current situation. The cornerstone is the issue of collecting, storing and analyzing the medical data, necessary for successful research. </li></ul><h2>The main problems here are:</h2><p>a) Local storage. Each national system (and sometimes even each medical facility) stores patient data in its own format with its own access rules. Data transfer from hospital to hospital or from country to country is difficult. Testing protocols are also local.</p><p>b) At the discretion of a particular researcher in accordance with the recommendations of regulatory authorities, only part of the data is made available to other scientists.</p><p>The prerequisites for these problems&#x2019; solutions have long been known: cloud storage, anonymization and de-identification technologies, and blockchain for secure and controlled access. Also now is exactly the moment, when the difficulties in standardizing formats can be effectively solved, when many people are ready to get involved in activities that contribute to a quick exit from a critical situation.</p><p>Many countries are currently attracting volunteers to help doctors treat patients with COVID-19. However, a huge number of bioinformatics and IT specialists can be no less useful in this situation. Creation of a prototype of a global patient database and the local involvement of one or two IT specialists in a hospital can help quickly, efficiently and relatively inexpensively (with the help of volunteers) collect data in a standardized format for subsequent analysis by the best scientists and AI algorithms around the world.</p><p>By allowing access to all types of anonymized or unidentifiable data now, using patient data from COVID-19 as an example, WHO can significantly accelerate the development of vaccines and treatment protocols. In addition, the current situation can serve as a tremendous impetus for optimizing the entire system of working with medical data, allowing us to develop an algorithm for the exchange and standardization of data on an international scale.  </p><h2>What other types of data are important for dealing with coronavirus?</h2><ul><li> Genomic data [4], primarily genomes and phylogenetic trees of the virus (examples will be in the list of examples below). Here things are much better with openness by the way. This data is needed to track differences in strains of the virus in different populations / countries, to understand how versatile therapies and tests will be. You can also select the most evolutionarily conservative regions of viral RNA to affect them&#x2014;potentially, these may be the most effective therapies.</li><li> Transcriptome data [5] (primarily sc-RNA-Seq of immune cells). Here&apos;s the thing. Hypermutation and VDJ recombination of genes responsible for the coding of antibodies and T-cell receptors occurs in immune cells. That is, the genomes in immune cells are different. The set of known sequences (clonotypes) of antibodies and T-cell receptors is called a repertoire. Since these are coding regions, the repertoire is most often recognized based on single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells. This data is needed to compare people, recovered from illness, with non-infected ones. You can also compare the repertoires of immune cells of different infected people (with different severity, different courses of the disease). In the end, all this will help to diagnose disease and develop a vaccine. </li><li> And, by the way, there is a clear deficit of this data, the Antibodies Society even called for action [6]: <em>&#x201C;...the AIRR-C hereby calls upon its members, and the wider research community, to share experiences, resources, samples, and data as openly and freely as possible, and to work within their respective systems to break down barriers to achieve this goal, subject to the overarching directives of respect, privacy, and protection for patients and all people. We are in this together.&#x201D;</em></li><li>Information about test kits [7] and diagnostics [8]. Many tests didn&#x2019;t have enough time to be certified, clinics and some countries are afraid to use them; this applies not only to test kits but also to PCR machines and other equipment.</li><li>Data on the spread of the virus [9] and prognosis [10]. The situation is getting better every day, but diagnostics, still not being perfect, make their own adjustments to the epidemiological data.</li><li>General educational information. WHO is doing well in this department [11].</li><li> Data on publications and clinical trials [12].</li><li>Newsfeeds with new articles on the topic [13]. </li></ul><p>Existing initiatives, including Kaggle Challenges [14], do not solve the problem of collecting and forming medical COVID-19 datasets and are focused on other tasks (training NLP systems on the texts about coronavirus, analysis of genomes, predicting the spread of the virus, etc.).</p><p>The idea is to find ways to significantly reduce the mortality rate from COVID-19 by influencing risk factors.

This is <em>wildly</em> at odds with the anti-transmission messaging I've heard. Where I live (USA), I hear endless appeals to wash hands, not shake hands, and not touch your face, etc. I hear barely a whisper about the grave risks of being indoors in a public, poorly-ventilated space. I mean, that CDC page seems to imply that standing in a poorly-ventilated grocery store, even &gt;6 feet from others, may well be riskier than touching a point-of-sale touchscreen and then immediately touching your face. (Remember, the virus <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay\">stays in the air 30 minutes</a>. [ETA: oops, I just learned that that article was later <a href=\"https://www.inkstonenews.com/health/medical-journal-retracts-study-how-far-coronavirus-can-spread-through-droplets/article/3074449\">retracted without explanation</a>.] Or as another example, the implication seems to be that just <em>breathing</em> inside an empty elevator (which was previously occupied within the previous 30 minutes) is quite possibly an even higher-risk activity than <em>licking the elevator buttons</em>. Really? Really???</p>\n<p>(And don't get me started on masks ... Masks &amp; googles are not only not suggested in the USA, they're actively stigmatized, despite <a href=\"https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-materials-make-diy-face-mask-virus/\">makeshift homemade masks</a> being I think at least somewhat effective and not contributing to the ongoing supply shortage, and goggles not being in short supply at all....)</p>\n<p>I'm posing this as a question because I don't have enough confidence, without doing more research, to declare that our public health messaging has been so wildly misdirected (at least, the messaging I've received). Does anyone have better evidence? Or what's your take?</p>\n<p>(Update: After reading <a href=\"http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/commentary-covid-19-transmission-messages-should-hinge-science\">this article</a> and <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/\">this article</a>, I'm somewhat less concerned about air that was exhaled more than a few seconds ago, and now thinking that the main things to think about are (1) being near someone coughing, (2) being near someone talking, (3) touching surfaces then touching your face, (4) aerosols from a bathroom (apparently a SARS patient with diarrhea was a super-spreader, infecting people up to 200 meters away!). I'm very uncertain about the relative importance of these four things. I'm also not sure what \"near\" means, see discussion <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8PfQt2ikGnLye2mfg/what-is-the-safe-in-person-distance-for-covid-19\">here</a>.)</p>\n</body></html>",

Eventually a report will come out summarizing some of what was talked about, but for now I want to focus on what I talked about in my session on deconfusing human values. For that session I wrote up some notes summarizing what I've been working on and thinking about. None of it is new, but it is newly condensed in one place and in convenient list form, and it provides a decent summary of the current state of my research agenda for building beneficial superintelligent AI; a version 1 of my agenda, if you will. Thus, I hope this will be helpful in making it a bit clearer what it is I'm working on, why I'm working on it, and what direction my thinking is moving in.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>This essay about dog ownership helped me empathise with dogs, and also caused me to update against getting a dog; if these ideas are accurate, it'd either be much more selfish and cruel than I previously thought, or else would require a lot more focused effort in order to give the dog a meaningful life.</p><p>Most of the essay is doing valuable and interesting work staring into the abyss and trying to help you see whether there is a dystopian horror occurring around us. But I'll mostly take away from it a clearer sense of what it looks like for a non-human animal to have purpose and meaning; it feels like a conceptual update that I won't easily be able to forget or ignore. (It has helped me think more clearly about animals and their values much more than most of the philosophical discussion I've seen on the topic, and I found it more useful than much extended discussion about consciousness and pleasure/pain.)</p><p>Here's three quotes to help you understand the post and entice you into reading the whole thing.</p><blockquote><p>After about three days, the dog started following me everywhere. If I sat on the couch to watch tv, the dog would curl-up under my outstretched legs resting on the coffee table. If I sat at the dinner table, it would sit beside me, and watch me throughout the entire meal. If I went to the bathroom, it would follow me to the door and wait outside. At night, the dog curled up in my bed and slept beside me. The dog started walking more, and she would almost always perfectly follow my lead; she walked at just the right pace so she stayed beside me, neither lagging behind my fast stride, nor pulling ahead. On the rare occasions she got distracted by a smell or other dog, I gently tugged on her leash and called her name, and she scurried over to me.</p><p>I found it kind of creepy.</p><p>Yes, I know, <i>it’s a dog</i>. But still… I felt like I had been granted a level of <i>submissiveness</i> from a sovereign being which I hadn’t earned. All I had done was feed and walk the dog – and I apparently did this so badly that the dog was massively depressed – and yet she worshipped me.</p></blockquote><p>The following section is something the author is themself quoting from a reddit thread:</p><blockquote><p><i>The most accurate thing I can say about dogs is I feel sorry for them. My immediate family didn’t own dogs growing up, but my extended family had farms or large acreage plots with 3-5 dogs running around all day. They eat, sleep, shit, and run around exploring with their pack hours a day whenever they want.</i></p><p><i>Compare to city dogs. Mostly live in matchbox apartments. A typical weekday is likely 9-12 hours home alone. You can’t run. You can’t shit. You are bored out of your fucking mind. Your human comes home and walks you for 15 minutes on a leash. It’s the highlight of your day. Human is tired and eats dinner in front of the TV while you get scratches. Maybe you sleep in the same bed as your human. You’re probably pretty tired after an entire day of mostly not moving.</i></p><p><i>Weekends if you’re lucky, you go to a dog-friendly park. Maybe you get off leash. Maybe you never get off leash because you’re too spazzy around other dogs/humans. It’s completely understandable to be spazzy. You are chronically understimulated. One of your only opportunities to get energy and action in life is by “misbehaving” or harassing strangers.</i></p><p><i>When I walk past someone with a dog and the dog is just pulling as hard as s/he can at the leash to pounce on me, you can’t think that’s instinct. No animal in the wild thinks it’s a good idea to go fuck with something 3-30x it’s bodyweight. It’s pure boredom. The dog is just trying to stimulate itself before it’s forced back in front of the TV to watch The Office again.</i></p><p><i>There’s a laundry list of other topics like neutering, diet, training, etc that I won’t elaborate on. There’s enough grey area for people to get away with justifying whatever happens to be easiest for them, obviously, but I hope it’s also obvious that there are many many ways in which the life of a dog is diminished compared to…. other normal living organisms…</i></p></blockquote><p>And from the sections on needs, pleasures, and meaning.</p><blockquote><p>With the exceptions of abusive or negligent owners, owned dogs get their needs met. In fact, dogs get their needs met better than pretty much any non-pet animals in the world. Unlike wild animals, dogs aren’t faced with the daily life-and-death struggle for survival. They don’t need to hunt or scrounge for food, they don’t need to worry about a tainted water source, they don’t need to evade predators, etc. And unlike farm animals, their deaths almost certainly won’t come at the hands of their owners, especially not in the first 25% of their max lifespans.</p><p>...</p><p>I’d say most dog owners have a mixed record of fulfilling their dog’s pleasure (ignore the innuendo). On the positive side, owned dogs will usually get lots of treats, toys, and petting... Diligent owners will devote significant time to taking their dog out of the house to run around, fetch, and hopefully interact with other dogs, but plenty of owners won’t and will leave their dogs perpetually under-stimulated at home... Where dog owners fall the shortest in providing for their dog’s pleasure is in – again, ignore the innuendo – sex. By the 2010s, <a href=\"https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/new-strides-in-spaying-and-neutering/\">83% of American dogs were neutered</a>, and presumably most other owners do everything they can to discourage their non-neutered dogs from having sex (which is arguably a worse fate for the dog). I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that depriving an animal of an act for which it is biologically programmed to derive the most extreme of pleasures is likely detrimental to the animal’s wellbeing. Ask yourself: for what other gains would you be willing to give up sex for the rest of your life?</p><p>Third, <strong>meaning</strong> is activity and goals which provide long-term value to the being. Admittedly, it’s hard enough to identify meaning in humans, so it’s even harder to do so in dogs, but I’m going to take a shot anyway.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://dormin.org/2020/03/21/against-dog-ownership/\"><strong>Read the essay here.</strong></a></p></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<h2>Kinsa Smart Thermometer Dataset</h2><p>Kinsa is a company that makes smart thermometers. A few years ago, they found that they could use the data that they got from their smart thermometers (most importantly the temperature reading and location of the user) to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy073\">track flu trends</a> across the United States. (FitBit has <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30222-5/fulltext\">done something similar</a>.)</p><p>Kinsa&apos;s data science team has now turned their attention to Covid-19 trends and started a <a href=\"https://www.healthweather.us/\">tracking website</a> using their thermometer data, using methods which they explain in more detail on their <a href=\"https://content.kinsahealth.com/covid-detection-technical-approach\">technical approach</a> page. It looks like the most impressive thing that they&apos;ve been able to do with this dataset so far is to identify new hotspots before other people do, like the increase in cases in southern Florida. But potentially there are a lot of other things that can be done with these sorts of data.</p><h2>Estimating the Number of Coronavirus Infections in the US</h2><p>One of those other things which might be doable with these sorts of data: coming up with more accurate estimates of the number of people with coronavirus. Testing in the US (and many other places) is spotty and delayed a great deal, estimating the number of infections based on the number of deaths involves a very long delay and a bunch of assumptions, etc. But if you can count the number of people in America with a fever (or extrapolate from a sample), and subtract off the baseline estimate of how many fevers you&apos;d expect from influenza or other causes, then you can get an estimate of the number of people in the US with a fever due to coronavirus. And that gets you close to an estimate of the total number of coronavirus cases.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://healthweather.us/\">coronavirus tracking website</a> that Kinsa set up is already doing much of this - their graph (also shown below) shows something like the number of people with a fever and the baseline expected number of fevers.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1584943716/excess_fever_2020-03-21_rf3gb8.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>So I decided to give it a try and use their graph to estimate the total number of coronavirus cases in the US.</p><p>My calculation is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HZ90eCFih_NN7vLZHBOE4G16kIKADsnpOFw-V7xbAxk/edit#gid=0\">here</a>, a longer (more &quot;thinking aloud&quot; style) writeup of my method is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14W5cmXvhU8XRvisQOpvMjw-mSyrPrR-mkEKRY8dS3cQ/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>, and a more concise summary of what I did is below. </p><p>It&apos;s a fairly rough first-pass analysis, which may contain errors, and could definitely be improved with some more work. The number I got at the end is that about 1% of Americans have gotten coronavirus, through March 20.</p><h2>My Estimation Method, in Brief</h2><p>The graph above shows something like &quot;number of new fevers&quot; (on an unclear scale labeled &quot;% ill&quot;) and Kinsa&apos;s estimate of the expected number of fevers if there was no coronavirus. So the gap between the two lines represents something like the number of new fevers each day due to coronavirus. That trend has an odd shape for a pandemic: it increases and then levels off. I suspect that this is because, once people start taking precautions to avoid coronavirus, the number of flu cases drops dramatically, so their estimated baseline gets farther and farther from reality (of # of flu cases) and coronavirus accounts for a larger and larger number of the new fevers. You can view the regional trends by clicking on particular counties; regions like the SF Bay Area and Seattle have a similar shape on earlier days. The SF Bay Area is actually now anomalously below baseline in number of new fevers on March 21.</p><p>I decided to deal with this by focusing on the trend up until March 14, and extrapolating from there. (It would be even better to do this separately for each county and then aggregate them.)</p><p>Next step: making sense of the y-axis. A little bit of digging showed that it&apos;s from their flu work, where they used their data to fit a particular measure of flu prevalence that the CDC uses, which is ILINet data (explained partly down the page <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm\">here</a>). A little bit more digging on the relationship between this number and the number of flu cases reported by the CDC (as seen headlines like <a href=\"https://www.contagionlive.com/news/us-flu-cases-reach-29-million-have-we-hit-peak-season\">this</a>) suggests that 1 point on the scale corresponds to roughly 75,000 new flu cases that day (which probably means about 75,000 new fevers). More detailed explanation of where that number comes from in my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14W5cmXvhU8XRvisQOpvMjw-mSyrPrR-mkEKRY8dS3cQ/edit\">longer writeup</a>.</p><p>So the gap of 0.79 scale points between observed and expected on March 14 corresponds to about 60,000 excess new fevers that day. Which we&apos;re guessing are entirely due to coronavirus. Using either their data for previous days, or assumptions about the growth rate in cases, we can turn that into an estimate in the cumulative total number of feverish cases as of that day. I tried both and got numbers of 470,000 and 370,000, so let&apos;s call it about 420,000 total cumulative cases through March 14.</p><p>But this is only counting the coronavirus cases that do get a fever, and (more importantly) it is only counting them <em>when</em> they get the fever. My guess is that a bit more than a doubling time passes between infection and fever, and also adjusting for the cases that never get a fever, the total number of coronavirus infections on March 14 was about 3x the number of feverish cases, or about 1.3 million.</p><p>Extrapolating forward assuming a 4-day doubling time gives an estimate of 3.6 million cases in the US through March 20, or 1.1% of the population.</p><p>So that&apos;s the basic method and estimate. The <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14W5cmXvhU8XRvisQOpvMjw-mSyrPrR-mkEKRY8dS3cQ/edit\">longer writeup</a> goes into more detail about each step, and includes various things things I&apos;m still confused or uncertain about and ways in which this analysis might be wrong. For instance, maybe concerns about coronavirus are causing people to take their temperature more often, which is sufficient to cause an increased number of measured fevers, and a large part of the upwards trend line is due to that rather than to actual coronavirus cases.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in improving this estimate, or having other people go off and do their own estimate. And I&apos;m especially interested in people finding more good things to do with this sort of dataset.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><u><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/petrihollmen/posts/10156628875511933\">Petri Hollm&#xE9;n</a></u> traveled to Tyrol on the 5th of March. He had a bottle of hand sanitizer with him, used it a lot and washed his hands like never before.  </p><p>Sunday, the 8th he returned home to hear a day afterwards that Tyrol was declared a COVID-19 epidemic area. He decided to work from home given the higher risk of having been in an epidemic area. On Thursday the 12th he woke up feeling normal but his Oura ring measured that his <u><a href=\"https://ouraring.com/readiness-score\">readiness</a></u> was down to 54 from being normally at 80-90 which was mostly due to having a  1&#xB0;C elevated temperature at his finger at night.</p><p>Even though he felt normal, he went to the doctor and given that he was from an epidemic area, they decided to test him. He tested positive and went to self-quarantine for 14 days. He measured his temperature several times during the following day and it always came back with 36.5&#xB0;C. The Oura ring provided evidence that led to his diagnosis that wouldn&apos;t have been available otherwise.</p><p>While he didn&#x2019;t have true fever as defined by the official gold standard he did have a kind of clinical relevant fever. It&#x2019;s my impression that our medical community is too focused on their gold standards that are based on old and outdated technology like mercurial thermometers. </p><p>Even when new measurements like nightly finger temperature don&#x2019;t match with the gold standard there are still cases where the information allows for better clinical decision making. </p><p>Today, we have cheap sensors and machine learning that provide us with a different context of making medical decisions then going to the doctors office.</p><p>Testing by doctors is very important in the fight against COVID-19 but people need to know when it&#x2019;s time to go to the doctor. Hollm&#xE9;n needed his Oura to know that it was time to get tested professionally. </p><p>We need to get good at catching cases of COVID-19 as fast as possible when they happen in the wild if we want to avoid that millions die without us choking our economy by long-term quarantines.</p><p>Analysis of <u><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30222-5/fulltext\">Fitbit users</a></u> found that their resting heart rate and total amount of sleep can be used to predict the official state numbers for influenza-like illness. </p><p>It&#x2019;s very likely that lower heart rate variance and a higher minimum of the nightly heartrate  happens in at least some of the COVID-19 cases. Unfortunately, the WHO is <u><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR3VFb-eGPxrLxCTfn0TGNK6TiWZUynwFJnFgu8-nFV0khluA9XQgFHVCB8#covid-19-what-are-the-symptoms-how-does-the-disease-progress\">stuck</a></u> in the last century and the official symptoms charts tell us nothing about how common either of those metrics are in COVID-19 patients. Lack of access to those metrics in the official statistics means it&#x2019;s harder for people who have an Oura Ring, an Apple watch or another device that can measure nightly heartrate to make good decisions about when to go to the doctor or self-quarantine. </p><p>Given that Apple sold around 50 million Apple watches between 2018 and 2019, a sizable portion of people could make better decisions if we would have more information about how COVID-19 affects heart rate. </p><p>Even more people have access to a smart phone with a decent camera. Having a sore throat is a typical symptom for many virus infections like COVID-19 and a good machine learning algorithm could produce valuable data from those images. </p><p>A priori it&#x2019;s unclear about how much we can learn from such pictures. If a throat of a patient is red due to inflammation a doctor who looks at it, can&#x2019;t distinguish whether it&#x2019;s due to snoring or a virus infection. </p><p>If a machine learning algorithm could have access to a steady stream of daily imagine of a person&#x2019;s throat the algorithm could understand a person&#x2019;s baseline and use that insight to factor out the effects of snoring. </p><p>When the gold standard of diagnosing the throat is to look at one image at a particular point in time at the doctor&#x2019;s office there&#x2019;s potentially a big improvement to be gained by looking at a series over multiple days. We don&#x2019;t know how useful such a diagnostic tool is before building it.</p><p>Ideally, users of a new app would take an image of their throat every morning after getting up and every evening before going to sleep. They would also measure their temperature with a normal thermometer at both points and enter information about subjective symptoms. If a person gets a proper COVID-19 test, they should also be able to enter the data.</p><p>At first we would train the machine learning algorithm to use the images to predict temperature. With enough users our algorithm can learn how the throat of a person having flu differs from their baseline whether or not they are snoring. </p><p>As we have more users and some of our users get COVID-19 lab tests our machine learning algorithm can learn to predict the test results directly. It&#x2019;s the nature of advanced technology that we don&#x2019;t know how powerful a tool is before it&#x2019;s developed. Most clinical trials for new drugs find that they don&#x2019;t live up to their promise. </p><p>We need <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/94QQkc5he9Qzq2tWC/more-dakka-for-coronavirus-we-need-immediate-human-trials-of\">more dakka for COVID-19</a></u>. Creating an app that does the above function doesn&#x2019;t cost much and the cost of the project should be worth the potential benefits of catching COVID-19 cases faster and thus preventing people from unknowingly infecting their friends. </p>",

The main reason for this is that AGI was presented as a powerful superintelligent optimizer, and germs were just simple mindless replicators. However, germs are capable to evolve and they are very extensively searching the space of possible optimisations via quick replication of viruses and quick replication rate. In other words, they perform an enormous amount of computations, far above what our computers can do. </p><p>This optimisation power creates several dangerous effects: antibiotic resistance (for bacteria) and obsolescence of vaccines (for flu) as well as a zoonosis: the transfer of viruses from animals to humans. Sometimes it could be also beneficial, as in the case of evolving in the direction of less CFR. </p><p>In other words, we should think about coronavirus not as of an instance of a virus on a doorknob, but as a large optimisation process evolving in time and space. </p><p>Thus, the main median-term (3-6 months) question is how it will evolve and how we could make it evolve in better ways. In other words, what will be the next wave? </p><p>There was a claim that second wave of Spanish flu was more dangerous, because of the large hospitals: the virus was &#x201C;interested&#x201D; to replicate in hospitals, so it produced more serious illness; Infected people had to go to hospitals, which were overcrowded after the war, and they infected other people there, including the medical personal which moved it to the next hospital. </p><p>Another point is that the size of the virus optimisation power depends on the number of infected and of the number of virus generations, as well as on the selective pressure. The idea of &#x201C;flattening the curve&#x201D; is the worst, as it assumes a large number of infections AND a large number of virus generation AND high selective pressure. Cruel but short-term global quarantine may be better. </p>",

The system relies on widespread willingness to falsify records, and would (temporarily) grind to a halt if people were to simply refuse to lie. But I expect that if I were to straightforwardly summarize this - that the American hospital system is built on lies - I mostly expect this to be evaluated as an attack, rather than a description.

This was partly justified by the book &#x201C;the info diet&#x201D; but mostly based on a philosophy that proposes,</p><blockquote><em> in a lifetime with limited hours, there is a choice to either consume or create.  And I&#x2019;d rather create than consume.</em></blockquote><p>To be honest, the idea for me was born in response to a meme complaining that if you think art should be free, try going without art for a month.  This sounded like a fun and interesting idea.</p><p>My main sources of content were:</p><ul><li>Facebook feed</li><li>Books (paper and TTS audiobook)</li><li>Some music</li><li>Youtube videos</li></ul><p>I decided to not get fussy about content that I was actively reciprocal in creating.  For example a dance form and a conversation are two different types of content that I am engaged in.  The difference would be between playing sport and watching sport (I&#x2019;m allowed to play sport but not watch sport).  I wanted to make an exception for live music but I would not usually see live music anyway.</p><p><strong>So how did I go?</strong></p><p>On the 1st of January I rearranged my phone screen to make my content less accessible than my creation pathways.  I don&#x2019;t think I recorded anything, but in the first week I wrote 5000 words with all that time I had.  In the silence I noticed my mind go quieter.  In the time that I spent not reading, I did thinking.  I drove places in silence.  I started having phone calls with my friends.  I just let myself go with whatever I wanted to go towards.</p><p>Without music coming in I started to get earworms appearing in my mind.  Without content ideas coming from books I had to start generating my own, or applying my existing methods.  Even making my own.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t realise how badly an entrenched habit of reading (134 books in 2019) could limit my growth.  I was doing a good thing adding more information to the parts of me that needed more information and also, now that I&#x2019;ve slowed down, I&#x2019;m more balanced.</p><p>I probably only needed to do book free for a day to get the benefit but I committed and I wasn&#x2019;t sure if there was a deepening after more time.  There wasn&#x2019;t but one of the major benefits I retained was that I freely chose to think or read a book or call a friend.  This was previously a more compulsive choice to urgently read books.</p><p>I spend a lot more time having phone calls and exploring relationally now.  For the handful of people that I am talking with, we are growing therapeutically together and healing each other as we reflect on our stuff together.</p><p><strong>Moving forward</strong></p><p>I read less, I talk more, I write more.

These masks are normally\nsingle-use, and you put on a new mask every time one is needed.\nRoughly, a hospital could increase its daily usage of masks 100x as\nthey get their first few covid-19 patients, and then even more as the\nfull force of the epidemic hits.  This is a ton of stress on the\nsupply chain, and not surprisingly suppliers haven't been able to ramp\nup.  Running your factory around the clock and bringing on extra\nworkers can help some, but when even doubling output would be\nimpressive this is nowhere near enough.\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\nThere are many types of mask, but the two main ones in health care are\nsurgical masks and N95 respirator masks:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>A surgical mask is primarily\nintended to protect others from the wearer by catching droplets, but\nprovides limited protection to the wearer.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>A vented N95 mask\nprotects the wearer against not just droplets but also airborne\ntransmission.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>An unvented N95 mask protects both the wearer and others.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen I say \"mask\" below, I'm talking about N95 masks.  We can get\nsomething to replace surgical masks, even if it's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StillwaterMedicalCenter/posts/3415488035131279\">people\nsewing reusable cloth ones</a>, but N95 production is bottlenecked on\nmachines that can make <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/16/814929294/covid-19-has-caused-a-shortage-of-face-masks-but-theyre-surprisingly-hard-to-make\">good\nenough melt-blown fabric</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nLuckily, health care is not the only field where people need\nrespiratory protection.  Industrial N95 masks are very widely used in\nconstruction, demolition, and other situations where there's\nmoderately hazardous dust.  These masks aren't rated as surgical N95\nmasks, and they're more likely to be vented, but their requirements\nare very similar and the government is now allowing them to be used.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAs hospitals are unable to get resupplied with their regular masks,\nthey're asking for donations from <a href=\"https://www.challiance.org/about/newsroom/personal_protective_equipment_ppe_donations_1179\">the\ncommunity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/coronavirus/pence-to-construction-companies-send-hospitals-your-n95-face-masks/2329888/\">industry</a>.\nThis makes a lot of sense: people and organizations that use masks\ngenerally keep extras, and medical use is now much more urgent.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn the other hand, donations of masks will not get us through this\nepidemic on their own: hospitals also need to make massive adjustments\nin how quickly they go through masks, and this is a hard adjustment.\nReusing masks is moderately dangerous, but it's much less dangerous\nthan the very likely prospect of later not having them at all.  It\nlooks like hospitals used masks at nearly their regular rate\nthroughout February and in early March, even though the shortage goes\nback to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/coronavirus-masks-hoarding.html\">late\nJanuary</a>.  Reports of mask rationing are haphazard, and in the last\ncouple days I've seen posts from health care workers saying they're\nusing N95 masks:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At their regular rate, but they're\nworried about running out.</li>\n<li>For aerosol-generating procedures\non suspected patients only.</li>\n<li>One per day, only as needed.</li>\n<li>One indefinitely.</li>\n<li>Not at all, because there are no more.</li>\n</ul>\n\nHospitals are not the kind of places that change policy quickly, and\nit seems they're mostly adjusting in response to their resupply orders\nnot being filled.  The CDC should be telling hospitals across the\ncountry that we're very short on masks and that we should be going\nthrough them as slowly as possible, but instead it's offering \n\n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html\">much\nweaker guidance</a> that would be more appropriate to local shortages.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nSince most of this change in behavior is happening in response to\nmasks being unavailable or in very short supply, mask production is\nhard to ramp up, and we don't expect this to peak for at least a\nmonth, if you donate masks today I expect them to be used much more\nquickly than if you wait and donate them when things are worse.  You\ndon't want to wait too long, because at some point the shortage really\nwill be over and the need will decrease, but I expect the need for\nmasks to be much higher in two weeks than it is today.\n\n  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Excerpt:</p><ul><li>In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. </li><li>In South Korea, ... 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases </li><li>There is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self-isolate for seven days, in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine, we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors, not realising the need to self-isolate. </li></ul><p>Simple clinical test for anosmia (from <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/624172\">Davidson &amp; Murphy, 1997</a>):</p><blockquote>Standard 70% isopropyl alcohol preparation pad is opened such that 0.5 cm of the pad itself is visible. The alcohol pad is placed beneath the patient&apos;s nostrils while the patient inspires twice, to familiarize himself or herself with the alcohol odor, and the subject is asked if he or she detects an odor. Odor thresholds for alcohols are 2 or more orders of magnitude lower than trigeminal thresholds for the same stimuli.6 Thus, an anosmic will detect the presence of alcohol trigeminally only when it is extremely close to the nose. The alcohol pad is withdrawn and the threshold test begun. The subject is asked to close the mouth and eyes, breathe normally, and indicate when the odor is detected. Active sniffing and deep inspiration are discouraged. The basic procedure follows the method of limits. A standard metric tape measure is extended downward from the patient&apos;s nares and held in place (Figure I ). </blockquote><blockquote>The alcohol pad is placed 30 cm below the nose and, with each expiration, is moved 1 cm closer to the nares until the subject detects the presence of odor. The distance from the anterior nares to the alcohol pad is measured in centimeters at the point at which the subject first detects the odor. The procedure is repeated 4 times and the mean distance defines the threshold. </blockquote><blockquote>Threshold For purposes of comparison, all of the subjects completed a standard olfactory threshold test. A series of 10 concentrations of butanol ( -butyl alcohol) was used to determine absolute olfactory threshold sensitivity. The highest butanol concentration consisted of 4% vol/vol in distilled water. Each successive dilution was one third of the preceding dilution. Two &quot;blanks,&quot; containing only distilled water, were also prepared. All bottles, including blanks, contained 60 mL of liquid. Olfactory threshold was assessed with a modified version 7 of a 2-alternative, forced-choice,ascending method of limits procedure. </blockquote><blockquote>The subject was presented with 2 bottles, one containing the odorant and the other consisting of distilled water. Each nostril was tested separately. The spout of the bottle was inserted into the nostril of interest. The subject was asked to squeeze the bottle to generate a puff of air. The subject did this with both bottles. Subjects were asked to identify which of the 2 bottles contained the stronger odor.All subjects began at the lowest concentration to avoid adaptation.9 Incorrect choices led to presentation of a higher concentration and correct choices led to continued presentation of the same concentration to a criterion of 5 successive correct responses. The presentation of the odorant and blank were randomized for each comparison trial and the nostril to be tested first was also randomly determined. </blockquote><blockquote>There were approximately 45 seconds between trials to allow time for recovery of the olfactory system and for the odor molecules to collect in the head space of the bottle.</blockquote>",

Maybe we should hurry to finish that up so that we can use it to help manage this avalanche of COVID-19 posts?\"</p><p>For the past week we've been rolling out features to help with this. Right now, since Tagging is still in beta, we're testing it out <i>just</i> with a Coronavirus tag.</p><h2>1. You can now filter out Coronavirus-tagged posts from the Home Page.</h2><p>If you click the gear icon to the right of the \"Latest Posts\" section, you'll open up a settings tab where you can test the new tag filtering system. You can currently filter on Personal Blogposts, and Coronavirus-tagged posts. You can choose to hide them, or to <i>only</i> show posts with a matching tag. (Later on, once we've implemented a wider-ranging tag system, you'll be able to filter arbitrary combinations of tags).</p><p>Right now the filter system only applies to the Latest Posts section, but soon we'll most likely extend this to the Recent Discussion section and the<i> \"/allPosts\" </i>page.</p><h2>2. Home Page Coronavirus Section</h2><p>We've also recently added a section at the top of the home page which displays the top 3 posts on the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR1NK2aoba2yHwLTEWroe3CMTuQ6C_YHjXPJKcSktof6mUTDo-DZiEe0lMo\">Coronavirus Tag Page.</a> &nbsp;We found that we wanted more than one stickied post, to keep multiple conversations going on the <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread\">Justified Advice Thread</a>, <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/posts/ACyGvQchWzGjGkKgS/coronavirus-open-thread\">Open Thread</a>, and <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/posts/5LFEDHjCKgXJgJQjR/lesswrong-coronavirus-link-database\">Link Database</a>, and other important posts we wanted people to be able to keep track of.</p><p>But! If you are sick of CV content, you can open up the gear-icon in the Recommendations section, and hide Top Coronavirus Content widget.</p><p>Meanwhile, it you <i>want</i> all the CV content...</p><h2>3. There's a Coronavirus Tag Page!</h2><p>If you <i>want</i> to catch up on all the COVID-19 content, it's all available over at <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coronavirus\">https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coronavirus</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, only admins can add a tag to a post. But all users can upvote or downvote the relevance of a tag to a particular post. On the Tag Page, you'll see a little vote button to the left of the karma. Voting affects the post's Tag Relevance Score, which determines the sort order on a tag page.&nbsp;</p><p>(It's fine to be a bit more strategic about how to upvote or downvote on tag-relevance. The goal is not to determine \"how good is this post overall?\" but \"how high on the tag page should the post appear?\". The system is designed so that the collective decision-making of the LessWrong userbase can output a pretty good set of \"top posts\" that new users see when they first come to the page, or when glance at the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coronavirus\">Tag Hover Preview</a>.)</p><h2>4. Beta Feedback, Upcoming Features</h2><p>What sort of additional features would you like for Tags, or for Coronavirus content in particular?</p><p>Some features we're currently considering include:</p><ul><li>Better sorting and filtering on the tag page (in particular, being able to see all Coronavirus un-resolved questions)</li><li>Possibly including a \"Recent Discussion\" section for the Tag page.</li><li>Subscribing to a tag, so you're alerted to all new posts with that tag.</li></ul></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Two years ago, I would have proclaimed a cautious bias towards thinking religion is a bad idea.</p><p>Since then, having read a bunch of &#x201C;religious&#x201D; philosophers and  observed a bunch of &#x201C;religious&#x201D; people, I came to the conclusion that  &#x201C;religion&#x201D; is a term I will start shying away from using at all, because it&#x2019;s ill  defined. It encompasses too many ideas to be a useful point of  discussion.</p><p>As a specific example, let&#x2019;s look at Sunni Islam and some things most people would probably like and dislike about it:</p><p><strong>1. I once visited Burj Khalifa and was told that the highest livable  floor in the building (158) is dedicated to a mosque. (Googling this  fact I find claims that it&#x2019;s an urban myth, but I can&#x2019;t find strong  evidence one way or another. For the purposes of this article let&#x2019;s  assume the tour guide wasn&#x2019;t lying).</strong></p><p>I find this to be a very nice thing. Here you have the tallest  building in the world and you could sell the top floor for billions of  dollars, or have it be the king&#x2019;s apartment, or show it off to important  officials to brag and to flatter them&#x2026; but instead you decide to build a  place of worship.</p><p>It&#x2019;s the sort of act that says &#x201C;Yeah, we made this awe-inspiring  thing, but we really owe it to thousands of of past generations. None of  us can fully comprehend how we managed to do this, so let&#x2019;s dedicate  its highest floor to something transcendent, something that symbolizes  the beautiful, impossible and absurd experiment that made it possible,  our society&#x201D;.</p><p>It&#x2019;s the sort of thing I like about the Catholic faith or any other  faith when I walk into their places of worship, adorned in such beauty  that they really make you stop, calm down and contemplate in awe and  wonder.</p><p><strong>2. On 11-9-2001 a group of Sunni terrorists decided that Americans were  the worst possible evil and that harming them and their country is an  act so moral and just that it&#x2019;s worth dying for.</strong></p><p>This is the kind of action born out of an ethical smugness that even I can&#x2019;t comprehend, and I&#x2019;m quite an ethically smug person.</p><p>It&#x2019;s thinking that you can be so right as to warrant doing an action  which will be viewed as horrible by most of the world, but completely  disregarding their opinion because you obviously have it right.</p><p>It&#x2019;s the same kind of thing I dislike about an atheist SS officer  murdering hundreds of Jews because he is certain his normally atrocious  action serves &#x201C;the greater good&#x201D;.</p><p><strong>3. Avicenna deciphered and translated old texts in order to better  learn what dozens of generations before him thought about the world.</strong></p><p>He observed, poked and prodded the world around him to learn its  mysteries. He generated knowledge which was so precious it was taught in  medical schools around the world more than half a millennium after his  death.</p><p>He did this, as far as I understand, partially because of some  mystical ideas about the will of God for man to master and understand  his creation. I admire Avicenna for basically the same reasons I admire Francis Bacon  or Richard Feynman or Alan Turing.</p><p><strong>4. Avicenna spent most of his life writing nonsense about his  interpretation of old religious texts. Coming up with unfounded and  useless systems to explain the soul. Producing a bunch of work that are  illogical and childish.</strong></p><p>His quest to say something relevant about metaphysics is as irrelevant to anything we have today as those of Thales or Bostrom.</p><p>Out of this he gathered up a bunch of ideas about man&#x2019;s purpose in  life and ethics which are pointless at best and harmful at worst.</p><p>I dislike  Avicenna for basically the same reasons I dislike Thomas  Aquinas: he wasted his life and added pointless mental fluff to the  zeitgeist, which materialized into nothing.</p><h2>Questions that need not be asked</h2><p>There are questions which need not be asked, that is simply because  they are ill-phrased, so answering them is just going to result in you  playing around with words until you&#x2019;ve convinced your brain that you  found and answer or embedded them into your mind so much that they seem  &#x201C;sacred&#x201D;.</p><p>The basic example of this is the whole &#x201C;If a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, does it make a sound ?&#x201D;.</p><p>This question has 4 ways of answering it:</p><ul><li>No</li><li>Yes</li><li>Thinking about it for 10 years, coupled with deep meditation and becoming &#x201C;enlightened&#x201D;</li><li>Do you mean &#x201C;sound&#x201D; as in &#x201C;someone hearing something&#x201D; or do you mean  &#x201C;sound&#x201D; as in &#x201C;acoustic vibrations being transmitted through the earth  and air starting at the points of impact&#x201D; ?</li></ul><p>See more on this <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE/disputing-definitions\">here</a>.</p><p>Out of those answers &#x201C;4&#x201D; is correct.</p><p>This is basically the case with all &#x201C;grand&#x201D; questions:</p><ul><li>What is the meaning of life ?</li><li>Does God exist ?</li><li>Is there free will ?</li></ul><p>Deconstruct these questions and you will soon find out that they are  ill posed. Once you try to further refine the terms in order to get to  an answerable question you reach a very simple answer to a bunch of  separate questions.</p><p>Those questions contain terms that upon further inspection are  impossible to define (e.g. &#x201C;free will&#x201D;, &#x201C;God&#x201D;) or terms incompatible  with one another (e.g. &#x201C;meaning&#x201D;, &#x201C;life&#x201D;).</p><ul><li>&#x201C;What is the meaning of life&#x201D; is as nonsensical as saying &#x201C;Is it  honorable to drink high-PH water ?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Are neutrons afraid of bees ?&#x201D;</li><li>&#x201C;Does God exist ?&#x201D; can mean &#x201C;Is there an absolute system of  morality we should bide by ?&#x201D;, &#x201C;Is there something more powerful than  humans out in the universe ?&#x201D;, &#x201C;Is there an invisible all-powerful man  in the sky ?&#x201D;, &#x201C;Are we living in controlled a simulation ?&#x201D;, &#x201C;Does our  consciousness transcend death ?&#x201D;.</li><li>&#x201C;Is there free will ?&#x201D; relies on a term so ill-defined it&#x2019;s like  asking &#x201C;Can magrugleblegs eat bloxorgs ?&#x201D; Try imaging the difference  between a world where &#x201C; free will&#x201D; exists versus one where it doesn&#x2019;t &#x2026;  or read Avicenna or 101 other philosophers who wasted their time trying  to define the term.</li></ul><h2>Answering questions that cannot be asked</h2><p>In the end, spending too much time answering questions that cannot be asked can lead down two paths.</p><p>Path number one is writing a bunch of philosophy and/or religious  books, ending up being very uncertain about your answer and only being  able to explain it in a format longer than the one required to  understand all of modern physics.</p><p>Path number two leads to the mind tricking itself into thinking the  answer existing and is certain, which leads to the kind of self-assured  megalomania that can cause you to fly planes into towers in order to  reach the kingdom of eternal bliss, or to torture and rape young single  mothers because that is the only way their sins can be absolved (Hi,  Irish Catholic Church!).</p><p>It&#x2019;s like feeding code into a compiler, getting the compiler stuck in  an infinite loop and, instead of pressing ctrl-C, waiting forever for  an answer or getting an OOM error and interpreting that as the compiled  code.</p><p>This is what I now assume I hate about religion. </p><p>You have people wasting their time and other&#x2019;s people resources shoveling air in order to find a treasure.</p><p>You have people wasting their time and other&#x2019;s people resources (and  sometimes life and well-being) because they reached a nonsensical answer  which they consider to be the absolute truth.</p><p>Both of these things might stem from trying to answer these &#x201C;trick&#x201D; questions.</p><p>This pattern is by no means sequestered to religion, however. It&#x2019;s  just that most of the questions seem to fall under the umbrella of  religion.</p><p>But go to the opposite end of spectrum and look at something like the  &#x201C;rationalist atheist&#x201D; community and you&#x2019;ll basically find the same  pattern. A bunch of people assuming an air of smugness because they  think they&#x2019;ve found an unshakable moral truth and a bunch of people  wasting their time thinking about ill-phrased questions, just  replacing  &#x201C;God&#x201D; with &#x201C;a simulation&#x201D; or  replacing &#x201C;repenting for the end times&#x201D;  with &#x201C;handling AI risk&#x201D;.</p><p>Indeed, go to the extreme end of any movement, be it a far-right  cult, a progressive propaganda machine, a libertarian echo chamber or a  communist party&#x2026; and you find the same pattern. A combination of  &#x201C;philosopher&#x201D; getting trapped by unanserable questions and spouting  nonsense and fanatics convinced they have the absolute moral truth and  committing acts of violence and hate because of it.</p><p>Part of me thinks that the answer to this problem is simple and I&#x2019;ve partially written about this in <a href=\"https://blog.cerebralab.com/A_Better_Way_of_Understanding_Systems\">A Better Way of Understanding Systems </a> and <a href=\"https://blog.cerebralab.com/A_short_rant_on_personal_memetic_hygiene\">A short rant on personal memetic hygiene</a>.</p><p>But that part of me is likely wrong. I&#x2019;d be a hypocrite if I thought  otherwise since a long time spent on these kind of questions is what got  me to where I am&#x2026; and I kind of enjoy the place where I am mentally. It  feels cozy and happy and the ideas I&#x2019;m able to generate from it, whilst  almost certainly not yet useful for almost anything, at least feel to  me like &#x201C;the kind of things which I will be able to develop into useful  works of engineering if I refine them for long enough&#x201D;.</p><p>You can argue that  Avicenna could have spent all his time  researching medicine and astronomy and none looking into the nature of  &#x201C;the soul&#x201D; and &#x201C;God&#x201D;, but it requires the same smugness that I warned  against a few paragraphs ago to make that assumption. It might well be  that  Avicenna needed to waste his time on pointless questions in order  to get the perspective and motivation that allowed him to create the  closest thing to modern medicine that existed before late Renaissance.</p><p>I think the world need more Avicennas and if the price we must pay is  a bunch of bad books about phenomenology and metaphysics it&#x2019;s a very  advantageous trade.</p><p>But the world could probably do without a bunch of Thomas Aquinas  throwing away hereditary money on whoring and gambling then publishing  nonsense about metaphysics due to thinking that &#x201C;existence&#x201D; is a  characteristic the same way &#x201C;blue&#x201D; is. The world would almost certainly  be better off without people committing genocide and flying commercial  planes into tall buildings.</p><p>Maybe there is a sweet spot in terms of musing on these questions,  around that sweet spot you get Edmund Burke or a Quaker doctor  dedicating his life to curing tropical diseases in Rwanda. If you don&#x2019;t  venture into these kind of questions at all, you get an accountant or a  store clerk; venture to deeply or go the wrong way and you get a  Thomas  Aquinas or a fundamentalist preacher who wants to kill homosexuals.</p><p>Alas, I can&#x2019;t speak much as to how you can find that sweet-spot,  besides the vaguely-related article I linked above. So this train of  thought about unanswerable questions leads me to an  unanswerable  question. Possibly because I&#x2019;m asking it in the wrong way or because my  assumptions are completely wrong to being with&#x2026; On which I just wasted  almost 2,000 words saying almost nothing at all, the very thing I am  railing against.</p>",

This is the second event of this type; <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NpZsCERfyKT7cJN9a/blog-post-day-retrospective\">the first one went well</a>. Please comment if you are thinking about joining so I can gauge interest.</em></p><h2>The Problem:</h2><p>Like me, you are too scared and/or lazy to write up this idea you&apos;ve had. What if it&apos;s not good? I started a draft but... Etc.</p><p>Alternatively: Coronavirus got you down? Cooped up inside? Looking for something new to do, someone new to talk to? How about you write a blog post?</p><h2>The Solution:</h2><p><strong>1. Higher motivation via Time Crunch and Peer Encouragement</strong></p><p>We&apos;ll set an official goal of having the post put up by midnight. Also, we&apos;ll meet up in a <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/AHTePn\">special-purpose discord channel </a>to chat, encourage each other, swap half-finished drafts, etc. If like me you are intending to write the thing one day eventually, well, here&apos;s a reason to make that day this day.</p><p><strong>2. Lower standards via Time Crunch and Safety in Numbers</strong></p><p>Since we have to be done by midnight, we&apos;ll all be under time pressure and any errors or imperfections in the posts will be forgivable. Besides, they can always be fixed later via edits. Meanwhile, since a bunch of us will be posting on the same day, writing a sloppy post just means it won&apos;t be read much, since everyone will be talking about the handful of posts that turn out to be really good. If you are like me, these thoughts are comforting and encouraging.</p><h2>Evidence this Works:</h2><p>MIRI Summer Fellows Program had a Blog Post Day towards the end, and it was enormously successful. It worked for me, for example: It squeezed two good posts out of me. (OK, so one of them I finished up early the next morning, so I guess it technically doesn&apos;t count. But in spirit it does: It wouldn&apos;t have happened at all without Blog Post Day.) More importantly, MSFP keeps doing this every year, even though opportunity cost for them is much higher (probably) than the opportunity cost for you or me. And we did a Blog Post Day on LW last month and it worked great.</p><h2>Side Benefits:</h2><p>It&apos;ll be fun!</p>",

It might be faster to develop new vaccines with such mRNA technology then to develop old protein based vaccines. The technology is the hope that we will get a vaccine sooner then we would get a vaccine that&apos;s produced the traditional way.</p><p>BigPharma giant Johnson &amp; Johnson that uses a more traditional approach to developing vaccines expects to hit clinical trials only in <u><a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/j-j-sets-sights-november-for-covid-19-vaccine-trial\">November</a></u>. </p><p>Moderna, the third company with such technology, that&#x2019;s from the US, started their human trials on <u><a href=\"https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19\">16th of March</a></u>. BioNTech, announced a $135 million partnership with Shanghai-based Fosun Pharmaceutical Group to co-develop its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in China.

This gives the impression that the German regulatory bodies prevent them to go as fast as the Moderna trials in Seattle or BioNTech trials in China.</p><p>The EU just gave CureVac 80 million Euro funding to scale up their production capacity to be able to produce 1 billion vaccine doses in one campaign. It&#x2019;s great that they fund production capacity but it would be worthwhile if EU and German regulators would also reduce the red tape so that CureVac can start human trials in other jurisdictions. </p><p>This situation looks to me like it would be beneficial if we can push EU/German regulators to cut red tape for CureVac in addition to giving money or another jurisdiction would allow them to run their human trials earlier. </p><p>(While researching this post I also created a <u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TssTyeK3pVBstuNMd5tv6eETQNh8w9VxldZw36Izsoo/edit?usp=sharing\">Google Sheet</a></u> that lists more COVID-19 vaccine efforts)</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>In this document, I attempt to discuss the impact of the coronavirus\nlockdown and how to prepare for it. This is not focused on the direct\nimpact of coronavirus, but rather on the secondary impact of\nprecautions that people are taking, including the lockdowns and the\nnew normal of staying home and working from home.</p>\n<p>The document is written in an imperative tone, focused on what to\ndo. However, please don't read into this tone the idea that I am\nconfident of these suggestions and authoritatively pushing them. They\nare just ideas!</p>\n<p>Many of these ideas are self-justifying, but I have not tried to\njustify their <em>relative importance</em> to other ideas that I have\nomitted. Subject to time constraints, I'll be happy to answer specific\nquestions challenging the ideas, or comparing them to other ideas I\ndidn't list. If you have a question of that sort, there's a good\nchance I'll just agree that the idea I didn't list was more important.</p>\n<p>My initial draft of this post included some discussion of potential\nfuture timelines, but I decided to omit that in order to make the post\nfocus on ideas for dealing with the situation. I may separately write\nabout possible futures.</p>\n<h2>General ideas</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Expect a <strong>three-month timeline</strong> for the lockdown (i.e., lockdown\ncontinuing till the end of June), with <strong>the possibility of a\nsix-month, twelve-month, or even eighteen-month lockdown</strong>. Even if\na strict lockdown lasts much less, health advice may still recommend\nthat you shelter in place for additional time.</li>\n<li><strong>Brace for impact! Prepare psychologically.</strong> Plan for three months of\nlockdown; it could be shorter, but it could also be much longer. If\nyou overprepare a little bit because the lockdown lasts just one\nmonth, you'll need to write off the effort, but that'll be less\npainful than forming expectations that this will end in a few weeks\nand then constantly being disappointed at how much it's dragging\nout.\n<ul>\n<li>It's ideal if all your concrete actions are \"no-regret\" -- so that\nif the lockdown lasts longer or shorter than you expect, the\naction still gives you some lasting benefit. But this may not\nalways be possible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Keep a buffer (material goods, liquid savings, other reserves), but\ndon't engage in panic actions to build buffers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Impact on day-to-day life experience</h2>\n<p>Since we're talking of a three-month timeline for a lockdown (and\npossibly much longer), you have to think of a sustainable way to\nmanage your life. It's not a day or two that you can somehow\nbrute-force. You need a sustainable approach, and a reasonable\nbalance. Here are some ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strike the right balance in terms of going out</strong>: It's reasonably safe\nto go out if you stay far from people and don't touch stuff. So,\nmake sure to get a reasonable amount of exercise and fresh\nair. Don't stay cooped up in your home for days. Obviously,\nexceptions apply for people who are sick or may have been exposed,\nor if there is legal enforcement of a stricter stay-at-home\norder. Most existing stay-at-home orders, even the strictest\nlockdowns, allow people (who are not old or at risk of already being\nexposed) to go out alone for exercise. In some regions, you may need\nto carry documentation stating that you are going out for exercise.</li>\n<li><strong>Get the right cadence in terms of purchasing food and necessities</strong>:\nKeep in mind that grocery stores and convenience stores are limiting\nthe amount you can buy at a given time. So make sure to make regular\n(though not very frequent) trips to stay stocked up on necessities,\nthinking as far ahead as feasible. Sanitize well before and after\nsuch trips. If you can make these trips at a time when the stores\nand streets are less crowded, please do that. Again, please make\nsure to comply with any stay-at-home orders, including taking\nappropriate documentation in regions where documentation is\nnecessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Take great care of your health even outside of coronavirus-related\nmatters</strong>: It'll be a terrible idea if you need to go to a doctor at\nthis time. So, make sure to take good care of your health,\nparticularly dental health and any other aspects of health that tend\nto be problematic for you. Make sure to eat healthy and take your\nnormal supplements that have a good track record for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Use scarce goods sparingly.</strong> Here are some illustrative examples; the\nspecifics may not make sense in light of your health concerns,\nbeliefs about environmental impact, and aesthetics, but they give a\ngeneral idea:\n<ul>\n<li>If you use paper goods at home (such as paper towels), consider\nusing cloth-based substitutes, as long as each person can use\ntheir own personal cloth: Paper goods are likely to stay in\nshortage, so you want to use yours sparingly if feasible. For\ninstance, use cloth towels instead of paper towels for wiping your\nhands, as long as multiple people aren't sharing the same towel.</li>\n<li>Give preference to handwashing with soap over using hand\nsanitizer. Handwashing is anyway more effective, and soap seems to\nbe less in demand than hand sanitizer (likely because of the huge\ndemand for hand sanitizer created by businesses offering hand\nsanitizers at workstations). The relative availability of hand\nsanitizer may, however, improve as lockdown continues and business\nuse of hand sanitizers slows down.</li>\n<li>You will need to figue out what other goods are scarce where you\nlive and adjust consumption habits accordingly. Please weigh other\nconsiderations like health, the environment, personal aesthetics, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Impact on social life and interaction</h2>\n<p>Staying at home, and refraining from participating in social\nactivities, is something that could get harder and harder as the time\nperiod gets longer. Some social activities are easy to forgo for a\nweek, but harder to forgo for three months. I expect that this could\nlead to people feeling depression, loneliness, and mental health\nissues, with the risks increasing the longer this continues.</p>\n<p>A silver lining is that the reduced level of necessary activity, in\nparticular commuting, may help people recover from months or even\nyears of hectic commutes.</p>\n<p>The balance of these factors will vary from person to person, but I\nexpect that for most people, the social life impact will be a net\nnegative.</p>\n<p>What can we do? Here are a few thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exploit the positives</strong>: You can't do some social activities that you\nnormally do, but perhaps the shelter-in-place and the saved commute\ntime gives you more flexibility and time to do some other things\nyou've always wanted to do but never had the bandwidth for. For\ninstance, maybe you can spend evenings working on a long-deferred\npersonal project, or learn a new skill, instead of being stuck in\nthe commute or socially pressured to attend events you don't really\nenjoy. Or maybe you could spend more time with your family (in the\nliteral sense, not as a euphemism). Or spend more time online with\npeople who don't live near you anyway.</li>\n<li><strong>Get along better with the people you live with</strong>: You can't escape\nyour home to go hang out with others, so you probably need to make\npeace with whoever is next to you, whether that's your family, your\npets, or random roommates. Appreciate more the time you spend with\nthem (with appropriate social distance!) or at any rate, don't get\ninto fights, considering that you can't walk out of the house that\neasily.</li>\n<li><strong>Switch social activities online as much as possible, and plan a\nlittle bit for them</strong>: If you got a lot of your social energy from\nserendipitious in-person interaction, this will be in short\nsupply. Instead, you may have to plan the equivalent online things a\nbit more. In many cases, more conscious planning and coordination\nmay be needed. So make sure to plan and push for the online\nequivalents where feasible. This is important because it's likely\nthe lockdown will last long enough that completely forgoing some\nkinds of social interactions will be too costly. This may be\nparticularly important for group activities that play an important\nrole providing emotional support to their members.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Impact on work life and job security</h2>\n<p>This mostly applies to jobs where you were previously going into an\noffice and you're now working from home. It doesn't apply to cases\nwhere you have been fired or furloughed, or where you were always\nworking from home, or where you still need to go in for the job.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make home station adjustments</strong>: Make adjustments to your home\nenvironment to make it more feasible to efficiently work from\nhome. A lot of people find it helpful to have a physical separation\nof their work station and the rest of their home; if that's feasible\nand desirable for you, consider doing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Negotiate a new work-life balance</strong>: The previous work-life\nbalance you worked out probably needs to be adjusted in light of the\nnew situation. For instance, perhaps you can start work earlier or\nend later, but need more breaks within the day to cook food or deal\nwith your kid who's also staying at home. Think through the right\nbalance that works for you and your employer. This may take a few\ndays to figure out.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure lines of communication and recognition of your work have\nadjusted to the work-from-home reality</strong>: Even if you're doing just as\nmuch work as you were doing in the past, your boss or colleagues may\nnot realize that. Make sure that the \"optics\" angle is\nwell-covered. The specifics will vary from job to job.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep in mind that getting a new job may be harder, so try to secure\nyourself in your existing job more</strong>: At least until the lockdown is\nin place, and possibly even for a few more months, switching jobs\nwill be hard. So, try as much as possible to get along with your\nexisting job. This is true even if your industry isn't directly\naffected in a severe way; for people in industries that are heavily\naffected, the situation is much trickier. NOTE: If you are in a\nheavily affected industry and have an opportuunity to jump to a less\naffected one, consider taking it. But secure the new opportunity\nfirst before jumping ship.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Financial impact</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Give more importance to building a liquid savings buffer</strong>: In my\n<a href=\"https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/tree/master/simple-financial-advice.md\">simple financial advice\ndoc</a>,\nI recommend building liquid savings for about one year. In the\ncurrent climate, I recommend increasing the target to two years,\nand to three if your job or industry is particularly negatively\naffected. In particular, I suggest:\n<ul>\n<li>Stop contributing to retirement accounts until you have hit the\nincreased liquid savings threshold. With that said, if you do have\nmore liquid savings than the increased threshold, increasing\ncontributions to retirement accounts may be a great idea.</li>\n<li>Hold off on repaying very-low-interest loans such as student loans\nuntil you have hit the increased liquid savings threshold (though\nit's best to do calculations for each loan to trade off the\ninterest rate against the loss of liquidity).</li>\n<li>If you are well below your liquid savings threshold, investigate\nhow much of your money is in retirement accounts and other funds\nand make contingency plans to liquidate some of it to shore up\nyour liquid savings. Liquidating retirement accounts may come with\na penalty, which is why it's better to store any new money you're\ngetting in more liquid forms. So make the plan (to liquidate) and\nbe prepared to execute it if you find your net savings rate\nturning negative (due to unexpected income loss or expense\nincreases).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Beyond the goal of maintaining liquidity to weather you through 2\nto 3 years, don't engage in panic buying or selling of assets</strong>:\nThere are arguments in favor of buying and holding in the stock\nmarket given the lower prices. Evaluate them based on your normal\ncriteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Continue your regular philanthropy and consumer spending</strong>: On a\nsimilar note, if you engage in regular philanthropy or in consumer\nspending that gives you happiness, continue with it as long as (a)\nit still makes sense in the context of the lockdown, and (b) you\neither already reached or are on the way to your liquid savings\nthreshold. In other words, after securing your health and wealth,\ncontinue your life as close to normal as possible.\n<ul>\n<li>If, for building your savings, you have a choice between cutting\ndown on consumer spending that gives you happiness, versus cutting\ndown on putting money into retirement accounts, choose the\nlatter. In other words, spend normally, and put less money into\nyour retirement account. Saving for retirement can wait for a few\nyears; if you don't survive those few years, there is no point\nsaving for retirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>My reasons for writing this document</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Especially in the rationality community, I've seen a lot of\n<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B9qzPZDcPwnX6uEpe/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-summary\">advice</a>\non protecting oneself against coronavirus, but not as much on\ndealing with the massive social experiment that's being unleashed in\nthe effort to do so. I expect the latter to increase in importance\nover time, both if containment efforts are successful, and if they\naren't.</li>\n<li>Much discussion among the general public about the lockdown seems to\nbe along the lines of \"hey, we're in uncharted territory, this is\nscary\" and isn't reiterating enough what this might mean over time\nperiods longer than a week or two. I think what's important is to\nstart bracing for an extended period of lockdown, to minimize the\nwave of secondary effects as people get frustrated with the\nlockdown. Preparing people in this way could help make sustained\ncontainment and social distancing efforts more palatable, and\nmitigate some of the adverse social and economic effects. My post\nis probably a very small contribution, but I hope it pushes\npositively in the general direction.</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>  Juan G. Diaz Ochoa</p><p>  </p><p>In the current virus outbreak, we all are experiencing for the first-time restrictions like those in war times and suddenly life is feeling like a bad B movie. The impact is not only in our private lives, but also in our economy and fundamental social interactions. Now, regarding the current facts, and making a comparison with the SARS outbreak of 2002, there is a constant question: why in that time there has been no global pandemic, and why we are now seeing a rapid propagation of a virus? Similarly, why we are experiencing a global deterioration of social norms and democracies? Perhaps there is a problem with the size of our networks[1].</p><p>Besides the obvious analysis of the biology of the virus (SARS-1 in 2002 vs. SARS-2 in 2020), we must not forget the structure of the networks making possible its spread. We are seeing not only the propagation of one infection in a large network, but in reality, the outbreak of different coinfections of different nature (biological, social) that are mutually influenced (Chen u. a. 2013). </p><p>A network growth subsequently associated to the spread of one &#x201C;infection&#x201D; (distribution of production systems and delivery chains or even envy[2] (Ram&#xED;rez Barrios, D&#xED;az Ochoa, und Schneider 2007)) is followed by the spread or other infections with a biological (viruses) and social character (misinformation or trends). In all cases there is a critical threshold in the network size and topology allowing a massive spread of tendencies or infections, and all of them have a mutual influence [3].</p><p>Humans have built a large-scale system that extends into a global network that is fragile due to its complexity and tendency to promote homogeneity over diversity. The growth of this network has been very rapid and indiscriminate with great environmental impact in different regions and scales, particularly afterthe world wide web, the end of the Cold War, trade deals, and new, rapidly developing economies fully entered in the global supplying chains after the fall of the Soviet Union. Some inconclusive analysis of the current outbreak just points to this environmental problem as first cause of this pandemics, since livestock, hosting such diseases[4] (Cui, Li, und Shi 2019), is transported to human settlements as a food source. </p><p>Unfortunately, the interconnection between different production chains favors the exchange of a few products and technologies that require just homogeneity in different areas (social, cultural, economic) helping the smooth operation of production and logistic processes, despite local cultural differences between different places like Istanbul, New York or Bogota. In this way, our nets slowly look like a homogeneous environment (like bananas or a palm oil farm). &quot;Risks have been allowed to fester, they are the underbelly of globalization&quot;[5].</p><p>More data and research are needed to confirm or deny the idea of limiting the growth and topology of a human/social economic network to a safe size. But if confirmed, we as human species must begin to identify and validate the threshold parameters. Simultaneously, our cultural, economic and social activity must again promote a diversity (which must also be reflected in our natural environment). Interestingly the current dramatic outbreak of COVID-19 has let the people recognize the risks embedded in the size of such large networks. For instance, in trade &quot;once supply chains were disrupted [by coronavirus], people started looking for alternative suppliers at home, even if they were more expensive. &quot;If people find domestic suppliers, they will stick with them&#x2026; because of those perceived risks.&quot;[6]</p><p>However, it is worth asking if it is not already too late, as is limiting the increase in the overall temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The effects are at least now visible in the current measures that governments around the world have taken to limit human mobility in response to the 2019-NCOV outbreak, with extreme measures such as the closure of schools and universities or the prohibition of free movement inside and between countries.</p><p>The restructuring of human activities as well as social/private behavior, and not the restriction of individual freedom, seems to be the long last effect, in particular considering that the limitation of the mobility does not considerably influences the spread of the disease and that hat the travel ban introduced in Wuhan on January 23 delayed progression of the epidemic throughout Mainland China by three to five days&#x2014;a modest effect[7] (&#x201E;The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak | Science&#x201C; o. J.). In such case more individual responsibility for the world, and not a war attitude, seems to be the adequate answer for this and future crisis. </p><p>    </p><p>[1] Which is evident in the byzantine international supply chains: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/supply-chains-and-coronavirus/608329/</p><br><p>[2] Ram&#xED;rez Barrios, Elena, Juan G.

    "htmlBody": "<p>Suppose we have an electronic circuit with two pieces: combinational logic and memory. The combinational logic is designed to behave as memoryless input/output logic gates - it has only short-term state, and computes some function. The memory reads the output of the combinational logic once per clock cycle, stores it, and feeds it back into the combinational logic as input during the next clock cycle. The causal diagram looks something like this:</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/sWGAZXupfWBGCc25guOYLdA/image?w=445&amp;h=622&amp;rev=97&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=1ZL2JCgOa8XSpNd0O0C5AiebKkqiWTc-FrfSeM0yL3LA\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:445%\"></figure></p><p>Key point: even though there&#x2019;s a path from the combinational logic state at the start of one clock cycle to its state at the start of the next cycle, that path has approximately-zero causal influence. We could intervene on the logic state right after the cycle starts:</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/d/sxFH8JooUPuCjTxBE-Q5AXA/image?w=445&amp;h=622&amp;rev=4&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=1ZL2JCgOa8XSpNd0O0C5AiebKkqiWTc-FrfSeM0yL3LA\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:445%\"></figure></p><p>&#x2026; and the state at the start of the next cycle would not change at all.</p><p>In other words: in this model, the memory state mediates the influence of the logic state during one cycle on logic states during future cycles. This is not a property of the graph structure alone - it happens because the combinational logic does not have any long-term memory of its own.</p><p>Key problem for causal abstraction: how can we algorithmically detect situations like this?</p><p>One obvious answer is to probe the circuit experimentally. Counterfactual queries are particularly handy for this: we fix the random noise, then check which nodes would be changed by a counterfactual intervention on the logic state at some time. Try this for a bunch of different samples, and look for long-range mediation in the results.</p><p>One problem with this approach: we often want an abstraction which works on all possible &#x201C;input values&#x201D; of some variables. There may be exponentially many such values, and we&#x2019;d have to check all of them to verify that the abstraction works.</p><p>An example: consider a ripple-carry adder (i.e. the electronic circuit version of grade-school long addition). Each stage adds two input bits and a carry bit from the previous stage, then passes its own carry bit to the next stage. We want to abstract from the low-level electronics to some higher-level model.</p><p>If we&#x2019;re using a 64-bit adder, then there are 2^(2*64) possible inputs. For almost all of those (specifically all but about 2^64 of them), flipping one low-order bit will not change the high-order bit. But if we want our adder to work on all possible inputs, then we need to account for the one-in-2^64 possibilities when flipping a low-order bit <em>does</em> change the high-order bit. We won&#x2019;t catch that just by sampling.</p><p>In full generality, the problem is presumably NP-complete - we&#x2019;re asking whether any possible inputs to an arbitrary circuit result in some variable changing in response to a counterfactual intervention on another variable. Yet we&#x2019;re able to use abstract models an awful lot in practice, so&#x2026; what tricks are we using?</p>",

So, here's the puzzle:</p>\n<p>We have a large number N of people that need to be tested. Each has SARS-CoV-2 with probability P. (The cases of interest are P&lt;5%, maybe even P&lt;1%, see <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pjLgE2efAozz82JmR/sars-cov-2-pool-testing-algorithm-puzzle?commentId=G8YJeetk7gQ3wtACz\">comment</a>.) We can test any subset of the N (or maybe up to a maximum pool size S), with the test returning positive if at least person in the subset is positive. (Bonus: allow that the tests are imperfect, with a per-test false positive rate FPR and false negative rate FNR.)</p>\n<p>Your mission is to develop a testing protocol, i.e. an algorithm for what tests to run in what order. The simplest example (proposed in that article linked above) would be: Test non-overlapping groups, and if the test is positive, test each individual within the group. But is there a better way?</p>\n<p>Score your algorithm's success on some combination of: (1) minimal total expected number of tests, (2) trying not to ask people for too many samples (lower priority on this one I think<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-xMhFDYKkYYiv4cZYx-1\" id=\"fnref-xMhFDYKkYYiv4cZYx-1\">[1]</a></sup>), (3) false positive and false negative rates for individuals, (4) minimal serial time (i.e., minimal number of steps where we need results from step N to figure out what tests to run in step N+1).</p>\n<p>(I'm not sure how to combine these criteria into a single score that reflects practical goals; if anyone knows, please comment. Or tell me if I'm leaving something out.)</p>\n<p>Bonus: What if we have prior information, in the form of a N×N correlation matrix? (This could reflect the fact that for cohabitants / colleagues / neighbors, it's likelier that both or neither have it.)</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-xMhFDYKkYYiv4cZYx-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The swabbing process is <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/getting-a-coronavirus-test-like-being-stabbed-in-the-brain.html\">mildly unpleasant</a>, so other things equal, better to not require lots of swabs.

Excerpt:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>COVID-19 causes shortness of breath and in severe cases requires artificial ventilation. There is a shortage of mechanical ventilators in hospitals, and a shortage of medical personnel to treat patients with severe COVID-19, so there’s widespread interest in contributing to open source ventilation projects. For these efforts to be effective, though, we need to understand what COVID-19 patients need in terms of ventilators and other supplemental oxygen sources.</p><p><strong>COVID-19 Symptoms and Clinical Guidelines</strong></p><p>Most patients who go to a hospital for COVID-19 have pneumonia or infection of the lungs, which is visible on a chest X-ray.&nbsp; A large fraction (41.3%) receive supplemental oxygen therapy; a smaller fraction (5%) needed to be admitted to the ICU, and 6.1% needed mechanical ventilation.[1]&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ARDS</strong>&nbsp; Severe cases of COVID-19 result in developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Fluid builds up in the lungs; the lungs may collapse; blood oxygen drops; and mechanical ventilation is required. Merely providing air with a higher oxygen content than room air isn’t enough; pressure needs to be administered to keep the alveoli open.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote></body></html>",

This prevents hypotheses such as &quot;the speaker is giving us the bits of a halting oracle in order&quot;, as well as &quot;the speaker has a little more processing power than the listener&quot;. However, the hypothesis space is not <em>so</em> restricted as to limit the world to being a finite-state machine. The listener can imagine the speaker proving complicated theorems, so long as it is done <em>sufficiently slowly for the listener to keep up</em>. In such a model, the listener might imagine the speaker staying quiet for quite a long time (observing the null string over and over, or some simple sentence such as 1=1) while a long computation completes; and only then making a complicated claim.</p><p>This is also not to say that I <em>assume</em> my listener considers <em>only</em> hypotheses in which it can 100% keep up with the speaker&apos;s reasoning.

I&apos;ll talk about relaxing it after I sketch the central result.</p><p><strong>Assumption 3.</strong> <em>A listener is said to have </em><strong>minimally consistent beliefs</strong><em> if each proposition </em>X<em> has a negation </em>X*<em>, and </em>P(X)+P(X*)<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\leq\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">&#x2264;</span></span></span></span></span></span>1. </p><p>The idea behind minimally consistent beliefs is that the listener need not be logically omniscient, but does avoid outright contradictions. This is important, since assuming logical omniscience would throw out computability from the start, making any computational-difficulty result rather boring; but totally throwing out logic would make my result impossible. Minimal consistency keeps an extremely small amount of logic, but, it is enough to prove my result.</p><p><strong>Theorem(/Conjecture).</strong> <em>It is not possible for a Bayesian reasoner, observing a sequence of remarks made by a speaker, to simultaneously:</em></p><ul><li><em>Have a rich hypothesis space.</em></li><li><em>Believe the speaker to be honest.</em></li><li><em>Have minimally consistent beliefs.</em></li><li><em>Have computable beliefs.</em></li></ul><p><strong>Proof sketch. </strong>Suppose assumptions 1-3. Thanks to the rich hypothesis space assumption, the listener will assign some probability to the speaker enumerating theorems of PA (Peano Arithmetic). Since this hypothesis makes distinct predictions, it is possible for the confidence to rise above 50% after finitely many observations. At that point, since the listener expects each theorem of PA to <em>eventually </em>be listed, with probability &gt; 50%, and the listener believes the speaker, the listener <em>must</em> assign &gt; 50% probability  to each theorem of PA! But this implies that the listener&apos;s beliefs are not computable, since if we had access to them we could <em>separate theorems of PA from contradictions</em> by checking whether a sentence&apos;s probability is &gt; 50%. <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\Box\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">&#x25A1;</span></span></span></span></span></span> </p><p>So goes my argument.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>What does the argument basically establish?</p><p>The argument is supposed to be surprising, because <em>minimally consistent beliefs</em> are compatible with computable beliefs; and <em>rich hypothesis space </em>is compatible with beliefs which are computable on observations alone; yet, when combined with a belief that the speaker is honest, we get an incomputability result.</p><p>My take-away from this result is that we cannot <em>simultaneously</em> use our unrestricted ability to predict sensory observations accurately <em>and</em> have completely coherent beliefs about the world which produces those sensory observations, at least if our &quot;bridge&quot; between the sensory observations and the world includes something like language (whereby sensory observations contain complex &quot;claims&quot; about the world).</p><p>This is because using the <em>full force</em> of our ability to predict sensory experiences includes some hypotheses which <em>eventually</em> make surprising claims about the world, by incrementally computing increasingly complicated information (like a theorem prover which slowly but inevitably produces all theorems of PA). In other words, a rich sensory model contains <em>implicit information about the world</em> which we cannot immediately compute the consequences of (in terms of probabilities about the hidden variables out there in the world). This &quot;implicit&quot; information can be <em>necessarily</em> implicit, in the same way that PA is <em>necessarily</em> incomplete.</p><p>To give a non-logical example: suppose that your moment-to-moment anticipations of your relationship with a friend are pretty accurate. It might be that if you roll those anticipations forward, you inevitably become closer and closer until the friendship becomes a romance. <em>However,</em> you can&apos;t necessarily predict that right now; even though the anticipation of each next moment is relatively easy, you face a halting-problem-like difficulty if you try to anticipate what the <em>eventual</em> behavior of your relationship is. Because our ability to look ahead is bounded, each new consequence can be predictable without the overall outcome being predictable.</p><p>Thus, in order for an agent to use the full force of its computational power on predicting sensory observations, it must have <em>partial</em> hypotheses -- similar to the way <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2016/09/12/new-paper-logical-induction/\">logical induction</a> contains traders which focus only on special classes of sentences, or Vanessa&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037530a/towards-learning-incomplete-models-using-inner-prediction-markets\">incomplete Bayesianism</a> contains incomplete hypotheses which do not try to predict everything.</p><p>So, this is an argument against strict Bayesianism. In particular, it is an argument against strict Bayesianism <em>as a model of updating on filtered evidence!</em> I&apos;ll say more about this, but first, let&apos;s talk about possible holes in my argument.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Here are some concerns you might have with the argument.</p><p>One might possibly object that the perfect honesty requirement is unrealistic, and therefore conclude that the result does not apply to realistic agents.</p><ul><li>I would point out that the assumption is not so important, so long as the listener <em>can conceive of the possibility of perfect honesty, </em>and assigns it nonzero probability<em>. </em>In that case, we can consider P(X|honesty) rather than P(X). Establishing that some conditional beliefs are not computable seems similarly damning.</li><li>Furthermore, because the &quot;speaker&quot; is serving the role of our <em>observations</em>, the perfect honesty assumption is just a version of P(X|observe-X)=1. IE, <em>observing X gives us X.</em> This is true in typical filtered-evidence setups; IE, filtered evidence can be misleading, but it can&apos;t be false.</li><li>However, one might further object that <em>agents need not be able to conceive of &quot;perfect honesty&quot;, </em>because this assumption has an unrealistically aphysical, &quot;perfectly logical&quot; character. One might say that <em>all</em> observations  are imperfect; none are perfect evidence of what is observed. In doing so, we can get around my result. This has some similarity to the assertion that zero is not a valid probability. I don&apos;t find this response particularly appealing, but I also don&apos;t have a strong argument against it.</li></ul><p>Along similar lines, one might object that the result depends on an example (&quot;the speaker is enumerating theorems&quot;) which comes from logic, as opposed to any realistic physical world-model. The example does have a &quot;logical&quot; character -- we&apos;re not explicitly reasoning about evidence-filtering algorithms interfacing with an empirical world and selectively telling us some things about it. However, I want to point out that I&apos;ve assumed extremely little &quot;logic&quot; -- the only thing I use is that you don&apos;t expect a sentence and its negation to both be true. Observations corresponding to theorems of PA are just an example used to prove the result.

(See also <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CvKnhXTu9BPcdKE4W/an-untrollable-mathematician-illustrated\">the illustrated explanation</a>.)</p><p>However, it did so at a high cost: Sam&apos;s prior is <em>dumb.</em> It isn&apos;t able to perform rich Occam-style induction to divine the hidden rules of the universe. It doesn&apos;t <em>believe in</em> hidden rules; it believes &quot;if there&apos;s a law of nature constraining everything to fit into a pattern, <em>I will eventually observe that law directly</em>.&quot; It shifts its probabilities when it makes observations, but, in some sense, it doesn&apos;t shift them <em>very much</em>; and indeed, that property seems key to the computability of that prior.</p><p>So, a natural question arises: is this an <em>essential </em>property of an untrollable prior? Or can we construct a &quot;rich&quot; prior which entertains hypotheses about the deep structure of the universe, learning about them in an Occam-like way, which is nonetheless still untrollable?</p><p>The present result is a first attempt at an answer: given my (admittedly a bit odd) notion of rich hypothesis space, it is indeed impossible to craft a computable prior over logic with some minimal good properties (like believing what&apos;s proved to it). I don&apos;t directly address a trollability-type property, unfortunately; but I do think I get close to the heart of the difficulty: a &quot;deep&quot; ability to adapt in order to predict data better stands in contradiction with computability of the latent probability-of-a-sentence.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>So, how should we think about filtered evidence?</p><p>Orthodox Bayesian (OB): We can always resolve the problem by distinguishing between X and &quot;I observe X&quot;, and conditioning on <strong>all</strong> the evidence available. Look how nicely it works out in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kJiPnaQPiy4p9Eqki/what-evidence-filtered-evidence\">the Monty Hall problem and other simple examples we can write down</a>. </p><p>Skeptical Critique (SC): You&apos;re ignoring the argument. You can&apos;t handle cases where running your model forward is easier than answering questions about what happens eventually; in those cases, many of your beliefs will either be uncomputable or incoherent.</p><p>OB: That&apos;s not a problem for me. Bayesian ideals of rationality apply to the logically omniscient case. What they give you is an idealized notion of rationality, which defines the <strong>best</strong> an agent <strong>could</strong> do.</p><p>SC: Really? Surely your Bayesian perspective is supposed to have some solid implications for finite beings who are not logically omniscient. I see you giving out all this advice to machine learning programmers, statisticians, doctors, and so on.</p><p>OB: Sure. We might not be able to achieve perfect Bayesian rationality, but whenever we see something less Bayesian than it could be, we can correct it. That&apos;s how we get closer to the Bayesian ideal!</p><p>SC: That sounds like cargo-cult Bayesianism to me. If you spot an inconsistency, <strong>it matters how you correct it</strong>; you don&apos;t want to go around correcting for the planning fallacy by trying to do everything faster, right? Similarly, if your rule-of-thumb for the frequency of primes is a little off, you don&apos;t want to add composite numbers to your list of primes to fudge the numbers.</p><p>OB: No one would make those mistakes.</p><p>SC: That&apos;s because there are, in fact, rationality principles which apply. You <strong>don&apos;t</strong> just cargo-cult Bayesianism by correcting inconsistencies any old way. A boundedly rational agent has rationality constraints which apply, guiding it to better approximate &quot;ideal&quot; rationality. And those rationality constraints don&apos;t actually need to refer to the &quot;ideal&quot; rationality. <strong>The rationality constraints are about the update, not in the ideal which the update limits to.</strong></p><p>OB: Maybe we can imagine some sort of finite Bayesian reasoner, who treats logical uncertainty as a black box, and follows the evidence toward unbounded-Bayes-optimality in a bounded-Bayes-optimal way...</p><p>SC: Maybe, but I don&apos;t know of a good picture which looks like that. The picture we <strong>do</strong> have is given by logical induction: we learn to avoid Dutch books by noticing lots of Dutch books against ourselves, and gradually becoming less exploitable.</p><p>OB: That sounds a lot like the picture I gave.</p><p>SC: Sure, but it&apos;s more precise. And more importantly, it&apos;s <strong>not</strong> a Bayesian update -- there is a kind of family resemblance in the math, but it isn&apos;t learning through a Bayesian update in a strict sense.</p><p>OB: Ok, so what does all this have to do with filtered evidence? I still don&apos;t see why the way I handle that is wrong.</p><p>SC: Well, isn&apos;t the standard Bayesian answer a little suspicious? The numbers conditioning on X don&apos;t come out to what you want, so you introduce something new to condition on, observe-X, which can have different conditional probabilities. Can&apos;t you get whatever answer you want, that way?</p><p>OB: I don&apos;t think so? The numbers are dictated by the scenario. The Monty Hall problem has a right answer, which determines how you should play the game if you want to win. You can&apos;t fudge it without changing the game.</p><p>SC: Fair enough. But I still feel funny about something. Isn&apos;t there an infinite regress? We jump to updating on observe-X when X is filtered. What if observe-X is filtered? Do we jump to observe-observe-X? What if we can construct a &quot;meta Monty-Hall problem&quot; where it isn&apos;t sufficient to condition on observe-X?</p><p>OB: If you observe, you observe that you observe. And if you observe that you observe, then you must observe. So there&apos;s no difference.</p><p>SC: If you&apos;re logically perfect, sure. But a boundedly rational agent need not realize immediately that it observed X. And certainly it need not realize and update on the entire sequence &quot;X&quot;, &quot;I observed X&quot;, &quot;I observed that I observed X&quot;, and so on.</p><p>OB: Ok...</p><p>SC: To give a simple example: call a sensory impression &quot;subliminal&quot; when it is weak enough that only X is registered. A stronger impression also registers &quot;observe-X&quot;, making the sensory impression more &quot;consciously available&quot;. Then, we cannot properly track the effects of filtered evidence for subliminal impressions. Subliminal impressions would always register as if they were unfiltered evidence.</p><p>OB: ...no. </p><p>SC: What&apos;s wrong?</p><p>OB: An agent should come with a basic notion of sensory observation. If you&apos;re a human, that could be activation in the nerves running to sensory cortex. If you&apos;re a machine, it might be RBG pixel values coming from a camera. That&apos;s the only thing you ever have to condition on; all your evidence has that form. Observing a rabbit means <em>getting pixel values corresponding to a rabbit. </em>We don&apos;t start by conditioning on &quot;rabbit&quot; and then patch things by adding &quot;observe-rabbit&quot; as an additional fact. We condition on <em>the complicated observation corresponding to the rabbit</em>, which happens to, <em>by inference,</em> tell us that there is a rabbit.</p><p>SC: That&apos;s... a bit frustrating.</p><p>OB: How so?</p><p>SC: The core Bayesian doctrine is the Kolmogorov axioms, together with the rule that we update beliefs via Bayesian conditioning. A common extension of Bayesian doctrine <em>grafts on a distinction between observations and hypotheses, </em>naming some special events as observable, and others as non-observable hypotheses. I want you to <em>notice when you&apos;re using the extension rather than the core.</em></p><p>OB: How is that even an extension? It just sounds like a special case, which happens to apply to just about any organism.</p><p>SC: But you&apos;re restricting the rule &quot;update beliefs by Bayesian conditioning&quot; -- you&apos;re saying that it only works for <em>observations</em>, not for other kinds of events.</p><p>OB: Sure, but you could never update on those other kinds of events anyway.</p><p>SC: Really, though? Can&apos;t you? Some information you update on comes from sensory observations, but other information comes from <em>reasoning</em>. Something like a feedforward neural network just computes one big function on sense-data, and can probably be modeled in the way you&apos;re suggesting. But something like a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916\">memory network</a> has a nontrivial reasoning component. A Bayesian can&apos;t handle &quot;updating&quot; on internal calculations it&apos;s completed; at best they&apos;re treated as if they&apos;re black boxes whose outputs are &quot;observations&quot; again.</p><p>OB: Ok, I see you&apos;re backing me into a corner with logical uncertainty stuff again. I still feel like there should be a Bayesian way to handle it. But what does this have to do with filtered evidence?</p><p>SC: <em>The whole point of the argument we started out discussing</em> is that if you have this kind of observation/hypothesis divide, and have sufficiently rich ways of predicting sensory experiences, <em>and remain a classical Bayesian</em>, then your beliefs about the hidden information are not going to be computable, even if your hypotheses themselves are easy to compute. So we can&apos;t realistically reason about the hidden information just by Bayes-conditioning on the observables. The only way to maintain both computability and a rich hypothesis space under these conditions is to be less Bayesian, allowing for more inconsistencies in your beliefs. <em>Which means,</em> <strong>reasoning about filtered evidence doesn&apos;t reduce to applying Bayes&apos; Law</strong>.</p><p>OB: That... seems wrong.</p><p>SC: Now we&apos;re getting somewhere!</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>All that being said, reasoning about filtered evidence via Bayes&apos; Law in the orthodox way still seems quite practically compelling. The perspective SC puts forward in the above dialogue would be much more compelling if I had more practical/interesting &quot;failure-cases&quot; for Bayes&apos; Law, and more to say about alternative ways of reasoning which work better for those cases. A real &quot;meta Monty-Hall problem&quot;.</p><p>Arguably, logical induction <em>doesn&apos;t</em> use the &quot;condition on the fact that X was observed&quot; solution:</p><ul><li>Rather than the usual sequential prediction model, logical induction accommodates information coming in for any sentence, in any order. So, like the &quot;core of Bayesianism&quot; mentioned by SC, it maintains its good properties without special assumptions about what is being conditioned on. This is in contrast to, e.g., Solomonoff induction, which uses the sequential prediction model.</li><li>In particular, in Monty Hall, although there is a distinction between the sentence &quot;there is a goat behind door 3&quot; and &quot;the LI discovers, at time <em>t</em>, that there is a goat behind door 3&quot; (or suitable arithmetizations of these sentences), we can condition on the first rather than the second. A logical inductor would learn to react to this in the appropriate way, since doing otherwise would leave it Dutch-bookable.</li></ul><p>One might argue that the traders are implicitly using the standard Bayesian &quot;condition on the fact that X was observed&quot; solution in order to accomplish this. Or that the update an LI performs upon seeing X <em>is always</em> that it saw X. But to me, this feels like stretching things. The core of the Bayesian method for handling filtered evidence is to distinguish between X and the observation of X, and update on the latter. A logical inductor doesn&apos;t explicitly follow this, and indeed appears to violate it. Part of the usual idea seems to be that a Bayesian needs to &quot;update on all the evidence&quot; -- but a logical inductor just gets a black-box report of X, without any information on how X was concluded or where it came from. So information can be arbitrarily excluded, and the logical inductor will still do its best (which, in the case of Monty Hall, appears to be sufficient to learn the correct result).</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>A notable thing about the standard sort of cases, where the Bayesian way of reasoning about filtered evidence is entirely adequate, is that you have a gears-level model of what is going on -- a causal model, which you can turn the crank on. If you run such a model &quot;forward&quot; -- in causal order -- you compute the hidden causes <em>before</em> you compute the filtered evidence about them. This makes it sound as if predicting the hidden variables should be <em>easier</em> than predicting the sensory observations; and, certainly makes it hard to visualize the situation where it is much much harder.</p><p>However, even in cases where we have a nice causal model like that, inferring the hidden variables from what is observed can be intractably computationally difficult, since it requires <em>reverse-engineering</em> the computation from its outputs. <a href=\"https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/inference/sampling/\">Forward-sampling</a> causal models is always efficient; running them backwards, not so.</p><p>So even with causal models, there can be good reason to engage more directly with logical uncertainty rather than use pure Bayesian methods.</p><p>However, I suspect that one could construct a much more convincing example if one were to use partial models explicitly in the construction of the example. Perhaps something involving an &quot;outside view&quot; with strong empirical support, but lacking a known &quot;inside view&quot; (lacking a single consistent causal story).</p><p>Unfortunately, such an example escapes me at the moment.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Finally, some notes on further formalisation of my main argument.</p><p>The listener is supposed to have probabilistic beliefs of the standard variety -- an event space which is a sigma-algebra, and which has a P(event) obeying the Kolmogorov axioms. In particular, the beliefs are supposed to be perfectly logically consistent in the usual way.</p><p>However, in order to allow logical uncertainty, I&apos;m assuming that there is <em>some embedding of arithmetic;</em> call it E[]. So, for each arithmetic sentence S, there is an event E[S]. Negation gets mapped to the &quot;star&quot; of an event: E[&#xAC;S] = (E[S])*. This need not be the compliment of the event E[S]. Similarly, the embedding E[A<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\vee\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2228;</span></span></span></span></span></span>B] need not be E[A]<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\cup\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x222A;</span></span></span></span></span></span>E[B]; E[A<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\wedge\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2227;</span></span></span></span></span></span>B] need not be E[A]<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\cap\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2229;</span></span></span></span></span></span>E[B]; and so on. That&apos;s what allows for logical non-omniscience -- the probability distribution doesn&apos;t necessarily <em>know</em> that E[A<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\wedge\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2227;</span></span></span></span></span></span>B] should act like E[A]<span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\cap\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&#x2229;</span></span></span></span></span></span>E[B], and so on.</p><p>The more we impose requirements which force the embedding to <em>act like it should, </em>the more logical structure we are forcing onto the beliefs. If we impose very much consistency, however, then that would already imply uncomputability and the central result would not be interesting. So, the &quot;minimal consistency&quot; assumption requires very little of our embedding. Still, it is enough for the embedding of PA to cause trouble in connection with the other assumptions.</p><p>In addition to all this, we have a distinguished set of events which count as observations. A first pass on this is that for any event A, there is an associated event obs(A) which is the observation of A. But I do worry that this includes more observation events than we want to require. Some events A do not correspond to sentences; sigma-algebras are closed under countable unions. If we think of the observation events as <em>claims made by the speaker</em>, it doesn&apos;t make sense to imagine the speaker claiming a countable union of sentences (particularly not the union of an uncomputable collection).</p><p>So, more conservatively, we might say that for events E[S], that is <em>events in the image of the embedding</em>, we also have an event obs(E[S]). In any case, this is closer to the minimal thing we need to establish the result.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if the argument works out exactly as I sketched; it&apos;s possible that the rich hypothesis assumption needs to be &quot;and also positive weight on a particular enumeration&quot;. Given that, we can argue: take one such enumeration; as we continue getting observations consistent with that observation, the hypothesis which predicts it loses no weight, and hypotheses which (eventually) predict other things must (eventually) lose weight; so, the updated probability eventually believes that particular enumeration will continue with probability &gt; 1/2.</p><p>On the other hand, that patched definition is certainly less nice. Perhaps there is a better route.</p>",

Two constraints we&#x2019;ll talk about here:</p><ul><li>Compute - flops, memory, etc.</li><li>Information - sensors, data, etc.</li></ul><p>Thanks to ongoing technology changes, both of these constraints are becoming more and more slack over time - compute and information are both increasingly abundant and cheap.</p><p>Immediate question: what happens in the limit as the prices of both compute and information go to zero?</p><p>Essentially, we get omniscience: our software has access to a perfect, microscopically-detailed model of the real world. Computers have the memory and processing capability to run arbitrary queries on that model, and predictions are near-perfectly accurate (modulo quantum noise). This limit applies even without AGI - as compute and information become more abundant, our software approaches omniscience, even limiting ourselves to special-purpose reasoning algorithms.</p><p>Of course, AGI would presumably be closer to omniscience than non-AGI algorithms, at the same level of compute/information. It would be able to more accurately predict more things which aren&#x2019;t directly observable via available sensors, and it would be able to run larger queries with the same amount of compute. (<em>How much</em> closer to omniscience an AGI would get is an open question, but it would at least not be any worse in a big-O sense.)</p><p>Next question: as compute and information constraints slacken, which constraints become taut? What new bottlenecks appear, for problems which were previously bottlenecked on compute/information?</p><p>To put it differently: if our software can run arbitrary queries on an accurate, arbitrarily precise low-level model of the physical world, what else do we need in order to get value out of that capability?</p><p>Well, mainly we need some way to specify what it is that we want. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/xEFeCwk3pdYdeG2rL/p/hyShz2ABiKX56j5tJ\">We need an interface</a>.</p><p>Our highly accurate low-level world model can tell us anything about the physical world, but the things-we-want are generally more abstract than molecules/atoms/fields. Our software can have arbitrarily precise knowledge and predictive power on physical observables, but it still won&#x2019;t have any notion that air-pressure-oscillations which sound like the word &#x201C;cat&#x201D; have something to do with the organs/cells/biomolecules which comprise a cat. It won&#x2019;t have built-in any notion of &#x201C;tree&#x201D; or &#x201C;rock&#x201D; or &#x201C;human&#x201D; - using such high-level abstractions would only impede predictive power, when we could instead model the individual components of such high-level objects.</p><p>It&#x2019;s the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/xEFeCwk3pdYdeG2rL/p/hyShz2ABiKX56j5tJ\">prototypical interface problem</a>: the structure of a high-precision world-model generally does not match the structure of what-humans-want, or the structure of human abstractions in general. Someone/something has to translate between the structures in order to produce anything useful.</p><p>As I see it, this is the central problem of alignment.</p><h2>Some Approaches</h2><p><strong>Default: Humans Translate</strong></p><p>Without some scalable way to build high-level world models out of low-level world models, we constantly need to manually translate things-humans-want into low-level specifications. It&#x2019;s an intellectual-labor-intensive and error-prone process; writing programs in assembly code is not just an analogy but an example. Even today&#x2019;s &#x201C;high-level programming languages&#x201D; are much more structurally similar to assembly code than to human world-models - Python has no notion of &#x201C;oak tree&#x201D;.</p><p>An analogy: translating high-level structure into low-level specification the way we do today is like translating English into Korean by hand.</p><p><strong>Humans Translate Using Better Tools</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s plausible (though I find it unlikely) that we could tackle the problem by building better tools to help humans translate from high-level to low-level - something like much-higher-level programming languages. I find it unlikely because we&#x2019;d probably need major theoretical breakthroughs - for instance, how do I formally define &#x201C;tree&#x201D; in terms of low-level observables? Even if we had ways to do that, they&#x2019;d probably enable easier strategies than building better programming languages.</p><p>Analogy: it&#x2019;s like translating by hand from English to Korean, but with the assistance of a dictionary, spell-checker, grammar-checker, etc. But if we had an English-Korean dictionary, we&apos;d probably be most of the way to automated translation anyway (in this respect, the analogy is imperfect).</p><p><strong>Examples + Interpolation</strong></p><p>Another path which is plausible (though I find it unlikely) is something like programming-by-example - not unlike today&#x2019;s ML. This seems unlikely to work from both an inside and outside view:</p><ul><li>Inside view: the whole problem in the first place is that low-level structure doesn&#x2019;t match high-level structure, so there&#x2019;s no reason to expect software systems to interpolate along human-intuitive dimensions.</li><li>Outside view: programming-by-example (and today&#x2019;s ML with it) is notoriously unreliable.</li></ul><p>Examples alone aren&#x2019;t enough to make software reliably carve reality at the same joints as humans. There probably are <em>some</em> architectures which would reliably carve at the same joints as humans - different humans tend to chunk the world into similar objects, after all. But figuring out such an architecture would take more than just throwing lots of data at the problem.</p><p>To put it differently: the way-in-which-we-want-things-translated is itself something which needs to be translated. A human&#x2019;s idea-of-what-constitutes-a-&#x201C;good&#x201D;-low-level-specification-of-&#x201C;oak tree&#x201D; is itself pretty high-level and abstract; that idea itself needs to be translated into a low-level specification before it can be used. If we&#x2019;re trying to use examples+interpolation, then the interpolation algorithm is our &#x201C;specification&#x201D; of how-to-translate&#x2026; and it probably isn&#x2019;t a very good translation of our actual high-level idea of how-to-translate.</p><p>Analogy: it&#x2019;s like teaching English to Korean speakers by pointing to trees and saying &#x201C;tree&#x201D;, pointing to cars and saying &#x201C;car&#x201D;, etc&#x2026; <em>except</em> that none of them actually realize they&#x2019;re supposed to be learning another language. The Korean-language instructions they received were not actually a translation of the English explanation &#x201C;learn the language that person is speaking&#x201D;.</p><p><strong>Incentives</strong></p><p>A small tweak to the previous approach: train a reinforcement learner.</p><p>The analogy: rather than giving our Korean-speakers some random Korean-language instructions, we don&apos;t give them any instructions - we just let them try things, and then pay them when they happen to translate things from English to Korean.</p><p>Problem: this requires some way to check that the translation was correct. Knowing what to incentivize is not any easier than specifying what-we-want to begin with. Rather than translating English-to-Korean, we&#x2019;re translating English-to-incentives.</p><p>Now, there is a lot of room here for clever tricks. What if we verify the translation by having one group translate English-to-Korean, another group translate back, and reward both when the result matches the original? Or taking the Korean translation, giving it to some other Korean speaker, and seeing what they do? Etc. These are possible approaches to translating English into incentives, within the context of the analogy.</p><p>It&#x2019;s possible in principle that translating what-humans-want into incentives is easier than translating into low-level specifications directly. However, if that&#x2019;s the case, I have yet to see compelling evidence - attempts to specify incentives seem plagued by the same surprising corner cases and long tail of difficult translations as other strategies.</p><p><strong>AI Translates</strong></p><p>This brings us to the obvious general answer: have the AI handle the translation from high-level structure to low-level structure. This is probably what will happen eventually, but the previous examples should make it clear why it&#x2019;s hard: an explanation of how-to-translate must itself be translated. In order to make an AI which translates high-level things-humans-want into low-level specifications, we first need a low-level specification of the high-level concept &#x201C;translate high-level things-humans-want into low-level specifications&#x201D;.</p><p>Continuing the earlier analogy: we&#x2019;re trying to teach English to a Korean speaker, but that Korean speaker doesn&#x2019;t have any idea that they&#x2019;re supposed to be learning another language. In order to get them to learn English, we first need to somehow translate something like &#x201C;please learn this language&#x201D;.</p><p>This is a significant reduction of the problem: rather than translating everything by hand all the time, we just need to translate the one phrase &#x201C;please learn this language&#x201D;, and then the hard part is done and we can just use lots of examples for the rest.</p><p>But we do have a chicken-and-egg problem: somehow, we need to properly translate that first phrase. Screw up that first translation, and nothing else will work. That part cannot be outsourced; the AI cannot handle the translation because it has no idea that that&#x2019;s what we want it to do.</p>",

Given that, I think it's good practice to have a public record of the bets I've made and their outcomes, when available.</p>\n<p>I'll try to keep this updated going forward, if I continue to make bets. (But only on my original blog, I won't copy the edits over to LW.) Currently I'm down £72.46 with one win and one loss.</p>\n<p>(This has nothing to do with the <a href=\"http://reasonableapproximation.net/2018/06/02/matched-betting.html\">matched betting</a> that I previously wrote about. There I was earning money from sign-up bonuses. Here I'm trying to earn money by being better at predicting the future than other people.)</p>\n<p>In order of date I made the bet:</p>\n<h3>Undecided: NO on Trump leaving before the end of his first term.</h3>\n<p>I placed this bet on 20-Oct-2019, on <a href=\"https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/politics/market/1.129133401\">Betfair</a>, after a friend said on Facebook that the odds seemed very favorable to him. The odds at the time were 1.3, giving an implied probability of ((1.3 - 1) / 1.3 = 30%) that he'd leave. I bet £50 against this, giving me £15 profit if he doesn't. (Minus commission, so £14.25.) As of 19-Mar-2020 the odds are 1.12, for an implied probability of 11% that he'll leave. (I could cash out now, taking my £50 back immediately and £7.56 minus commission when the market closes<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wmvSBRJ3AD4AyzwHE-1\" id=\"fnref-wmvSBRJ3AD4AyzwHE-1\">[1]</a></sup>. I'm not inclined to do that.)</p>\n<h3>I lost: NO on a large increase in working from home.</h3>\n<p>LessWrong user Liron <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/7XTnz7S77hRzLbpDA/programmers-should-plan-for-lower-pay#comment-SuFjevs6QmcDHQaWN\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also bet more than 50% chance that within 3 years at least one of {Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon} will give more than 50% of their software engineers the ability to work from home for at least 80% of their workdays.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I took him up on this for $100 each. We confirmed on 02-Jan-2020. I don't think I'd heard the term \"coronavirus\" at the time.</p>\n<p>This cost me $100 (£92.69 over Paypal, which I think included £2.99 transaction fee). But I got a bunch of LW karma for it. Swings and roundabouts.</p>\n<h3>Undecided: YES on someone contracting Covid-19.</h3>\n<p>In a Telegram group chat I'm in, I bet another member €30 each that at least one person in the chat would contract Covid-19 by 28-Feb-2021. (We made the bet on 28-Feb-2020.)</p>\n<p>I wasn't confident of winning at the time, and I'm still not. Confirmed infection rates are lower than I'd anticipated - for example, Hubei has had just over 0.1% of its population confirmed as having had the disease at one point, and Italy just over 0.05%.</p>\n<p>I think an ambiguous result is more likely than I used to, because people who get mild cases of the disease often aren't tested.</p>\n<h3>I won: DECLINE in Trump's odds of being re-elected.</h3>\n<p>On 04-Mar-2020, I noticed that the betting markets' odds on Trump's re-election had gone up since Covid-19 became a thing. (According to <a href=\"https://electionbettingodds.com/President2020.html\">Election Betting Odds</a>, rising from about 40% mid-november to about 56% at the time.) At the time, the number of officially diagnosed cases in the US was very small. I predicted that as the official number rose, and as it became more widely known that the CDC and FDA had <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-links-speculation-open-thread/\">basically fucked up</a>, the odds would drop again.</p>\n<p>The obvious objection was: \"if you can predict that happening, so can anyone. Why haven't the odds changed already?\" I didn't have an answer for that, but the stock markets had seemed to react slowly to the news<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wmvSBRJ3AD4AyzwHE-2\" id=\"fnref-wmvSBRJ3AD4AyzwHE-2\">[2]</a></sup> so maybe it would happen here too. (And the next obvious objection was: \"oh, so you're expecting the same thing to work <em>twice in a row</em>?\" I didn't have an answer for that either.)</p>\n<p>Less obvious objections that I realized/someone pointed out after I'd made the bet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bush's popularity rose after 9/11.</li>\n<li>Covid-19 seems to play very nicely into Trump's anti-immigrant, anti-globalist narrative.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In any case, I went ahead. Again on <a href=\"https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/politics/market/1.128151441\">Betfair</a>, I bet £100 against Trump at odds of 1.76. The odds started to drop pretty soon after that. Two weeks later, on 18-Mar-2020, I cashed out (by betting £110.26 for Trump at odds of 2.1, but actually by pressing the \"cash out\" button). I've claimed my initial £100 back, and no matter who wins I'll earn £21.29. (£20.23 after commission, but nothing if the market is voided.)</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-wmvSBRJ3AD4AyzwHE-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>I can't take any profit now, because if he gets assassinated the market is void. <a href=\"#fnref-wmvSBRJ3AD4AyzwHE-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-wmvSBRJ3AD4AyzwHE-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This didn't do me any good.

So she caught a domestic flight from Toronto to Vancouver, then boarded a flight to London. &#x201C;When she arrived at Heathrow [airport] and authorities asked her, &#x2018;Have you been to Toronto,&#x2019; she said no and walked right through.&#x201D;</em></blockquote><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8P9MZv3.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:88%\"></figure></span><br><p>A policy that allows people to travel from an infected area to to an uninfected area is not a travel ban. It&apos;s containment theater. A real travel ban would be grounding <em>all</em> international flights and stopping passenger trains and boats until the disease had been eradicated or at least very well contained, as well as <em>aggressively</em> tracking down and contact tracing people who slipped through before the lockdown, for example using <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183716/coronavirus-covid-19-israel-natanyahu-cellphone-data-tracking\">cellphone data from intelligence agencies</a>. A key point here is that mopping up a small number of cases that slip through is in fact possible.</p><p>It would have been expensive to do all this, but the cost of not doing it is that the developed world is now on lockdown, the stock markets have fallen by around 33% and we have about 10,000 deaths at the time of writing. And we have ended up <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/14/21179822/trump-coronavirus-uk-travel-restrictions-ban\">implementing the travel bans anyway</a>!</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E9mhGlX.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:72%\"></figure></span><br><p><strong>#Don&apos;tFlattenTheCurve</strong></p><p>The optimal strategy to defeat the disease is currently the subject of much debate. Several strategies have emerged, and a popular meme right now is #flattenthecurve. The idea of flattening the curve is that if we increase the <em>duration</em> of the pandemic, the number of people infected <em>at any one time</em> will be lower and our ability to treat people properly will be increased. People put a lot of time into creating convincing memes and diagrams showing how this works:</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/reddit.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:91%\"></figure></span><br><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/flatten-the-curve.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:75%\"></figure></span><br><p>Unfortunately people didn&apos;t put much effort into getting the numbers right. Every single one of these diagrams is a steaming pile of nonsense because the line for &quot;Healthcare System Capacity&quot; is about 20-50 times too high, which was first <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727\">pointed out by Joshua Bach</a>. That tiny red line right next to the x-axis is our health system capacity:</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Y2sXm61.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:73%\"></figure></span><br><p>(<a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">taken from The Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team&apos;s latest report</a> ). </p><p> The UK government&apos;s &quot;herd immunity&quot; strategy was another possible way forward, but the government reversed course on this when they realized it would involve at least a few hundred thousand deaths.</p><br><p><strong>Contain and Eradicate</strong></p><p>In my opinion, the correct strategy to beat covid-19 whilst minimizing losses from this point forward is a contain-and-eradicate strategy. The <a href=\"https://necsi.edu/review-of-ferguson-et-al-impact-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions\">New England Complex Systems Institute&apos;s writeup</a> on this, written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb of Black Swan fame outlines the strategy:</p><blockquote> <em>Since lockdowns result in exponentially decreasing numbers of cases, a comparatively short amount of time can be sufficient to achieve pathogen extinction, after which relaxing restrictions can be done without resurgence. ...</em><br> </blockquote><blockquote><em>Finally, the use of geographic boundaries and travel restrictions allows for effective and comparatively low cost imposition and relaxation of interventions. Such a multi-scale approach accelerates response efforts, reduces social impacts, allows for relaxing restrictions in areas earlier that are less affected, enables uninfected areas to assist in response in the ares that are infected, and is a much more practical and effective way to stop otherwise devastating outbreaks. ...</em><br> </blockquote><blockquote><em>A few other issues are of importance: They ignore the possibility of superspreader events in gatherings by not including the fat tail distribution of contagion in their model. This leads them to deny the importance of banning them, which has been shown to be incorrect, including in South Korea. Cutting the fat tail of the infection distribution is critical to reducing R0.&#xA0;</em><br> </blockquote><p>Basically: </p><p> - Close borders and limit internal travel, lockdown and hygiene to drive R0 below 1</p><p> -  Ban large events to cut off the <a href=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html\">long tail of the R0 distribution</a></p><p> - Use aggressive testing and contact tracing to clean up any remaining holdouts, and eradicate the virus on a region-by-region and country-by-country level. </p><p> - &quot;Green&quot; regions can return to mostly normal life, albeit without large events and travel. That means that people can go back to work and we can reverse the economic damage.</p><p>Contain-and-eradicate probably results in both less loss of life and less economic damage than any other strategy, and we can see this as a consequence of <u>taking an exponential process and fighting it in the low orders of magnitude rather than the high ones</u>. Flatten-The-Curve is bad because a flat curve that lasts for a long time is still, in log-terms, almost at the maximum power of the virus and therefore it can do huge amounts of damage. Herd-Immunity and Deliberate-Infection are bad for the same reason. The only other sensible plan I have seen is the idea of rushing a vaccine as quickly as possible, but that is beyond my expertise.</p><br><p><strong>Travel bans and restrictions during a pandemic</strong></p><p>Why do borders need to be closed now when the virus is already everywhere? Because there is still uncertainty about where the virus is and in what numbers. The virus wins when people with different amounts of virus mix, because areas of high virus can spread to areas of low virus whilst the reverse process doesn&apos;t work. </p><p>Similarly, if you were certain about who had the virus, this would almost be trivial because all the infected could be moved to containment facilities and everyone else could get on with running the economy. </p><p><u>The virus wants to maximize entropy</u> (virus spread everywhere), humanity wants to minimize it (all virus in one place), for a given total amount of virus. </p><p><u>The need for borders is a result of this combination of uncertainty and mixing being bad</u>. And as Taleb points out in the NECSI review, travel bans and restrictions during a pandemic should be multilevel. </p><p>As we approach the &quot;endgame&quot; where testing is ubiquitous and virus numbers get closer to 0, borders become more important, because adding 500 cases to an area with 1 case is <em>much</em> worse than adding 2000 cases to an area with 1000 cases (you have to think in logarithms). </p><p>Though even when numbers are high, closing borders is still useful and we should still do it; principally because the decision to close can lag behind rapidly developing facts on the ground, or worse the decision to close borders to a particular area could leak, at which point people start actively helping the virus to spread as they flee from the soon-to-be locked down area. Of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/leaked-coronavirus-plan-to-quarantine-16m-sparks-chaos-in-italy\">nobody would be stupid enough to leak that information</a>, right?</p><br><p><strong>What if we do Mitigation instead?</strong></p><p>If we do go down the mitigation path - letting most people get the disease - there are some important &quot;dice rolls&quot; that will determine how it goes:</p><ul><li>The rate of long-term complications amongst covid-19 survivors, </li><li>The rate at which young &amp; otherwise healthy people die when hospital treatment is denied due to overcrowding</li><li>Whether new pharmaceuticals like Chloroquine and Remdesivir are both effective and scalable, and how quickly covid-19 evolves resistance to them </li><li>Whether summer weather substantially slows the spread</li><li>Whether covid-19 picks up a mutation that makes it less lethal, or more lethal</li></ul><br><p><strong>A Test of Rationality</strong></p><p>When competent Muggles make decisions, they&apos;re usually very empirical about it. They build a chair with one leg, it falls over, and then they don&apos;t do that again. </p><p>Covid-19&apos;s exponential dynamics, asymptomatic carriers and long lag time between infection and death punished the try-it-and-see approach very hard. </p><p>By the time it became absolutely obvious to people who build one-legged chairs that this was a <em>big deal</em> and needed attention, the virus had increased both its numbers and distribution most of the way to its goal of infecting every human being on the planet. </p><p>Covid-19 was a rationality test as well as a competence test. China failed on rationality but passed on competence. The West failed hard on rationality and is on course for a F+ on competence as well. Vox and the other mainstream media who either <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/13/21128209/coronavirus-fears-contagion-how-infection-spreads\">mocked those who took it seriously</a> early, or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121358/coronavirus-racism-social-media-east-asian-chinese-xenophobia\">got on a soapbox talking about racism</a> (which is bad, but was not even remotely the most important thing at that time) should take a reputational hit. The various government agencies that dithered throughout February should be investigated, particularly in the USA.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\">",

Is testing someone for a fever a useful diagnostic in isolation, without the other parts of their operational workflows, i.e. reverse GPS tracking for contact tracing?</p><p>If so, it may be useful to research or brainstorm methods of taking a person&apos;s temperature that do not require an actual thermometer.  Thermometers appear to be in short supply on Amazon, but it looks like you&apos;d have no trouble getting one on eBay.  That said, there maybe not be enough thermometers in stock to implement a testing program where every single place of business has one (or more) to test all of their employees and customers.</p><p>My first idea was to use a smartphone camera and attempt to extract some signal from that, but it turns out that not only do many smartphone cameras come with infrared filters to improve image quality, even those that don&apos;t still aren&apos;t capable of detecting thermal IR.</p><p>Can anyone think of any other plausible side-channels by which you might estimate a person&apos;s body temperature within sufficient tolerances?</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Why is abstraction useful? Why use a high-level model rather than a low-level model?</p><p>An example: when I type &#x201C;4+3&#x201D; in a python shell, I think of that as adding two numbers, not as a bunch of continuous voltages driving electric fields and current flows in little patches of metal and doped silicon. Why? Because, if I&#x2019;m thinking about what will show up on my monitor after I type &#x201C;4+3&#x201D; and hit enter, then the exact voltages and current flows on the CPU are not relevant. This remains true even if I&#x2019;m thinking about the voltages driving individual pixels in my monitor - even at a fairly low level, the exact voltages in the arithmetic-logic unit on the CPU aren&#x2019;t relevant to anything more than a few microns away - <em>except</em> for the high-level information contained in the &#x201C;numbers&#x201D; passed in and out.</p><p>Another example: if I&#x2019;m an astronomer predicting the trajectory of the sun, then I&#x2019;m presumably going to treat other stars as point-masses. At such long distances, the exact mass distribution within the star doesn&#x2019;t really matter - <em>except</em> for the high-level information contained in the total mass and center-of-mass location.</p><p>If I&#x2019;m running a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, then I take sample points fairly far apart in &#x201C;time&#x201D;. As long as they&#x2019;re far enough apart, they&#x2019;re roughly independent - there isn&#x2019;t <em>any</em> information from one sample relevant to the next.</p><p>If I&#x2019;m planning a roadtrip from San Francisco to Los Angeles, the details of my route through the Bay Area are irrelevant to planning my route within LA - <em>except</em> for the high-level information contained in my choice of highway for the middle leg of the trip and the rough time I expect to get there.</p><p>General point: abstraction, in practice, is about keeping information which is relevant to things &#x201C;far away&#x201D;, and throwing out everything else.</p><h2>Formalization</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s start with a bunch of random variables <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

Key subtlety: which information is relevant may itself depend on the values of other variables - e.g. maybe we have a conditional in a program which picks one of two variables to return. Should we keep around all information which is relevant in any possible case? All information which is relevant after averaging over some variables?</p><p>Looking back over the examples, I think the natural answer is: we&#x2019;re keeping information relevant to things &#x201C;far away&#x201D; (i.e. variables not in <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"s_i\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>), so those are what we&#x2019;re interested in.

They sent me a 50-page PDF which contained no information on any practical steps to establish or test the currency, but a lot of musings on rising inequality and the will of the people.

    "htmlBody": "<p>Update 19/03/20: Inspired by johnswentworth&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/w49gTfuQEZxRDS6jM/covid-19-cabin-secondary-attack-rates-on-diamond-princess?commentId=W5thdiRuXHMS8TBuT\">comment</a>, I implemented a multinomial distribution on the 4-berth cabin result. Taking this additional information into account the model shows reduced likelihood of secondary attack rates of &gt;0.9.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Jimrandomh recently <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QdfD3bbMYAbCLv4aB/covid-19-s-household-secondary-attack-rate-is-unknown\">showed</a> how we have no real idea about the household secondary attack rates of COVID-19.</p><p>The Diamond Princess <a href=\"https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e/9417-covid-dp-fe-02.html\">data</a> showed that the proportion of passengers infected with COVID-19 increased with cabin occupancy. </p><p>It occurred to me that this data could be used to infer the cabin secondary attack rates.</p><h2>Data</h2><p>I eyeballed the data in figure 2 in the report linked above.</p><p>There were 6 COVID-19 cases in single passenger cabins which looks like ~8% infection rate so there were ~75 passengers in single cabins.</p><p>For double cabins the numbers are 485/2425 = 20%.</p><p>For triple cabins 27/129 = 21%.</p><p>For 4-berth 18/60 = 30%.</p><p>(all numbers are per person, rather than per cabin)</p><p>These numbers add up to 2,689 total passengers which is slightly more than 2,646 actually included but this is close as eyeballing is likely to get me.</p><h2>Method</h2><p>I implemented a model with 2 variables:</p><p>1. The background rate of infection without sharing a cabin (just from being on the ship).</p><p>2. An additional rate of infection for each infected person an individual shared a cabin with.</p><p>Given those two variables I was able to create predicted infection rates for each size of cabin by calculating the probability of the number of initial cases in a cabin (before secondary attack) and then the probability of each result after applying secondary attacks. </p><p>I created 2 models, one where I only included secondary attack and another where the victim of the secondary attack could in turn cause a tertiary attack on any remaining healthy members of the cabin. Tertiary attack may not have been possible (or somewhat suppressed) by the quarantine and/or other factors.</p><p>Importantly the secondary attack rate as used by me here is &#x201C;probability of contracting COVID-19 for each person in the cabin who had COVID-19&#x201D;. So if you live with 2 infected people then you have a higher probability of contracting than if you just lived with 1. In 4-berth cabins having even one person infected gives a high probability of at least one of the remaining people being infected at which point the other 2 have a higher chance (when allowing for tertiary attack). </p><p>Even with a relatively low attack rate per person, it ends up being likely that many people in a 4-berth cabin will end up infected. For instance with a 0.3 secondary attack rate there is a &gt;30% chance of all 4 people getting it from a single incoming case. A 0.5 secondary attack rate brings this up to &gt;70% chance</p><p>These models were used to create likelihoods for the results actually witnessed via a binomial distribution.</p><p>As this model isn&#x2019;t computationally expensive I just brute-force calculated the likelihood over a number of possible values of the 2 variables. I then integrated across the background rate to give the likelihood function of the secondary attack rate.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>The likelihoods of the secondary attack rates for the two models are shown in the figure below. I&#x2019;ve also included a combined likelihood based on equal confidence in both models.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1584627279/blog%20posts/SecondaryAttack2.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:85%\"></figure></span><p>And on a log axis:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1584627284/blog%20posts/SecondaryAttackLog2.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:86%\"></figure></span><p>This is slightly frustrating &#x2013; there is a large range of secondary attack rates which fit the data adequately. </p><p>The most noticeable thing is that a very low secondary attack rate appears to be ruled out. Only 7% of the likelihood is below 0.15 and 3% below 0.1. This goes against the results from the papers analysed in jimrandomh&apos;s post (0.1 and 0.15)</p><p>The large range of possible values is caused in large part by the relatively small sample size for all except 2-berth cabins.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>There are some potential confounders here, for instance 2-berth cabins are probably mainly couples whereas 4 berth are relatively more likely to include children. I don&apos;t expect these effects to be very large (couples and their children will all have close contact) but hopefully someone will point out any potential larger confounders in the comments if there are any. </p><p>It is also not certain that cabin secondary attack rates convert directly to household secondary attack rates although my personal expectation is that they wouldn&apos;t be too far off.</p><p>Most of these secondary attack values are very bad news for larger households. Plenty of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9GyKccaJdLEbdhyTi/a-significant-portion-of-covid-19-transmission-is\">presymptomatic transmission</a> means that if one person gets it then at least one more person will likely get it before anyone is aware that they have. So if someone does become symptomatic then isolating from each other is likely to be as important as being careful around the patient.</p><p>Isolating from each other when no-one has symptoms is likely a very costly exercise as it would need to be maintained for months but the bigger the household the more benefit is to be gained from taking care.</p><p>My impression from looking at the virus growth rate data from various countries is that massively improving hygiene and implementing social distancing can increase the doubling time by a factor of 2 (I hope to write this up in the coming days). If it can similarly halve secondary attack rate then this could be hugely important in large households to prevent a single case infecting the entire house.</p><p>Note that as jimrandomh said, leaving a household with a sick patient in order to avoid contracting COVID-19 is a bad idea.</p><blockquote>If people tried to move out when their housemates got sick, they wouldn&apos;t lower their own risk much, but they would spread it wherever they moved to. </blockquote><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Cabin secondary attack rates of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess were not able to be confirmed precisely. It is unlikely that the rate was very low (&lt;0.2) and as a result additional infections are likely, especially in larger cabins.</p><p>If this can be extrapolated to households then particularly larger households may struggle to prevent additional infections after the first household member is infected.</p>",

This includes the infamous\nMonad, the unknown Applicative, and the subject of this post: <code>Functor</code>.\nBut before detailing the latter, let's refresh our definition of a\nHaskell typeclass.</p>\n<h2>What's a typeclass?</h2>\n<p>One of Haskell's selling points is its strong type system. We might\neven say the focus on functional purity stems from the want for\npowerful type systems. Now, using strong types in a naive way creates\nmassive redundancy: each function would have to be implemented for all the\ndifferent types it works on. Of course, there will be some implementation to\nbe done -- but the less the better.</p>\n<p>Here, genericity comes to the rescue. We use generic types instead of concrete ones\nto write functions only once -- for the generic type. But this\nbrings another set of problems: with completely generic types, we can't do\nanything. That's because a type tells us what we can do with its values: you can\nask if an int is even or odd, but that doesn't make sense for a bool or a float.\nFor example, a function of type</p>\n<pre><code>f :: a -&gt; a\n</code></pre>\n<p>can only be the identity function. Why? Because I don't know anything about\nvalues of type <code>a</code>. Notably, I don't know how to build one. So when I need\nto return a value of type <code>a</code>, and I got one in input, my only option is\nto give it back.</p>\n<p>Typeclasses are a clean way to constrain genericity, so that we can implement\nnon trivial functions on generic types. Formally, a typeclass is defined\nby a set of functions:</p>\n<pre><code>class OurTypeclass a where\n  f1 :: a -&gt; [a]\n  f2 :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool\n</code></pre>\n<p>An instance of this typeclass for a concrete type is an implementation of these\nfunctions.</p>\n<pre><code>instance OurTypeclass Bool where\n  f1 x = [x]\n  f2 x y = x\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then this instance gives us the ability to call <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code> on values\nof type <code>Bool</code>. Which means we can define a generic function on any type with\nan instance of <code>OurTypeclass</code>, and use <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code> in this function.</p>\n<pre><code>f :: (OurTypeclass a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; [a]\nf x y = filter (f2 y) (f1 x)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The more types with instances of <code>OurTypeclass</code>, the most useful\nthe abstraction becomes.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of typeclasses is that instances satsify certain laws.\nWhen I say require, the laws are not actually checked at compile-time,\nsince they tend to be undecidable in Haskell's type system. Instead,\nthese laws are promises to Haskell programmers using the generic type.\nSince programmers write code assuming these promises, instances breaking\nthe laws of their typeclass possibly break any code using this typeclass.\nSo don't do that. Winners don't break typeclass laws.</p>\n<p>And lastly, typeclasses generally have a minimal implementation. That is,\nthere is a subset of functions such that all others can be defined in\nterms of them. So when writing an instance, you only have to implement\na set of minimal functions. That being said, you can still reimplement the\nothers; it is mostly done for optimization reasons.</p>\n<p>That's it for the typeclass primer. What's left is the one commandment of\ntypeclasses, stressed over and over in every resource that I scoured: <strong>laws before\n<a href=\"https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/\">burritos</a></strong>.\nOr more seriously, <strong>laws before intuitions</strong>. Because it's natural to look\nfor intuitions on what a typeclass captures. Even more\nwhen confronted with a weird one like Monad. But by limiting ourselves to these intuitions,\nwe build our understanding on shaky grounds.</p>\n<p>Every time I see monads (or other Haskell concepts) explained through intuition\nalone, I think about Terry Tao's\n<a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/\">three stages of mathematical education</a>:\npre-rigorous, rigorous, and post-rigorous.\nIn summary, we first learn about mathematical concepts\nin a fuzzy and informal way (the pre-rigorous stage); then we go into the formal\ndetails, and rebuild everything from the ground up (the rigorous stage); and finally\nwe can gloss over most details most of the time, since we can stop at any time\nand unwrap everything (the post-rigorous stage).\nLearning intuitions without looking at the functions and laws of\na typeclass amounts to stagnating at the pre-rigorous stage of Haskell education. And\nsince I aim for post-rigorous mastery, the only way is the rigorous path.</p>\n<h1>A first look at Functor</h1>\n<p>My primary source for <code>Functor</code> is the amazing\n<a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia\">Typeclassopedia</a>, and more\nspecifically its <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#%60Functor%60\">first section</a>.\nI'll tell whenever I turn to other references.</p>\n<h2>Form and functions</h2>\n<pre><code>class Functor f where\n  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n\n  (&lt;$) :: a        -&gt; f b -&gt; f a\n  (&lt;$) = fmap . const\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, one subtlety I struggled with: instances of <code>Functor</code> are\nfunctions on types. That is, a type that takes\nanother type and gives a concrete type. A simple example is the list type\n<code>[]</code>: <code>[] a</code> is actually equivalent to <code>[a]</code>. Thus <code>[]</code> has an instance of\n<code>Functor</code>, but not <code>[Bool]</code>.</p>\n<p>Technically, this means that the kind (the \"type of a type\") of a <code>Functor</code>\nis <code>* -&gt; *</code>, where <code>*</code> is the kind of a concrete datatype like <code>Bool</code> or even\n<code>[a]</code>.</p>\n<p>Carrying on, the meat of this class is the <code>fmap</code> function. Indeed, it constitutes a minimal\ndefinition of <code>Functor</code>: the other function <code>(&lt;$)</code> follows by default from\nthe definition of <code>fmap</code>. As a first step, let's look at the type of <code>fmap</code></p>\n<pre><code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n</code></pre>\n<p>So <code>fmap</code> takes a function of type <code>a -&gt; b</code>, a value of type <code>f a</code>, and returns\na value of type <code>f b</code>. We get a transformation from one type to another, an element\nof our functor applied to the first type, and must transform it into an element of\nour functor applied to the second type.\nIf you're able to write such a function for your type <code>f</code>, then you have a <code>Functor</code>.</p>\n<p>The other function is just a specialization of <code>fmap</code> when the transformation is\nconstant. So instead of giving a function, we just give an element of the return\ntype of the function for <code>fmap</code>. (Also notice the parentheses, telling us\nthis function use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation\">infix notation</a>,\nlike the + operator).</p>\n<pre><code>(&lt;$) :: a -&gt; f b -&gt; f a\n</code></pre>\n<p>What confused me at first is that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are reversed\ncompared to <code>fmap</code>. But that's only the consequence of Haskell's naming\nconvention for types: the first type variable of kind * is named <code>a</code>,\nthe second <code>b</code>, the third <code>c</code>... If I break this convention and use the\nsame names than for <code>fmap</code>, I get a type fitting the description above:</p>\n<pre><code>(&lt;$) :: b -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I mentioned, <code>(&lt;$)</code> has a default implementation in terms of <code>fmap</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>(&lt;$) = fmap . const\n</code></pre>\n<p>And given that the only reason to rewrite a default implementation, and\nthat all the work is done by <code>fmap</code>, I see no reason for ever writing\nan explicit <code>(&lt;$)</code>. That said, I'll be pretty interested by an counter-example\nif one exists.</p>\n<p>Finally for the functions, there are utility functions defined on <code>Functor</code> instances.\nTheses cannot be reimplemented, as they are not part of the typeclass.</p>\n<pre><code>(&lt;$&gt;) :: Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n(&lt;&amp;&gt;) :: Functor f =&gt; f a -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f b\n($&gt;) ::  Functor f =&gt; f a -&gt; b -&gt; f b\nvoid :: Functor f =&gt; f a -&gt; f ()\n</code></pre>\n<p>These are not that interesting: <code>(&lt;$&gt;)</code> is the infix version of <code>fmap</code>,\n<code>(&lt;&amp;&gt;)</code> and <code>($&gt;)</code> are respectively the flipped versions of <code>(&lt;$&gt;)</code> and <code>(&lt;$)</code>,\nand <code>void</code> just replaces the inside of a functor by the unit value <code>()</code> from\nthe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_type\">unit type</a>.</p>\n<h2>Lawful Functor</h2>\n<p>I lied when I said that any function of type <code>(a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code> gives\nan acceptable <code>fmap</code>, and an acceptable instance of <code>Functor</code>. In fact, <code>Functor</code>\ninstances must follow the laws:</p>\n<pre><code>fmap id = id\nfmap (g . f) = (fmap g) . (fmap f)\n</code></pre>\n<p>As mentioned above, these laws are not enforced by GHC. My first instinct\nwas that they were undecidable. After all, function equality is undecidable.\nBut after looking a bit more into the matter, the only thing I'm sure of is\nthat GHC can't do it. On the other hand, adding flavors of dependent types\nto the mix allow semi-automatic verification of these laws. Although you and I\nwill probably never use these, or at least not in the near future.</p>\n<p>So, these laws are not checked at compile-time. And breaking them doesn't (in general)\ncreate runtime panics and exceptions. Nonetheless, they matter: they\ncapture what you can <strong>expect</strong> from a <code>Functor</code> instance. That is to say, programmers\nusing your type as a <code>Functor</code> (through <code>fmap</code> mostly) will expect it to satisfy these\nlaws. And their code might behave incorrectly if these assumptions\ndon't hold.</p>\n<p>Going back to the laws, they clarify a little more what a <code>Functor</code>\nis. The first one,</p>\n<pre><code>fmap id = id\n</code></pre>\n<p>says that when passing the identity function to <code>fmap</code>, it does nothing. This\nfits the intuition that a <code>Functor</code> is some sort of container, a structure\nwith values of type <code>a</code> inside. And <code>fmap</code> can only touch these values,\nnot the structure itself.</p>\n<p>Let's look at the example: <code>map</code>, the instance of <code>fmap</code> for lists. It applies the function\nto every element of the list, but doesn't change the number of elements, or\ntheir position.</p>\n<p>As for the second law, it constrains <code>Functor</code>s even more towards containers:</p>\n<pre><code>fmap (g . f) = (fmap g) . (fmap f)\n</code></pre>\n<p>When applying a function <code>f</code> through <code>fmap</code> and then a function <code>g</code> through\n<code>fmap</code>, that must be equivalent to applying the composition <code>g . f</code> through\n<code>fmap</code>.</p>\n<p>This also holds for <code>map</code>, since applying <code>f</code> then <code>g</code> to each element\nis the same as applying <code>g . f</code> to each element.</p>\n<h2>Examples and anti-examples</h2>\n<p>When I learn a definition, I like to get both examples and anti-examples (examples\nnot satisfying the definition). That gives me an outline of the concept from the inside\n(what it requires) and from the outside (what it forbids).</p>\n<p>Let's start with the instance for list, which I already mentioned:</p>\n<pre><code>instance Functor [] where\n  fmap = map\n</code></pre>\n<p>As explained above, this instance satisfies the <code>Functor</code> laws. Can we write\none that doesn't? That's pretty easy.</p>\n<pre><code>instance Functor [] where\n  fmap f l = []\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>instance Functor [] where\n  fmap f [] = []\n  fmap f x:xs = (fmap f xs)++[f x]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, these two instances break both laws. Can we break one and not the other?\nWe'll see later that the second law follows from the first law; so we can't break\nthe second without breaking the first. But can we break the first without\nbreaking the second?</p>\n<p>If the second law is true, then</p>\n<pre><code>fmap (g . id) = (fmap g) . (fmap id)\nfmap g = (fmap g) . (fmap id)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code>fmap (id . g) = (fmap id) . (fmap g)\nfmap g = (fmap id) . (fmap g)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This entails that <code>fmap id</code> acts like the identity on elements of <code>f a</code>\nor <code>f b</code> depending on the side. I think this means that the second law\nimplies the first law, but it's slightly tricky. This is because not\nall functions of type <code>f a -&gt; f b</code> are representable as <code>fmap g</code> for\nsome <code>g :: a -&gt; b</code>. For example, the function applying <code>g</code> on each\nelement of a list and reversing the list is not representable by an\napplication of <code>fmap</code>. So <code>fmap g = (fmap g) . (fmap id)</code> is not\nequivalent to <code>h = h . (fmap id)</code>, and similarly for the other direction.</p>\n<p>Thus I think the second law implies the first law, but I would appreciate\nany clean proof or counter-example.</p>\n<p>Another <code>Functor</code> is <code>Maybe</code>. The canonical instance is</p>\n<pre><code>instance Functor Maybe where\n  fmap f Nothing = Nothing\n  fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here too, we can write blatantly false instances.</p>\n<pre><code>instance Functor Maybe where\n  fmap f x = Nothing\n</code></pre>\n<p>and... that's it actually. I just realized while coming up with examples\nthat <code>Maybe</code> only has this bad <code>Functor</code> instance. Because with <code>Nothing</code>,\nyou can only return <code>Nothing</code> (nothing to apply <code>f</code> on), and with <code>Just x</code>,\nthe only way to get a value of type <code>b</code> from it is by applying <code>f</code>.\nThe other option being returning <code>Nothing</code>.</p>\n<p>The intuition behind the <code>fmap</code> for <code>Maybe</code> is that it applies the function\nwhen there is something, and it keeps <code>Nothing</code> when there isn't. Pretty\nstraightforward.</p>\n<p>One last example: <code>Either</code>. The thing that disturbed me with <code>Either</code> is\nthat its kind is actually <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, because it takes the type\nof the <code>Left</code> (the error type) and the type of the <code>Right</code> (the result type).\nWhich means that for getting a <code>Functor</code>, we need to provide the first parameter\n(the error type).</p>\n<pre><code>instance Functor (Either e) where\n  fmap f (Left e) = (Left e)\n  fmap f (Right x) = (Right f x)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>fmap</code> for <code>Either</code> acts like the one for <code>Maybe</code>, except that it keeps\nthe error if there was one before.\nHere, there are no false instance, because we cannot change what\nwe do to <code>Right x</code>, and we have no way of building a value of type <code>e</code>.</p>\n<p>You might have noticed that all the examples I gave have lawful instances of <code>Functor</code>.\nIs this always the case? No: one type without a <code>Functor</code> instance is the following.</p>\n<pre><code>data Type a = Type (a -&gt; Bool)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Why? Because there is no way to build a value of <code>b -&gt; Bool</code> from\na value of <code>a -&gt; Bool</code> and a value of <code>a -&gt; b</code>. The last two types\nare not composable, so we're screwed.</p>\n<p>How do we distinguish types with a <code>Functor</code> and types without?\nGlad you asked; let's go down the first rabbit hole.</p>\n<h1>Down the rabbit holes</h1>\n<h2>Existence: covariance and contravariance</h2>\n<p>The example above, of a type without a <code>Functor</code>, I did not find myself.\nInstead, after failing to find such an example, I asked Google and found\nit on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16118414/an-example-of-a-type-with-kind-which-cannot-be-an-instance-of-functor\">stack overflow</a>.\nI convinced myself that it has no implementation for <code>fmap</code>. But what is the\nunderlying reason? How am I supposed to know if a given type has a <code>Functor</code> instance?</p>\n<p>Apparently, types with a <code>Functor</code> instance must be covariant according\nto their type parameter. And our counter-example above is contravariant,\nwhich means it has no <code>Functor</code>. So that's just two new words. What do they\nmean? When is a type covariant according to a type parameter, and what does\nit means concretely?</p>\n<p>First, there is a typeclass with the contravariant equivalent of <code>fmap</code></p>\n<pre><code>class Contravariant f where\n  contramap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f b -&gt; f a\n  (&gt;$) :: b -&gt; f b -&gt; f a\n  (&gt;$) = contramap . const\n</code></pre>\n<p>And <code>Type</code> above has an instance of <code>Contravariant</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>instance Contravariant Type where\n  contramap f (Type g) = Type (g . f)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The difference is that the function given to contramap goes the other\nway. And from a function <code>a -&gt; Bool</code> and a function <code>b -&gt; a</code>, composition\ngives a function <code>b -&gt; Bool</code>.</p>\n<p>The only way to have both an instance of <code>Functor</code> and of <code>Contravariant</code> is for\nthe type parameter to be phantom, that is to say useless:</p>\n<pre><code>data Useless a = Useless\n\ninstance Functor Useless where\n  fmap _ Useless = Useless\n\ninstance Contravariant Useless where\n  contramap _ Useless = Useless\n</code></pre>\n<p>And some types have neither an instance of <code>Functor</code> nor one of <code>Contravariant</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>data Nope a = Nope (a -&gt; a)\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we have four cases. Looking around, it seems the type parameter can be\nin one of four relations with the type itself, which entails in which case\nit lies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if <code>a</code> is covariant, then it has a <code>Functor</code> instance and no <code>Contravariant</code> instance.</li>\n<li>if <code>a</code> is contravariant, then it has no <code>Functor</code> instance and a <code>Contravariant</code> instance.</li>\n<li>if <code>a</code> is bivariant, then it has no <code>Functor</code> instance and no <code>Contravariant</code> instance.</li>\n<li>if <code>a</code> is invariant, then it has both a <code>Functor</code> instance and a <code>Contravariant</code> instance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That still does not answer my question about the meaning of covariant and contravariant.\nFor that, the best source I found, surprisingly, was the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)\">wikipedia page</a>.</p>\n<p>Basically, what matters is the relation between subtypes of the type parameters,\nand subtypes of the full type. The most interesting example is the function (at\nleast in a purely functional context like Haskell). Let's say I have a function <code>f</code>\nof type <code>a -&gt; b</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are fixed types. What are the subtypes\nof <code>a -&gt; b</code>? That is, what are the types of objects with which I can replace\n<code>f</code>, and still have correct types?</p>\n<p>Well, <code>f</code> takes a value of type <code>a</code>. This means that when I use it in\nmy code, I will pass to it a value of this type. Now assume I have a\ntype <code>A</code> that is a supertype of <code>a</code>. For example, <code>A</code> is a generic\ntype and <code>a</code> is one of its concrete types. In Haskell, <code>A</code> would be\nthe generic type associated with a typeclass for which <code>a</code> has an instance.\nThen I can replace <code>f</code> by a function of type <code>A -&gt; b</code>, and the program will\nstill compile. On the other hand, if <code>a</code> is a generic type associated with\na typeclass, and, let's say <code>Bool</code> has an instance of this typeclass,\nI cannot replace <code>f</code> by a function of type <code>Bool -&gt; b</code>. Because the\nuse of <code>f</code> entails that it can receive any value of type <code>a</code>,\nnot just values from <code>Bool</code>.</p>\n<p>This whole reasoning is reversed for <code>b</code>: because <code>f</code> returns a value\nof <code>b</code>, my program will expect something of this type. Which means\nthat if we want to change the return type, then it must be a subtype\nof <code>b</code>, not a supertype.</p>\n<p>Why do we care? Well, because this gives us the definition of covariant\nand contravariant. A subtype of <code>a -&gt; b</code> returns a subtype of <code>b</code>: both\nthe type parameter and the full type vary in the same direction. We say\nthat <code>a -&gt; b</code> is covariant in <code>b</code>. Whereas a subtype of <code>a -&gt; b</code>\ntakes a supertype of <code>a</code>; this means, you guessed it, that <code>a -&gt; b</code>\nis contravariant in <code>a</code>.</p>\n<p>This gives us a way to check, given a type and its type parameter, whether\nthe former is covariant/contravariant/bivariant/invariant in the latter. For\nfunctions, which are pretty much the only place where contravariant positions\nhappens, the wikipedia page gives a rule of thumbs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a position is covariant if it is on the left side of an even number of arrows applying to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Easy, no? Well, it took me a discussion with a colleague expert in type theory\nto realize I misread this. It does not say \"if it is on the left side of\nan even number of arrows\", but \"if it is on the left side of an even number\nof arrows <strong>applying to it</strong>\". Why the fuss? Because this type</p>\n<pre><code>data Tricky a = Tricky (a -&gt; (Bool -&gt; Int))\n</code></pre>\n<p>has an even number of arrows on the right of <code>a</code>, but it is contravariant in <code>a</code>.\nThis is because the last arrow doesn't apply to <code>a</code> -- it is on the other side\nof the principal arrow, the root of the binary tree capturing the type expression.\nOn the other hand, the type</p>\n<pre><code>data NotTricky a = NotTricky ((a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Int)\n</code></pre>\n<p>is covariant in <code>a</code></p>\n<pre><code>instance Functor NotTricky where\n  fmap f (NotTricky h) = (\\g -&gt; h (g . f))\n</code></pre>\n<p>Because from a <code>a -&gt; b</code> and a <code>b -&gt; Bool</code>, I can build a <code>a -&gt; Bool</code>.\nAnd giving that to <code>((a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Int)</code>, I get a <code>Int</code>. So from\n<code>f:: a -&gt; b</code> and an element of <code>NotTricky a</code>, I can build an element of\n<code>NotTricky b</code>.</p>\n<p>So, caveat aside, we have a rule for computing whether a type is covariant\nor contravariant, or both or neither, in a type parameter. That's almost\nwhat I was looking for. What is still missing is an understanding of\nwhy <code>fmap</code> requires a type that is covariant in its type parameter. I mean,\nI can check for the examples, like I did above. But I did not find a general\nexplanation.</p>\n<p>Yet this is enough for my purpose. That being said, if someone has such\na reference or explanation, I'll gladly take it.</p>\n<h2>Unicity: Free Theorems!</h2>\n<p>Once settled, somewhat, the question of whether a <code>Functor</code> exists for\na given type, a natural follow-up is whether there are multiple instances\nfor this type. As a matter of fact, there is only one instance of <code>Functor</code>\n(satisfying the laws) per type. I read that in the Typeclassopedia,\nbut when I followed the links...\nlet's just say that Haskell is full of rabbit holes.</p>\n<p>The proof of the unicity of <code>Functor</code> instances follows from the free theorem for\nthe type of <code>fmap</code>. What is a free theorem? Well... here goes the rabbit hole.\nThe opening in the earth is this\n<a href=\"https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/tor/papers/wadler.pdf\">paper</a> by Wadler,\ntitled \"Theorems for free!\". In it, he shows\nthat given a polymorphic type, we can deduce a theorem for all values of this\ntype. That is, just from the type, we can deduce things about any instance of it.</p>\n<p>Remember when I said that the only function of type <code>a -&gt; a</code> is the identity? That\nactually follows from the free theorem for <code>a -&gt; a</code> : if <code>f :: a -&gt; a</code>, then\nforall <code>g</code>, we have <code>g . f = f . g</code>. The only <code>f</code> satisfying this property is\nthe identity function (with the usual caveat that only the input/output behavior\nmatters here, so we work up to isomorphism).</p>\n<p>So the free theorem gives a property that  any function of this type must satisfy.\nThe way we show the unicity of the <code>Functor</code> instance is by assuming the existence\nof one instance satisfying the functor laws. Let's <code>fmap</code> be the function\ndefined for this instance. Then, if we have\n<code>foo :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code> satisfying the functor laws for our type, we\nuse the free theorem on <code>foo</code>. It is: for <code>f,g,h,k</code> such that <code>g . k = h . f</code></p>\n<pre><code>fmap g . foo k = foo h . fmap f\n</code></pre>\n<p>Free theorems show their powers when specialized. Here, we can choose\n<code>g = h</code> and <code>f = k = id</code>, which maintains the condition <code>g . k = g = f = h . f</code>.\nThen the free theorem specializes into</p>\n<pre><code>fmap g . foo id = foo g . fmap id\n</code></pre>\n<p>which by the first law of functors (satisfied by both <code>fmap</code> and <code>foo</code>) gives us:</p>\n<pre><code>fmap g = foo g\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is, foo has exactly the same input output behavior than <code>fmap</code>.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/second_functor_law.md\">similar reasoning</a>\ncan also be used to show that <code>fmap</code> only has to satisfy the first law\n-- the second law follows from the first and the free theorem for <code>fmap</code>.</p>\n<p>All of this is actually fascinating, but I don't want to get into the derivations\nof free theorems in this post. First because it is already long enough; and second\nbecause free theorems deserve a post of their own.</p>\n<h2>Automation: Deriving Functor Instances</h2>\n<p>The nice thing about having only one instance of <code>Functor</code>, if it exists,\nis that we can derive it automatically: the\n<a href=\"https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#extension-Derive%60Functor%60\">Derive<code>Functor</code> extension</a>\nof GHC does exactly that.</p>\n<p>Although the page I linked is quite thorough, I didn't find much to learn in it.\nAlmost all of it seems to talk about when a <code>Functor</code> instance cannot be derived...\nthat is when the type is contravariant or bivariant in its\nlast type parameter. So apparently, GHC\ncannot derive a <code>Functor</code> instance iff there is no such instance. That's pretty\ncool.</p>\n<h1>Different perspectives</h1>\n<p>Now that we did our homework on the technical details, we can go through some\ncommon intuitions about <code>Functor</code>. I think we deserved it.</p>\n<h2>Is it a container? Is it a context? No, it's a Functor!</h2>\n<p>First, there are two \"obvious\" interpretation of a <code>Functor</code> in Haskell:\nas a container, and as a context.</p>\n<p>Although most <code>Functor</code>s can be thought\nas either, some works really well as one or the other. For example, lists\nare very natural containers. A list is a sequence of values, and applying\nsomething on this container translate into applying it to its values.\nOn the other hand, <code>Either</code> works well as a context. It captures\nwhether everything is alright, or whether an error happened.</p>\n<p>Most examples I have in mind fit in one of these categories. But that's\nnot the case of all functors:</p>\n<pre><code>data SomeType a = SomeType (Bool -&gt; a)\n</code></pre>\n<p>represents neither a container of values of type <code>a</code>, nor a context\nin which <code>a</code> is embedded. It is more of a producer of <code>a</code>. And I\ndon't even have an intuition like that for the weirder function\ntypes where a is covariant, like <code>(a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Int</code>.</p>\n<p>Let that remind us that intuitions only go so far.</p>\n<h2>Going to the next level</h2>\n<p>Another perspective on <code>Functor</code> appears if we change parentheses slightly:</p>\n<pre><code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (f a -&gt; f b)\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is, instead of seeing <code>fmap</code> as taking a function and a functor, and returning\na transformed functor, we can see it as taking a function and returning it\non the functors of the types. The jargon for this is a lift. From discussions\nwith my friends about Haskell, and category theory, and types, I know there's\na lot coming on the topic of <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/Lifting\">lifts</a>. But for\nnow, it's only a nice new perspective on <code>Functor</code>.</p>\n<h2>Category Theory is watching you</h2>\n<p>Finally, let's address the elephant in the room: the name <code>Functor</code> comes\nfrom category theory. And yet, I did not mention it during this post.\nRight now, I'm not sure what it teaches me. I mean, I get that functors\nare mapping from one category to another, and that they maintain identity\nand composition in the same way that the <code>Functor</code> laws do.\nI even get that a Haskell <code>Functor</code> is a functor on the category\nHask of Haskell types (with some subtleties).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I cannot see, for now, a use for this understanding. I'll\nkeep searching, but I think that the connection brings fruits only\nfor concepts more complex than mere functors.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, going deeper into typeclasses made me think about\nthe links between Haskell and category theory. I feel that the implementation\nof powerful typeclasses is akin to the effort in category theory for finding\nthe right category and transformations to do the job. Then in one case you\nhave a short generic program, and in the other you have a small generic diagram.\nAnd in both cases, when you want to understand exactly what is happening,\nyou need to go down into the nitty gritty details hidden behind the cute\nabstractions: instances in Haskell and the meaning of objects and arrows in\ncategory theory.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>There sure are a lot of things to dig in Haskell!\nI came in pretty sure that I knew what <code>Functor</code> was, and I still learned\na lot.</p>\n</body></html>",

This is particularly exacerbated when the environment contains multiple agents: for goals that benefit from having more resources, it is objectively bad for you if a different agent seizes your resources, and objectively good for you if you seize other agents&apos; resources.</p><p>Based on this intuitive (but certainly not ironclad) argument, we get the <strong>Catastrophic Convergence Conjecture (CCC)</strong>: &quot;Unaligned goals tend to have catastrophe-inducing optimal policies because of power-seeking incentives&quot;.</p><p>Let&apos;s now consider a <em>conceptual</em> version of <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/yEa7kwoMpsBgaBCgb/towards-a-new-impact-measure\">Attainable Utility Preservation (AUP)</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/0c5eeec28f75/alignment-newsletter-25\">AN #25</a></strong>): the agent optimizes a primary (possibly unaligned) goal, but is penalized for changing its &quot;power&quot; (in the intuitive sense). Intuitively, such an agent no longer has power-seeking incentives, and so (by the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition\">contrapositive</a></strong> of the CCC) it will not have a catastrophe-inducing optimal policy -- exactly what we want! This conceptual version of AUP also avoids thorny problems such as ontology identification and butterfly effects, because the agent need only reason about its own beliefs, rather than having to reason directly about the external world.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> This was my favorite part of the sequence, as it explains the conceptual case for AUP clearly and concisely. I especially liked the CCC: I believe that we should be primarily aiming to prevent an AI system &quot;intentionally&quot; causing catastrophe, while not attempting to guarantee an absence of &quot;accidental&quot; mistakes (<strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZeE7EKHTFMBs8eMxn/clarifying-ai-alignment\">1</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/b6dc636f6a1b/alignment-newsletter-33\">AN #33</a></strong>), <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/E2aZ9Xwdz3i2ghPtn/techniques-for-optimizing-worst-case-performance\">2</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/768a8130013f/alignment-newsletter-43\">AN #43</a></strong>)), and the CCC is one way of cashing out this intuition. It&apos;s a more crisp version of the idea that <strong><a href=\"https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf\">convergent instrumental subgoals</a></strong> are in some sense the &quot;source&quot; of AI accident risk, and if we can avoid instrumental subgoals we will probably have solved AI safety.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW\">Reframing Impact - Part 3</a></strong> <em>(Alex Turner)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The final section of the sequence turns to an actual implementation of AUP, and deals with problems in how the implementation deviates from the conceptual version of AUP. We measure power by considering a set of auxiliary rewards, and measuring the change in attainable utilities of this auxiliary set as impact, and penalizing the agent for that. The first post presents some empirical results, many of which <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mDTded2Dn7BKRBEPX/penalizing-impact-via-attainable-utility-preservation\">we&apos;ve covered before</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/036ba834bcaf/alignment-newsletter-39\">AN #39</a></strong>), but I wanted to note the new results on <strong><a href=\"https://www.partnershiponai.org/safelife/\">SafeLife</a></strong> (summarized below). On the high-dimensional world of SafeLife, the authors train a VAE to find a good latent representation, and choose a single linear reward function on the latent representation as their auxiliary reward function: it turns out this is enough to avoid side effects in at least some cases of SafeLife.</p><p>We then look at some improvements that can be made to the original AUP implementation. First, according to CCC, we only need to penalize <em>power</em>, not <em>impact</em>: as a result we can just penalize <em>increases</em> in attainable utilities, rather than both increases and decreases as in the original version. Second, the auxiliary set of rewards only provides a <em>proxy</em> for impact / power, which an optimal agent could game (for example, by <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mdQEraEZQLg7jtozn/subagents-and-impact-measures-full-and-fully-illustrated\">creating subagents</a></strong>, summarized below). So instead, we can penalize increases in attainable utility for the <em>primary</em> goal, rather than using auxiliary rewards. There are some other improvements that I won&apos;t go into here.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think the plan &quot;ensure that the AI systems we build don&apos;t seek power&quot; is pretty reasonable and plausibly will be an important part of AI alignment. However, the implementation of AUP is trying to do this under the threat model of optimal agents with potentially unaligned primary goals. I think this is probably going to do something quite different from the conceptual version of AUP, because impact (as defined in this sequence) occurs only when the agent&apos;s beliefs <em>change</em>, which doesn&apos;t happen for optimal agents in deterministic environments. The current implementation of AUP tries to get around this using proxies for power (but these can be gamed) or by defining &quot;dumber&quot; beliefs against which power is measured (but this fails to leverage the AI system&apos;s understanding of the world). See <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wAAvP8RG6EwzCvHJy/reasons-for-excitement-about-impact-of-impact-measure?commentId=s48grPhMbuBEXNtyc\">this comment</a></strong> for more details.</p><p>Note that the author himself is more <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/7CdoznhJaLEKHwvJW/p/wAAvP8RG6EwzCvHJy\">excited</a></strong> about AUP as deconfusion, rather than as a solution to AI alignment, though he is more optimistic about the implementation of AUP than I am.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mdQEraEZQLg7jtozn/subagents-and-impact-measures-full-and-fully-illustrated\">Subagents and impact measures, full and fully illustrated</a></strong> <em>(Stuart Armstrong)</em> (summarized by Flo): Impact measures reduce the reward an agent <strong>A</strong> receives for reaching a state <strong>s</strong> by the distance between <strong>s</strong> and some baseline state <strong>s&apos;</strong>. This article clarifies the interaction of <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/sYjCeZTwA84pHkhBJ/attainable-utility-has-a-subagent-problem\">impact measures and subagents</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/598f425b1533/an-86-improving-debate-and-factored-cognition-through-human-experiments\">AN #86</a></strong>).</p><p>In the <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mDTded2Dn7BKRBEPX/penalizing-impact-via-attainable-utility-preservation\">attainable utility framework</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/036ba834bcaf/alignment-newsletter-39\">AN #39</a></strong>) the distance metric measures changes in <strong>A</strong>&apos;s power, its ability to optimize a set of auxiliary rewards <strong>R</strong>, relative to doing nothing. This means that <strong>A</strong> is never penalized for doing nothing. Thus, if <strong>A</strong> manages to construct a subagent <strong>SA</strong> without getting penalized for that, <strong>A</strong> can just stop doing anything afterwards without getting a penalty, no matter what <strong>SA</strong> does. </p><p>For the <em>stepwise inaction baseline</em>, where <strong>s&apos;</strong> is the state that <strong>A</strong> would have reached had it done nothing in the last time step, <strong>A</strong> can completely avoid the penalty by building an <strong>SA</strong> that commits to balance out the change in <strong>A</strong>&apos;s ability to optimize the auxiliary reward <strong>R</strong> if <strong>A</strong> decided to optimize <strong>R</strong>, but instead becomes an optimizer for <strong>A</strong>&apos;s real reward when <strong>A</strong> does nothing in the next step. </p><p>For the <em>inaction baseline</em>, where <strong>s&apos;</strong> is the state reached if <strong>A</strong> had not done anything for the whole episode, it gets more complicated. When only gains in power are penalized, <strong>SA</strong> has to be built such that it does not cause a significant increase in <strong>R</strong>, even if <strong>A</strong> decided to optimize for <strong>R</strong> later on. If <strong>SA</strong> is constructed in a way such that <strong>A</strong> cannot control its behaviour after some time has passed, the penalty <strong>A</strong> receives for the construction only depends on the <em>actual</em> effect of <strong>SA</strong> on <strong>R</strong>. This is a lot weaker than the original penalty, which was about the <em>possible</em> effects of <strong>A</strong>&apos;s actions on <strong>R</strong>. </p><p>In the case where decreases in power are also penalized, <strong>A</strong> needs to make sure that building <strong>SA</strong> does not reduce its ability to optimize <strong>R</strong>. This is not always possible without <strong>A</strong> retaining some control over <strong>SA</strong>, but giving up control was only necessary to prevent the construction of <strong>SA</strong> from increasing <strong>A</strong>&apos;s potential to optimize <strong>R</strong>. It seems like it is often possible for <strong>A</strong> to finetune the amount of control it retains over <strong>SA</strong> such that <strong>A</strong>&apos;s ability to optimize <strong>R</strong> barely changes while <strong>SA</strong> is able to do things <strong>A</strong> could not do unpenalized. </p><p>In the most extreme example, <strong>A</strong> boxes itself into <strong>SA</strong> and does nothing in reality, but is counterfactually able to intervene on <strong>SA</strong>&apos;s policy. If <strong>A</strong> is able to cleverly put constraints on its own future actions in other ways, no subagents are needed to avoid the penalty. While other impact penalties like <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186\">relative reachability</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/d1a19c140226/alignment-newsletter-10\">AN #10</a></strong>) do allow for subagents to be constructed, they do not undermine the penalty for these.</p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> The article contains many useful examples in a grid world and I recommend reading it for a deeper understanding of the problem. The main problem with the attainable utility penalty seems to be the definition of power. While this has proven to be quite useful in simple examples, it seems like agents in more complex environments would be able to disentangle their ability to optimize their own reward and the auxiliary rewards, for example by essentially committing to never optimize the auxiliary rewards beyond a certain threshold. Such an agent would still look very powerful from the outside and I don&apos;t see why power-reducing commitments would diminish the agent&apos;s incentive to take away power from others. So while the <strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/w6BtMqKRLxG9bNLMr/the-catastrophic-convergence-conjecture\">catastrophic convergence conjecture</a></strong>, which states that unaligned goals tend to lead to catastrophic optimal policies because of power-seeking incentives, still rings true, it seems like we need to look at power from our perspective instead of the agent&apos;s.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I agree with Flo above: the issue is that AUP is measuring a proxy for our intuitive notion of power that falls apart under adversarial optimization. In particular, while it is normally reasonable to measure power by looking at the ability to optimize a set of auxiliary reward functions, this characterization no longer works when the agent can ensure that it won&apos;t be able to optimize those specific rewards, while still being able to optimize its primary reward. Subagents are a particularly clean way of demonstrating the problem.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.partnershiponai.org/safelife/\">Introducing SafeLife: Safety Benchmarks for Reinforcement Learning</a></strong> <em>(Carroll Wainwright et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): So far, techniques to avoid negative side effects have only been tested on <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186\">simple</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/d1a19c140226/alignment-newsletter-10\">AN #10</a></strong>) <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mDTded2Dn7BKRBEPX/penalizing-impact-via-attainable-utility-preservation\">gridworlds</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/036ba834bcaf/alignment-newsletter-39\">AN #39</a></strong>) <strong><a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/02/11/learning_preferences/\">or</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/35b451cb4d70/alignment-newsletter-45\">AN #45</a></strong>) <strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wzPzPmAsG3BwrBrwy/test-cases-for-impact-regularisation-methods\">hypotheticals</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/35b451cb4d70/alignment-newsletter-45\">AN #45</a></strong>). SafeLife aims to provide a high-dimensional environment in which negative side effects are likely. It is based on Conway&apos;s Game of Life, which allows for complex effects arising out of relatively simple rules. An agent is given the ability to move, create life in an adjacent cell, or destroy life in an adjacent cell. With the specified reward function, the agent must build desired patterns, remove undesired patterns, and navigate to the exit.</p><p>The challenge comes when there are additional &quot;neutral&quot; patterns in the environment. In this case, we want the agent to leave those patterns alone, and not disrupt them, even if doing so would allow it to complete the main task faster. The post shows several examples of agents attempting these levels. Vanilla RL agents don&apos;t avoid side effects at all, and so unsurprisingly they do quite badly. An agent with a naive impact measure that simply says to preserve the initial state can correctly solve levels where all of the &quot;neutral&quot; patterns are static, but has much more trouble when the existing patterns are dynamic (i.e. they oscillate over time).</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01217\">Paper: SafeLife 1.0: Exploring Side Effects in Complex Environments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I am a big fan of benchmarks; they seem to be a prerequisite to making a lot of quantitative progress (as opposed to more conceptual progress, which seems more possible to do without benchmarks). This benchmark seems particularly nice to me because the &quot;side effects&quot; which need to be avoided haven&apos;t been handcoded into the benchmark, but instead arise from some simple rules that produce complex effects.</p><h1>TECHNICAL AI ALIGNMENT </h1><h2>HANDLING GROUPS OF AGENTS </h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11174\">TanksWorld: A Multi-Agent Environment for AI Safety Research</a></strong> <em>(Corban G. Rivera et al)</em> (summarized by Asya): This paper presents TanksWorld, a simulation environment that attempts to illustrate three important aspects of real-world AI safety challenges: competing performance objectives, human-machine learning, and multi-agent competition. TanksWorld consists of two teams of N vs. N tanks. Tanks move and shoot while navigating in a closed arena with obstacles. Tanks are rewarded for killing opponent tanks and penalized for killing neutral and allied tanks according to a specified reward function. Each tank is controlled by either its own AI or a special policy meant to mimic a &apos;human&apos; teammate. Each individual tank can only see a small portion of its environment, and must communicate with other teammates to gain more information. The following parameters can be varied to emphasize different research challenges:</p><p>- The communication range between tanks -- meant to represent environmental uncertainty.</p><p>- The number of neutral tanks and obstacles -- meant to represent the extent to which tanks must care about &apos;safety&apos;, i.e. avoid collateral damage.</p><p>- The control policies of teammates -- meant to represent the variability of human-machine teams.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> I am generally excited about more work on demonstrating safety challenges; I think it helps to seed and grow the field in concrete directions. I am particularly excited about the possibility for TanksWorld to demonstrate multi-agent safety problems with agents in direct competition. I feel unsure about whether TanksWorld will be a good demonstration of general problems with human-machine interaction-- intuitively, that seems to me like it would be very difficult to capture and require more complex real-world modeling.</p><h2>FORECASTING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YgNYA6pj2hPSDQiTE/distinguishing-definitions-of-takeoff\">Distinguishing definitions of takeoff</a></strong> <em>(Matthew Barnett)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post lists and explains several different &quot;types&quot; of AI takeoff that people talk about. Rather than summarize all the definitions (which would only be slightly shorter than the post itself), I&apos;ll try to name the main axes that definitions vary on (but as a result this is less of a summary and more of an analysis):</p><p>1. <em>Locality</em>. It could be the case that a single AI project far outpaces the rest of the world (e.g. via recursive self-improvement), or that there will never be extreme variations amongst AI projects across all tasks, in which case the &quot;cognitive effort&quot; will be distributed across multiple actors. This roughly corresponds to the Yudkowsky-Hanson FOOM debate, and the latter position also seems to be that taken by <strong><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reframing/\">CAIS</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/b649f32b07da/alignment-newsletter-40\">AN #40</a></strong>).</p><p>2. <em>Wall clock time</em>. In <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742\">Superintelligence</a></strong>, takeoffs are defined based on how long it takes for a human-level AI system to become strongly superintelligent, with &quot;slow&quot; being decades to centuries, and &quot;fast&quot; being minutes to days.</p><p>3. <em>GDP trend extrapolation</em>. Here, a continuation of an exponential trend would mean there is no takeoff (even if we some day get superintelligent AI), a hyperbolic trend where the doubling time of GDP decreases in a relatively continuous / gradual manner counts as continuous / gradual / slow takeoff, and a curve which shows a discontinuity would be a discontinuous / hard takeoff.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I found this post useful for clarifying exactly which axes of takeoff people disagree about, and also for introducing me to some notions of takeoff I hadn&apos;t seen before (though I haven&apos;t summarized them here).</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5WECpYABCT62TJrhY/will-ai-undergo-discontinuous-progress\">Will AI undergo discontinuous progress?</a></strong> <em>(Sammy Martin)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post argues that the debate over takeoff speeds is over a smaller issue than you might otherwise think: people seem to be arguing for either discontinuous progress, or continuous but fast progress. Both camps agree that once AI reaches human-level intelligence, progress will be extremely rapid; the disagreement is primarily about whether there is already quite a lot of progress <em>before</em> that point. As a result, these differences don&apos;t constitute a &quot;shift in arguments on AI safety&quot;, as some have claimed.</p><p>The post also goes through some of the arguments and claims that people have made in the past, which I&apos;m not going to summarize here.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> While I agree that the debate about takeoff speeds is primarily about the path by which we get to powerful AI systems, that seems like a pretty important question to me with <strong><a href=\"https://alignmentforum.org/posts/mJ5oNYnkYrd4sD5uE/clarifying-some-key-hypotheses-in-ai-alignment\">many ramifications</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/4a1b3c4249ae/an-62are-adversarial-examples-caused-by-real-but-imperceptible-features\">AN #62</a></strong>).</p><h1>OTHER PROGRESS IN AI </h1><h2>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12499\">On Catastrophic Interference in Atari 2600 Games</a></strong> <em>(William Fedus, Dibya Ghosh et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): One common worry with deep learning is the possibility of <em>catastrophic interference</em>: as the model uses gradients to learn a new behaviour, those same gradients cause it to forget past behaviours. In model-free deep RL, this would be particularly harmful in long, sequential tasks as in hard exploration problems like Montezuma&#x2019;s Revenge: after the model learns how to do the first few subtasks, as it is trying to learn the next subtask, it would &#x201C;forget&#x201D; the first subtasks, degrading performance. The authors set out to test this hypothesis.</p><p>If this hypothesis were true, there would be an easy way to improve performance: once you have learned to perform the first subtask, just create a brand new neural net for the next subtask, so that training for this next subtask doesn&#x2019;t interfere with past learning. Since the new agent has no information about what happened in the past, and must just &#x201C;pick up&#x201D; from wherever the previous agent left off, it is called the Memento agent (a reference to the movie of the same name). One can then solve the entire task by executing each agent in sequence.</p><p>In practice, they train an agent until its reward plateaus. They train a new Memento agent starting from the states that the previous agent reached, and note that it reliably makes further progress in hard exploration games like Montezuma&#x2019;s Revenge, and not in &#x201C;steady-state&#x201D; games like Pong (where you wouldn&#x2019;t expect as much catastrophic interference). Of course, with the Memento agent, you get both twice the training time and twice the model size, which could explain the improvement. They compare against giving the original agent twice the compute and model capacity, and find that Memento still does significantly better. They also present some fine-grained experiments which show that for a typical agent, training on specific contexts adversely affects performance on other contexts that are qualitatively different.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think this is pretty strong evidence that catastrophic interference is in fact a problem with the Atari games. On the other hand, <strong><a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/\">OpenAI Five</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/8234356e4b7f/alignment-newsletter-13\">AN #13</a></strong>) also has many, many subtasks, that in theory should interfere with each other, and it still seems to train well. Some guesses at how to reconcile these facts:</p><p>1) the tasks in Dota are more correlated than in (say) Montezuma&#x2019;s Revenge, and so interference is less of a problem (seems plausible)</p><p>2) the policy in OpenAI Five was large enough that it could easily allocate separate capacity for various subtasks (seems unlikely, I believe the policy was relatively small), or</p><p>3) with sufficiently large-scale training, there is more &#x201C;exploration&#x201D; in weight-space until a configuration is found where interference doesn&#x2019;t happen (seems unlikely given that large batch sizes help, since they tend to reduce weight-space exploration).</p><h2>DEEP LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/A_new_model_and_dataset_for_long-range_memory\">A new model and dataset for long-range memory</a></strong> <em>(Jack W. Rae et al)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): A central challenge in language modeling is capturing long-range dependencies. For example, a model needs to be able to identify the antecedent of a pronoun even if it is much earlier in the text. Existing datasets consist of news and Wikipedia articles, where articles have average lengths ranging from 27 to 3,600 words. This paper introduces a dataset of Project Gutenberg books, PG-19, where each book has a much longer average length of 69,000 words. This benchmark enables comparison of how well algorithms can make use of information that is spread out across a much larger context.</p><p>They then introduce the <em>Compressive Transformer</em>, which builds on the <em><strong><a href=\"http://ai.googleblog.com/2019/01/transformer-xl-unleashing-potential-of.html\">TransformerXL</a></strong></em> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/6bfac400a0c3/alignment-newsletter-44\">AN #44</a></strong>). The <em>TransformerXL</em> saves old activations into a FIFO queue, discarding them when the queue is full. The <em>Compressive Transformer</em> instead has two FIFO queues: the first stores the activations just like <em>TransformerXL</em>, but when activations are ejected, they are compressed and added to the second queue. This functions as a sort of long-term memory, storing information from a longer period of time but in a compressed format. </p><p>They try a number of types of compression function and find that it is best to use a 1D convolutional compression function with an auxiliary loss that leads to lossy compression, where information that is not attended to can be removed. The compression network and the Transformer optimize independent losses without any mixing. </p><p>They find that the <em>Compressive Transformer</em> improves on <em>TransformerXL</em> on their new PG-19 dataset and is state of the art on the already existing WikiText-103 and Enwik8 benchmarks. They also inspect where the network attends to and find that more attention is paid to the compressed memory than the oldest activations in regular memory, showing that the network is preserving some valuable information.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05507\">Paper: Compressive Transformers for Long-Range Sequence Modelling</a></strong></p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> I like the idea of saving long-term memory in a more efficient but lower-dimensional format than short-term memory. The current <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361\">trend</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/c29b3247da6f/4da2bu7tjd\">AN #87</a></strong>) in language modelling is that more computation leads to better results, so I think that algorithms that target computation on the most relevant information are promising. I&#x2019;d be interested to see (and curious if the authors tried) more continuous variants of this where older information is compressed at a higher rate than newer information, since it seems rather arbitrary to split into two FIFO queues where one has a fixed compression rate. </p><p>I&#x2019;m not well calibrated on the meaning of the evaluation metrics for NLP, so I don&#x2019;t have a sense of how much of an improvement this is over the <em>TransformerXL</em>. I looked through some of the example text they gave in the blog post and thought it was impressive but has clear room for improvement.</p><h2>MACHINE LEARNING </h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://thegradient.pub/independently-reproducible-machine-learning/\">Quantifying Independently Reproducible Machine Learning</a></strong> <em>(Edward Raff)</em> (summarized by Flo): While reproducibility refers to our ability to obtain results that are similar to the results presented in a paper, <strong>independent reproducibility</strong> requires us to be able to reproduce similar results using <em>only</em> what is written in the paper. Crucially, this excludes using the author&apos;s code. This is important, as a paper should distill insights rather than just report results. If minor technical details in a reimplementation can lead to vastly different results, this suggests that the paper did not accurately capture all important aspects. The distinction between reproducibility and independent reproducibility is similar to the previously suggested distinctions between <strong><a href=\"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/bouthillier19a.html\">reproducibility of methods and reproducibility of conclusions</a></strong> (<strong><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/c8ea4a5e842f/an-66-decomposing-robustness-into-capability-robustness-and-alignment-robustness\">AN #66</a></strong>) and <strong><a href=\"http://cogprints.org/7691/7/ICMLws09.pdf\">replicability and reproducibility</a></strong>. </p><p>The author attempted to replicate 255 machine learning papers, of which 162 were successfully replicated and ran a statistical analysis on the results. Factors that helped with independent reproduction included specified hyperparameters, ease of reading and authors answering emails. Meanwhile, neither shared code nor the inclusion of pseudo-code robustly increased the rate of reproduction. Interestingly, papers with a strong focus on theory performed worse than mostly empirical or mixed ones. While more rigour can certainly be valuable in the long term, including learning bounds or complicated math just for the sake of it should thus be avoided. Most of the data is <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/EdwardRaff/Quantifying-Independently-Reproducible-ML\">publically available</a></strong> and the author encourages further analysis.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06674\">Paper: A Step Toward Quantifying Independently Reproducible Machine Learning Research</a></strong></p><p><strong>Flo&apos;s opinion:</strong> I appreciate this hands-on approach to evaluating reproducibility and think that independent reproducibility is important if we want to draw robust conclusions about the general properties of different ML systems. I am a bit confused about the bad reproducibility of theory-heavy papers: One hypothesis would be that there is little incentive to provide theoretical justification for approaches that work robustly, as empirical evidence for their merits is generated more easily than theoretical results. This relationship might then flip, as results get more brittle.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> My explanation for the theoretical results is different: most theory tends to make at least a few assumptions that don&apos;t actually hold in order to obtain interesting guarantees. A paper will typically only include empirical results that confirm the theory, which will tend to select for environments in which the assumptions are minimally violated. If you then try to reproduce the paper in a new setting, it is more likely that the assumption is violated more strongly, and so the theoretical results don&apos;t show up any more.</p><h4><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></h4><p>I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me, <strong><a href=\"https://rohinshah.com/\">Rohin Shah</a></strong>, by <strong>replying to this email</strong>.                         </p><h4><strong>PODCAST</strong></h4><p>An audio podcast version of the <strong>Alignment Newsletter</strong> is available.

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Roko Mijic, Alexey Turchin</em></p><p><em>Epistemic status: Many different uncertainties here, but the idea has some good evidence in favor of it and a high potential payoff. </em></p><p>Tl;dr: We should urgently investigate putting special human-safe Far-UVC lamps all over our built environment to &#x2018;kill&#x2019; virus particles whilst they are in the air, thereby vastly reducing covid-19 spread. </p><p>Inspired by: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w</a></p><br><p>One of the most promising and neglected ideas for combating the spread of covid-19 is the use of ubiquitous ultraviolet light in our built environment (trains, offices, hospitals, etc). Ultraviolet light is already being used as a disinfecting agent across the world; it goes by the acronym UVGI - &#x201C;Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation&#x201D;. The energetic photons of UVC light break chemical bonds in DNA and kill/inactivate both viruses and bacteria.  </p><p>Ultraviolet light on earth exists on a spectrum between 200nm and 400nm. Light above 400nm is <strong>blue</strong> visible light. Light below 200nm is called &#x201C;vacuum UV&#x201D; because it is strongly absorbed by the oxygen in ordinary air and therefore cannot exist except in a vacuum or some other non-air medium. Within the 200-400nm range we have UVA, UVB and UVC, and at the short-wave edge of the UVC band we have &#x201C;Far-UVC&#x201D;, from roughly 200nm&#x2013;220&#x2009;nm. </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1J3CCkQ3amTIA8RrJmlc1QOQv4YzGG_Oj\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><h2>Safety considerations</h2><p>Human beings are also vulnerable to UV radiation. It causes skin cancer and serious eye damage.  </p><p>However, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225654\">recent research</a> suggests that the Far-UVC band is actually safe for human skin because it cannot penetrate through the thin layer of dead skin cells on the surface of our skin.  </p><p>This means that it might be possible to mount a long-term response to covid and other pathogens by constantly illuminating our built environment with light from specifically the Far-UVC band. If the Far-UVC light is indeed safe for humans, the Far-UVC could be on at all times and could destroy or deactivate viral particles before they can spread from person to person.  </p><p>Why hasn&#x2019;t this already been considered by relevant authorities? Far-UVC appears in a <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329439/WHO-WHE-IHM-GIP-2019.1-eng.pdf\">literature review</a> by WHO, but it is not currently being acted upon as the amount of evidence in favor of safety and efficacy is small. </p><p>There is some uncertainty about whether Ozone generation by this band (200nm-220nm) would be problematic. Ozone<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone#Chronic_Ozone_Exposure\"> is not great</a> for your health. However, it seems to be the case that the 200-220nm band is not a strong producer of Ozone. In addition, UV degradation of surfaces might result from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_degradation\">chronic UV exposure</a>.</p><h3>Balancing harms of action and inaction</h3><p>Even if Far-UVC is somewhat harmful it might still be a good idea to implement. Small harms from Far-UVC light might be much less bad than large harms from covid-19, or from the economic damage caused by the lockdown which one author estimates to be roughly $10 million per minute, plus much personal hardship which will be caused by the forthcoming recession. </p><p>Furthermore, UV light is easier to defend a person against than a virus. Sun-creams, clothing and eyewear that defend against UVC may be less bad than a semi-permanent lockdown or an exponentially growing covid-19 outbreak that results in millions or tens of millions of deaths. UV in the built environment could even be managed intelligently - computer vision could identify where the people were and turn on UV lights only in unoccupied areas, though such a project would at best be ready by the start of 2021 (and then only with wartime levels of effort and purpose). <br> </p><p>If the safety claims of Far-UVC are partially true rather than fully true, a combination of using Far-UVC with physical protection like eyewear may still cause only acceptable losses to cancer and eye damage. In the longer term, such &#x201C;almost safe&#x201D; Far-UVC could be combined with intelligent management at various levels of granularity; imagine a lift that is bathed in Far-UVC every time people leave it, or &#x201C;walls&#x201D; of Far-UVC separating people that automatically turn off momentarily when a person walks through them. The ultimate system might even adjust the power of the Far-UVC using AI. </p><h3>Epidemiological considerations</h3><p>Even an ideal Far-UVC solution that was harmless to humans, 100% lethal to covid-19 particles and easy to deploy at scale might not be sufficient to reduce R to exactly 0. But the key question is whether it could reduce R below 1 whilst also allowing most economic activity. An easy preliminary experiment to run would be to put virus samples in mouse cages - perhaps in aerosolized form - treat some cages with Far-UVC, leave other cages alone, see if infection rates go down in the treated cages. </p><p>This is an important source of uncertainty and further research is needed. </p><h3>Scaleup considerations</h3><p>Even a perfect system is useless if it cannot be scaled up and implemented across the globe. Far-UVC can be produced from Krypton Chloride (Kr-Cl) Excimer Lamps, but modern Aluminium Nitride (AlN) Far-UVC LEDs are a better solution for the long term. In the even longer term, collimated Far-UVC could be produced by lasers. This is an important source of uncertainty and further research and expert input is needed. </p><p>Power considerations:</p><p>The amount of Far-UVC energy required to kill 99% of the viral particles is estimated to be around 20J/m^2. With a power of, say 5W/m^2, a system would need 4 seconds to mostly sterilize a viral aerosol that could travel from person to person. However a lower power system would still have some benefits - we know that people can be infected by air that was contaminated 30 minutes earlier. Higher power in these wavelengths could be difficult to achieve with Kr-Cl Excimer Lamps as the overall <a href=\"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.362871\">efficiency</a> from electricity to Far-UVC is ~10%. AlN Far-UVC LEDs would likely have a much higher <a href=\"https://www.photonicsonline.com/doc/aluminum-nitride-deep-ultraviolet-light-emitt-0002\">conversion efficiency</a>. </p><h3>Generality</h3><p>One of the greatest benefits of Far-UVC is that it would be a very general weapon against pathogens. Far-UVC kills/deactivates bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. MRSA, C-DIFF, influenza, etc are all killed by UVC, as is the next problematic pathogen, whatever it is. </p><h3>Summary</h3><p>There are many different reasons that Ubiquitous Far-UVC might not work out, but if it did work out it could have huge benefits. For this reason the authors believe that it should get more attention at this critical time. Scaleup and safety and efficacy trials must all be carried out as quickly as possible, preferably in parallel. More importantly, the idea needs more attention from experts in the relevant fields - UV physics, epidemiology, and people who study the etiology of skin cancers. As of writing there are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-plan.html\">reports</a> that the US government estimates the epidemic could last for 18 months, so a plan like Far-UVC that will take months to implement may still be a critical component of a response later this year. </p><h2>Appendix. Other ways to use UV light to fight coronavirus</h2><p>One of the explanations of the flu and other infections seasonality is that the Sun&apos;s UV kills viruses. However, people spend a lot of time indoors even during summer, and especially during self-isolation. Most of our infections are happening indoors: at home, in transport and in working places. UV from Sun could be part of the explanation of the lower instances of coronavirus in southern countries. </p><p>If we replace light bulbs everywhere with light sources which also emit UV light of some special wavelength, we will kill most of the airborne viruses and will clean fomites. Thus, we will create artificial summer everywhere and will lower R0 of coronavirus below 1.</p><p>The main obstacles are the duration of exposition and possible harm to people. Recently in Moscow 20 children had burns in their eyes after a school teacher forgot to turn off the UV cleaner in the classroom.</p><p>There are several other ideas, besides Far-UVC light, to prevent human eye and skin damage:</p><p>1) Intelligently<em> controlled UV lighting</em>. UV light source turns on the maximum level when there are no people in the room. We already have motion detectors for lighting, but here they will work in reverse. Light with motion detection could also direct light in directions, where there is no motion, so no people. On the <a href=\"https://kdvr.com/news/coronavirus/colorado-company-uses-uv-lighting-technology-to-kill-99-9-percent-of-bacteria-and-viruses/\">video</a>, one can see UV light sources on sale with motion detectors:<a href=\"https://kdvr.com/news/coronavirus/colorado-company-uses-uv-lighting-technology-to-kill-99-9-percent-of-bacteria-and-viruses/\"> </a></p><p>The power of light could be temporarily increased after the sound of sneezing. But it will make all the system more complex and its large-scale implementation will take longer time. If Krypton Chloride Excimer bulbs are used, their lifetime is not great, so they can&#x2019;t run constantly. But if we can get the Aluminium Nitride LEDS then lifetime and efficiency will be better.</p><p>2) <em>Not &#x201C;too strong&#x201D; sources of UV</em>, which are producing Sun&#x2019;s intensity of UV and which act mostly on fomites. As we know, humans can survive at least 1 hour of sunlight UV exposure without strong damage (on beaches). We could use it as a reference point to calibrating UV sources.  </p><p>3) <em>Strong UV lighting + gloves.</em> Everyone will wear gloves, masks and glasses outside. In that case, no skin will be exposed to the UV lighting (and to viruses). Wearing PPE will be effective anyway. Women in the East are wearing full cover clothes, and they are ok.</p><p>4) <em>Wearable headlight UV </em>will direct UV light in the opposite direction to the person&#x2019;s eyes but will cover everything he inhales or touches, as well as his hands. The light will be strongest near the human face (but not affecting the face), and will attack droplets which the person is about to inhale. However, the light will dissipate in the distance of 1- 2 meters to safer levels. UV headlamps already exist and on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/WindFire-Ultraviolet-UV-Ultraviolet-Rechargeable-DetectorSports/dp/B014SEEHDE\">sale</a>, but may be not strong enough for disinfection. It will be especially effective if wearables Far UVC light sources will be used.</p><p>5) <em>UV flashlight</em> - Torch that emits UV radiation in a wide beam. Runs off main power. Could be used by cleaners as an additional step when cleaning surfaces. </p><p>Pros:</p><ol><li>Simpler, easier, cheaper and faster      to build than other solutions </li><li>Less harm to people, as UV light can be directed, and is not      always on</li><li>Proving ground (an MVP, in startup terms) for more advanced      implementations </li><li>Mobile; could be used in multiple locations </li></ol><p>Cons: </p><ol><li>Less effective than always on UV      lights and lamps </li><li>Requires additional time/effort on top of normal cleaning routines</li></ol><p>Artificial light exists currently almost everywhere, where contemporary humans live: in homes, in any shop, in cars and even on the streets. All we need is to replace electric lamps. Large amounts of lamps could be manufactured in 0.5-1 year, and smaller amounts for critical places like elevators in the even shorter notice.</p><p>However, there is a problem of actual testing the technology until it will be approved as safe and effective by the FDA. It is technically <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08332?fbclid=IwAR3LTW4y0MZaq6v-Oq4syxQhSrJoKltSCwGorUtlbtS29ZlGtE1gWXsP7w8\">difficult</a> to make deep UV (220nm) light-emitting diodes.</p><p>A good start will be to put UV lights in the places of short use: elevators, shops, restrooms. </p><p>It is much more convenient to wear protection against light than protection against viruses, and after a few months of lockdown, the idea of returning to almost normal life but with sun cream and/or gloves will be quite nice.</p><h2>References </h2><p>Welch, D., Buonanno, M., Grilj, V. <em>et al.</em> Far-UVC light: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w?fbclid=IwAR3eNTMbA8snIMpCCsYn3LM5TdCtlOPsdIuwRpmmFMI8T_q61MZSMVfT0Q0\">A new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases</a>. <em>Sci Rep</em> 8, 2752 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21058-w</p><p>Narita K, Asano K, Morimoto Y, Igarashi T, Nakane A (2018)<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=printable&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201259&amp;fbclid=IwAR17TQN7L_AMgxY_Q3ASBB8rtnb1E1j3zk6bwhs8jBxsMdfqErjMEEDak_o\"> Chronic irradiation with 222- nm UVC light induces neither DNA damage nor epidermal lesions in mouse skin, even at high doses.</a> PLoS ONE 13(7): e0201259. https://doi.org/ 10.1371/journal.pone.0201259</p><p>Willie Taylor, Emily Camilleri, D.

Many things go wrong all at once, and any safeguards are overwhelmed by the repeated issues. COVID-19 could clearly be one of those root causes. What might be others?</p>\n<p>Another clear source of turmoil for the western world right now is domestic politics. America has a historically unpredictable president and is heading into a divisive election year where the two candidates are both likely to be <em>very</em> old. The UK is finally going to leave the EU and hasn’t yet struck a deal to determine what that actually means. Canada (where I live, though less critical on the world stage) was in the middle of its own domestic crisis around Native American land rights and infrastructure projects before that got overshadowed by COVID-19 - our railroads and as such some parts of our supply chain had been shut down for weeks already by protesters.</p>\n<p>A third source of problems might be the “oil war” between OPEC and Russia, but I don’t know enough about that to really write about it usefully.</p>\n<p>With all that said, the thing that I am most afraid of right now is China. China has been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51938035\">very aggressive</a> on the world stage in the last couple of days, and I fully expect them to continue that pattern. Why wouldn’t they? Just as their country is recovering from the virus and starting to pick back up, the crisis in America and Europe is still growing. They are feeling strong while Western democracies are weak, divided, and looking inwards, and we should fully expect them to take advantage of that power imbalance in the short term to do things like finally and properly annexing Hong Kong (predict 50% that by the time COVID-19 has run its course in North America, Hong Kong has lost whatever quasi-independence it might have had).</p>\n<p>The question is how far they will go, and how will we (our governments) react? In normal times I would expect them to be cautious but I would also expect a cautious response from western governments. With the current volatility in the American system and the antagonism built up over the previous Chinese-American trade war, there is substantial risk of something escalating out of control. A full military conflict between world powers at this point in time would truly be something else going terribly, terribly wrong.</p>\n<p>[cross-posted to <a href=\"https://grandunifiedcrazy.com/2020/03/18/international-conflict-x-risk-in-the-era-of-covid-19/\">Grand, Unified, Crazy</a>]</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Epistemic status: Ramblings. Sorry for the tone. It was easier to write this way. I promise I won&apos;t be stubborn about any of this in the comments.</em></p><h1>Is it that bad?</h1><p>After reading Mr. Money Mustache&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2020/03/03/coronavirus-stock-market/\">take on the coronavirus</a>, I started having a few doubts about how bad it actually is. I didn&apos;t realize that 2M people in America die each year of things related to &quot;<a href=\"https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showLifestyleRiskFactorsMain\">lifestyle factors</a>&quot;.</p><p>It&apos;s possible that the coronavirus might be much worse than that. Let&apos;s say the worst case scenario is 50% infected and 10% of those infected die. In America that would mean about 150M infected and 15M dead. Almost an order of magnitude more than what what currently happens with lifestyle factors, so that&apos;s a lot.</p><p>But for a more average case scenario let&apos;s say 25% infected and 3% death rate, which would mean 75M infected and 2.25M deaths. An amount of deaths on par with the deaths we currently have due to lifestyle factors.</p><p>And for a more hopeful scenario, let&apos;s say 10% infected and a 2% death rate, which would mean 30M infected and 600k deaths. Less than a third of the lifestyle factors deaths.</p><p>Maybe the coronavirus is scarier than the lifestyle factor deaths we currently seem to just accept. But how <em>much</em> scarier? Mr Money Mustache asks this question:</p><blockquote>But do you feel the appropriate ratios of fear in these two situations?</blockquote><p>I know that my level of fear seems to be weighted too strongly towards the coronavirus.</p><p>This all makes me think of one of my favorite movie scenes: where the Joker talks about things that are &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0AXgaFqEas\">part of the plan</a>&quot;.</p><h1>Existential risks are still a much bigger problem</h1><p>Sorry for being so America-centric in the previous section. Let&apos;s look at worst case scenario for the entire world. Call it a 50% infection rate and 10% death rate. That&apos;d be about 4B infected and 400M dead.</p><p>400M dead is certainly a lot, but I think it pales in comparison to the consequences of screwing up with existential risks. As Eliezer says in his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky\">Twitter bio</a>:</p><blockquote>Ours is the era of inadequate AI alignment theory. Any other facts about this era are relatively unimportant, but sometimes I tweet about them anyway.</blockquote><p>And if that&apos;s true, then by focusing on the current <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wFTRgeaq5wceEfb2X/lesswrong-coronavirus-agenda\">LessWrong Coronavirus Agenda</a>, are we purchasing <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3p3CYauiX8oLjmwRF/purchase-fuzzies-and-utilons-separately\">fuzzies or utilons</a>?</p><h1>QUALYS and happiness</h1><p>If existential risk wasn&apos;t a thing, my attention would probably be on The Happiness Crisis. That&apos;s right: people aren&apos;t happy enough! I suspect that if we put existential risks aside, the best way to do good for the world might be to just make normal people happier!</p><p>I was going to do some research and spend a some time explaining this belief, but fortunately I remembered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeUOHOCFteM\">a talk</a> I came across a while back that does a better job.</p><p>If 1) my suspicion is correct that what Michael Plant calls &quot;ordinary human unhappiness&quot; is more harmful than deaths due to things like lifestyle factors, and 2) my argument in the first section is correct, then I think it follows that the coronavirus isn&apos;t particularly notable compared to The Happiness Crisis.</p><h1>0.1% is a lot of micromorts</h1><p>I get the impression that a lot of young people wave their hands at the risk that they personally have with the coronavirus. Even on LessWrong, to some extent.</p><p>But a 0.1% death rate isn&apos;t small. Neither is a 0.01% death rate. Neither is a 0.001% death rate.</p><p>Death is bad. 0.1% is a lot of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort\">micromorts</a>.</p><h1>Is the quarantined life really that bad?</h1><p>I don&apos;t know about you guys, but after reading <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eeZQunErdm6oWyhTy/how-to-have-a-happy-quarantine\">How to have a happy quarantine</a>, I&apos;m pumped!</p><h1>Is losing money really going to be that bad?</h1><p>One of my more contrarian beliefs is that it is absolutely ridiculous how worried we are about maintaining our standard of living. It seems to me that there is a ton of evidence showing that once your basic needs are met, money doesn&apos;t really matter. I think money is mostly a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sP2Hg6uPwpfp3jZJN/lost-purposes\">lost purpose</a>. It&apos;s originally an instrumental goal for happiness, but people forget this and pursue it because they &quot;need money&quot;.</p><p>Some unorganized comments:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Progress-Paradox-Better-While-People/dp/0812973038\">The Progress Paradox</a> is a good book on how over time standard of living has risen consistently over time, but happiness has stayed constant.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q1dgn_C0AU\">Hedonic adaptation</a> is a thing.</li><li>I think <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/\">Mr. Money Mustache</a> does a great job of talking about how we can live totally awesome lives while still being frugal. I&apos;m a pretty big Mustachian, with a few caveats.</li><li>I&apos;ve been reading some books and watching some shows on history lately. Something that I&apos;ve always got my eye on is what things people used to consider to be luxuries. Last night I learned that <em>salt</em> was once a huge luxury. They didn&apos;t have freezers or supermarkets, so they used salt to prevent their meats from going bad. Other things that were once luxuries include spices, silk, freedom, a basic education, books, and computers. All of those things are either free or dirt cheap right now.</li><li>Most of the things recommended by positive psychology regarding <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy\">how to be happier</a> don&apos;t really require money.</li><li>I have of course have other qualms with them, but I love how Stoicism and Buddhism emphasize that unhappiness stems from your mindset. What&apos;s &quot;in here&quot;, not what&apos;s &quot;out there&quot;. And largely your mindset regarding unrealistic wants and expectations.</li></ul><p>So then, with all of that said, getting back to the coronavirus, people are going to lose their jobs, dip into their savings, maybe even require help from family or the government. But would it really be that bad if that stuff happened?</p><h1>Low-cost interventions FTW!</h1><p>Something I&apos;ve always appreciated about <a href=\"https://www.painscience.com/\">PainScience</a> is <a href=\"https://www.painscience.com/articles/pain-tips.php#sec_trying\">how</a> the author reasons about whether things are worth a shot. If something is unlikely to work, but it&apos;s also cheap and harmless, he&apos;ll say &quot;give it a shot!&quot;. I love that mindset, and unfortunately don&apos;t see it enough in the medical world. If the downside is low, the barrier to trying should be correspondingly low.</p><p>As it applies to this coronavirus stuff, there are certain things that seem like the downside is so low that our response should be &quot;screw it, I&apos;ll give it a shot!&quot;.</p><ul><li>Does copper tape actually prevent the disease from surviving on surfaces? Who cares, it&apos;s ten bucks!</li><li>Are you really going to need all of those groceries? Who cares, they&apos;re not going to go bad and you were going to buy them at some point anyway!</li><li>Is it too risky to hang out at Starbucks? Who knows, but is the benefit that large relative to hanging out at home?</li></ul><p>The point I&apos;m trying to make makes me think about the third virtue of rationality:</p><blockquote>The third virtue is lightness. Let the winds of evidence blow you about as though you are a leaf, with no direction of your own.</blockquote><p>It isn&apos;t quite the same thing as what I&apos;m saying, but I think the analogy of lightness applies. When the downside is low, don&apos;t hesitate to act.</p>",

My chances of catching COVID-19 are actually quite low, and my chances of surviving it if I do are quite high, and I&#x2019;m still scared. What if I get into a car accident and have to go to the ER? Will they have a bed for me? Will I leave with coronavirus? What are my pregnant friends going to do? What is anyone over 70 going to do?</p><p>My goal, and the goal of everyone on the LW staff, and I assume most everyone who&#x2019;s participated in all the coronavirus threads, has been to figure out what is happening and what we can do about it. We&#x2019;ve already done a lot.  Posts like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5okDRahtDewnWfFmz/seeing-the-smoke\">Seeing the Smoke</a> got coronavirus on people&#x2019;s radar faster than it otherwise would have been, aided by the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJBQ7GiyvFTBnSEEC/growth-rate-of-covid-19-outbreaks\">numerous modeling threads</a> backing it up. The <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mQdTCKKB8p5mGaMfC/quarantine-preparations\">Quarantine Preparations</a> thread gave people a starting place to act from. The <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread\">Justified Practical Advice</a> (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B9qzPZDcPwnX6uEpe/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-summary\">summary</a>) thread let us share our expertise, in ways that led to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B6e2reZPPY7Wbktty/how-did-the-coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread\">concrete behavioral changes</a>. More recently we examined <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9GyKccaJdLEbdhyTi/a-significant-portion-of-covid-19-transmission-is\">asymptomatic transmission</a>. I&#x2019;ve had a legit, reasonably high ranking government official say they look at us to see where everyone else will be in weeks.</p><p>This is currently the LessWrong team&#x2019;s top priority, and they&#x2019;ve done a number of things over the recent weeks to facilitate research and action on coronavirus, including hiring me to be a point person on it. To facilitate as much progress as possible over the coming weeks, habryka and I have compiled a list of what we consider the most important questions in fighting COVID, and are asking anyone with the skill to help us answer them. </p><p>That list is at the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wFTRgeaq5wceEfb2X/lesswrong-coronavirus-agenda#The_Full_Agenda\">end of this post</a>. But first, what is the overall plan here? </p><h1>Who are we trying to help?</h1><p>We have three broad categories of potential beneficiaries in mind:<br></p><ol><li><strong>Individuals making choices for themselves and their loved ones</strong>, who need accurate information about the current threat level and how to lower it with existing tech.<br><br></li><li><strong>Individuals creating the tools for the people above</strong>, meaning anything from noticing that copper tape is anti-viral to creating plans for DIY non-invasive ventilators, who need accurate information about how COVID-19 operates and where the current gaps and bottlenecks are. We&#x2019;d like to help people in this group get volunteers and money when appropriate.<br><br></li><li><strong>Organizations and institutions making decisions that affect many people</strong>, who need all the information the previous two groups do, plus more to know what the effect of their decisions will be.</li></ol><h1>How Are We Doing That?</h1><p>I am managing a Coronavirus Agenda, composed of what myself and habryka think are the most important coronavirus-related questions to answer (think we missed some? Please comment).  But the full agenda is kind of overwhelming, and there are benefits to coordinating multiple people around the same question, so every so often I&#x2019;ll pull out Spotlight Questions to generate a critical mass of attention around the most critical questions. I want to say &#x201C;every so often&#x201D; will be once a week, but I feel like those kinds of commitments are for situations where I know within an order of magnitude how many people are going to die in that week. I will spotlight as often as seems merited by the situation at the time.</p><p>If your eye is caught by a question on the agenda that&#x2019;s not currently spotlighted, of course pursue your interest. That&#x2019;s the point of sharing the whole agenda. And if you think the agenda is missing something important, of course pursue that, and add a comment explaining it if you have time so I can add it.</p><p>Without further adieu, the spotlight questions...</p><h1>Spotlight Questions</h1><h2><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FftgfqqdRAx5ssiAp/what-is-the-impact-of-varying-initial-viral-load-of-covid-19\">What is the impact of varying initial viral load of COVID-19?</a></h2><p>The hypothesis that lower initial viral load leads to better outcomes, and might be worth pursuing deliberately, is a central assumption is Zvi&#x2019;s post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3ArEA7tHDXQxE6PED/taking-initial-viral-load-seriously\">Taking Initial Viral Load Seriously</a>.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>In this post we lay out some ideas around framing interpretability research which we have found quite useful. Our framing is goal-oriented, which we believe is important for making sure interpretability research is meaningful. We also go over a variety of dimensions which we think are useful to consider when thinking about interpretability research. We wanted to have a shared vocabulary when talking about this kind of research, and found that these ideas helped us communicate effectively.</p>\n<p>One of our motivations for having these thoughts and discussions is so we can understand the relevance of interpretability to alignment, and to help us think about which categories or dimensions of interpretability research are important for alignment of strong AI. In a coming post we discuss interpretability and alignment, using the ideas from this post and other previous writing on the subject.</p>\n<h2>Interpretability, transparency, explainability?</h2>\n<p>A quick note on terminology. Many terms are used to mean many similar things in the interpretability research literature. We think of <em>Interpretability</em> as the broadest possible category, which is why it can be hard to define and operationalise. Two specific terms are used with frequency apart from interpretability - <em>explainability</em> and <em>transparency</em> - and following the definitions in <em>The Mythos Of Model Interpretability</em> (summarised in more detail in the appendix), we’ll use them as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Explainability</em> is usually a post-hoc action, where we want to understand and explain why a model made a specific prediction (or enacted certain behaviour) after the fact.</li>\n<li><em>Transparency</em> is normally seen as a more intrinsic property of a model, and is about understanding it’s internal workings and mechanisms. This is often a harder property to achieve. This can often mean a human would be able to “Run an approximation of the algorithm in their head”.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Dimensions for interpretability</h1>\n<p>We found two dimensions most useful to consider when thinking about interpretability. The first dimension (<em>Goals</em>) is concerned with which goals interpretability research aims to fulfil. The second (<em>Enabling Humans</em>) refers to the idea that interpretability is human-centred, and we feel that interpretability methods normally must have a human involved in interpreting the model for them to be meaningful. We could also consider agents acting on behalf of humans (i.e. in amplification or recursive reward modelling). These aren’t the only axes on which to consider interpretability research (see Other Dimensions), but they are the two we felt were the most useful.</p>\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<p>Possibly the most important dimension to consider is the Goals of interpretability methods. We describe five generic goals (not specific to certain domains). We found that this helps us the most when thinking about what kinds of interpretability methods we should pursue developing and what a specific interpretability method is hoping to achieve. This is descriptive, in that these are (generic) goals researchers have put forward for using interpretability methods, or that interpretability methods have been used to achieve. There’s overlap between these goals, and especially the first three are interrelated, as are the last two.</p>\n<p>The goals are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Predicting behaviour</em> - This is about being able to predict a model’s behaviour in novel scenarios. This normally will be without having a full formal definition of the scenario (otherwise we should just run it through the model and see what it does). We might care about predicting large classes of behaviour (“The model never acts against human interest”) which is overlapping with the <em>Assurance of properties</em> goal below; we might also care about more specific classes of behaviour (“Will the agent smash the red vase in this gridworld?”).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some current methods which might help with this are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12969\">Counterfactual States for Atari Agents via Generative Deep Learning</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01318\">Finding and Visualizing Weaknesses of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents</a>, as they both visualise what states would produce certain behaviours, and hence enable us to predict behaviours in these states.</li>\n<li>One way in which this goal can be validated is to test whether it enables users to construct inputs which produce a certain behaviour, rather than predicting the input given the behaviour. This would have to be done without access to the model (otherwise you could just optimise for that behaviour). The two methods above are examples of this kind of approach: Having seen several visualisations of counterfactual states, you could be able to produce counterfactual states on your own without the method, which demonstrates you’ve gained some understanding of the model enough to predict it’s behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Assurance of properties</em> - This is related to the <em>Predicting Behaviour</em> goal, but where the goal is to give broader assurances that are better described as properties rather than specific behavioural predictions. In the strongest form, this might take the form of formal verification, but in weaker forms we might be satisfied with visualisations or explanations of behaviour which imply that the model has a certain property.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04730\">Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08484\">Estimating Training Data Influence by Tracking Gradient Descent</a> are both methods designed to find training data which is influential for specific model decisions. If a model’s influential training points for a specific action are unrelated to this action, we might suppose that the model has learned spurious correlations rather than a robust approach. These methods can hence give us a small amount of assurance that the model is reasoning correctly about it’s inputs.</li>\n<li>Visualising adversarial examples might give us some assurance of the robustness (or not) of the network to adversarial attacks.</li>\n<li>We could also consider value learning as an interpretability method. In the case of perfect IRL, we can find the revealed preferences of an agent, and having these preferences would allow you to examine some properties of the agent. This would also help with <em>Predicting Behaviour</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Persuasion of properties</em> - This is similar to the <em>Assurance of properties</em> goal, but with the difference that the aim is purely persuasion of a person, rather than a truthful representation of the model’s properties. Often interpretability methods might be used to convince a non-technical person (perhaps an auditor or a companies machine learning models) that the model has certain properties. This goal can often be problematic, as the incentives come apart from truthfully presenting the behaviour or properties of the model. That is, we could create methods that produce pretty interesting visualisations which seem to show the model is doing the right thing, when the visualisations aren’t actually dependent on the model’s parameters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03292\">Sanity Checks for Saliency Maps</a> and <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub46494/\">The (Un)reliability of Saliency methods</a> both seem to point at the possibility that saliency maps are doing this implicitly. Obviously no researcher is explicitly thinking <em>“Let's find the prettiest picture to convince people or some interesting property”</em>, but without better forms of validation this seems like it could happen by accident for some methods. This was one of our motivations for coming up with a goal-oriented framing in the first place</li>\n<li>Note that we’re not saying this a goal one <em>should</em> aim for, and it’s rarely if ever explicitly mentioned as a goal in literature; however, it likely to have been (at least implicitly) optimised for in certain methods, as the above bullet point alludes to.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Improving model performance</em> - Many methods are designed to give us understanding which we can use to improve the performance of the model. We might find weaknesses in how the model currently performs, or unbalanced training data, which we can use to improve the model’s performance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, saliency maps (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00138\">Visualizing and Understanding Atari Agents</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391\">Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization</a>, many others) tell us what the model is attending to in the input, which can tell us whether it’s learning the correct signals and information to attend to. This information might help us improve the model behaviour.</li>\n<li>When trying to improve the robustness of our models, especially by adversarial training, we might use interpretability methods to find uninterpretable or seemingly un-robust behaviours, and bias our adversarial training towards these behaviours. If the behaviours are reliant on spurious correlations, then we can improve the robustness of our model by training on examples where these correlations break down, and if they in fact are robust, then we may have learned something new about the environment or task which we didn’t realise beforehand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Debugging model</em> - Similar to the <em>Improving model performance</em>, and especially in deep learning, this is about finding incorrect model behaviour and fixing it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To clarify the difference from <em>Improving model performance</em>, we might say a model is implemented and executing correctly if it’s implementation is fully faithful to the conception in your head, or to some pseudocode, mathematical formula or design document. In this case, we might use interpretability to <em>Improve model performance</em> by giving us insights into how it behaves.</li>\n<li>However, we might say a model is implemented (and hence executing) incorrectly if it’s implementation is unfaithful to the pseudocode, mathematical formulation or design document, most likely due to an error in implementation, or a possibly hidden assumption being violated in the training process. For example, we might assume that all the training data is labelled correctly, but it might not be, and we may be able to find this using interpretability methods. This would fall under <em>Debugging models</em> rather than <em>Improving model performance</em>.</li>\n<li>This might take the form of an interactive debugger or some logging view such as tensorboard, or visualisations of the flow of gradients through the network, to make sure they’re flowing the way you expect.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A key caveat is that many methods might not target a specific goal in the above list, but instead aim to produce in the end-user of the interpretability method some <em>Generic Understanding</em> or a <em>Gearful Model</em> of the object being interpreted. This understanding could then serve in the fulfilment of a variety of goals, such as aiding the user in predicting behaviour, or understanding why the model fails and hence improving its performance. A key example of these kinds of <em>Generic Understanding</em> methods are the series of methods based on <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/\">Feature Visualisation</a>, especially the <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/\">Activation Atlas</a>. The Activation Atlas paper is a good example of a method giving <em>Generic Understanding</em> which is then cashed out in the ability to produce adversarial examples aimed at specific things using only overlapping natural images, which is a kind of <em>Predicting Behaviour.</em></p>\n<p>We want to stress, however, that validating whether a interpretability method produces genuine understanding seems very difficult (or perhaps impossible) to do without seeing whether the understanding can be cashed out to achieve one of the goals above. The aim when trying to produce understanding should not be for the user to just <em>feel</em> like they understand the method, but rather for the user’s understanding to enable them to better achieve one of the goals above. If a method produces some fuzzy feeling of understanding but doesn’t seem useful for any downstream task, then it’s worth considering what it’s useful for.</p>\n<h2>Enabling Humans</h2>\n<p>The second dimension, <em>Enabling Humans</em>, is about whether the method enables a <em>human</em> to achieve one of the goals above, as opposed to achieving the goal directly. That is, there are many methods or algorithms in machine learning which <em>Improve model performance</em>, such as the Adam optimiser or adding more layers to your neural network. These techniques are obviously not interpretability techniques, but it’s useful to think about the difference between them and a technique we would call interpretability which does enable an improvement in model performance.</p>\n<p>We think the key difference is the existence of a human in a chain between interpretability method and in this case <em>Improvement of model performance</em>. An interpretability method will <em>Enable Humans</em> to achieve the goals above. For a method such as automatic verification (which could be considered interpretability) the verifier is doing the vast majority of the work, but the human still needs to decide what to verify, i.e. they need to ask the right questions. On the other hand, methods such as feature visualisation and saliency maps only provide some visualisation of the model behaviour or internals, and hence still require human effort to achieve one of the goals above.</p>\n<p>For some of the goals above this is basically guaranteed: When trying to gain <em>Assurance of Properties</em>, we’re the human in the loop, and the method could give us these assurances or enable us to find them for ourselves. However as mentioned above, for <em>Improving model performance</em> the distinction becomes more necessary.</p>\n<p>This dimension is more difficult to reason about than the <em>Goals</em> dimension, and is hence less fleshed out. However, we think it’s just as important to consider what the role of the human is in an interpretability method’s use.</p>\n<h2>A Map of Methods</h2>\n<p>These dimensions aren’t an operationalisation of interpretability, and don't present necessary and sufficient conditions, and we’re uncertain whether it’d be useful to have a strict dividing line. We do think that the framing is useful even if it’s not a formal definition of what interpretability is, as it helped us to discuss what goals interpretability methods are trying to achieve, and whether they’re enabling humans to achieve those goals or not. To test out our ideas with a variety of current methods, we produced a map of current interpretability methods on these two dimensions. This helped us in earlier formulations to spot problems with the description of the framing, relations between various parts of it, and similar patterns of goal behaviour from different methods. This is just an illustration of applying some of our ideas to current methods. Bold lines indicate that method helping more with that goal. We don't want to stake a lot on exactly where the bold lines are drawn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Wnto7sT.png\" alt=\"Map of methods\"></p>\n<h2>Other dimensions</h2>\n<p>The two dimensions described above were the ones we felt were the most useful at a higher level when thinking about generating ideas for interpretability methods. However, there’s a few other dimensions which we think are also important to think about. This can also be useful in a generative sense. If we draw out the matrix of all dimensions, we can consider whether methods in certain points of the matrix would be useful, and how they might look. These other important dimensions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Interpreting the <em>training process vs finished model</em> (vs both). A method might aim to interpret how training happens (such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01440\">LCA: Loss Change Allocation for Neural Network Training</a> or <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04730\">Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions</a>), or it might be interpreting the finished model (such as <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/\">Feature Visualization</a>).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We think this dimension can still be orthogonal to the <em>Goals</em> dimension, as we might want <em>Assurances of properties</em> or <em>Predicting Behaviour</em> of the training process as opposed to the finished model. The distinction is more blurry when it comes to <em>Improving model performance</em> or <em>Debugging models</em>, but we can still say a method looks at the training process of the finished model (or both) to aid in achieving this goal. In an online/meta-learning setup this also not be a crisp definition, as these paradigms have training as part of the “finished model”.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Level of access</em> to components of training and model. In some settings, we might have access to all the training data, the whole training process (i.e. the mini batches and loss and model checkpoints at every iteration), the final model (i.e. it’s architecture and weights), and a copy of the environment/simulation (especially relevant in reinforcement learning). In this full information setting many more interpretability methods are possible than in a setting where we only have access to the final model (architecture and weights), or even just examples of it’s behaviour.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We find it useful to think about what resources the interpretability method requires to produce its results. This is especially pertinent in reinforcement learning, as some methods such as in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02658\">Understanding DQNs</a> require running the model for many time steps in the environment to gain insight from a behavioural standpoint, but this can be problematic depending on the type and simulatability of the environment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Ground Truth Access</em>. Some interpretability methods may rely on access to the ground truth, either from a human’s evaluation or otherwise. In some settings (such as natural image classification) this is the case, but in reinforcement learning we don’t know what the optimal policy in most settings is. This will become more pertinent as we get stronger AIs and they start to overtake humans on domains other than board games.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Methods like <a href=\"http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/\">NetDisect</a> require dense pixel level labellings of images, an even stronger notion of ground truth than just class labels for inputs, and gradient-based saliency methods require the ground truth label to take the gradient with, whereas perturbation based saliency methods and methods such as feature visualisation have no such requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What’s next?</h1>\n<p>While the ideas in this post helped us deconfuse and discuss interpretability research in general, we think an ideal use-case for the framing (which also motivates us) is talking about interpretability in AI alignment. This problem setting is different from those tackled in the standard machine learning literature: We’ll care about a subset of the goals described above, and the way in which a method enables humans will also deserve more scrutiny. A second post coming soon will focus on this issue, using the ideas in this post and other previous writing on the subject. To give an (obvious) sneak preview, <em>Persuasion of Properties</em> is a goal we would want to avoid explicitly optimising for when thinking about aligning strong AI.</p>\n<h1>Appendix: Previous Literature</h1>\n<p>There have been previous works addressing the problem of defining and discussing interpretability research. We here summarise two works which seemed to be the most discussed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03490\">The Mythos of Model Interpretability</a> tackles the problem that interpretability is an under-defined term. The author first presents five desiderata which cover most interpretability researchers’ motivations for doing interpretability research: <em>Trust</em>, <em>Causality</em>, <em>Informativeness</em>, <em>Transferability</em>, and <em>Fair and ethical decision making</em>. In many problems, the problem specification used to train the model (i.e. the loss function, which normally just optimises accuracy) does not capture all of the desired properties of the model (i.e. not discriminating different races, having an understanding of causality, being transferable to other similar problems). Hence, optimising to solve this problem specification will not produce these properties. In these cases, Interpretability can be used to validate that these extra properties hold. This point is made both in this paper and following one.</p>\n<p>The paper describes a taxonomy of interpretability methods, with the top level topics of <em>transparency</em> and <em>post-hoc interpretability</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Transparency</em> is about understanding what procedure the algorithm is implementing, and in its strongest form about being to simulate the algorithm yourself. This definition has problems when we consider superhuman AI, as a human presumably won’t be able to simulate the AI’s algorithm. (See <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jg6ZJLE5eHkfuxk67/one-way-to-think-about-ml-transparency\">One Way to Think About ML Transparency</a> for an attempt to solve this specific problem by extending the definition from human-simulatable in practice to human-simulatable in theory without constant access to the model being simulated).</li>\n<li><em>Post-hoc Explanations</em> refers to methods which aim to understand or explain why a machine learning model has made a certain decision, either through examples, visualisation or explicit textual explanation produced by the model itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08608\">Towards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning</a> echoes the point made in the above paper that interpretability research is aimed at addressing the case where the loss function a model is optimised for doesn’t capture all of the desired properties of the trained model. To the list of possible use-cases or problem underspecification cases it adds having a <em>Multi-objective trade-off</em> or only having trained with a <em>Proxy reward function</em>. It provides a semi-formal description of the variety of ways in which interpretability methods or models can be validated, and the links between these methods and the desiderata or methods described above.</p>\n<p>Some papers we haven’t looked into but also seem to tackle a similar topic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04263\"><em>The Challenge of Crafting Intelligible Intelligence</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00033\"><em>Techniques for Interpretable Machine Learning</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09722\"><em>Explicability?

We could have been stranded. And it’s likely our furniture does get stranded.</p>\n<p>Alas, it is hard to overreact. We did ordinary cheap preparing. We had a month’s worth of food, all our medicines and stuff like that. Initially I thought that would be the plan. Hunker down in our apartment, take deliveries with increasing caution, get through this.</p>\n<p>Increasingly as the day drew near it became clear this wasn’t a great idea. Going in and out of the apartment at all would be unsafe. Either the nanny would be living with us, or she wouldn’t be available. Either way, the place was so small for us and two children. My wife became increasingly convinced we’d go insane.</p>\n<p>So we had to go. We picked a location, where we could ride things out reasonably. We got a real estate agent to go look at houses. But we didn’t want to halt her business too soon, for fear that it would permanently cost clients. So we didn’t see anything until the weekend. At which time, our blowhard mayor took a break from going to the YMCA each morning to say that he was ‘considering a lockdown.’</p>\n<p>Which is excellent news. Since, obviously, lock it down. But for us, it meant we could be stranded halfway. We’d be outside, with none of our things. Or we’d be inside, with no way to get out, and a lease we couldn’t use. Everyone was freaking out.</p>\n<p>The freaking out is in many ways the worst of it. Sleep has come, but it’s been tricky. Work goes forward when I can, but it’s hard to focus. Keeping up with events seems important. But I don’t know a way to do that and not obsess. Twitter is the best news source yet terrible for one’s mental health. Everyone makes dumb decisions. Everyone is filled with regret. Regret we didn’t get the place ready a month ago.</p>\n<p>Regret I didn’t sell everything and go short, not because I had some crazy belief in efficient markets, but because I didn’t expect it to be this bad and I told myself a few years ago I was going to not be a trader anymore and just buy and hold. I’d just come off a decade of looking at markets all day. I needed my mental energy elsewhere. I made myself a promise. Then I looked at the tax implications, and decided it was better to just keep the promise. Didn’t think of buying options until too late. Obviously, regrets now.</p>\n<p>We’ll be all right, assuming of course we dodge the virus. Hard pivot. At first, virus kind of welcome on selfish personal level. Hospitals fine, health good, still relatively young, not exposing many people, would recognize quickly and self-isolate. Might be better to get infected early. Then could ride out much better without fear. Now things poised to get bad. Must be increasingly careful. Can’t return to city.</p>\n<p>Parents hopefully safe at new location. Got them to take things more seriously. Even made a little progress towards our response as a world – my father was an immunologist. Did analysis, made some phone calls and such. Aunt still in danger. Needs help from someone who can’t quarantine properly. Don’t know what to do about that. Tried.</p>\n<p>Crossed the Red Sea known as Hudson River. Now in desert known as New Jersey. At in-laws for now. Our stuff is in a van or around the house. Will being unloading the van at new place later today. Late, but better late than too late. Mazel tov on the new house, I suppose. Anxiety level coming somewhat down.</p>\n<p>Political response still crazy, still too slow. Taking forever to come down from mountain with commandments. Many instead choose to build golden calves. Some countries despair, talk of fake herd immunity. America’s federal response beyond terrible, doing untold damage. Active sabotage of testing, then denial. America still not ramping up ventilator production far as we can tell, but talking about grants to airlines. House member stalls bill so it can be read. Turns out the sick leave being granted exempts large corporations. But we already knew hat. Reading request almost certainly member being difficult because he could be. War being waged on small businesses that need help. Sharp contrast to places like France, where lock-down in place and no business however small will be allowed to fail.</p>\n<p>Might be lost here for a while. Hopefully not forty years.</p>\n<p>Local responses much better. Still inadequate. San Francisco on strangely incomplete lock-down. Going on walks considered fine for some reason, very strange. New York paying price for choosing terrible mayor. Wouldn’t close schools until aids threatened to quit and teachers threatened mass sick-out. Governor much better on relative basis. Even brought together tri-state area to coordinate policy. Perhaps we can add 47 more states. Stranger things have already happened. New York lock-down seems inevitable, should already be here. Who knows when they’ll finally do it.</p>\n<p>Still, hope. Increasing action. Curves that should soon bend if actions are held to. Success examples from Asia. We can do this.</p>\n<p>Our civilization’s failures exposed. Now can start to fix. Hopefully.</p>\n<p>Not touching face still surprisingly hard.</p>\n<p>Market crazy too. Can share impressions. Not investment advice or endorsed strongly. Just musings. Hunches.</p>\n<p>Giant liquidity crunch and flight to safety doing strange things. In this sense, overreaction. Things vulnerable to this taking big hits, presumably cheap long term. Not where one wants to try and catch a falling knife. Betas dragging stocks down. Companies that want you to always stay inside taking pounding too. Amazon, Netflix and so on. Not enough thinking about future reality, adjusting take to circumstances.</p>\n<p>Market seems to still underestimate real effects. Periodically wakes up some more as exact median scenarios play out over next day, sells more stuff. Overreacts to what it <em>thinks </em>is happening, but overreacting to an underestimate. Tricky.</p>\n<p>Even more than underestimate, market lacks good estimate or handle on events. Thus, reacts incorrectly to announcements. When things close or people react more strongly and say things are bad, market treats as bad news. Whereas that is actually good news. When people downplay, market treats as good news. Whereas that is actually bad news. Exception is President. President like Vash. Well known liar. Market knows. <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/everybody-knows/\">Everybody knows</a>.</p>\n<p>WordPress still not offering automatic or easy way to link to post with exact title equal to link text. Frustrating.</p>\n<p>Reactions to relief packages different. There good news is good news. Especially if good news means economic warfare on behalf of big business. <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/moloch-hasnt-won/\">Like there’s a maze</a> or something.</p>\n<p>All fun to think about. Potentially productive too. Except also happening for real, to us. Which is not so fun.</p>\n<p>Still telling myself. Not a trader. Not anymore. Have plenty of cash. Stupidly obvious opportunity is passed. Can make money trading whenever. Let others trade. You chose to end that life. Making a digital card game. Creating efficient digital marketplaces. Much better missions. Stay on target. Fundraising will get tricky. We’ll figure it out. Product market fit stronger than ever.</p>\n<p>Life still good. Exploring new life in Warwick likely fun. Technically in New York. Important for medical licencing. And to avoid shame. Having a house will be great. Never had a house. So much space. A yard. A garden. Fresh air. Washer and dryer. No one around. Gigantic supermarket with low prices. Grill! Learn to cook more things. Learn to drive, perhaps. Spend more time with family.</p>\n<p>Folders full of links as post topics. Amazon wish list full of books to read. Try to read old ones. Thousands of hours of television I’d be happy to stream. Podcasts in abundance. Endless games to play. Including Magic: the Gathering. And of course, we have a game to develop and bring to market. And other products.</p>\n<p>So much to do. So much to see. So what’s wrong with taking the back streets. Or no streets at all. For a while.</p>\n<p>Treat as vacation.</p>\n<p>Next year in New York City.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

That it takes about a week of a severe lockdown to switch from the exponential growth to linear, about two weeks to switch to leveling off, and three to four weeks to start seeing a meaningful decline. If this pattern holds, then the dire projections of millions dying would not come to pass. The overall toll is likely to be around 100,000 in 2020 if most countries adopt the China/Korea/Italy/Spain-level measures. Moreover, the worst of the pandemic, or at least of this first wave, will be over in 2-3 months, as long as the containment measures are in place, and the countries and jurisdictions that are proactive enough will not have to resort to the worst of the ICU triage any time soon. </p><p>This was the good news. The bad news is that this is not sustainable in the medium to long term, given the impact of the measures on the economy, mobility and lifestyle. But maybe the effort to flatten the curve is not in vain. The question is, what&apos;s next? Who knows? A viable vaccine is at least a year away, the ICU bed count ramp up may help, some of the social distancing measures such as deliveries, takeouts, telecommuting may prove sustainable enough, but that doesn&apos;t seem like nearly enough in the long term.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>For group houses, one of the most important factors when deciding how to relate to COVID-19 is the question: If one of my housemates gets infected, how likely am I to also get infected? This is known as the household secondary attack rate, and it determines how much you need to worry about your housemates' level of precaution (as compared to your own), and how much within-house social distancing is necessary.</p><p>Household secondary attack rate is context dependent; it could mean one of several things, which I will illustrate with two scenarios:</p><ul><li>Scenario 1: A member of your household is returning from a trip to Wuhan, which you have heard is high risk. You react… however you react to that. You might find a way to be out of the house for awhile, or prepare an isolated room they can lock themself in. If they're your spouse, you might decide that isolation isn't worth it. Some time not long after they become symptomatic, they check into a hospital, where they remain until after their infectious period is over.</li><li>Scenario 2: You live in a group house. You all have separate rooms, but share a kitchen and living room. One of your housemates is infected during a trip to the grocery store. Some time later they become symptomatic, and you react… however you react to that. You might or might not have somewhere to move to, or somewhere to move them to, but they can't check into a hospital because they're all full. You might or might not have been exposed to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9GyKccaJdLEbdhyTi/a-significant-portion-of-covid-19-transmission-is\"><u>presymptomatic transmission</u></a>. If neither of you has the ability to move, you'll be in the same house until after they've recovered.</li></ul><p>Right now there are two studies which purport to measure the household secondary attack rate:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200305183724/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6909e1.htm?s_cid=mm6909e1_w#contribAff\"><u>Active Monitoring of Persons Exposed to Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 — United States, January–February 2020</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v1.full.pdf\"><u>Epidemiology and Transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: Analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts</u></a></li></ul><p>I'll refer to these as the CDC report and the Shenzhen study, respectively. These are the only studies I have been able to find which make any quantitative claim about COVID-19's secondary attack rate, and all other claims I've found have traced back to either of these two. The CDC study finds a household secondary attack rate of 10%; the Shenzhen study finds a household secondary attack rate of 15%.</p><p>When I started writing this post, I thought I'd be focusing on the difference between scenarios 1 and 2. Unfortunately, as I dug into the studies in detail, I found evidence of severe problems which make me think that these two studies provide almost no evidence whatsoever about COVID-19's household secondary attack rate, even in scenario 1.</p><h2>CDC Report</h2><p>On March 3, CDC published a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200305183724/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6909e1.htm?s_cid=mm6909e1_w#contribAff\"><u>report</u></a> on the results of a contact-tracing program started on January 20. The report statistics on contacts of the first 10 patients with travel-related confirmed COVID-19 reported in the US; presumably, all of these travellers came from Hubei on or after January 20. They trace 445 contacts total, of which 54 developed concerning symptoms, became \"persons under investigation\", and were tested. It doesn't sound like anyone besides those 54 were tested.</p><p>The 445 contacts break down as follows:</p><ul><li>222 were health care personnel</li><li>100 were \"community members who were exposed to a patient in a health care setting\"</li><li>104 were \"community members who spent at least 10 minutes within 6 feet of a patient with confirmed disease\"</li><li>19 were members of a patient's household</li></ul><p>Out of the 54 people who were tested, two were positive; of those two, both were members of a patient's household. The CDC report does not provide any further information about those two positive cases, but they can be pretty easily matched to public news coverage. The first case was in Illinois and is described in detail in <a href=\"https://secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/action/getSharedSiteSession?rc=1&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flancet%2Farticle%2FPIIS0140-6736%2820%2930607-3%2Ffulltext\"><u>this Lancet paper</u></a>; the second was in San Benito and is described in <a href=\"https://hhsa.cosb.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Two-cases-of-2019-Novel-Coronavirus-2019-nCoV02022020HAVFinal.pdf\"><u>this announcement</u></a> from a local public health agency. Both transmissions were to the spouses of travellers who returned from Wuhan.</p><p>The Lancet paper describes the first instance of person-to-person spread in detail, with a complete timeline of travel, symptoms, and tests. A woman who returned from Wuhan to Illinois on January 13 tested positive on January 20; her husband tested positive on January 24. In the Lancet paper, a few things are striking.</p><p>The first striking thing is that the husband was not tested until he developed a fever, at which point his wife had been hospitalized with a positive test for 4 days. So, testing was very much not proactive.</p><p>The second striking thing is that they ran many different tests in parallel, and appear to have been grappling with false negatives.</p><p>The third striking thing about the Lancet paper involved monitoring of 372 contacts, of which 44 became PUIs and were tested. Of these 44, one was her husband and was positive, and this was the only household contact. The CDC report had 445 contacts and 54 people tested. So after subtracting out the Lancet study and the San Benito case, we're left with 17 household members, 56 miscellaneous contacts, and... only 9 people tested. There is no information on how those 9 tests were allocated, except that they were negative.</p><p>Of the 19 household members in the CDC study, five stayed in the house with an infected person after they were diagnosed.&nbsp;</p><p>So to summarize: Two family members of index cases were tested and were positive. Nine more tests were allocated between 17 household members and 56 miscellaneous other contacts; none of those nine tests were positive. From this, the CDC report concludes that the household secondary attack rate is 2/19 (~10%).</p><p>I would say that this is laughable, but unfortunately it isn't funny. The practical upshot of all this is that the CDC report provides <i>almost no information whatsoever</i> about the household secondary attack rate.</p><h2>Shenzhen Study</h2><p>Shenzhen is a Chinese city in Guangdong province. The <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v1.full.pdf\"><u>Shenzhen study</u></a> looks at 391 cases and 1286 close contacts between Jan 14 and Feb 12, and estimates a household secondary attack rate of 15%.</p><p>298 (76%) of the index cases were travelers. Sick people were isolated an average of 2.57 days after symptom onset (if they were being monitored for symptoms because they had been labelled as at-risk by contact tracing) or 4.64 days after symptom onset (if they weren't). The study estimates R during the observation period to have been 0.4, implying successful containment.</p><p>I have a few concerns with this study.</p><p>My first concern is that the household secondary attack rate is an important factor in peoples' decision whether to stay put when a household member is sick, which might create political pressure to find a low number. If people tried to move out when their housemates got sick, they wouldn't lower their own risk much, but they would spread it wherever they moved to.</p><p>My second concern is that 9 days before the Shenzhen study was published as a preprint, the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\"><u>Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19</u></a> stated that</p><blockquote><p>Household transmission studies are currently underway, but preliminary studies ongoing in Guangdong estimate the secondary attack rate in households ranges from 3-10%.</p></blockquote><p>I believe the Shenzhen study is the preliminary study referred to (the geographic location matches, and I can find no other studies in that geographic region which attempt to measure the rate). This seems like evidence of political pressure to report a low attack rate. (10% was the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17098951\"><u>household secondary attack rate for SARS</u></a>, and was used in some preliminary modeling of COVID-19 transmission dynamics before data was available.)</p><p>My third concern is that the paper contains three different household secondary attack rates: 15% in the Findings section, 14.9% in the Transmission Characteristics section, and 12.9% in Table 3. I cannot reconcile these numbers, and my attempts to cross-check numbers between different sections and tables within the paper all ended in mismatches and muddle.</p><p>My fourth concern is that in table 3, adding up the numbers within the category labels implies a substantial amount of data is missing, in ways that make no sense. 19% of contacts are missing a gender, 17% are missing an age, 10% are missing the annotation of whether they're a household-member or not, and 14% are missing the annotation for whether they interacted with the contact rarely, moderately often, or often. I am having a hard time imagining what sort of data collection process could do this, without being such a mess that serious errors are likely.</p><p>My fifth concern is that during the period studied, China was having significant issues with <a href=\"https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/10/WS5e40ac66a31012821727629f.html\"><u>false negatives</u></a>. Feb 12, the last day covered in the Shenzhen study, is the day before China changed its diagnostic criteria and reported a 34% one-day increase in cases. The study itself states that it changed its definition of a confirmed case changed on Feb 7, to require symptoms, \"but sensitivity analyses show that truncating the data at this point does not qualitatively impact results\". The paper reports results for many variables, and does not state which variables had sensitivity analysis performed.</p><p>These issues add up to extremely low confidence in the paper. I might change my mind if the authors release data that someone else can analyze, or someone manages to make sense of the seeming inconsistencies within it. Either of these things would surprise me.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The unfortunate practical upshot is that there's no good quantitative estimate of the household secondary attack rate (or attack rates in general). My belief, based on priors and on the observed large values for R0, is that it's probably quite high, and I will be acting accordingly; but even a small amount of non-terrible evidence could shift this belief greatly.</p></body></html>",

I&#x2019;m Lucas Perry. Today&#x2019;s conversation is with Paul Scharre and explores the issue of lethal autonomous weapons. And so just what is the relation of lethal autonomous weapons and the related policy and governance issues to AI alignment and long-term AI risk? Well there&#x2019;s a key question to keep in mind throughout this entire conversation and it&#x2019;s that: if we cannot establish a governance mechanism as a global community on the concept that we should not let AI make the decision to kill, then how can we deal with more subtle near term issues and eventual long term safety issues about AI systems? This question is aimed at exploring the idea that autonomous weapons and their related governance represent a possibly critical first step on the international cooperation and coordination of global AI issues. If we&#x2019;re committed to developing beneficial AI and eventually beneficial AGI then how important is this first step in AI governance and what precedents and foundations will it lay for future AI efforts and issues? So it&#x2019;s this perspective that I suggest keeping in mind throughout the conversation. And many thanks to FLI&#x2019;s Emilia Javorsky for much help on developing the questions for this podcast.&#xA0;</p><p>Paul Scharre is a Senior Fellow and Director of the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.

So we&#x2019;re here today to discuss your book, Army of None, and issues related to autonomous weapons in the 21st century. To start things off here, I think we can develop a little bit of the motivations for why this matters. Why should the average person care about the development and deployment of lethal autonomous weapons?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> I think the most basic reason is because we all are going to live in the world that militaries are going to be deploying future weapons. Even if you don&#x2019;t serve in the military, even if you don&#x2019;t work on issues surrounding say, conflict, this kind of technology could affect all of us. And so I think we all have a stake in what this future looks like.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Let&#x2019;s clarify a little bit more about what this technology actually looks like then. Often in common media, and for most people who don&#x2019;t know about lethal autonomous weapons or killer robots, the media often portrays it as a terminator like scenario. So could you explain why this is wrong, and what are more accurate ways of communicating with the public about what these weapons are and the unique concerns that they pose?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, I mean, the Terminator is like the first thing that comes up because it&#x2019;s such a common pop culture reference. It&#x2019;s right there in people&#x2019;s minds. So I think go ahead and for the listeners, imagine that humanoid robot in the Terminator, and then just throw that away, because that&#x2019;s not what we&#x2019;re talking about. Let me make a different comparison. Self-driving cars. We are seeing right now the evolution of automobiles that with each generation of car incorporate more autonomous features: parking, intelligent cruise control, automatic braking. These increasingly autonomous features in cars that are added every single year, a little more autonomy, a little more autonomy, are taking us down at some point in time to a road of having fully autonomous cars that would drive themselves. We have something like the Google car where there&#x2019;s no steering wheel at all. People are just passengers along for the ride. We&#x2019;re seeing something very similar happen in the military with each generation of robotic systems and we now have air and ground and undersea robots deployed all around the world in over 100 countries and non state groups around the globe with some form of drones or robotic systems, and with each generation they&#x2019;re becoming increasingly autonomous.</p><p>Now, the issue surrounding autonomous weapons is, what happens when a predator drone has as much autonomy as a self-driving car? What happens when you have a weapon that&#x2019;s out in the battlefield, and it&#x2019;s making its own decisions about whom to kill? Is that something that we&#x2019;re comfortable with? What are the legal and moral and ethical ramifications of this? And the strategic implications? What might they do for the balance of power between nations, or stability among countries? These are really the issues surrounding autonomous weapons, and it&#x2019;s really about this idea that we might have, at some point of time and perhaps the not very distant future, machines making their own decisions about whom to kill on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Could you unpack a little bit more about what autonomy really is or means because it seems to me that it&#x2019;s more like an aggregation of a bunch of different technologies like computer vision and image recognition, and other kinds of machine learning that are aggregated together. So could you just develop a little bit more about where we are in terms of the various technologies required for autonomy?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, so autonomy is not really a technology, it&#x2019;s an attribute of a machine or of a person. And autonomy is about freedom. It&#x2019;s the freedom that a machine or a person is given to perform some tasks in some environment for some period of time. As people, we have very little autonomy as children and more autonomy as we grow up, we have different autonomy in different settings. In some work environments, there might be more constraints put on you; what things you can and cannot do. And it&#x2019;s also environment-specific and task-specific. You might have autonomy to do certain things, but not other things. It&#x2019;s the same with machines. We&#x2019;re ultimately talking about giving freedom to machines to perform certain actions under certain conditions in certain environments.</p><p>There are lots of simple forms of autonomy that we interact with all the time that we sort of take for granted. A thermostat is a very simple autonomous system, it&#x2019;s a machine that&#x2019;s given a freedom to decide&#x2026; decide, let&#x2019;s put that in air quotes, because we come back to what it means for machines to decide. But basically, the thermostat is given the ability to turn on and off the heat and air conditioning based on certain parameters that a human sets, a desired temperature, or if you have a programmable thermostat, maybe the desired temperature at certain times a day or days of the week, is a very bounded kind of autonomy. And that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re talking about for any of these machines. We&#x2019;re not talking about freewill, or whether the machine develops consciousness. That&#x2019;s not a problem today, maybe someday, but certainly not with the machines we&#x2019;re talking about today. It&#x2019;s a question really of, how much freedom do we want to give machines, or in this case, weapons operating on the battlefield to make certain kinds of choices?</p><p>Now we&#x2019;re still talking about weapons that are designed by people, built by people, launched by people, and put into the battlefields to perform some mission, but there might be a little bit less human control than there is today. And then there are a whole bunch of questions that come along with that, like, is it going to work? Would it be effective? What happens if there are accidents? Are we comfortable with seeding that degree of control over to the machine?</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> You mentioned the application of this kind of technology in the context of battlefields. Is there also consideration and interest in the use of lethal autonomous weapons in civilian contexts?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, I mean, I think there&#x2019;s less energy on that topic. You certainly see less of a poll from the police community. I mean, I don&#x2019;t really run into people in a police or Homeland Security context, saying we should be building autonomous weapons. Well, you will hear that from militaries. Oftentimes, groups that are concerned about the humanitarian consequences of autonomous weapons will raise that as a concern. There&#x2019;s both what might militaries do in the battlefield, but then there&#x2019;s a concern about proliferation. What happens when the technology proliferates, and it&#x2019;s being used for internal security issues, could be a dictator, using these kinds of weapons to repress the population. That&#x2019;s one concern. And that&#x2019;s, I think, a very, very valid one. We&#x2019;ve often seen one of the last checks against dictators, is when they tell their internal security forces to fire on civilians, on their own citizens. There have been instances where the security forces say, &#x201C;No, we won&#x2019;t.&#x201D; That doesn&#x2019;t always happen. Of course, tragically, sometimes security forces do attack their citizens. We saw in the massacre in Tiananmen Square that Chinese military troops are willing to murder Chinese citizens. But we&#x2019;ve seen other instances, certainly in the fall of the Eastern Bloc at the end of the Cold War, that security forces&#x2026; these are our friends, these are our family. We&#x2019;re not going to kill them.</p><p>And autonomous weapons could take away one of those checks on dictators. So I think that&#x2019;s a very valid concern. And that is a more general concern about the proliferation of military technology into policing even here in America. We&#x2019;ve seen this in the last 20 years, is a lot of military tech ends up being used by police forces in ways that maybe isn&#x2019;t appropriate. And so that&#x2019;s, I think, a very valid and legitimate sort of concern about&#x2026; even if this isn&#x2019;t kind of the intended use, what would that look like and what are the risks that could come with that, and how should we think about those kinds of issues as well?</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right. So we&#x2019;re developing autonomy in systems and there&#x2019;s concern about how this autonomy will be deployed in context where lethal force or force may be used. So the question then arises and is sort of the question at the heart of lethal autonomous weapons: Where is it that we will draw a line between acceptable and unacceptable uses of artificial intelligence in autonomous weapons or in the military, or in civilian policing? So I&#x2019;m curious to know how you think about where to draw those lines or that line in particular, and how you would suggest to any possible regulators who might be listening, how to think about and construct lines of acceptable and unacceptable uses of AI.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> That&#x2019;s a great question. So I think let&#x2019;s take a step back first and sort of talk about, what would be the kinds of things that would make uses acceptable or unacceptable. Let&#x2019;s just talk about the military context just to kind of bound the problem for a second. So in the military context, you have a couple reasons for drawing lines, if you will. One is legal issues, legal concerns. We have a legal framework to think about right and wrong in war. It&#x2019;s called the laws of war or international humanitarian law. And it lays out a set of parameters for what is acceptable and what&#x2026; And so that&#x2019;s one of the places where there has been consensus internationally, among countries that come together at the United Nations through the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the CCW, the process, we&#x2019;ve had conversations going on about autonomous weapons.</p><p>One of the points of consensus among nations is that existing international humanitarian law or the laws of war would apply to autonomous weapons. And that any uses of autonomy in weapons, those weapons have to be used in a manner that complies with the laws of war. Now, that may sound trivial, but it&#x2019;s a pretty significant point of agreement and it&#x2019;s one that places some bounds on things that you can or cannot do. So, for example, one of the baseline principles of the laws of war is the principle of distinction. Military forces cannot intentionally target civilians. They can only intentionally target other military forces. And so any use of force these people to comply with this distinction, so right off the bat, that&#x2019;s a very important and significant one when it comes to autonomous weapons. So if you have to use a weapon that could not be used in a way to comply with this principle of distinction, it would be illegal under the laws war and you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to build it.</p><p>And there are other principles as well, principles about proportionality, and ensuring that any collateral damage that affects civilians or civilian infrastructure is not disproportionate to the military necessity of the target that is being attacked. There are principles about avoiding unnecessary suffering of combatants. Respecting anyone who&#x2019;s rendered out of combat or the appropriate term is &#x201C;hors de combat,&#x201D; who surrendered have been incapacitated and not targeting them. So these are like very significant rules that any weapon system, autonomous weapon or not, has to comply with. And any use of any weapon has to comply with, any use of force. And so that is something that constrains considerably what nations are permitted to do in a lawful fashion. Now do people break the laws of war? Well, sure, that happens. We&#x2019;re seeing that happen in Syria today, Bashar al-Assad is murdering civilians, there are examples of Rogue actors and non state terrorist groups and others that don&#x2019;t care about respecting the laws of war. But those are very significant bounds.</p><p>Now, one could also say that there are more bounds that we should put on autonomous weapons that might be moral or ethical considerations that exist outside the laws of war, that aren&#x2019;t written down in a formal way in the laws of war, but they&#x2019;re still important and I think those often come to the fore with this topic. And there are other ones that might apply in terms of reasons why we might be concerned about stability among nations. But the laws of war, at least a very valuable starting point for this conversation about what is acceptable and not acceptable. I want to make clear, I&#x2019;m not saying that the laws of war are insufficient, and we need to go beyond them and add in additional constraints. I&#x2019;m actually not saying that. There are people that make that argument, and I want to give credit to their argument, and not pretend it doesn&#x2019;t exist. I want the listeners to sort of understand the full scope of arguments about this technology. But I&#x2019;m not saying myself that&#x2019;s the case necessarily. But I do think that there are concerns that people raise.</p><p>For example, people might say it&#x2019;s wrong for a machine to decide whom to kill, it&#x2019;s wrong for a machine to make the decision about life and death. Now I think that&#x2019;s an interesting argument. Why? Why is it wrong? Is it because we think the machine might get the answer wrong, it might perform not as well as the humans because I think that there&#x2019;s something intrinsic about weighing the value of life and death that we want humans to do, and appreciating the value of another person&#x2019;s life before making one of these decisions. Those are all very valid counter arguments that exist in this space.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yes. So thanks for clarifying that. For listeners, it&#x2019;s important here to clarify the difference where some people you&#x2019;re saying would find the laws of war to be sufficient in the case of autonomous weapons, and some would not.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, I mean, this is a hotly debated issue. I mean, this is in many ways, the crux of the issue surrounding autonomous weapons. I&#x2019;m going to oversimplify a bit because you have a variety of different views on this, but you certainly have some people whose views are, look, we have a set of structures called the laws of war that tell us what right and wrong looks like and more. And most of the things that people are worried about are already prohibited under the laws of war. So for example, if what you&#x2019;re worried about is autonomous weapons, running amok murdering civilians, that&#x2019;s illegal under the laws of war. And so one of the points of pushback that you&#x2019;ll sometimes get from governments or others to the idea of creating like an ad hoc treaty that would ban autonomous weapons or some class of autonomous weapons, is look, some of the things people worry about like they&#x2019;re already prohibited under the laws of war, passing another law to say the thing that&#x2019;s already illegal is now illegal again doesn&#x2019;t add any value.</p><p>There&#x2019;s group of arguments that says the laws of war dictate effects in the battlefield. So they dictate sort of what the end effect is, they don&#x2019;t really affect the process. And there&#x2019;s a line of reasoning that says, that&#x2019;s fine. The process doesn&#x2019;t matter. If someday we could use autonomous weapons in a way that was more humane and more precise than people, then we should use them. And just the same way that self-driving cars will someday save lives on roads by avoiding accidents, maybe we could build autonomous weapons that would avoid mistakes in war and accidentally targeting civilians, and therefore we should use them. And let&#x2019;s just focus on complying better with the laws of war. That&#x2019;s one school of thought.</p><p>Then there&#x2019;s a whole bunch of reasons why you might say, well, that&#x2019;s not enough. One reason might be, well, militaries&#x2019; compliance with the laws of war. Isn&#x2019;t that great? Actually, like people talk a good game, but when you look at military practice, especially if the rules for using weapon are kind of convoluted, you have to take a bunch of additional steps in order to use it in a way that&#x2019;s lawful, that kind of goes out the window in conflict. Real world and tragic historical example of this was experienced throughout the 20th century with landmines where land mines were permitted to be used lawfully, and still are, if you&#x2019;re not a signatory to the Ottawa Convention, they&#x2019;re permitted to be used lawfully provided you put in a whole bunch of procedures to make sure that minefields are marked and we know the location of minefields, so they can be demined after conflict.</p><p>Now, in practice, countries weren&#x2019;t doing this. I mean, many of them were just scattering mines from the air. And so we had this horrific problem of millions of mines around the globe persisting after a conflict. The response was basically this global movement to ban mines entirely to say, look, it&#x2019;s not that it&#x2019;s inconceivable to use mines in a way that you mean, but it requires a whole bunch of additional efforts, that countries aren&#x2019;t doing, and so we have to take this weapon away from countries because they are not actually using it in a way that&#x2019;s responsible. That&#x2019;s a school of thought with autonomous weapons. Is look, maybe you can conjure up thought experiments about how you can use autonomous weapons in these very specific instances, and it&#x2019;s acceptable, but once you start any use, it&#x2019;s a slippery slope, and next thing you know, it&#x2019;ll be just like landmines all over again, and they&#x2019;ll be everywhere and civilians will be being killed. And so the better thing to do is to just not let this process even start, and not letting militaries have access to the technology because they won&#x2019;t use it responsibly, regardless of whether it&#x2019;s theoretically possible. That&#x2019;s a pretty reasonable and defensible argument. And there are other arguments too.</p><p>One could say, actually, it&#x2019;s not just about avoiding civilian harm, but there&#x2019;s something intrinsic about weighing the value of an enemy soldier&#x2019;s life, that we want humans involved in that process. And that if we took humans away from that process, we&#x2019;ll be losing something that sure maybe it&#x2019;s not written down in the laws of war, but maybe it&#x2019;s not written down because it was always implicit that humans will always be making these choices. And now that it&#x2019;s decision in front of us, we should write this down, that humans should be involved in these decisions and should be weighing the value of the human life, even an enemy soldier. Because if we give that up, we might give up something that is a constraint on violence and war that holds back some of the worst excesses of violence, we might even can make something about ourselves. And this is, I think, a really tricky issue because there&#x2019;s a cost to humans making these decisions. It&#x2019;s a very real cost. It&#x2019;s a cost in post traumatic stress that soldiers face and moral injury. It&#x2019;s a cost in lives that are ruined, not just the people that are killed in a battlefield, but the people have to live with that violence afterwards, and the ramifications and even the choices that they themselves make. It&#x2019;s a cost in suicides of veterans, and substance abuse and destroyed families and lives.</p><p>And so to say that we want humans to stay still evolved to be more than responsible for killing, is to say I&#x2019;m choosing that cost. I&#x2019;m choosing to absorb and acknowledge and take on the cost of post traumatic stress and moral injury, and also the burdens that come with war. And I think it&#x2019;s worth reflecting on the fact that the burdens of war are distributed very unequally, not just between combatants, but also on the societies that fight. As a democratic nation in the United States, we make a decision as a country to go to war, through our elected representatives. And yet, it&#x2019;s a very tiny slice of the population that bears the burden for that war, not just putting themselves at risk, but also carrying the moral burden of that afterwards.</p><p>And so if you say, well, I want there to be someone who&#x2019;s going to live with that trauma for the rest of your life. I think that&#x2019;s an argument that one can make, but you need to acknowledge that that&#x2019;s real. And that&#x2019;s not a burden that we all share equally, it&#x2019;s a burden we&#x2019;re placing on young women and men that we send off to fight on our behalf. The flip side is if we didn&#x2019;t do that, if we fought a war and no one felt the moral burden of killing, no one slept uneasy at night afterwards, what would they say about us as a society? I think these are difficult questions. I don&#x2019;t have easy answers to that. But I think these are challenging things for us to wrestle with.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yes, I mean, there&#x2019;s a lot there. I think that was a really good illustration of the different points of views on this. I hadn&#x2019;t heard or considered much the implications of post traumatic stress. And I think moral burden, you called it that would be a factor in what autonomous weapons would relieve in countries which have the power to develop them. Speaking personally, I think I find the arguments most compelling about the necessity of having human beings integrated in the process of decision making with regards to killing, because if you remove that, then you&#x2019;re removing the deep aspect of humanity, which sometimes does not follow the laws of war, which we currently don&#x2019;t have complex enough preference learning techniques and machine learning techniques to actually train autonomous weapon systems in everything that human beings value and care about, and that there are situations where deviating from following the laws of war may be the best thing to do. I&#x2019;m not sure if you have any thoughts about this, but I think you did a good job of illustrating all the different positions, and that&#x2019;s just my initial reaction to it.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, these are tricky issues. And so I think one of the things I want to try to do for listeners is try to lay out the landscape of what these arguments are, and some of the pros and cons of them because I think sometimes they will often oversimplify on all sides. The other people will be like, well, we should have humans involved in making these decisions. Well, humans involved where? If I get into a self-driving car that has no steering wheel, it&#x2019;s not true that there&#x2019;s no human involvement. The type of human involvement has just changed in terms of where it exists. So now, instead of manually driving the car, I&#x2019;m still choosing the car&#x2019;s destination, I&#x2019;m still telling the car where I want to go. You&#x2019;re going to get into the car and car take me wherever you want to go. So the type of human involvement is changed.</p><p>So what kind of human relationship do we want with decisions about life and death in the battlefield? What type of human involvement is right or necessary or appropriate and for what reason? For a legal reason, for a moral reason. These are interesting challenges. We haven&#x2019;t had to confront anymore. These arguments I think unfairly get simplified on all sides. Conversely, you hear people say things like, it doesn&#x2019;t matter, because these weapons are going to get built anyway. It&#x2019;s a little bit overly simplistic in the sense that there are examples of successes in arms control. It&#x2019;s hard to pull off. There are many examples of failures as well, but there are places where civilized nations have walked back from some technologies to varying degrees of success, whether it&#x2019;s chemical weapons or biological weapons or other things. So what is success look like in constraining a weapon? Is it no one ever uses the weapon? Is it most nations don&#x2019;t use it? It&#x2019;s not used in certain ways. These are complicated issues.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Right. So let&#x2019;s talk a little bit here about integrating human emotion and human reasoning and humanity itself into the autonomous weapon systems and the life or death decisions that they will be making. So hitting on a few concepts here, if you could help explain what people mean when they say human in the loop, and human on the loop, and how this relates to the integration of human control and human responsibility and human accountability in the use of autonomous weapons.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Let&#x2019;s unpack some of this terminology. Broadly speaking, people tend to use the terms human in the loop, on the loop, or out of the loop to refer to semi autonomous weapons human is in the loop, which means that for any really semi autonomous process or system, the machine is taking an action and then it pauses and waits for humans to take a positive action before proceeding. A good example of a human in the loop system is the automated backups on your computer when they require you to push a button to say okay to do the backup now. They&#x2019;re waiting music in action before proceeding. In a human on the loop system, or one where the supervisor control is one of the human doesn&#x2019;t have to take any positive action for the system to proceed. The human can intervene, so the human can sit back, and if you want to, you can jump in.</p><p>Example of this might be your thermostat. When you&#x2019;re in a house, you&#x2019;ve already set the parameters, it&#x2019;ll turn on the heat and air conditioning on its own, but if you&#x2019;re not happy with the outcome, you could change it. Now, when you&#x2019;re out of the house, your thermostat is operating in a fully autonomous fashion in this respect where humans out of the loop. You don&#x2019;t have any ability to intervene for some period of time. It&#x2019;s really all about time duration. For supervisory control, how much time does the human have to identify something is wrong and then intervene? So for example, things like the Tesla autopilots. That&#x2019;s one where the human is in a supervisory control capacity. So the autopilot function in a car, the human doesn&#x2019;t have to do anything, car&#x2019;s driving itself, but they can intervene.</p><p>The problem with some of those control architectures is the time that you are permitting people to identify that there&#x2019;s a problem, figure out what&#x2019;s going on, decide to take action, intervene, really realistic before harm happens. Is it realistic that a human can be not paying attention, and then all of a sudden, identify that the car is in trouble and leap into action to avoid an accident when you&#x2019;re speeding on the highway 70 miles an hour? And then you can see quite clearly in a number of fatal accidents with these autopilots, that that&#x2019;s not feasible. People actually aren&#x2019;t capable of doing that. So you&#x2019;ve got to think about sort of what is the role of the human in this process? This is not just a semi autonomous or supervised autonomous or fully autonomous process. It&#x2019;s one where the human is involved in some varying capacity.</p><p>And what are we expecting the human to do? Same thing with something that&#x2019;s fully autonomous. We&#x2019;re talking about a system that&#x2019;s operating on its own for some period of time. How long before it checks back in with a person? What information is that person given? And what is their capacity to intervene or how bad could things go wrong when the person is not involved? And when we talk about weapons specifically. There are lots of weapons that operate in a semi autonomous fashion today where the human is choosing the target, but there&#x2019;s a lot of automation in IDing targets presenting information to people in actually carrying out an attack, once the human has chosen a target, there are many, many weapons that are what the military calls fire and forget weapon, so once it&#x2019;s launched, it&#x2019;s not coming back. Those have been widely used for 70 years since World War Two. So that&#x2019;s not new.</p><p>There are a whole bunch of weapons that operate in a supervisory autonomy mode, where humans on the loop. These are generally used in a more limited fashion for immediate localized defense of air bases or ships or ground vehicles defending against air or missile or rocket attack, particularly when the speed of these attacks might overwhelm people&#x2019;s ability to respond. For humans to be in the loop, for humans to push a button, every time there&#x2019;s a missile coming in, you could have so many missiles coming in so fast that you have to just simply activate an automatic defensive mode that will shoot down all have the missiles based on some pre-programmed parameters that humans put into the system. This exists today. The systems have been around for decades since the 1980s. And there were widespread use with at least 30 countries around the globe. So this is a type of weapon system that&#x2019;s already in operation. These supervisory autonomous weapons. What really would be new would be fully autonomous weapons that operate on their own, whereas humans are still building them and launching them, but humans put them into operation, and then there&#x2019;s some period of time where they were able to search a target area for targets and they were able to find these targets, and then based on some programming that was designed by people, identify the targets and attack them on their own.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Would you consider that out of the loop for that period of time?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Exactly. So over that period of time, humans are out of the loop on that decision over which targets they&#x2019;re attacking. That would be potentially largely a new development in war. There are some isolated cases of some weapon systems that cross this line, by in large that would be new. That&#x2019;s at least the starting point of what people might be concerned about. Now, you might envision things that are more advanced beyond that, but that&#x2019;s sort of the near term development that could be on the horizon in the next five to 15 years, telling the weapon system, go into this area, fly around or search around underwater and find any ships of this type and attack them for some period of time in space. And that changes the human&#x2019;s relationship with the use of force a little bit. It doesn&#x2019;t mean the humans not involved at all, but the humans not quite as involved as they used to be. And is that something we&#x2019;re comfortable with? And what are the implications of that kind of shift in warfare.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So the relevant things here are how this helps to integrate human control and human responsibility and human accountability into autonomous weapons systems. And just hearing you speak about all of that, it also seems like very relevant questions have to do with human psychology, about what human beings are actually likely to be able to do. And then also, I think you articulately put the practical question of whether or not people will be able to react to certain threats given certain situations. So in terms of trying to understand acceptable and unacceptable uses of autonomous weapons, that seems to supervene upon a lot of these facets of benefits and disadvantages of in the loop, on the loop, and out of the loop for different situations and different risks, plus how much we&#x2019;re willing to automate killing and death and remove human decision making from some of these situations or not.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, I mean, I think what&#x2019;s challenging in this space is that it would be nice, it would be ideal if we could sort of reach agreement among nations for sort of a lethal laws of robotics, and Isaac Asimov&#x2019;s books about robots you think of these three laws of robotics. Well, those laws aren&#x2019;t going to work because one of them is not harming a human being and it&#x2019;s not going to work in the military context, but could there be some agreement among countries for lethal laws of robots that would govern the behavior of autonomous systems in war, and it might sort of say, these are the things that are acceptable or not? Maybe. Maybe that&#x2019;s possible someday. I think we&#x2019;re not there yet at least, there are certainly not agreement as widespread disagreement among nations about what approach to take. But the good starting position of trying to understand what are the goals we want to achieve. And I think you&#x2019;re right that we need to keep the human sort of front and center. But I this this is like a really important asymmetry between humans and machines that&#x2019;s worth highlighting, which is to say that the laws of war government effects in the battlefield, and then in that sentence, the laws of war, don&#x2019;t say the human has to pick every target, the laws of war say that the use of force must be executed according to certain principles of distinction and proportionality and other things.</p><p>One important asymmetry in the laws of war, however, is that machines are not legal agents. Only humans have legal agents. And so it&#x2019;s ultimately humans that are responsible for complying with the laws of war. You can&#x2019;t put a machine on trial for a war crime. It doesn&#x2019;t make sense. It doesn&#x2019;t have intentionality. So it&#x2019;s ultimately a human responsibility to ensure this kind of compliance with the laws of war. It&#x2019;s a good starting point then for conversation to try to understand if we start from that proposition that it&#x2019;s a human responsibility to ensure compliance with the laws of war, then what follows from that? What balances that place on human involvement? One of the early parts of the conversations on autonomous weapons internationally came from this very technological based conversation. To say, well, based on the technology, draw these lines, you should put these limits in place. The problem with that approach is not that you can&#x2019;t do it.</p><p>The problem is the state of the technology when? 2014 when discussions on autonomous weapons started at the very beginning of the deep learning revolution, today, in 2020, our estimate of whether technology might be in five years or 10 years or 50 years? The technology moving so quickly than any technologically based set of rules about how we should approach this problem and what is the appropriate use of machines versus human decision making in the use of force. Any technologically based answer is one that we may look back in 10 years or 20 years and say is wrong. We could get it wrong in the sense that we might be leaving valuable technological opportunities on the table and we&#x2019;re banning technology that if we used it actually might make war more humane and reduce civilian casualties, or we might be permitting technologies that turned out in retrospect to be problematic, and we shouldn&#x2019;t have done that.</p><p>And one of the things we&#x2019;ve seen historically when you look at attempts to ban weapons is that ones that are technologically based don&#x2019;t always fare very well over time. So for example, the early bans on poison gas banned the use of poison gas that are launched from artillery shells. It allowed actually poison gas administered via canisters, and so the first use of poison gas in World War One by the Germans was canister based, they actually just laid out little canisters and then open the valves. Now that turns out to be not very practical way of using poison gas in war, because you have someone basically on your side standing over this canister, opening a valve and then getting gassed. And so it&#x2019;s a little bit tricky, but technically permissible.</p><p>One of the things that can be challenging is it&#x2019;s hard to foresee how the technology is going to evolve. A better approach and one that we&#x2019;ve seen the dialogue internationally sort of shift towards is our human-centered approach. To start from the position of the human and say, look, if we had all the technology in the world and war, what decisions would we want humans to make and why? Not because the technology cannot make decisions, but because it should not. I think it&#x2019;s actually a very valuable starting place to understand a conversation, because the technology is moving so quickly.</p><p>What role do we want humans to play in warfare, and why do we think this is the case? Are there some tasks in war, or some decisions that we think are fundamentally human that should be decisions that only humans should make and we shouldn&#x2019;t hand off to machines? I think that&#x2019;s a really valuable starting position then to try to better interrogate how do we want to use this technology going forward? Because the landscape of technological opportunity is going to keep expanding. And so what do we want to do with this technology? How do we want to use it? And are there ways that we can use this technology that keeps humans in control of the use of force in the battlefield? Keep humans legally and morally and ethically responsible, but may make war more humane in the process, that may make war more precise, that may reduce civilian casualties without losing our humanity in the process.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So I guess the thought experiment, there would be like, if we had weapons that let us just delete people instantly without consequences, how would we want human decision making to be integrated with that? Reflecting on that also makes me consider this other point that I think is also important for my considerations around lethal autonomous weapons, which is the necessity of integrating human experience in the consequences of war, the pain and the suffering and the carnage and the PTSD as being almost necessary vehicles to some extent to make us tired of it to integrate how horrible it is. So I guess I would just be interested in integrating that perspective into it not just being about humans making decisions and the decisions being integrated in the execution process, but also about the experiential ramifications of being in relation to what actually happens in war and what violence is like and what happens in violence.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Well, I think that we want to unpack a little bit some of the things you&#x2019;re talking about. Are we talking about ensuring that there is an accurate representation to the people carrying out the violence about what&#x2019;s happening on the other end, that we&#x2019;re not sanitizing things. And I think that&#x2019;s a fair point. When we begin to put more psychological barriers between the person making the decision and the effects, it might be easier for them to carry out larger scale attacks, versus actually making war and more horrible. Now that&#x2019;s a line of reasoning, I suppose, to say we should make war more horrible, so there&#x2019;ll be less of it. I&#x2019;m not sure we might get the outcome that there is less of it. We just might have more horrible war, but that&#x2019;s a different issue. Those are more difficult questions.</p><p>I will say that I often hear philosophers raising things about skin in the game. I rarely hear them being raised by people who have had skin in the game, who have experienced up close in a personal way the horrors of war. And I&#x2019;m less convinced that there&#x2019;s a lot of good that comes from the tragedy of war. I think there&#x2019;s value in us trying to think about how do we make war less terrible? How do we reduce civilian casualties? How do we have less war? But this often comes up in the context of technologies like we should somehow put ourselves at risk. No military does that, no military has ever done that in human history. The whole purpose of militaries getting technology in training is to get an advantage on the adversary. It&#x2019;s not a fair fight. It&#x2019;s not supposed to be, it&#x2019;s not a boxing match. So these are things worth exploring. We need to come from the standpoint of the reality of what war is and not from a philosophical exercise about war might be, but deal with the realities of what actually occurs in the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So I think that&#x2019;s a really interesting point. And as someone with a background and interest in philosophy, it&#x2019;s quite funny. So you do have experience in war, right?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, I&#x2019;ve fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Then it&#x2019;s interesting for me, if you see this distinction between people who are actually veterans, who have experienced violence and carnage and tragedies of war, and the perspective here is that PTSD and associated trauma with these kinds of experiences, you find that they&#x2019;re less salient for decreasing people&#x2019;s willingness or decision to engage in further war. Is that your claim?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> I don&#x2019;t know. No, I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t know the answer to that. I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s some difficult question for political scientists to figure out about voting preferences of veterans. All I&#x2019;m saying is that I hear a lot of claims in this space that I think are often not very well interrogated or not very well explored. And there&#x2019;s a real price that people pay for being involved. Now, people want to say that we&#x2019;re willing to bear that price for some reason, like okay, but I think we should acknowledge it.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yeah, that make sense. I guess the thing that I was just pointing at was it would be psychologically interesting to know if philosophers are detached from the experience, maybe they don&#x2019;t actually know about the psychological implications of being involved in horrible war. And if people who are actually veterans disagree with philosophers about the importance of there being skin in the game, if philosophers say that skin in the game reduces willingness to be in war, if the claim is that that wouldn&#x2019;t actually decrease their willingness to go to war. I think that seems psychologically very important and relevant, because there is this concern about how autonomous weapons and integrating human decision making to lethal autonomous weapons would potentially sanitize war. And so there&#x2019;s the trade off between the potential mitigating effects of being involved in war, and then also the negative effects which are incurred by veterans who would actually have to be exposed by it and bring the trauma back for communities to have deeper experiential relation with.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, and look, we don&#x2019;t do that, right? We had a whole generation of veterans come back from Vietnam and we as society listen to the stories and understand them and understand, no. I have heard over the years people raise this issue whether it&#x2019;s drones, autonomous weapons, this issue of having skin in the game either physically being at risk or psychologically. And I&#x2019;ve rarely heard it raised by people who it&#x2019;s been them who&#x2019;s on the line. People often have very gut emotional reactions to this topic. And I think that&#x2019;s valuable because it&#x2019;s speaking to something that resonates with people, whether it&#x2019;s an emotional reaction opposed to autonomous weapons, and that you often get that from many people that go, there&#x2019;s something about this. It doesn&#x2019;t feel right. I don&#x2019;t like this idea. Or people saying, the opposite reaction. Other people that say that &#x201C;wouldn&#x2019;t this make war great, it&#x2019;s more precise and more humane,&#x201D; and which my reaction is often a little bit like&#x2026; have you ever interacted with a computer? They break all the time. What are you talking about?</p><p>But all of these things I think they&#x2019;re speaking to instincts that people have about this technology, but it&#x2019;s worth asking questions to better understand, what is it that we&#x2019;re reacting to? Is it an assumption about the technologies, is it an assumption about the nature of war? One of the concerns I&#x2019;ve heard raised is like this will impersonalize war and create more distance between people killing. If you sort of buy that argument, that impersonal war is a bad thing, then you would say the greatest thing would be deeply personal war, like hand to hand combat. It appears to harken back to some glorious age of war when people looked each other in the eye and hacked each other to bits with swords, like real humans. That&#x2019;s not that that war never occurred in human history. In fact, we&#x2019;ve had conflicts like that, even in recent memory that involve hand to hand weapons. They tend not to be very humane conflicts. When we see civil violence, when people are murdering each other with machetes or garden tools or other things, it tends to be horrific communal violence, mass atrocities in Rwanda or Cambodia or other places. So I think it&#x2019;s important to deal with the reality of what war is and not some fantasy.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Yes, I think that that makes a lot of sense. It&#x2019;s really tricky. And the psychology around this I think is difficult and probably not studied enough.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> There&#x2019;s real war that occurs in the world, and then there&#x2019;s the fantasy of war that we, as a society, tell ourselves when we go to movie theaters, and we watch stories about soldiers who are heroes, who conquer the bad guys. We&#x2019;re told a fantasy, and it&#x2019;s a fantasy as a society that allows society to perpetuate wars, that allows us to send young men and women off to die. And it&#x2019;s not to say that there are no circumstances in which a nation might need to go to war to defend itself or its interest, but we sort of dress war up in these pretty clothes, and let&#x2019;s not confuse that with the reality of what actually occurs. People said, well, through autonomous weapons, then we won&#x2019;t have people sort of weighing the value of life and death. I mean, it happens sometimes, but it&#x2019;s not like every time someone dies in war, that there was this thoughtful exercise where a committee sat around and said, &#x201C;Do we really need to kill this person? Is it really appropriate?&#x201D; There&#x2019;s a lot of dehumanization that goes on on the battlefield. So I think this is what makes this issue very challenging. Many of the objections to autonomous weapons are objections to war. That&#x2019;s what people are actually objecting to.</p><p>The question isn&#x2019;t, is war bad? Of course war&#x2019;s terrible? The question is sort of, how do we find ways going forward to use technology that may make war more precise and more humane without losing our humanity in the process, and are ways to do that? It&#x2019;s a challenging question. I think the answer is probably yes, but it&#x2019;s one that&#x2019;s going to require a lot of interrogation to try to get there. It&#x2019;s a difficult issue because it&#x2019;s also a dynamic process where there&#x2019;s an interplay between competitors. If we get this wrong, we can easily end up in a situation where there&#x2019;s less human control, there&#x2019;s more violence and war. There are lots of opportunities to make things worse as well.</p><p>If we could make war perfect, that would be great, in terms of no civilian suffering and reduce the suffering of enemy combatants and the number of lives lost. If we could push a button and make war go away, that would be wonderful. Those things will all be great. The more practical question really is, can we improve upon the status quo and how can we do so in a thoughtful way, or at least not make things worse than today? And I think those are hard enough problems to try to address.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> I appreciate that you bring a very holistic, well-weighed perspective to the varying sides of this issue. So these are all very big and difficult. Are you aware of people actually studying whether some of these effects exist or not, and whether they would actually sanitize things or not? Or is this basically all just coming down to people&#x2019;s intuitions and simulations in their head?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Some of both. There&#x2019;s really great scholarship that&#x2019;s being done on autonomous weapons, certainly there&#x2019;s a robust array of legal based scholarship, people trying to understand how the law of war might interface with autonomous weapons. But there&#x2019;s also been worked on by thinking about some of these human psychological interactions, Missy Cummings, who&#x2019;s at Duke who runs the humans and automation lab down has done some work on human machine interfaces on weapon systems to think through some of these concerns. I think probably less attention paid to the human machine interface dimension of this and the human psychological dimension of it. But there&#x2019;s been a lot of work done by people like Heather Roth, people at Article 36, and others thinking about concepts of meaningful human control and what might look like in weapon systems.</p><p>I think one of the things that&#x2019;s challenging across the board in this issue is that it is a politically contentious topic. You have kind of levels of this debate going on, you have scholars trying to sort of understand the issue maybe, and then you also have a whole array of politically motivated groups, international organizations, civil society organizations, countries, duking it out basically, at the UN and in the media about where we should go with this technology. As you get a lot of motivated reasoning on all sides about what should the answer be. So for example, one of the things that fascinates me is i&#x2019;ll often hear people say, autonomous weapons are terrible, and they&#x2019;ll have a terrible outcome, and we need to ban them now. And if we just pass a treaty and we have enough political will we could ban them. I&#x2019;ll also hear people say a ban would be pointless, it wouldn&#x2019;t work. And anyways, wouldn&#x2019;t autonomous weapons be great? There are other possible beliefs. One could say that a ban is feasible, but the weapons aren&#x2019;t that big of a deal. So it just seems to me like there&#x2019;s a lot of politically motivated reasoning that goes on this debate, which makes it very challenging.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So one of the concerns around autonomous weapons has to do with accidental escalation of warfare and conflict. Could you explore this point and explain what some strategies might be to prevent accidental escalation of warfare as AI is increasingly being used in the military?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, so I think in general, you could bucket maybe concerns about autonomous weapons into two categories. One is a concern that they may not function very well and could have accidents, those accidents could lead to civilian casualties, that could lead to accidental escalation among nations and a crisis, military force forces operating in close proximity to one another and there could be accidents. This happens with people. And you might worry about actions with autonomous systems and maybe one shoots down an enemy aircraft and there&#x2019;s an escalation and people are killed. And then how do you unwind that? How do you communicate to your adversary? We didn&#x2019;t mean to do that. We&#x2019;re sorry. How do you do that in a period of tension? That&#x2019;s a particular challenge.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a whole other set of challenges that come from the weapons might work. And that might get to some of these deeper questions about the role of humans in decision making about life and death. But this issue of accidental escalation kind of comes into the category of they don&#x2019;t work very well, then they&#x2019;re not reliable. And this is the case for a lot of AI and autonomous technology today, which isn&#x2019;t to say it doesn&#x2019;t work at all, if it didn&#x2019;t work at all, it would be much easier. There&#x2019;d be no debates about bias and facial recognition systems if they never identify faces. There&#x2019;d be no debates about safety with self-driving cars if the car couldn&#x2019;t go anywhere. The problem is that a lot of these AI based systems work very well in some settings, and then if the settings change ever so slightly, they don&#x2019;t work very well at all anymore. And the performance can drop off very dramatically, and they&#x2019;re not very robust to changes in environmental conditions. So this is a huge problem for the military, because in particular, the military doesn&#x2019;t get to test its systems in its actual operating environment.</p><p>So you can take a car, and you can take it on the roads, and you can test it in an actual driving environment. And we&#x2019;ve seen car companies rack up 10 million miles or more of driving data. And then they can go back and they can run simulations. So Waymo has said that they run 10 million miles of simulated driving every single day. And they can simulate in different lighting conditions, in different environmental conditions. Well, the military can build simulations too, but simulations of what? What will the next war look like? Well we don&#x2019;t know because we haven&#x2019;t fought it yet. The good news is that war&#x2019;s very rare, which is great. But that also means that for these kinds of systems, we don&#x2019;t necessarily know the operating conditions that they&#x2019;ll be in, and so there is this real problem of this risk of accidents. And it&#x2019;s exacerbated in the fact that this is also a very adversarial environment. So you actually have an enemy who&#x2019;s trying to trick your system and manipulate it. That&#x2019;s adds another layer of complications.</p><p>Driving is a little bit competitive, maybe somebody doesn&#x2019;t want to let you into the lane, but the pedestrians aren&#x2019;t generally trying to get hit by cars. That&#x2019;s a whole other complication in the military space. So all of that leads to concerns that the systems may do okay in training, and then we take them out in the real world, and they fail and they fail a pretty bad way. If it&#x2019;s a weapon system that is making its own decisions about whom to kill, it could be that it fails in a benign way, then it targets nothing. And that&#x2019;s a problem for the military who built it, or fails in a more hazardous way, in a dangerous way and attacks the wrong targets. And when we&#x2019;re talking about an autonomous weapon, the essence of this autonomous weapon is making its own decisions about which targets to attack and then carrying out those attacks. If you get that wrong, those could be pretty significant consequences with that. One of those things could be civilian harm. And that&#x2019;s a major concern. There are processes in place for printing that operationally and test and evaluation, are those sufficient? I think they&#x2019;re good reasons to say that maybe they&#x2019;re not sufficient or not completely sufficient, and they need to be revised or improved.</p><p>And I&#x2019;ll point out, we can come back to this that the US Defense Department actually has a more stringent procedure in place for reviewing autonomous weapons more than other weapons, beyond what the laws of war have, the US is one of the few countries that has this. But then there&#x2019;s also question about accidental escalation, which also could be the case. Would that lead to like an entire war? Probably not. But it could make things a lot harder to defuse tensions in a crisis, and that could be problematic. So we just had an incident not too long ago, where the United States carried out an attack against the very senior Iranian General, General Soleimani, who&#x2019;s the head of the Iranian Quds Force and killed him in a drone strike. And that was an intentional decision made by a person somewhere in the US government.</p><p>Now, did they fully think that through? I don&#x2019;t know, that&#x2019;s a different question. But a human made that decision in any case. Well, that&#x2019;s a huge escalation of hostilities between the US and Iraq. And there was a lot of uncertainty afterwards about what would happen and Iran launched some ballistic missiles against US troops in Iraq. And whether that&#x2019;s it, or there&#x2019;s more retaliation to come, I think we&#x2019;ll see. But it could be a much more challenging situation, if you had a situation in the future where an autonomous weapon malfunctioned and took some action. And now the other side might feel compelled to respond. They might say, well, we have to, we can&#x2019;t let this go. Because humans emotions are on the line and national pride and prestige, and they feel like they need to maintain a principle of deterrence and they need to retaliate it. So these could all be very complicated things if you had an accident with an autonomous weapon.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Right. And so an adjacent issue that I&#x2019;d like to explore now is how a potential arms race can have interplay with issues around accidental escalation of conflict. So is there already an arms race brewing for autonomous weapons? If so, why and what could potentially be done to deescalate such a situation?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> If there&#x2019;s an arms race, it&#x2019;s a very strange one because no one is building the weapons. We see militaries advancing in robotics and autonomy, but we don&#x2019;t really see sort of this rush to build autonomous weapons. I struggle to point to any programs that I&#x2019;m aware of in militaries around the globe that are clearly oriented to build fully autonomous weapons. I think there are lots of places where much like these incremental advancements of autonomy in cars, you can see more autonomous features in military vehicles and drones and robotic systems and missiles. They&#x2019;re adding more autonomy. And one might be violently concerned about where that&#x2019;s going. But it&#x2019;s just simply not the case that militaries have declared their intention. We&#x2019;re going to build autonomous weapons, and here they are, and here&#x2019;s our program to build them. I would struggle to use the term arms race. It could happen, maybe worth a starting line of an arms race. But I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re in one today by any means.</p><p>It&#x2019;s worth also asking, when we say arms race, what do we mean and why do we care? This is again, one of these terms, it&#x2019;s often thrown around. You&#x2019;ll hear about this, the concept of autonomous weapons or AI, people say we shouldn&#x2019;t have an arms race. Okay. Why? Why is an arms race a bad thing? Militaries normally invest in new technologies to improve their national defense. That&#x2019;s a normal activity. So if you say arms race, what do you mean by that? Is it beyond normal activity? And why would that be problematic? In the political science world, the specific definitions vary, but generally, an arms race is viewed as an increase in defense spending overall, or in a particular technology area above normal levels of modernizing militaries. Now, usually, this is problematic for a couple of reasons. One could be that it ends up just in a massive national expenditure, like during the case of the Cold War, nuclear weapons, that doesn&#x2019;t really yield any military value or increase anyone&#x2019;s defense or security, it just ends up net flushing a lot of money down the drain. That&#x2019;s money that could be spent elsewhere for pre K education or healthcare or something else that might be societally beneficial instead of building all of these weapons. So that&#x2019;s one concern.</p><p>Another one might be that we end up in a world that the large number of these weapons or the type of their weapons makes it worse off. Are we really better off in a world where there are 10s of thousands of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger versus a few thousand weapons or a few hundred weapons? Well, if we ever have zero, all things being equal, probably fewer nuclear weapons is better than more of them. So that&#x2019;s another kind of concern whether in terms of violence and destructiveness of war, if a war breakout or the likelihood of war and the stability of war. This is an A in an area where certainly we&#x2019;re not in any way from a spending standpoint, in an arms race for autonomous weapons or AI today, when you look at actual expenditures, they&#x2019;re a small fraction of what militaries are spending on, if you look at, say AI or autonomous features at large.</p><p>And again for autonomous weapons, there really aren&#x2019;t at least openly declared programs to say go build a fully autonomous weapon today. But even if that were the case, why is that bad? Why would a world where militaries are racing to build lots of atomic weapons be a bad thing? I think it would be a bad thing, but I think it&#x2019;s also worth just answering that question, because it&#x2019;s not obvious to everyone. This is something that&#x2019;s often missing in a lot of these debates and dialogues about autonomous weapons, people may not share some of the underlying assumptions. It&#x2019;s better to bring out these assumptions and explain, I think this would be bad for these reasons, because maybe it&#x2019;s not intuitive to other people that they don&#x2019;t share those reasons and articulating them could increase understanding.</p><p>For example, the FLI letter on autonomous weapons from a few years ago said, &#x201C;the key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or prevent it from starting. If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, the global arms race is virtually inevitable. And the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious. Autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.&#x201D; I like the language, it&#x2019;s very literary, &#x201C;the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.&#x201D; Like it&#x2019;s a very concrete image. But there&#x2019;s a whole bunch of assumptions packed into those few sentences that maybe don&#x2019;t work in the letter that&#x2019;s intended to like sort of galvanize public interest and attention, but are worth really unpacking. What do we mean when we say autonomous weapons are the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow and why is that bad? And what does that mean? Those are, I think, important things to draw out and better understand.</p><p>It&#x2019;s particularly hard for this issue because the weapons don&#x2019;t exist yet. And so it&#x2019;s not actually like debates around something like landlines. We could point to the mines and say like &#x201C;this is a landmine, we all agree this is a landmine. This is what it&#x2019;s doing to people.&#x201D; And everyone could agree on what the harm is being caused. The people might disagree on what to do about it, but there&#x2019;s agreement on what the weapon is and what the effect is. But for autonomous weapons, all these things are up to debate. Even the term itself is not clearly defined. And when I hear people describe it, people can be describing a whole range of things. Some people when they say the word autonomous weapon, they&#x2019;re envisioning a Roomba with a gun on it. And other people are envisioning the Terminator. Now, both of those things are probably bad ideas, but for very different reasons. And that is important to draw out in these conversations. When you say autonomous weapon, what do you mean? What are you envisioning? What are you worried about? Worried about certain types of scenarios or certain types of effects?</p><p>If we want to get to the place where we really as a society come together and grapple with this challenge, I think first and foremost, a better communication is needed and people may still disagree, but it&#x2019;s much more helpful. Stuart Russell from Berkeley has talked a lot about dangers of small anti-personnel autonomous weapons that would widely be the proliferated. He made the Slaughterbots video that&#x2019;s been seen millions of times on YouTube. That&#x2019;s a very specific image. It&#x2019;s an image that&#x2019;s very concrete. So then you can say, when Stuart Russell is worried about autonomous weapons, this is what he&#x2019;s worried about. And then you can start to try to better understand the assumptions that go into that.</p><p>Now, I don&#x2019;t share Stuart&#x2019;s concerns, and we&#x2019;ve written about it and talked about before, but it&#x2019;s not actually because we disagree about the technology, I would agree that that&#x2019;s very doable with existing technology. We disagree about the social responses to that technology, and how people respond, and what are the countermeasures and what are ways to prevent proliferation. So we, I think, disagree on some of the political or social factors that surround kind of how people approach this technology and use it. Sometimes people actually totally agree on the risks and even maybe the potential futures, they just have different values. And there might be some people who their primary value is trying to have fewer weapons in the world. Now that&#x2019;s a noble goal. And they&#x2019;re like, hey, anyway that we can have fewer weapons, fewer advanced technologies, that&#x2019;s better. That&#x2019;s very different from someone who&#x2019;s coming from a position of saying, my goal is to improve my own nation&#x2019;s defense. That&#x2019;s a totally different value system. A total different preference. And they might be like, I also value what you say, but I don&#x2019;t value it as much. And I&#x2019;m going to take actions that advance these preferences. It&#x2019;s important to really sort of try to better draw them out and understand them in this debate, if we&#x2019;re going to get to a place where we can, as a society come up with some helpful solutions to this problem.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Wonderful. I&#x2019;m totally on board with that. Two questions and confusions on my end. The first is, I feel a bit confused when you say these weapons don&#x2019;t exist already. It seems to me more like autonomy exists on a spectrum and is the integration of many different technologies and decision making in systems. It seems to me there is already a certain degree of autonomy, there isn&#x2019;t Terminator level autonomy, or specify an objective and the autonomous system can just basically go execute that, that seems to require very high level of generality, but there seems to already exist a level of autonomy today.</p><p>And so in that video, Stuart says that slaughterbots in particular represent a miniaturization and integration of many technologies, which already exist today. And the second thing that I&#x2019;m confused about is when you say that it&#x2019;s unclear to you that militaries are very interested in this or that there currently is an arms race. It seems like yes, there isn&#x2019;t an arms race, like there was with nuclear weapons where it&#x2019;s very clear, and they&#x2019;re like Manhattan projects around this kind of technology, but given the strategic advantage conferred by this technology now and likely soon, it seems to me like game theoretically, from the position of militaries around the world that have the capacity to invest in these things, that it is inevitable given their battlefield importance that there would be massive ramping up or investments, or that there already is great interest in developing the autonomy and the subtechnologies required for developing fully autonomous systems.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Those are great questions and right on point. And I think the central issues in both of your questions are when we say these weapons or when I say these things, I should be more precise. When we say autonomous weapons, what do we mean exactly? And this is one of the things that can be tricky in this space, because there are not these universally agreed upon definitions. There are certainly many weapons systems used widely around the globe today that incorporate some autonomous features. Many of these are fire and forget weapons. When someone launches them, they&#x2019;re not coming back. They have in that sense, autonomy to carry out their mission. But autonomy is relatively limited and narrowly bounded, and humans, for the most part are choosing the targets. So you can think of kind of maybe these three classes of weapons, these semi autonomous weapons, where humans are choosing the targets, but there&#x2019;s lots of autonomy surrounding that decision, queuing information to people, flying the munition once the person launches it. That&#x2019;s one type of weapon, widely used today by really every advanced military.</p><p>Another one is the supervised autonomous weapons that are used in these relatively limited settings for defensive purposes, where there is kind of this automatic mode that people can turn them on and activate them to defend the ship or the ground base or the vehicle. And these are really needed for these situations where the incoming threats are too fast for humans to respond. And these again are widely used around the globe and have been in place for decades. And then there are what we could call fully autonomous weapons, where the human&#x2019;s launching them and human programs in the parameters, but they have some freedom to fly a search pattern over some area and then once they find a target, attack it on their own. For the most part, with some exceptions, those weapons are not widely used today. There have been some experimental systems that have been designed. There have been some put into operation in the past. The Israeli harpy drone is an example of this that is still in operation today. It&#x2019;s been around since the &#x2019;90s, so it&#x2019;s not really very new. And it&#x2019;s been sold to a handful of countries, India, Turkey, South Korea, China, and the Chinese have reportedly reverse engineered their own version of this.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s not like when widespread. So it&#x2019;s not like a major component of militaries order of that. I think you see militaries investing in robotic systems, but the bulk of their fleets are still human occupied platforms, robotics are largely an adjunct to them. And in terms of spending, while there is increased spending on robotics, most of the spending is still going towards more traditional military platforms. The same is also true about the degree of autonomy, most of these robotic systems are just remote controlled, and they have very limited autonomy today. Now we&#x2019;re seeing more autonomy over time in both robotic vehicles and in missiles. But militaries have a strong incentive to keep humans involved.</p><p>It is absolutely the case that militaries want technologies that will give them an advantage on the battlefield. But part of achieving an advantage means your systems work, they do what you want them to do, the enemy doesn&#x2019;t hack them and take them over, you have control over them. All of those things point to more human control. So I think that&#x2019;s the thing where you actually see militaries trying to figure out where&#x2019;s the right place on the spectrum of autonomy? How much autonomy is right, and that line is going to shift over time. But it&#x2019;s not the case that they necessarily want just full autonomy because what does that mean, then they do want weapon systems to sort of operate under some degree of human direction and involvement. It&#x2019;s just that what that looks like may evolve over time as the technology advances.</p><p>And there are also, I should add, other bureaucratic factors that come into play that militaries investments are not entirely strategic. There&#x2019;s bureaucratic politics within organizations. There&#x2019;s politics more broadly with the domestic defense industry interfacing with the political system in that country. They might drive resources in certain directions. There&#x2019;s some degree of inertia of course in any system that are also factors in play.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> So I want to hit here a little bit on longer term perspectives. So the Future of Life Institute in particular is interested in mitigating existential risks. We&#x2019;re interested in the advanced risks from powerful AI technologies where AI not aligned with human values and goals and preferences and intentions can potentially lead us to suboptimal equilibria that were trapped in permanently or could lead to human extinction. And so other technologies we care about are nuclear weapons and synthetic-bio enabled by AI technologies, etc. So there is this view here that if we cannot establish a governance mechanism as a global community on the concept that we should not let AI make the decision to kill then how can we deal with more subtle near term issues and eventual long term safety issues around the powerful AI technologies? So there&#x2019;s this view of ensuring beneficial outcomes around lethal autonomous weapons or at least beneficial regulation or development of that technology, and the necessity of that for longer term AI risk and value alignment with AI systems as they become increasingly intelligent. I&#x2019;m curious to know if you have a view or perspective on this.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> This is the fun part of the podcast with the Future of Life because this rarely comes up in a lot of the conversations because I think in a lot of the debates, people are focused on just much more near term issues surrounding autonomous weapons or AI. I think that if you&#x2019;re inclined to see that there are longer term risks for more advanced developments in AI, then I think it&#x2019;s very logical to say that there&#x2019;s some value in humanity coming together to come up with some set of rules about autonomous weapons today, even if the specific rules don&#x2019;t really matter that much, because the level of risk is maybe not as significant, but the process of coming together and agreeing on some set of norms and limits on particularly military applications in AI is probably beneficial and may begin to create the foundations for future cooperation. The stakes for autonomous weapons might be big, but are certainly not existential. I think in any reasonable interpretation of autonomous weapons might do really, unless you start thinking about autonomy wired into, like nuclear launch decisions which is basically nuts. And I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s really what&#x2019;s on the table for realistically what people might be worried about.</p><p>When we try to come together as a human society to grapple with problems, we&#x2019;re basically forced to deal with the institutions that we have in place. So for example, for autonomous weapons, we&#x2019;re having debates in the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to CCW. Is that the best form for talking about autonomous weapons? Well, it&#x2019;s kind of the form that exists for this kind of problem set. It&#x2019;s not bad. It&#x2019;s not perfect in some respects, but it&#x2019;s the one that exists. And so if you&#x2019;re worried about future AI risk, creating the institutional muscle memory among the relevant actors in society, whether it&#x2019;s nation states, AI scientists, members of civil society, militaries, if you&#x2019;re worried about military applications, whoever it is, to come together, to have these conversations, and to come up with some answer, and maybe set some agreements, some limits is probably really valuable actually because it begins to establish the right human networks for collaboration and cooperation, because it&#x2019;s ultimately people, it&#x2019;s people who know each other.</p><p>So oh, &#x201C;I worked with this person on this last thing.&#x201D; If you look at, for example, the international movement that The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is spearheading, that institution or framework, those people, those relationships are born out of past successful efforts to ban landmines and then cluster munitions. So there&#x2019;s a path dependency, and human relationships and bureaucracies, institutions that really matters. Coming together and reaching any kind of agreement, actually, to set some kind of limits is probably really vital to start exercising those muscles today.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> All right, wonderful. And a final fun FLI question for you. What are your views on long term AI safety considerations? Do you view AI eventually as an existential risk and do you integrate that into your decision making and thinking around the integration of AI and military technology?</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Yes, it&#x2019;s a great question. It&#x2019;s not something that comes up a lot in the world that I live in, in Washington in the policy world, people don&#x2019;t tend to think about that kind of risk. I think it&#x2019;s a concern. It&#x2019;s a hard problem because we don&#x2019;t really know how the technology is evolving. And I think that one of the things is challenging with AI is our frame for future more advanced AI. Often the default frame is sort of thinking about human like intelligence. When people talk about future AI, people talk about terms like AGI, or high level machine intelligence or human like intelligence, we don&#x2019;t really know how the technology is evolving.</p><p>I think one of the things that we&#x2019;re seeing with AI machine learning that&#x2019;s quite interesting is that it often is evolving in ways that are very different from human intelligence, in fact, very quite alien and quite unusual. And I&#x2019;m not the first person to say this, but I think that this is valid that we are, I think, on the verge of a Copernican revolution in how we think about intelligence, that rather than thinking of human intelligence as the center of the universe, that we&#x2019;re realizing that humans are simply one type of intelligence among a whole vast array and space of possible forms of intelligence, and we&#x2019;re creating different kinds, they may have very different intelligence profiles, they may just look very different, they may be much smarter than humans in some ways and dumber in other ways. I don&#x2019;t know where things are going. I think it&#x2019;s entirely possible that we move forward into a future where we see many more forms of advanced intelligent systems. And because they don&#x2019;t have the same intelligence profile as human beings, we continue to kick the can down the road into being true intelligence because it doesn&#x2019;t look like us. It doesn&#x2019;t think like us. It thinks differently. But these systems may yet be very powerful in very interesting ways.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve already seen lots of AI systems, even very simple ones exhibit a lot of creativity, a lot of interesting and surprising behavior. And as we begin to see the sort of scope of their intelligence widen over time, I think there are going to be risks that come with that. They may not be the risks that we were expecting, but I think over time, there going to be significant risks, and in some ways that our anthropocentric view is, I think, a real hindrance here. And I think it may lead us to then underestimate risk from things that don&#x2019;t look quite like humans, and maybe miss some things that are very real. I&#x2019;m not at all worried about some AI system one day becoming self aware, and having human level sentience, that does not keep me up at night. I am deeply concerned about advanced forms of malware. We&#x2019;re not there today yet. But you could envision things over time that are adapting and learning and begin to populate the web, like there are people doing interesting ways of thinking about systems that have misaligned goals. It&#x2019;s also possible to envision systems that don&#x2019;t have any human directed goals at all. Viruses don&#x2019;t. They replicate. They&#x2019;re effective at replicating, but they don&#x2019;t necessarily have a goal in the way that we think of it other than self replication.</p><p>If you have systems that are capable of replicating, of accumulating resources, of adapting, over time, you might have all of the right boxes to check to begin to have systems that could be problematic. They could accumulate resources that could cause problems. Even if they&#x2019;re not trying to pursue either a goal that&#x2019;s misaligned with human interest or even any goal that we might recognize. They simply could get out in the wild, if they&#x2019;re effective at replication and acquiring resources and adapting, then they might survive. I think we&#x2019;re likely to be surprised and continue to be surprised by how AI systems evolve, and where that might take us. And it might surprise us in ways that are humbling for how we think about human intelligence. So one question I guess is, is human intelligence a convergence point for more intelligent systems? As AI systems become more advanced, and they become more human like, or less human like and more alien.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> Unless we train them very specifically on human preference hierarchies and structures.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Right. Exactly. Right. And so I&#x2019;m not actually worried about a system that has the intelligence profile of humans, when you think about capacity in different tasks.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> I see what you mean. You&#x2019;re not worried about an anthropomorphic AI, you&#x2019;re worried about a very powerful, intelligent, capable AI, that is alien and that we don&#x2019;t understand.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Right. They might have cross domain functionality, it might have the ability to do continuous learning. It might be adaptive in some interesting ways. I mean, one of the interesting things we&#x2019;ve seen about the field of AI is that people are able to tackle a whole variety of problems with some very simple methods and algorithms. And this seems for some reason offensive to some people in the AI community, I don&#x2019;t know why, but people have been able to use some relatively simple methods, with just huge amounts of data and compute, it&#x2019;s like a variety of different kinds of problems, some of which seem very complex.</p><p>Now, they&#x2019;re simple compared to the real world, when you look at things like strategy games like StarCraft and Dota 2, like the world looks way more complex, but these are still really complicated kind of problems. And systems are basically able to learn totally on their own. That&#x2019;s not general intelligence, but it starts to point towards the capacity to have systems that are capable of learning a whole variety of different tasks. They can&#x2019;t do this today, continuously without suffering the problem of catastrophic forgetting that people are working on these things as well. The problems today are the systems aren&#x2019;t very robust. They don&#x2019;t handle perturbations in the environment very well. People are working on these things. I think it&#x2019;s really hard to see how this evolves. But yes, in general, I think that our fixation on human intelligence as the pinnacle of intelligence, or even the goal of what we&#x2019;re trying to build, and the sort of this anthropocentric view is, I think, probably one that&#x2019;s likely to lead us to maybe underestimate some kinds of risks.</p><p><strong>Lucas Perry:</strong> I think those are excellent points and I hope that mindfulness about that is able to proliferate in government and in actors who have power to help mitigate some of these future and short term AI risks. I really appreciate your perspective and I think you bring a wholesomeness and a deep authentic entertaining of all the different positions and arguments here on the question of autonomous weapons and I find that valuable. So thank you so much for your time and for helping to share information about autonomous weapons with us.</p><p><strong>Paul Scharre:</strong> Thank you and thanks everyone for listening. Take care.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>When I imagine the beginnings of life on earth, I imagine a handful of molecules which just-so-happen to catalyze reactions which produce more of those same molecules. The more of molecule X there is, the more molecule X is produced. The chemical kinetic equations contain a positive feedback loop (aka instability).</p><p>There might also be other molecules which catalyze their own production. If Y catalyzes its own production more efficiently than X, then we eventually expect to see more Y than X. Still at the level of chemical kinetics, we&#x2019;d say that the equations contain multiple positive feedback loops, and the feedback loop for Y has a faster doubling time than that for X.</p><p>We haven&#x2019;t used the word &#x201C;fitness&#x201D; here at all. We&#x2019;re quite literally talking about eigenvalues of a matrix (i.e. the Jacobian of the kinetic equations of the chemical system) - those are what determine the relevant doubling times, at least close to ambient steady-state concentrations. As we move away from ambient concentrations, the math will get a bit more complicated, but the qualitative idea remains: we&#x2019;re talking about positive feedback loops, without any <em>explicit</em> mention of fitness or optimization.</p><p>But it sure seems like there should be a higher level of abstraction, at which the positive feedback loops for X and Y are competing, Y eventually wins out due to higher fitness, and there&#x2019;s some meaningful sense in which the system is optimizing for fitness.</p><p>More generally, <strong>whenever there&#x2019;s a dynamical system containing multiple instabilities (i.e. positive feedback loops), it seems like there should be a canonical way to interpret that system as multiple competing subsystems, under selection, optimizing for some kind of fitness function</strong>. I&#x2019;d like a way to take a dynamical system containing positive feedback loops, and say both (a) what the competing subsystems are, and (b) what fitness function it&#x2019;s implicitly maximizing.</p><p>Something like this would likely be useful in a number of areas:</p><ul><li>Alignment: notice implicit optimization by looking for dynamic instabilities (e.g. <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X7S3u5E4KktLp7gHz/tessellating-hills-a-toy-model-for-demons-in-imperfect\">instabilities in imperfect search</a></u>).</li><li>Agent foundations: formulate &#x201C;agents&#x201D; as self-reinforcing feedback loops in dynamical systems. Tying effective self-reinforcement to world-models would probably be a key piece (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JBFHzfPkXHB2XfDGj/evolution-of-modularity\">along these lines</a>).</li><li>Biology: generalize evolutionary theory</li><li>Economics: ground economic theory in selection effects (e.g. <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PrCmeuBPC4XLDQz8C/unconscious-economics\">along these lines</a></u>) rather than ideal agents, allowing it to apply much more broadly.</li></ul>",

These seem to differ from medical-grade oxygen concentrators (which you need a prescription to buy) in that they deliver less oxygen at less purity, i.e. medical-grade oxygen concentrators can provide &gt;5L/min of oxygen at &gt; 85% purity, whereas one of these goes from 1L/min at 92% to 5L/min at 30%.</p><p>Here&apos;s a case for why buying one or more could be life-saving, which I would love LessWrong&apos;s opinion on.

E.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uncommon, but well-supported, scientific knowledge or math;</li>\n<li>Long inferential distances;</li>\n<li>Hard-to-verbalize intuitions, perhaps stemming from specific visualizations;</li>\n<li>Zeitgeists inherited from a profession (that may have good reason for it);</li>\n<li>Patterns perceptually recognized from experience;</li>\n<li>Sheer habits of thought;</li>\n<li>Emotional commitments to believing in a particular outcome;</li>\n<li>Fear that a past mistake could be disproved;</li>\n<li>Deep self-deception for the sake of pride or other personal benefits.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am assuming that something like this is happening in the key disagreements in AI alignment. The last three bullet points are somewhat uncharitable to proponents of a particular view, and also seem less likely to me. Summarizing the first six bullet points, I want to say something like: some combination of \"innate intuitions\" and \"life experiences\" led e.g. Eliezer and Paul Christiano to arrive at different opinions. I want to go through a useful subset of the \"life experiences\" part, so that I can share some of the same intuitions.</p>\n<p>To that end, my question is something like: What fields should I learn? What textbooks/textbook chapters/papers/articles should I read? What historical examples (from history of AI/ML or from the world at large) should I spend time thinking about? (The more specific the resource, the better.) What intuitions should I expect to build by going through this resource? In the question title I am using the word \"exercise\" pretty broadly.</p>\n<p>If you believe one just needs to be born with one set of intuitions rather than another, and that there are no resources I can consume to refine my intuitions, then my question is instead more like: How can I better introspect so as to find out which side I am on :)?</p>\n<p>Some ideas I am aware of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading discussions between Eliezer/Paul/other people: I've already done a lot of this; it just feels like now I am no longer making much progress.</li>\n<li>Learn more theoretical computer science to learn the Search For Solutions And Fundamental Obstructions intuition, as mentioned in <a href=\"http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/the-i-already-get-it-slide\">this post</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Two weeks ago Ben Pace and I asked for <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread\">practical advice</a> on what to do about coronavirus, with the requirement that advice be justified in some way- ideally full blown models informed by empirical data, but at a minimum, an explanation of why it was helpful. The resulting thread had wonderful advice but makes for, uh, inefficient reading, at best. This post is an attempt to take the best of the Justified Practical Advice Thread and present it in a clear, easy-to-digest format.</p><p>It&#x2019;s important to note that neither the original post nor this one are attempting to give <em>comprehensive</em> advice. If you&#x2019;re looking for that, I suggest checking out the Guide/FAQs/Intros tab on the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aXBq5edfzvOz22rot6JvMeKD0tRF9-w4fF500fIrvcs/edit#gid=1069546931\">LessWrong Coronavirus Link Database</a>. This is for advice that fell through the cracks.</p><p>Though I will briefly mention the standard advice. From what I can tell, the most important (and luckily widely publicized advice) is the following: </p><ul><li>Wash your hands a lot, and wash them to a hospital standard (spend 20 seconds and follow <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html\">these instructions</a>).</li><li>Socially isolate yourself, and don&apos;t be around other people unless really necessary. Avoid groups of people, especially large gatherings. Really don&apos;t go to bars, clubs, restaurants or other places that lots of people pass through (like public transportation).</li><li>If you are sick, use a mask. They are probably also effective at preventing the disease when you are not sick, but most of the western world currently has massively limited supply, so leave the masks to health workers and sick people.</li></ul><p>The rest of this post will summarise the interesting ideas that went beyond these basic recommendations. But if you haven&apos;t done (or at least seriously considered doing) all of the above, I would recommend you prioritise the things listed above.</p><p>Many of the below recommendations involve buying things. When possible I&#x2019;ve included a link to a particular amazon page. This is not a strong recommendation for that particular product: it&#x2019;s an attempt to lower activation energy for acting on a recommendation. If you have reason to believe a particular model is better than what I linked to, please comment and I&#x2019;ll update if appropriate. Speaking of which, if you think of anything else I missed or got wrong, please comment with that too.</p><p>That said, here is the top advice from the Coronavirus Justified Practical Advice thread.</p><ul><li>Cover your high-touch surfaces with copper tape.</li><li>Treat newly delivered packages as contagious for 48 hours.</li><li>Take vitamin D supplements daily.</li><li>Buy electrolytes to drink if you get ill.</li><li>Maybe: Buy a pulse oximeter.</li></ul><h1>Practical Advice</h1><h2>Get <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Conductive-Shielding-Repellent-Electrical-Grounding/dp/B07HGBSH4M/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=copper+tape+2+inch&amp;qid=1584299289&amp;s=arts-crafts&amp;sr=1-5\">2-inch copper tape</a> and cover high-touch surfaces with it, especially shared high-touch surfaces (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread?commentId=jRZSkavPJzcQtSPhc\">Connor Flexman</a>)</h2><p>This was the clear winner of JPA Olympics&#x2013; it&#x2019;s cheap, effective, and very few people had heard of it before.

    "htmlBody": "<p>TL;DR Our estimation of young adult mortality could be biased because of longer survival time before death in ICU and triage. </p><p>The data from Asia is that the mortality of young adults between 20-39 is like 0.2 per cent. This sometimes contradicts claims from the ground in Italy, <a href=\"https://www.ilcapoluogo.it/2020/03/14/coronavirus-abruzzo-medici-sfiniti-in-trincea/?fbclid=IwAR2fl_Z_HtEH-ce1Gwo6CkSFnuzIqU21DZdyY-4FIohbPJNMTAKsAXdQBr4.\">like</a>:</p><p><em>&quot;There are many young people in intensive care, so we dispelled a &apos;myth&apos;, for which Coronavirus is a disease that affects only the elderly: stay at home, who can, don&apos;t go out, maybe just so we could come out! There will be a happy ending only if we respect the rules. So stay at home, respect the safety distances &#x201D;&#xA0;</em></p><p>However, Italy still almost didn&#x2019;t report deaths of people below 50. The main question is: could it be taken as evidence of the low young adult&apos;s mortality in the situation after the medicine collapse?</p><p>The lack of reports of the death of young adults could have 3 possible explanations which need additional verification:</p><p>1) <em>Better survival on the ventilator</em>. Young adults survive better if they put on the ventilator. I don&#x2019;t know how many young adults are currently on the ventilator. However, if there will be a shortage of ventilators, the mortality of young adults will jump. </p><p>2) <em>Better triage</em>. Young adults are getting better triage. Because young adults seem to survive better on ventilators and also are a more valuable part of society, they are given ventilators, and older people are turned off if there is a shortage of ventilators. It was reported that in Italy they had to turn off 40 years old people to save 30 years old ones (I lost the link, but will add when will find).&#xA0;</p><p>3) <em>A longer time before death</em>. Some young adults could survive for a much longer time on the ventilator and will die anyway. Maybe they can survive 6-8 weeks on the ventilator but will die eventually. In that case, we are just not starting to see these deaths, as the jump of infections started around mid-January, or around 8 weeks ago. In China, there are still 3000 people in serious condition, and as the peak of infections was at the beginning of February, most of them were diagnosed more than a month ago.&#xA0;</p><p>The main question here is the age of people in ICU, not age of deaths, as younger people may live longer in ICU. Some data points:&#xA0;Half of the Dutch patients in ICU are <a href=\"https://myprivacy.dpgmedia.net/?siteKey=V9f6VUvlHxq9wKIN&amp;callbackUrl=https%3a%2f%2fwww.ad.nl%2fprivacy-gate%2faccept%3fredirectUri%3d%252fdossier-coronavirus%252f40-a-50-nederlandse-coronapatienten-op-intensive-cares-meer-dan-de-helft-is-onder-de-vijftig%257ea058aad2%252f%253freferrer%253dhttps%253a%252f%252ft.co%252fFFkYTRXzox%253famp%253d1%2526fbclid%253dIwAR2B_58hHk31S5ZMyV3U3iHiYRbygfljekw6rFEeMgdFyJosK5u51L7FmZs\">below 50</a>, and 16 years boy is in a <a href=\"https://www.ad.nl/dossier-coronavirus/familie-bidt-voor-16-jarige-bredanaar-sehraz-die-door-corona-op-intensive-care-ligt~a0dc5413/?fbclid=IwAR0MuxWvq07r1BXJM86FahYKDpfQl2hPXac6A64nd30EzFuWpPbFYST6-0U\">coma</a>.<br></p>",

We're all in the same\nroom, so the time from when you make a sound to when I hear it is\nvery small compared to the speed at which we perceive music.  Since\nwe're currently avoiding being close to each other, however, there's\nnow too much delay to make traditional parallel singing work.  This is\nhard since it's a time we'd especially like to be able to sing\ntogether.\n\n</span>\n\n</p><p>\n\nOne potential solution is circular singing.  Pick a song which works\nwith a fixed delay, and then I hear you following me while you hear me\nfollowing you.  I was <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/remote-rounds\">musing about singing\nrounds this way</a> a few years ago, but it looks like there have been\nopen source implementations of this going back to <a href=\"https://www.cockos.com/ninjam/\">at least 2005</a> there's a <a href=\"https://jammr.net/\">hosted service</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnother approach, though, would be series singing, like a bucket\nbrigade.  You have a leader who sings/plays and hears only themself,\nand each person in the chain hears everyone before them.  This seems\nlike it could be a good fit for churches especially?  Has anyone\ntried this, or seen anything like it?\n\n  </p>",

But there's a problem: <a href=\"https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext\">This review</a> found that coronaviruses can persist on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days at room temperature (<strong>EDIT</strong>: Maybe as many as 17 days, actually.  See <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e3.htm\">this</a>.)  There's no way to know how many infected people handled your package before it got to you.</p>\n<p>This is a protocol my roommate and I came up with for handling packages safely. Although it looks like a lot of steps, most individual steps aren't all that long. I chose to err on the side of including <em>extra steps</em> that you can cut if you want to save time.  Obviously, if you're at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19, extra steps are going to be more worthwhile.  (In addition to the elderly being at greater risk, the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\">WHO's report</a> says that people with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer have a mortality rate of 5-15%.)</p>\n<p>Your time will be spent most efficiently if you process multiple boxes at once.</p>\n<h1>You will need</h1>\n<p>Note: It's been estimated that practically everyone in the US will have the virus by mid-May. So even if you think this procedure looks overly paranoid, you might want to buy these items <em>now</em> so you have them on hand in case things get worse.  (How you gonna disinfect your box of disinfecting supplies without any disinfecting supplies?)</p>\n<p>Anyway, you'll want <em>(optional things in italics)</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A long sleeve shirt and long pants--ideally clothes you don't care very much about that are too big for you (they might shrink when you put them through the dryer on high heat for disinfection)</li>\n<li>3 pairs of gloves</li>\n<li>A knife</li>\n<li>Bleach.  If bleach isn't available, get hydrogen peroxide or concentrated ethanol, and use disposable gloves instead.</li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bzT7GT8ec2deE8JAi/when-are-immunostimulants-immunosuppressants-likely-to-be?commentId=YFRxupXbmpCftGKxF\">Immunostimulants</a> or similar (Edit: <strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bzT7GT8ec2deE8JAi/when-are-immunostimulants-immunosuppressants-likely-to-be?commentId=oc39xwJG9yXiTC5kN\">OR NOT</a></strong>).  <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033062020300372\">This paper</a> has a list of supplements you could try in Table 1.  Might as well get some <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread?commentId=KEAc428gk4F6Ys3tv\">Vitamin D</a> too (Edit: <strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B9qzPZDcPwnX6uEpe/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-summary?commentId=G33Rsm7qX48upbvmz\">OR NOT</a></strong>).</em></li>\n<li><em>Moisturizer/lotion</em></li>\n<li><em>Rubber bands</em></li>\n<li><em>Mask/eye protection</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to use items in your boxes soon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A spray bottle</li>\n<li>A washcloth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that most of these items, including gloves and a jug of bleach, can purchased for $1 each at Dollar Tree.  They even have glucosamine, one of the supplements recommended in the paper.</p>\n<h1>Getting started</h1>\n<p>To economize on time, I recommend waiting until you were about to take a shower anyway before starting this procedure, since showering is one of the last steps.  Ideally, get set up for your shower before you start the process.</p>\n<p>And it's probably better to work during the day so you can see what's touching what.</p>\n<p>Preparation steps <em>(optional steps are in italics)</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Take Chris Masterjohn's recommended <a href=\"https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/what-im-doing-for-the-coronavirus\">supplements</a> (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B9qzPZDcPwnX6uEpe/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-summary?commentId=MzKimsDfzar7TCdpL\">garlic consumption details</a>) and/or things <a href=\"http://Examine.com\">Examine.com</a> <a href=\"https://examine.com/topics/coronavirus/\">recommends</a>.</em></li>\n<li><em>Moisturize your hands.  You'll be washing your hands at the end, and you want to be moisturizing regularly so your skin doesn't dry out and develop cuts.</em></li>\n<li>If you have long hair, tie it back.  <em>If you have facial hair, shave it so your mask will fit better.</em></li>\n<li>Put on your long sleeve shirt &amp; long pants.  <em>Use rubber bands to pull your shirt tight around your wrists so it covers your forearms as well as possible.</em></li>\n<li>If you're impatient to use the things in your boxes, prep disinfection solution in spray bottle:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses... can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.\n<a href=\"https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext\">Source</a>\n* Bleach products are typically around 5% sodium hypochlorite, so if you dilute 10x (1 part bleach 9 parts water), you'll have 0.5% sodium hypochlorite--5 times as strong as needed.\n* Also grab a washcloth and put a clock within viewing distance of where you'll work so you can time a 60-second wait.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Otherwise, designate a place <strong>inside</strong> your house for letting potentially infected items sit for 9 (edit: or 17!) days.  The ideal place is warm and dry (e.g. near a heater vent--not so near that air streaming from the vent will blow virus everywhere though).  Sunlight exposure can't hurt either.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Disinfection procedure</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn on lights, open doors, open washing machine, open recycle bin, etc. so you won't have to touch these things during disinfection.  <em>Turn on an <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/W23AGDC8DeXvopSmG/are-hepa-filters-likely-to-pull-covid-19-out-of-the-air\">air filter</a> if you have one.</em></li>\n<li><em>If you'll be disinfecting lots of boxes, get your boombox so you can play a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38j1Loi4r9o\">disaster movie soundtrack</a> on loop in the background.</em></li>\n<li>Put on 1st pair of gloves <em>plus eye protection and mask</em>.</li>\n<li>Might as well handle your mail first.  Wearing gloves, open your mailbox (your mailperson touched it!) and slice open envelopes with your knife.  Dump the contents of the envelopes in your 9-day wait spot and drop the empty envelopes in the recycle bin.\n<ul>\n<li><em>The envelope has probably been handled by more people than whatever's inside.  So try not to move virus from the envelope to the contents--keep your knife cuts shallow, or even cover your knife in bleach before you start.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Open all boxes with the first set of gloves and your knife.  Push box flaps down.  Set gloves &amp; knife aside.  Try not to touch the outsides of the boxes from now on.  (Who knows how many people handled them.)</li>\n<li>Take off 1st pair of gloves (when removing gloves, be sure not to touch the outside of the glove with your bare hand) and put gloves+knife in an \"infected items\" spot.  Put on 2nd pair of gloves.</li>\n<li>If you're impatient to use box contents, disinfect them using your spray bottle.  Pick up an item and spray 6 inches from it until it's wet all over.  Once all items have been sprayed, allow spray to remain for 60 seconds.\n<ul>\n<li><em>If you want to leave items in boxes during the 60 second wait, you might also spray the inside of the box so items don't just pick up virus from the inside again. But it's probably better to put the items somewhere else.</em></li>\n<li>Put on 3rd pair of gloves.  (The 3rd pair won't get infected, they're just to protect your skin from disinfectant.)  Use the washcloth to wipe disinfectant off.\n<ul>\n<li>Bleach can leave a residue--be sure to wipe it all off, instead of letting it evaporate off, if you don't want residue.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Otherwise, use 2nd pair of gloves to move box contents to designated 9-day wait spot.</li>\n<li>Put 2nd pair of gloves in \"infected items\" spot.</li>\n<li>Go take a shower.  Be careful with your clothes because they might have virus on them.  Wash areas of your skin that might have touched infected surfaces.</li>\n<li>Put your clothes in the laundry.  (Be sure to wash+moisturize your hands after putting possibly-infected items in the washer but before using washer controls.)\n<ul>\n<li>If you're alright with ruining the colors on your clothes, use bleach and throw in the gloves as well.</li>\n<li>Otherwise wash normally, then <a href=\"https://time.com/4676920/washing-machine-germs/\">dry on the highest heat setting for at least 28 minutes</a> (wash+moisturize hands after transferring from washer to dryer--clothes haven't been disinfected yet!)  Then do a 2nd load with bleach and the gloves (does double duty cleaning both the gloves and the washer itself).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Turn off your boombox.</em></li>\n<li>If you're using the wait option, I suggest you make a record of the date and the things that were left in the waiting spot.  We have a whiteboard near the waiting spot that we use for this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the simplest way to deal with the empty boxes is actually to leave them in your yard, then slice them up for recycling while wearing the 1st pair of gloves the next time you go through the disinfection procedure.  (Remember, coronaviruses appear to survive ~indefinitely at colder temperatures, so just because a box has been sitting in your yard for 9 days doesn't mean it's disinfected!)  If you have a backyard that's bigger than your front yard, you might want to move boxes to your backyard right after putting on the first pair of gloves, to avoid cluttering your front yard up.</p>\n<p>Excessive?  Maybe.  I say this is the one time this century that germaphobes are 100% right.  (Well, hopefully there won't be more times later in the century...)</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT March 29</strong>: Some commenters in this thread convinced me the procedure was excessive, so I relaxed it, and now I'm sick with something that I suspect is COVID-19.  <strong>Only the paranoid survive.</strong></p>\n<h1>Feedback</h1>\n<p>Please comment or send me a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/john_maxwell\">personal message</a> if you have any suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More steps that could be added</li>\n<li>Steps that don't seem very essential</li>\n<li>Reorganization for greater efficiency</li>\n<li>Incorrect factual claims (I'm not an expert on any of this)</li>\n<li>Etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>",

My goal with this post is to help meetup organizers help their communities deal with this situation. I know that some communities have already preemptively canceled events, and that others live in areas that have already been hit hard enough that this message is too little, too late. I hope that those of you in the latter situation are staying safe.</p><h1>When should we stop having meetups?</h1><p><strong>I recommend that you stop holding meetups immediately, regardless of your location. </strong>It’s abundantly clear that containment measures have failed, so even if your city isn’t currently in crisis, it’s unlikely that that will remain the case for long. At this point, we should be aiming to “flatten the curve” – that is, to slow the spread of the disease so that hospitals don’t have to operate above capacity for long periods. If we can achieve this, a greater proportion of ill people will have access to professional medical care, which will reduce mortality rates.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca\"><u>This popular article</u></a> makes a good case for acting <strong>now</strong>.</p><p>If you are adamant about waiting to suspend your meetups (maybe you live somewhere remote and sparsely populated with excellent testing protocol… but probably not), <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6MVdKcZCW2sFLFgPK9L1deMS8i2G2nliI0Aw6_zTWw/edit#gid=612256187\"><u>this spreadsheet </u></a>provides a crude mathematical model to calculate risks from holding gatherings, based on the confirmed COVID-19 cases (or deaths) in your area and the size of your gathering. I encourage you to reach out to me directly if you are thinking of continuing to hold events going forward; it’s my impression that this is currently just a bad idea, but I'm open to talking one-on-one about your particular situation.</p><h1>What can I do for my community?</h1><h2>How can I help my community prepare for COVID-19?</h2><p>Not holding events is a good first step, of course. For more on what to do, I suggest <a href=\"http://bit.ly/covid-preparedness\"><u>bit.ly/covid-preparedness</u></a>. This is a document about how to prepare for a COVID-19 pandemic, and while I am not a domain expert, the document is open-source and provides citations, which means you can assess the evidence for yourself and suggest corrections if you think anything is wrong.</p><p>Here is a bulleted list of priority interventions:</p><ul><li>Educate your community about proper hygiene and social distancing.</li><li>Make sure that everyone in your community has stocked up on essentials (food, medications, toilet paper, etc) to reduce the chance that they’ll need to visit a store during a time when doing so is likely to endanger their health.</li><li>Make sure that everyone in your community has a plan for what to do in the event that they or someone in their household contracts COVID-19.</li></ul><h2>How can I keep my community connected when we can’t meet in person?</h2><p>I’ve created a Discord server so that you can keep the conversation going even when you can’t meet in person! We can create separate channels for each different group, and it should be easy to have voice or video calls over Discord at your normal group meeting time. (I’m a Discord noob, but I think it should be possible to make channels private as well.) Regular meetup organizers will be made admins, and I’ll be available to help set things up if you have questions.</p><p>This is the invite link to the server: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/hfyRcfk\"><u>https://discord.gg/hfyRcfk</u></a>. You can send it out to everyone in your meetup group (it’s set to not expire). And please let me know if you’d like to help moderate the server!&nbsp;</p><h1>Additional resources</h1><p>There are thousands of COVID-19 resources floating around out there, and at this point it’s really hard to orient to all of them.

Social distancing is becoming increasingly widespread, which means that people are going to be experiencing social isolation at an unprecedented level. In this age of global connectedness, this seems really scary to some people, but I prefer to think of it as something akin to the experience of weathering a snowy winter in a log cabin on the western frontier. That is, cozy and exciting!</p><p>I live in a house with about ten people. We all have different personalities and we're all afraid of going stir-crazy spending five months together, so I did some research on how we can avoid that. (We also have a dry-erase monthly calendar where we can plan out activities!) Below are my ideas :)</p><hr><p><i>Epistemic status: these recommendations are based on a combination of (1) things that are required or recommended for astronauts, (2) recommendations for people homebound due to injuries, chronic illnesses, or old age,&nbsp;and (3) common sense.</i></p><h2>Body interventions:</h2><ul><li>If at all possible, <strong>get fresh air and sunshine</strong> at least once a day.</li><li>Get at least light <strong>exercise </strong>at least once a day; ideally get heavy exercise regularly.</li><li><strong>Get enough sleep, water, and calories.</strong></li><li><strong>Eat a variety of foods that you enjoy!</strong></li></ul><h2>Brain interventions:</h2><ul><li><strong>Regularly video chat loved ones</strong> who aren't quarantined with you.</li><li><strong>Talk to a therapist online</strong>, if possible.</li><li><strong>Meditate.</strong> There are lots of guided meditations available online and via apps, some of which are free.</li><li><strong>Stick to a basic routine that you endorse. </strong>For example, you might want to wake up and go to bed at the same time each day, or do daily exercise.</li><li><strong>Change out of sleep clothes and into day clothes each day.</strong> If you are a newly minted remote worker, this is especially important, and you may want to set up additional \"going to work\", \"leaving work\", and \"lunch break\" routines.</li><li><strong>Have projects to work on; set goals</strong> that feel meaningful to you.</li><li><strong>Get around to those things you always meant to do but didn’t have time for</strong>, e.g. learning a certain skill, cleaning out a certain room, or reading a certain book.</li><li><strong>Make sure you get real alone time</strong>, even if you're sharing a room.</li><li><strong>Do things that are fun for you! </strong>e.g. watch movies, make art, have sex, read, dance.</li><li><strong>Gratitude journaling.</strong> Try to write down three or more things you're grateful for each day, or exchange gratitudes with a friend or partner verbally.</li><li><strong>Plan at least one thing to do each day. </strong>This will give your day structure and purpose!</li><li><strong>Clean the house regularly </strong>so that your living environment stays fresh and nice.</li><li><strong>Celebrate birthdays and other holidays just as you normally would</strong>; take these opportunities to dress up nice/put on makeup if it makes you happy.</li></ul><p>And remember that everyone else is in a similarly stressful situation to you. Interpersonal conflicts are fairly likely to arise, and you need to do your best to minimize their impact on your household. For some people that might mean you need to walk away from the situation for a while rather than letting it escalate. Maybe you need to talk to a trusted friend and/or try third-party mediation. Maybe you need to let your feelings out in a dance battle. In any case, dealing with conflict in a way that minimizes negative externalities is really important.

You will not get much chance to eat such items when the stores are all closed.</p><p>It was interesting to note that the fresh produce (as apposed to the packages chicken, beef and pork - but not the package lunch meets) was, for the most part fully stocked. True, it did reflect the pattern of less perishable items (except the spring onions) being in lower supply. Things like potatoes and onions. Plenty of apples, oranges, blueberries, raspberries, grapes, lettuce and such.</p><p>That certainly made sense but like I say, now seems to be the time people might want to enjoy eating more fresh foods than frozen or canned foods.</p><p>The other thing, and more related to the title, was what things were still on the shelves and where were gone from the shelves. Toilet paper, rice, dried beans and a good amount of the packaged ramen were gone (and have been for a few days). Certain cereals were gone, while others seem to be about as plentiful as before.</p><p>What I&apos;m uncertain of is does that patter reflect the actual character of local demand, but the curves all just shifted up and right or if the &quot;panic&quot; buying has produced a change in the underlying character of the local demand.</p><p>I would think that if the buying is reflective of a shift in the curve, looking at the shelves, and what is left might be good information for both the manufactures as well as the retail stores. (Though for the retail level there may well be a zero marginal cost of having the items on the shelves so they may amount to something akin to a pure profit type case -- store collects the rent for the shelf space regardless of sales and at some level of operation there is always some shelf space available).</p>",

But before we understand what epigenetics is and how does it do all that magic, we need to understand genetics first.</p><p><strong>Genetics 101:</strong></p><p>The human body contains approx 40 trillion <strong>cells</strong>! The function of all these cells varies depending on where they are put to work. For example, a liver cell performs a different function than the kidney and the brain cell. We function as a whole because of these cells. Cells are the fundamental working unit in our bodies. Cells receive instructions on what exactly they need to do from a molecule called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d6f02ab31f5cabbaf4db8cf2583775777549dacd/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313630302f312a47616e4b616c367746565555363038666f6a4d4147672e706e67\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>The DNA in humans is made up of around <strong>3 billion letters.</strong> There are four letters that repeat in a sequence &#x2014; A, C, T, and G (The four fundamental <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Nucleotide\">nucleotide</a> bases: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine). Humans inherit these 3 billion letters from their mother and 3 billion letters from their father!</p><p>The sequence or the order of these letters determines the instruction set for the cells. Within these 3 billion letters there are approximately about 20, 000 genes. The DNA sequence when formed in specific order or pattern, forms a gene that then instructs and helps in the production of essential proteins. These proteins perform all the essential biological functions that keep us alive! Sometimes it takes just one letter in the sequence to be wrong and you might have a devastating disease. This means that the genome sequence is very very very important.</p><p>Ok, we know what is genetics now. But that&apos;s not all there is to the story.</p><p><strong>Enter Epigenetics:</strong></p><p>Epigenetics is a phenomenon in which modifications happen around the DNA <strong>without actually altering the sequence</strong> of it. And these modifications are heritable. So, you can transfer things that happened to you in your life span to your children by changing how certain genes are activated or not activated.</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bfc511636221fc126db3f07051b5fc32b8985c83/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313630302f312a7373345669674c6163622d384d37305f786a705242412e706e67\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>To answer this, we need to consider our DNA and how it fits into our cells. So each of the 40 trillion cells contains about 6 feet of DNA molecule. If we were to make it linear and stretch it out, it would be as tall as some NBA player. But then how does it fit into our tiny cells?</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f8201959a61037f88f5062ad1f6610d6ab983d88/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313630302f312a3144496c466b385443337a4372387674396a78736b512e706e67\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>In our cells, the DNA wraps around a cluster of 8 protein molecules called the <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/histone\">histone</a>.

You would probably feel the kick after one or two vodka shots. Now you continue drinking frequently for a few months. You find that you do not feel anything even after 4 shots! We all have experienced this. But how does this happen?</p><p>This is because your body starts breaking down the alcohol faster. Basically, it switches on a higher expression of the gene that breaks down alcohol.</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ac1e2965e50da6b18fa2718a21584121760c5109/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313630302f312a3059522d4379725771464a733975694c47376d436d672e706e67\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>When you start consuming more alcohol, the liver signals the body that it needs to break down more of the alcohol rapidly. This results in some modifications added to the <strong>tails</strong> of those proteins (histone) around which the gene that breaks alcohol is wrapped around. These modifications enable the gene to be switched on easily. So they drive up gene expression.</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4b27d42ff15d31bc231df2a13274fda95b7b87eb/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313630302f312a685f356a42594539356f6b57465f4e45556a573651412e706e67\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Now after some time, you decide to get sober and control drinking alcohol. The liver does not need to break down a large amount of alcohol anymore so it signals the body again. The modifications that occurred earlier (represented by orange dots on the tails) to drive up the gene expression are replaced with new modifications (red dots) that drive down the gene expression.</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8afbc1e804ef86751f9176a834f1561cde5438b0/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313630302f312a565261727a4a6f77314c6b53457371784c4f50376e412e706e67\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>let&apos;s say you decide to take it further and stop drinking alcohol completely. The liver does not need to produce enzymes that break alcohol at all. This results in further more modifications at the tails of histones that replaces the previous ones to basically say that <strong>turn this particular gene off</strong>.</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1002eb86e1053f2be1d2ed309f300efb9b259072/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313630302f312a746b69674b2d33356e427133336c796a4b65562d6d672e706e67\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>So here, the body has a mechanism to turn genes on or off based on the external factors. But it&apos;s not just binary. There can be some orange dots, some red dots, and some purple dots. So the body shows a wide range of gene expression.</p><p>Now if a large number of purple dots (modifications that turn the gene off) accumulate near a cluster of histones, it can result in modifications to the DNA itself that say &#x201C;I never want this gene to be switched on from now&#x201D;. In such cases, the histone molecules scrunch together and become so compact that no part of the DNA is exposed for the cell to read. It shuts down the gene expression, almost permanently.</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1a624793ae8bd7a8a325fa9452a71aa1aca20824/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313630302f312a765876775631374a55446f716757664436544e3435412e706e67\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>All of these modifications are called Epigenetic modifications! So to summarize, epigenetic modifications are changes that occur on the DNA that modifies the gene expression without altering the DNA sequence.</p><p>So how does your lifestyle affect the lives of your grand grand kids?

Receptor uncertain, but they were checking T-cells specifically, which are exactly the WBCs that get severely depleted in severe COVID-19. They were in-vitro studies, but this mechanism matches the in-vivo results I'm seeing better, and I find the idea moderately convincing. (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9\">Article</a>, h/t <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nRX7uwT2wNvvmd2Yd/coronavirus-justified-key-insights-thread?commentId=hRzw8sejgnb5C8C7B\">CellBioGuy</a>'s post mentioning it). SARS-2 is apparently <em>much</em> better at this than SARS-1.</p>\n<h3>Define ADE</h3>\n<p>Producing antibodies that are imperfect matches for one of these viruses (ex: optimized for another strain, or incompletely neutralizing) not only do not inactivate the virus, but instead get repurposed by the virus as a mechanism it can use to anchor and infect the cells that try to interact with those antibodies, most often immune cells.</p>\n<h2>Current conclusions</h2>\n<p>TL;DR: I think something else is having a larger impact than ADE on the immune system in severe COVID-19 disease. I have seen several theories, and listed some below. SARS-1 and MERS have both seen <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421\">plenty of bad vaccine reactions</a> that only show up at the animal-testing stage, and I still think vaccine development is going to be hard.</p>\n<p>While I don't understand the upstream causes of this, Th-2 type activation has been extensively noted in both severe COVID-19 disease and bad vaccine reactions. Th-2 type immunopathology (roughly, allergy-like immune responses in lieu of virus-like immune responses) seems likely to play a large role in both complicating vaccine development, and influencing disease severity.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Something weird is going on with white blood cell counts, but I'm currently leaning towards believing it might be something else causing it. Specifically, they're seeing T-cell lymphopenia. T-cells seem to be the worst-hit WBC (hyper-activated, decreased numbers), and I'd have expected them to be close to immune to Fc-based ADE once mature; they only express the receptor while young.</p>\n<p>SARS-1 and MERS vaccines both seem to have seen instances of bad reactions that required animal testing to become apparent. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3187504/\">SARS-1</a> and <a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/5/e02015-19\">SARS-2</a> exhibit ADE in-vitro against S-protein vaccines and not N-protein vaccines, but both S- and N-targeting vaccines sometimes had bad reactions in animal testing*. What I see as an in-vitro/in-vivo divergence boosts my impression that vaccine development will be challenging.</p>\n<p>*For example, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421\">this mouse study with SARS-1</a> saw hypersensitivity reactions to several S-containing vaccine subtypes (whole virus, VLP, S-protein), while <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17194199?dopt=Abstract\">this paper</a> tested S- or N- VRPs and found that their N-inoculation not only had had no protective effect, but made things worse when it \"resulted in enhanced immunopathology... within the lungs\" upon infection.</p>\n<p>Going on the current human results and a tiny <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1?fbclid=IwAR1odmOack-q6I3wm09wG6GcZ0upIB56oTrcphoXeOwjf14wtROb3Szwatw\">Macaque study with 4 monkeys</a>, for SARS-CoV-2 it does appear that getting through the disease once does preclude or largely-preclude reinfection by the same strain. I don't feel I can weigh in on whether this will stay true.</p>\n<p>A few theories trying to explain the blood results (I'm sure there's more):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glucocorticoid reaction/Too much cortisol as a possible upstream cause of the lymphopenia + neutrophilia reaction seen in SARS, RSV, Ebola</li>\n<li>Something is causing/reacting to the cytokine storm\n<ul>\n<li>Cytokines essentially steer the strategy of WBCs (activation/direction/activity)</li>\n<li>Both severe COVID19 disease and bad vaccine reactions steer towards Th-2 type immune responses (vaguely allergy-like)</li>\n<li>I found this a bit too confusing to wade into</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some sort of immune-cell suppression effects\n<ul>\n<li>Indirectly impacting cells at an earlier stage of blood cell development/differentiation (possibly as early as bone marrow stem cells)</li>\n<li>Infecting cells via its additional receptor-binding affinities, for purely manipulation purposes (probably without viral replication)\n<ul>\n<li>It seems to clearly prefer lung and bowels for productive viral replication; we aren't seeing viral inclusion bodies in most other tissues. I don't feel this rules it out.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I don't understand the upstream causes of this, Th-2 type activation has been extensively noted in both severe COVID-19 disease and bad vaccine reactions. Going on both the frequency with which it comes up in these contexts, and <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8218\">commentary by experts</a>, Th-2 type immunopathology (roughly, allergy-like immune responses in lieu of virus-like immune responses) seems likely to play a large role in both complicating vaccine development, and influencing disease severity.</p>\n<h3>Earlier thoughts</h3>\n<p>I've repeatedly had to update in the direction of it being plausible, and I currently think it's more-likely-than-not to be a factor that will complicate vaccine development.</p>\n<p>However, there do exist viable alternative theories for a lot of what I'm seeing, some of which I couldn't rule out.</p>\n<h3>Related Questions</h3>\n<p>I wanted to consolidate research on this into one place, and am interested in if anyone has additional solid arguments for/against it.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of questions about this, but lets boil it down to a few.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is this virus doing this in-vivo? What induces it? (note: it does happen in-vitro, but in-vitro is apparently easier to induce, and often not conclusive evidence that this happens in-vivo at appreciable levels)</li>\n<li>What exactly are the consequences of this ADE interaction? Can we get it down to symptoms?</li>\n<li>How does this change things?</li>\n<li>What can we do about it?</li>\n</ol>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<p>Whereof one cannot <em>speak</em>, thereof one must be silent.</p>\n<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein, <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>*</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some criticism of <a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2020/03/12/puzzles-for-physicalists/\">my post on physicalism</a> is that it discusses reference, not the world. To quote <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/my5pbcmQPb6ASSHYM/puzzles-for-physicalists/comment/vwXvqDZChNZftYxkt\">one comment</a>: \"I consider references to be about agents, not about the world.\" To quote <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/my5pbcmQPb6ASSHYM/puzzles-for-physicalists#w4fE7PpZhnxj7tf3Z\">another</a>: \"Remember, you have only established that indexicality is needed for reference, ie. semantic, not that it applies to entities in themselves\" and also \"you need to show that standpoints are ontologically fundamental, not just epistemically or semantically.\" A <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/39DwkziFPGYv7g2Bd/a-sketch-of-answers-for-physicalists\">post containing answers</a> says: \"However, everyone already kind of knows the we can't definitely show the existence of any objective reality behind our observations and that we can only posit it.\" (Note, I don't mean to pick on these commentators, they're expressing a very common idea)</p>\n<p>These criticisms could be rephrased in this way:</p>\n<p>\"You have shown limits on what can be referenced. However, that in no way shows limits on the world itself. After all, there may be parts of the world that cannot be referenced.\"</p>\n<p>This sounds compelling at first: wouldn't it be strange to think that properties of the world can be deduced from properties of human reference?</p>\n<p>But, a slight amount of further reflection betrays the absurdity involved in asserting the possible existence of un-referenceable entities. \"Un-referenceable entities\" is, after all, a reference.</p>\n<p>A statement such as \"there exist things that cannot be referenced\" is comically absurd, in that it refers to things in the course of denying their referenceability.</p>\n<p>We may say, then, that it is not the case that there exist things that cannot be referenced. The assumption that this is the case leads to contradiction.</p>\n<p>I believe this sort of absurdity is quite related to Kantian philosophy. Kant distinguished phenomena (appearances) from noumena (things-in-themselves), and asserted that through observation and understanding we can only understand phenomena, not noumena. Quoting Kant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Appearances, to the extent that as objects they are thought in ac­cordance with the unity of the categories, are called phaenomena. If, however, I suppose there to be things that are merely objects of the un­derstanding and that, nevertheless, can be given to an intuition, although not to sensible intuition, then such things would be called noumena.</p>\n<p><em><em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, Chapter III</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kant at least grants that noumena are given to some \"intuition\", though not a sensible intuition. This is rather less ridiculous than asserting un-referenceability.</p>\n<p>It is ironic that noumena-like entity being hypothesized in the present case (the physical world) would, by Kant's criterion, be considered a scientific entity, a phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Part of the absurdity in saying that the physical world may be un-referenceable is that it is at odds with the claim that physics is known through observation and experimentation. After all, un-referenceable observations and experimental results are of no use in science; they couldn't made their way into theories. So the shadow of the world that can be known (and known about) by science is limited to the referenceable. The un-referenceable may, at best, be inferred (although, of course, this statement is absurd in refererring to the un-referenceable).</p>\n<p>It's easy to make fun of this idea of un-referenceable entities (infinitely more ghostly than ghosts), but it's worth examining what is compelling about this (absurd) position, to see what, if anything, can be salvaged.</p>\n<p>From a modern perspective, we can see things that a pre-modern perspective cannot conceptualize. For example, we know about gravitational lensing, quantum entanglement, Cesium, and so on. It seems that, from our perspective, these things-in-themselves did not appear in the pre-modern phenomenal world. While they had influence, they did not appear in a way clear enough for a concept to be developed.</p>\n<p>We may believe it is, then, normative for the pre-moderns to accept, in humility, that there are things-in-themselves they lack the capacity to conceptualize. And we may, likewise, admit this of the modern perspective, in light of the likelihood of future scientific advances.</p>\n<p>However, conceptualizability is not the same as referenceability. Things can be pointed to that don't yet have clear concepts associated with them, such as the elusive phenomena seen in dreams.</p>\n<p>In this case, pre-moderns may point to modern phenomena as \"those things that will be phenomena in 500 years\". We can talk about those things our best theories don't conceptualize that will be conceptualized later. And this is a kind of reference; it travels through space-time to access phenomena not immediately present.</p>\n<p>This reference is vague, in that it doesn't clearly define what things are modern phenomena, and also doesn't allow one to know ahead of time what these phenomena are. But it's <em>finitely</em> vague, in contrast to the <em>infinite</em> vagueness of \"un-referenceable entities\". It's at least possible to imagine accessing them, by e.g. becoming immortal and living until modern times.</p>\n<p>A case that our current condition (e.g. modernity) cannot know about something can be translated into a reference: a reference to that which we cannot know on account of our conditions but could know under other imaginable conditions. Which is, indeed, unsurprising, given that any account of something outside our understanding existing, must refer to that thing outside our understanding.</p>\n<p>My critique of an un-refererenceable objective physical world is quite similar to Nietzsche's of Kant's unknowable noumena. Nietzsche wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The \"thing-in-itself\" nonsensical. If I remove all the relationships, all the \"properties,\" all the \"activities\" of a thing, the thing does not remain over; because thingness has only been invented by us owing to the requirements of logic, thus with the aim of defining, communication (to bind together the multiplicity of relationships, properties, activities).</p>\n<p><em><em>Will to Power</em>, sec. 558</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I continue to be struck by the irony of the transition from physical phenomena to physical noumena. Kant's positing of a realm of noumena was, perhaps, motivated by a kind of humility, a kind of respect for morality, an appeasement of theological elements in society, while still making a place for thinking-for-one's-self, science, and so on, in a separate magisterium that can't collide with the noumenal realm.</p>\n<p>Any idea, whether it's God, Physics, or Objectivity, can disconnect from the human cognitive faculty that relates ideas to the world of experience, and remain as a mere signifier, which persists as a form of unfalsifiable control. When Physics and Objectivity take on theological significance (as they do in modern times), a move analogous to Kant's will place them in an un-falsifiable noumenal realm, with the phenomenal realm being the subjective and/or intersubjective. This is extraordinarily ironic.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Every so often, when explaining issues related to AI safety, I call on\ngood old Asimov. That's easy: almost everyone that is at least interested\nin science knows his name, and the Three Laws of Robotics are a very good\nexample of misspecified goal. Or are they?</p>\n<p>The truth is: I don't know. My last reading through Asimov's robots\ndates back ten years; it was in french; and I didn't know anything about\nAI safety, specification and many parts of my current mental scaffolding.\nSo when I use Asimov for my points now, I'm not sure whether I'm spouting\nbullshit or not.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the solution is simple, for once: I just have to read the\ngoddamn stories. And since I'm not the only one I heard talking about Asimov\nin this context, I thought that a sequence on the robots stories would prove useful.</p>\n<p>My first stop is by \"I,Robot\", the first robot short story collection. And it\nstarts with the first story published by Asimov, \"Robbie\".</p>\n<p>Basically, this Robbie is a robot that takes care of a little\ngirl named Gloria. All is well, until Gloria's mother turns into the bad guy,\nand decides that her girl\nshould not be raised by a machine. She harasses her weak husband until he accepts\nto get rid of Robbie. But when Gloria discovers the loss of her friend, nothing\ncan comfort her. The parents try everything, including a trip to New York, paradise\nto suburbians. But nope, the girl is still heartbroken. Last try of the father: a\nvisit to a factory manned by robots, so little Gloria can see that they are lifeless\nmachines, not real people. But, tada! Robbie was there! And he even saves the girl\nfrom an oncoming truck! It's revealed that the father planned it\n(Robbie being there, not the murder attempt on his daughter),\nbut even so, the mother can't really send back the savior of her little girl. The End.</p>\n<p>Just a simple story about a nice little robot beloved by a girl,\nand the machinations of her mother to \"protect\" her from him.\nWhat's not to love? It's straight to the point, nicely written,\nand, if you can gloss over the obvious sexism, quite enjoyable.</p>\n<p>How does it hold in terms of AI safety discussion?\nWell, let Mr Weston, the father, give it to us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'Nonsense', Weston denied, with an involuntary nervous shiver. 'That's completely\nridiculous. We had a long discussion at the time we bought Robbie about the\nFirst Law of Robotics. You <em>know</em> it's impossible for a robot to harm a human\nbeing; that long before enough can go wrong to alter that First Law, a robot\nwould be completely inoperable. It's a mathematical impossibility. Besides\nI have an engineer from US Robots here twice a year to give the poor gadget\na complete overhaul. Why, there's no more chance of anything at all going\nwrong with Robbie than there is of you or I suddenly going looney -- considerably\nless, in fact. [...]'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That was underwhelming.</p>\n<p>See, Robbie is a human in a tin wrapping. Even worse, he's a human with a perfect\ntemper, that never really gets mad at the girl. For example, here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Robbie cowered, holding his hands over his face, so that she had to add,\n'No, I won't, Robbie. I won't spank you.[...]'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But Robbie was hurt at the unjust accusation, so he seated himself carefully\nand shook his head ponderously from side to side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nowhere do I see the kind\nof AI we're all thinking about -- an AI that does not hate you, but does not\nlove you either. Robbie loves you. At least Gloria. And this sidesteps pretty\nmuch every issue of AI safety.</p>\n<p>To be fair with old Isaac, the point of this story is clearly to counter\nthe paranoia about robots and machines. An anti-terminator, if you wish.\nAnd it works decently on that front. Robbie is always nice with Gloria --\nhe even saves her at the end. He's one of the characters with which we\nhave more empathy. And the only bad guys are the mother, and the\nrobophobic neighbors.</p>\n<p>This would be okay, if it did not wrap a wrong assumption:\nrobots are safe and the only issue comes from the nasty humans.\nWhereas what we want people to understand is that robots and AIs are not\nunsafe because they don't do what we tell them to do, but because they\ndo exactly that.</p>\n<p>What about the First Law, you may ask? After all, it was mentioned in the quote\nabove. Well, that mention is all we get in this story. To find the actual Law\n(yes, I know it, and so do you, but let's assume an innocent reader), you have\nto look at the first page of the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1- A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human\nbeing to come to harm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's what I'm talking about! I've come looking for Laws breaking up, not\nanti-discrimination against non-existent robots.\nI assume these are treated in the next stories. After all, there are three\nLaws of Robotics, and only one is mentioned -- not even written -- here.\nI'll reserve my judgement until all the stories are in. But still, don't try\nto pull another Robbie on me, Asimov.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p><i>Epistemic status: Not quite settled science, but preprints seem to agree.</i></p><p>Strong evidence points to presymptomatic sources as a major source of COVID-19 infections, possibly the majority. The exact proportion is environment-dependent; awareness and public health measures reduce symptomatic transmission more than they reduce presymptomatic transmission.</p><p>The main reasons for thinking presymptomatic transmission is significant are direct measurements of the serial interval and incubation period, and the outside view of what level of public health measures have and haven't succeeded at containment.</p><p>Before delving into papers, a quick aside. If COVID-19 were only transmissible when people were coughing or feverish, containing it would be pretty easy; just tell people to stay home if they have those symptoms. Some people might try to go out anyways, so you might also set up checkpoints where people have their temperature taken and have someone listen to whether they're coughing, but that would pretty much be sufficient. Empirically, however, COVID-19 is successfully spreading in countries which have taken these measures and other more extreme measures, which is what we would expect given presymptomatic transmission, but not what we would expect without it.</p><p>(<span style=\"color:rgb(29,28,29);\">Note: You might think this means that symptomatic people aren’t contagious, but actually it just means that people who show symptoms are doing a good job of isolating themselves</span>. People with COVID-19 symptoms are definitely contagious and need to isolate themselves and notify people they might have spread it to.)</p><p>(Note: Presymptomatic transmission is a separate issue from asymptomatic carriers. Presymptomatic transmission is when someone is contagious when they aren't symptomatic <i>yet</i>. An asymptomatic carrier is someone who is contagious but who never develops symptoms. Asymptomatic carriers seem to be rare, though not completely nonexistent.)</p><h1>Serial Interval and Incubation Period</h1><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_interval\"><u>serial interval</u></a> is the average length of time between transmissions in a transmission chain; that is, given pairs of people A and B where A was infected on a known date and then infected B on a known date, the serial interval is the average amount of time between those dates. The incubation period is the amount of time between when someone is infected, and when they display symptoms.</p><p>If the serial interval is shorter than the incubation period, this implies that a large fraction of transmission must be presymptomatic. So, with that in mind, I went looking for studies which measure COVID-19's incubation period and serial interval. These are in two tables below.</p><p>One of these studies, Tapiwa Ganyani et al, estimated the proportion of transmission which was pre-symptomatic: 48% (95% CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin. No other studies estimated this quantitatively, but most stated that their results provided qualitative evidence that presymptomatic transmission is occurring.</p><h2>Estimates of the Incubation Period</h2><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Study</strong></td><td><strong>Incubation Period (days)</strong></td><td><strong>Sample Size</strong></td><td><strong>Data source</strong></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported\"><u>Stephen A.

The sample size column for serial interval studies is unusually painful, as sample-size columns go, because many of the studies needed to account for uncertainty in who infected who; as such, sample sizes are reported varyingly in units of (in order from most to least reliable per sample) pairs, chains, clusters, and cases.</p><p>The study with the longest estimated serial interval, Qun Li et al, looks at a small number of clusters and guesses which cases infected which other cases. While it estimates a mean serial interval of 7.5, Its data is also compatible with an interpretation in which the mean serial interval is shorter and some of the transmissions are indirect. This change in interpretation would bring it in line with other studies in this set, which estimate shorter intervals.</p><p>One of these studies, Zhanwe Du et al, estimated the serial interval using when people became symptomatic (rather than when they were exposed), and found that in 13% of cases, the infectee showed symptoms before the infector did. This would imply that either in those cases the infector transmitted presymptomatically, the infector had a relatively long incubation period, and the infectee had a relatively short incubation period; or that this data set had major issues identifying who affected who. The distribution of SIs fits a nice Gaussian, which is some evidence that it's the former.</p><h2>Anecdotal Reports and Case Studies</h2><p>To understand what presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 would look like, I went looking for anecdotes and case studies of known COVID-19 transmission events. You can't use these to infer much about rates, but they're helpful for internalizing what presymptomatic transmission would look like.</p><blockquote><p>\"I believe I caught it when attending a small house party at which no one was coughing, sneezing or otherwise displaying any symptoms of illness. It appears that 40% of the attendees of this party ended up sick.\"</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EbethBerkeley/posts/10110434821081713\"><u>https://www.facebook.com/EbethBerkeley/posts/10110434821081713</u></a></p><blockquote><p>(via Google Translate) \"On January 24, Li and his grandfather, grandma, and father went to aunt's house for dinner, a total of 9 people. On January 28, Li developed fever. … all 9 people participating in the dinner were confirmed as confirmed cases.\"&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://hlj.people.com.cn/GB/n2/2020/0205/c220024-33767665.html\"><u>http://hlj.people.com.cn/GB/n2/2020/0205/c220024-33767665.html</u></a></p><h2>Practical Implications</h2><p>The main practical implication is that contact tracing is really important.</p><p>Contact tracing is where, when you find someone with COVID-19, you identify everyone they might have spread it to and warn them that they've been exposed. People who've been exposed are expected to quarantine themselves for 14 days, which is long enough that if they are in fact infected, there's only a 1% chance they are infected but not yet symptomatic . Back in January, this served two purposes: it ensured that if they had a cough, they wouldn't brush it off as something minor and keep going to work, and it ensured that if they <i>didn't</i> have a cough, they wouldn't transmit it while presymptomatic. The first issue is now less of a concern; everyone knows that if someone has a cough, they aren't supposed to go to work, even if it's definitely rhinovirus. The second issue is exactly as much a concern as it was before.</p></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Epistemic Status: Just quickly sketched out some rough solutions</em></p><p>Jessicata recently wrote a post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/my5pbcmQPb6ASSHYM/puzzles-for-physicalists\">Puzzles for Physicalists</a>. I&apos;m not a physicalist, but I&apos;ll attempt answer these questions from this perspective anyway.</p><h2><strong>Indexicality</strong>:</h2><p>Jessicata argues that indexicality is fundamental (without defining the exact sense she means fundamental) because our attempts to define things objectively don&apos;t actually succeed. For example, the indexical &quot;my phone&quot; could be expanded to the objective-looking &quot;Chris Leong&apos;s phone&quot;. However, this still actually needs to be defined relatively because there could be an exact clone of me somewhere in the universe.</p><p>I agree that the only way to refer to features of the world without encountering these non-uniqueness problems is relatively. So we never really encounter anything objectively. However, everyone already kind of knows the we can&apos;t definitely show the existence of any objective reality behind our observations and that we can only posit it. This isn&apos;t exactly news.</p><h2><strong>Pre-Reduction References</strong></h2><p>Jessicata argues that even though we often define water as H2O, if the chemical composition of the substance with the properties we observe from H20 had been XYZ, we would have defined water as that instead. She then argues that a) before we knew the science we still had an initial pre-reduction definition of water b) a philosophical account of science should contain these pre-reduction definitions so we can describe how they get attached to scientific definitions.</p><p>Why are these hard to define? Consider water. For simplicity we&apos;ll pretend that it&apos;s pre-reduction definition consists of &quot;feels wet&quot;, &quot;transparent&quot; and &quot;behaves like a liquid&quot;. Let&apos;s zoom in on &quot;transparent&quot; as if we could explain one, we will most likely be able to explain the others too. Just like water, &quot;transparent&quot; has a high-level and low-level definition and to fully understand it we need both. The high-level may contain thing like &quot;see&quot;, &quot;object&quot; and &quot;light&quot; as primitives so that we can define an object as transparent if we can see another on the other side of it. The low-level definition describes the exact physics from the object to the light in your brain. The high-level is just a description of logical relations while the low-level is physical. So both will occur in a physicalist account.</p><h2><strong>Epistemic Status of Physics</strong></h2><p>The argument here is that in order to explain our justification of physics we need a concept of agents. Otherwise we we&apos;ll be able to talk about running or observing experiments. Fair enough, but as to whether observations imply agents depends on what is meant by &quot;observation&quot;. If we imagine observations have a qualiatic element, then we can&apos;t model them with science. On the other hand, if they don&apos;t then we can apply the same double model trick. The high level relational model is something to do with informational processing; again we can define this as a logical relation. The low level contains a physical description of object observed, transmission of light to the observer, mechanism of the eyes and a description of the observers mind. This would explain the entanglement of the object and the observation.</p><h2><strong>Anthropics</strong>:</h2><p>Argues that physics on its own doesn&apos;t have the language to say what an observer is. If qualia existed then we could just say an observer is someone who experiences qualia, but without this we need to find a definition of observer. I agree that just given a physical system on its own we can&apos;t define what counts as an observer. Observers are an information processing concept so in order to define them we need an interpretation scheme so we can understand how a physical system is processing information.</p><p>So given a physical system containing a human, how do we figure out which interpretation scheme to use? Well, humans need to interact with the world. We could hypothetically look at a bunch of humans, see how they interact with the world, scan their brains and then define an interpretation scheme of the information in their brains. Given such a scheme, we could then define information update operations that accurately match the real world as observation and observers as systems that are efficient at making observations.</p><h2><strong>Functionalism</strong>:</h2><p>The argument is that functions like the hammer function are relative to observers. A hammer for humans isn&apos;t the same as one for an octopus. The argument is that similarly the functions of a mind are relative to a user and so what counts as planning, observation, ect. is relative. I&apos;m not a fan of functionalism at all, but I already explained about how to define observations without making it relative to each human. It&apos;s not so hard to generalise other mental operations in the exact same way.</p><h2><strong>Causality vs. Logic</strong>:</h2><p>I&apos;ve broken down this conflict <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YpdTSt4kRnuSkn63c/the-prediction-problem-a-variant-on-newcomb-s#Why_do_we_care_about_point_optimality_anyway_\">here</a>. We really shouldn&apos;t expect counterfactual &quot;coulds&quot; and logical &quot;coulds&quot; to be the same just because it&apos;s the same word.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>It didn&apos;t actually turn out that challenging in the end to produce plausible solutions for all of these problems. I&apos;m not definitely claiming that any of these solutions are correct, indeed they&apos;d probably all need work since I just quickly sketched them out, but the point is that it isn&apos;t at all clear that any of these issues are really problematic.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>Epistemic status: Hortative. I&apos;m trying to argue for carving reality at a new joint.</em></p><p>I think it&apos;s lovely and useful that we have labels, not just for <strong>rationalist</strong>, but for <strong>rationalist-adjacent</strong> and for <strong>post-rationalist</strong>. But these labels are generally made <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HsznWM9A7NiuGsp28/extensions-and-intensions\">extensionally</a>, by pointing at people who claim those labels, rather than intensionally, by trying to distill what distinguishes those clusters.</p><p>I have some intensional definitions that I&apos;ve been honing for a long time. Here&apos;s the biggest one.</p><h1>A rationalist, in the sense of this particular community, is someone who is trying to build and update a unified probabilistic model of how the entire world works, and trying to use that model to make predictions and decisions.</h1><p>By &quot;unified&quot; I mean <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N2pENnTPB75sfc9kb/outside-the-laboratory\">decompartmentalized</a>- if there&apos;s a domain where the model gives two incompatible predictions, then as soon as that&apos;s noticed it has to be rectified in some way.</p><p>And it&apos;s important that it be probabilistic- it&apos;s perfectly consistent to resolve a conflict between predictions by saying &quot;I currently think the answer is X with about 60% probability, and Y with about 25% probability, and with about 15% probability I&apos;m missing the correct option or confused about the nature of the question entirely&quot;.</p><p>The Sequences are aimed at people trying to do exactly this thing, and Eliezer focuses on how to not go horribly wrong in the process (with a special focus on not trusting one&apos;s own sense of obviousness).</p><p>Being a rationalist isn&apos;t about any specific set of conclusions- it&apos;s not about being an effective altruist, or a utilitarian, or even an atheist. It&apos;s about whether one is trying to <em>do that thing</em> or not. Even if one is doing a terrible job of it!</p><p>Truth-seeking is a prerequisite, but it&apos;s not enough. It&apos;s possible to be very disciplined about finding and assembling true facts, without thereby changing the way one thinks about the world. As a contrast, here&apos;s how the New York Times, whose fact-checking quality is not in dispute, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/11/shocked-by-trump-new-york-times-finds-time-for-soul-searching-1201852490/\">decides what to report:</a></p><blockquote>By and large, talented reporters scrambled to match stories with what internally was often called &#x201C;the narrative.&#x201D; We were occasionally asked to map a narrative for our various beats a year in advance, square the plan with editors, then generate stories that fit the pre-designated line.</blockquote><p>The difference between wielding a narrative and fitting new facts into it, and learning a model from new facts, is the difference <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SFZoEBpLo9frSJGkc/rationalization\">between rationalization and rationality</a>.</p><p>&quot;Taking weird ideas seriously&quot; is also a prerequisite (because some weird ideas are true, and if you bounce off of them you won&apos;t get far), but again it&apos;s not enough. I shouldn&apos;t really need to convince you of that one.</p><p>Okay, then, so what&apos;s a post-rationalist?</p><p>The people who identify as such generally don&apos;t want to pin it down, but here&apos;s my attempt at categorizing at least the ones who make sense to me:</p><h1>A post-rationalist is someone who believes the rationalist project is misguided or impossible, but who likes to use some of the tools and concepts developed by the rationalists.</h1><p>Of course I&apos;m less confident that this properly defines the cluster, outside of groups like Ribbonfarm where it seems to fit quite well. There are people who view the Sequences (or whatever parts have diffused to them) the way they view Derrida: as one more tool to try on an interesting conundrum, see if it works there, but not really treat it as applicable across the board.</p><p>And there are those who talk about being a fox rather than a hedgehog (and therefore see trying to reconcile one&apos;s models across domains as being harmful), and those who talk about how the very attempt is a matter of hubris, that not only can we not know the universe, we cannot even realistically aspire to decent calibration.</p><p>And then, of course:</p><h1>A rationalist-adjacent is someone who enjoys spending time with some clusters of rationalists (and/or enjoys discussing some topics with rationalists), but who is not interested in doing the whole rationalist thing themself.</h1><p>Which is not a bad thing at all! It&apos;s honestly a good sign of a healthy community that the community appeals even to people for whom the project doesn&apos;t appeal, and the rationalist-adjacents may be more psychologically healthy than the rationalists.</p><p>The real issue of contention, as far as I&apos;m concerned, is something I&apos;ve saved for the end: <strong>that not everyone who self-identifies as a rationalist fits the first definition very well, and that the first definition is in fact a more compact cluster than self-identification.</strong></p><p>And that makes this community, and this site, a bit tricky to navigate. There are rationalist-adjacents for whom a double-crux on many topics would fail because they&apos;re not interested in zooming in so close on a belief. There are post-rationalists for whom a double-crux would fail because they can just switch frames on the conversation any time they&apos;re feeling stuck. And to try to double-crux with someone, only to have it fail in either of those ways, is an infuriating feeling for those of us who thought we could take it for granted in the community.</p><p>I don&apos;t yet know of an intervention for signaling that a conversation is happening on explicitly rationalist norms- it&apos;s hard to do that in a way that others won&apos;t feel pressured to insist they&apos;d follow. But I wish there were one.</p>",

People are cancelling gatherings, working from home, and\ngenerally trying their best to </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.flattenthecurve.com/\">flatten the curve</a>.\nSlowing down the infection rate is critical because if we can't keep\nthis within the capacity of our medical system the harm goes up\nenormously.\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\nUnfortunately, these are steps that individuals and local governments\nare taking, based on their own assessment of the situation and without\nclear guidance from the CDC.  This means that there's a lot of social\ncontact still happening, enough that even with the steps we're taking\nI think it's likely there will be a period when the medical system\nwill be overwhelmed.\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhat does an overwhelmed medical system look like, in a country like\nthe US?  I think the closest comparison is to the the hardest hits\nparts of Italy, and it looks like running out of space, ventilators,\nnurses, and doctors.  Hospitals are <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/who-gets-hospital-bed/607807/\">going\ninto triage</a>, and people who would survive with treatment are dying\ninstead.  This <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/13/metro/these-are-crazy-numbers-boston-doctors-warn-that-italy-may-be-preview-coronavirus-outbreak-here/\">can\nhappen here</a>, and with our response so far, unfortunately, I think\nit's likely to.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhen it does happen, you don't want to be needing hospitalization\nduring the crisis.  This is clearly good from an altruistic\nperspective, since resources you take can't go to anyone else, but\nit's also important even if you only care about yourself, since there\nmight not be resources for you.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhen might the crisis start?  It looks like Italy published <a href=\"http://www.siaarti.it/SiteAssets/News/COVID19%20-%20documenti%20SIAARTI/SIAARTI%20-%20Covid19%20-%20Raccomandazioni%20di%20etica%20clinica.pdf\">triage\nguidelines</a> on March 6th, and the first English-language reports\nI'm seeing of their hospitals being overwhelmed are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-10/virus-spread-pushes-italian-hospitals-toward-breaking-point\">March\n10th</a>.  Here's a chart of new daily confirmed cases, from the numbers Italy\nhas been <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports\">reporting\nto the WHO</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/daily-new-italian-coronavirus-cases-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/daily-new-italian-coronavirus-cases.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/daily-new-italian-coronavirus-cases.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/daily-new-italian-coronavirus-cases-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWe're very behind on testing, and so we have a lot of \"presumptive\npositive\" cases which would likely be \"confirmed cases\" in Italy, so\nI'm going to try to use the former numbers.  Since the US is much\nlarger than Italy, with some parts less tied to others, I'm going to\nlook at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_megalopolis\">Boston-Washington\ncorridor</a> to get an estimate of where we are.  Here are yesterday's\ntotal cases, which are statewide but strongly concentrated in the\ncities:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MA: <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring\">108</a>\n</li>\n<li>RI: <a href=\"https://health.ri.gov/data/covid-19/\">5</a>\n</li>\n<li>CT: <a href=\"https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus\">6</a> (doesn't\ncount presumptive positives)</li>\n<li>NY: <a href=\"https://health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/\">325</a>\n</li>\n<li>PA: <a href=\"https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx\">22</a>\n</li>\n<li>MD: <a href=\"https://phpa.health.maryland.gov/Pages/Novel-coronavirus.aspx\">12</a>\n(doesn't count presumptive positives)</li>\n<li>DC: <a href=\"https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/coronavirus-data\">10</a>\n(doesn't\ncount presumptive positives)</li>\n<li>VA: <a href=\"http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/novel-coronavirus/\">17</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Total</b>: 497</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThis puts us at about where Italy was on 2/29, thirteen days ago and\nten days before the first reports of hospitals hitting capacity.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt's possible that our social distancing will be enough to push this\nout substantially, but I wouldn't count on it.  At this point I think\nif you get sick there's a strong possibility that by the time you need\nmedical help we'll be in triage.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nPersonally, I'm now being even more careful.  Our household has been\ntalking, and here are the precautions we're thinking of taking:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Contact within the house is ok, contact outside the house is not\nok.</li>\n<li>Contact is touching, or breathing air that others have recently\nbreathed.  This means no going to work, school, houses, stores, or\nhaving guests.</li>\n<li>Walking around outside with someone is ok, as is driving in a car\nwith someone if all the windows are open.</li>\n<li>We'll do final groceries today for perishables, fill the fridge, and\nplan not to get any more for, potentially, weeks.</li>\n<li>Receiving packages is ok, but we'll let them sit outside for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815307842/research-coronavirus-can-live-for-a-long-time-in-air-on-surfaces\">three\ndays</a> before bringing them in.</li>\n<li>If there's something important that's not allowed by this list (ex: go\ninto a pharmacy to get medicine) then we'll talk with the rest of the\nhousehold about whether it's worth the risk and what precautions make\nsense.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIt's not quite quarantine, but it's a lot of the way there.  I'm\nhoping that this isn't needed, but I don't expect looking back I'll\nthink this was an overreaction based on what we knew at the time.\nPart of why I'm this concerned is that <a href=\"https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1594122.html\">Siderea is</a>, and\nshe's been <a href=\"https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/\">consistently right and ahead of\nthe curve on this since late January</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI know this isn't something everyone can do, and we're lucky to be in\na situation where we can.  The more people that take steps like this\nthe more medical capacity will be available for others if things do\nget really bad.\n\n  </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Our best chance to fight CV is to create a vaccine as soon as possible. The irony is that we probably&#xA0;<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/25/business/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine/index.html\">already have</a>&#xA0;a vaccine but we can&#x2019;t prove that it works, until animal safety test, 1 and 2 stage of the clinical trials, which will take 12-18 months at least. How we could accelerate the creation of the vaccine?</p><p><br>There are several ideas, which are mostly inspired by the research of anti-aging drugs, which suffer from the same problem: the need for very long clinical trials. See&#xA0;<a href=\"https://qualiacomputing.com/2019/09/06/more-dakka-in-medicine/\">More Dakka post</a>&#xA0;by Sara Constantin.&#xA0;<br></p><ol><li><em>Immediate human trials</em>. If we have the vaccine in 3 months, not 18 months, we will save millions of lives. So, based on the trolley problem logic, we may risk the health of a few thousand people to achieve these goals, especially if they were volunteers. Thus we need to start a human test of the vaccine candidates immediately, even before the end of animal trials, which are still needed. here we get acceleration by performing in parallel the actions which are typically done sequentially.</li><li><em>Test safety and efficiency simultaneously.</em> We also should combine 1 stage and 2 stages o&#x430; tests, that is safety and efficiency, by giving the vaccine to people who are already under potential exposure to CV, like nurses, or old people in nurseries.&#xA0;</li><li><em>Test on large groups</em>. We should test a vaccine on a large group of people, like 10 000, so any finding will quickly get statistical significance. If the number of infection will decline relative to the control group, we could see it in one month.</li><li><em>Test all vaccine candidates</em>. All said above in 1-3 should be done with each of a dozen vaccine-candidates which are currently under developing. As a result, in one month we could know which vaccine candidate is the strongest and safest.&#xA0;</li><li><em>Manufacturing in advance</em>. Simultaneously, we should start large scale production of all vaccine-candidates, if it is possible. After the best (maybe 3 or 5) vaccine-candidates are validated, the stockpile of failed vaccine-candidates is destroyed, and the best vaccines are delivered to the population. This will help to fight the production delay.</li><li><em>Give people different best vaccines.</em> There is still could be long-term detrimental effects of some of the vaccines, so it may be better not to give everybody just one best vaccine - what if it makes everybody will become sterile in 1 year?</li><li><em>Combine best vaccines</em>. To increase protection, we could give each person a combination of several (but not all to ensure point 6) of the best vaccines. Here I assume that detrimental interaction between vaccines is typically unlikely, but more technical analysis is needed.&#xA0;</li><li><em>Establish biomarkers</em> of a good vaccine (e.g. antibodies).

    "htmlBody": "<p>The human adaptive immune system is the &#x201C;smart&#x201D; part of the human immune system, the part which learns to recognize specific pathogens, allowing for immunity to e.g. chicken pox. For our current purposes, the key players are T-cells. T-cells start out &#x201C;naive&#x201D; and eventually learn to recognize specific antigens, becoming &#x201C;memory&#x201D; T-cells. The aged immune system is characterized by a larger fraction of memory relative to naive T-cells (without dramatic change in overall counts). This makes the elderly immune system slower to adapt to new pathogens.</p><p>This post is mainly about why the naive:memory T-cell ratio shifts with age, how to undo that shift, and some speculation about implications and applications.</p><p>A natural hypothesis (frequently asserted in the literature): the shift toward memory T-cells is driven by slower production of new (naive) T-cells. The T-cells themselves maintain overall cell count by living longer, resulting in a larger proportion of older (memory) cells.</p><p>The interesting part: why would the production of new T-cells fall with age?</p><p>Turns out there&#x2019;s an obvious culprit: the thymus. The thymus is the last stop in the production line for new T-cells. It provides a sort of boot camp, training the T-cells to distinguish &#x201C;self&#x201D; (your own cells) from &#x201C;other&#x201D; (pathogens) using a whole battery of tricks. T-cells which make it through become full-time members of the naive T-cell reserve, and go on to police the body.</p><p>With age, the thymus does this:</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PVt0ADHpnxxfIMu2k9jMiFj7NwuEddUZeQYOt7yXnVpNgnl15sXgODcXH0Iu6S-FQKZR320L5qtz1KazWoE3W8n_rLAw_4YBd1GOZPLka1JROjlvnMIKYCkpXCYsswlrvPJlq5VG\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:624%\"></figure></p><p>(source: <u><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0849309484\">PhysAging</a></u>). This is called &#x201C;involution&#x201D; of the thymus.</p><p>Many organs shrink with age, but the thymus is among the most dramatic. Unlike most age-related loss, it starts even before development is complete - the thymus shrinks measurably between day zero and a child&#x2019;s first birthday. And it keeps on shrinking, at a steady rate, throughout childhood and adult life. The extremely early start of thymic involution suggests it&#x2019;s more a developmental phenomenon than an age-related phenomenon - perhaps an appropriate hormonal mix could undo thymic involution?</p><p>Turns out, <u><a href=\"http://www.jimmunol.org/content/175/4/2741.long\">castration of aged mice</a></u> (18-24 mo) leads to complete restoration of the thymus in about 2 weeks. The entire organ completely regrows, and the balance of naive to memory T-cells returns to the level seen in young mice. (Replicated <u><a href=\"http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/108/12/3777?sso-checked=true\">here</a></u>.) This is pretty dramatic evidence that:</p><ul><li>The thymus only generates/regenerates in the absence of sex hormones</li><li>The age-related shift in naive:memory T-cell ratio is driven primarily by thymic involution</li></ul><p>Particularly intriguing: we already have <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration\">chemical castration methods</a></u>, which are generally considered reversible. And it only took two weeks for the mice to regrow the whole thymus. At this point we&#x2019;re speculating, but assuming chemical castration also works and it translates to humans and the thymus doesn&#x2019;t rapidly re-involute after ceasing the chemical castration&#x2026; that sounds pretty promising as an avenue to fixing age-related adaptive immune system decline in humans.</p><p>As long as we&#x2019;re speculating, let&#x2019;s speculate hard. Immunotherapy is the hot new thing in cancer these days - apparently T-cells in young people remove precancerous cells and attack tumors, but in old people that doesn&#x2019;t happen as reliably. So&#x2026; have there been any studies on how castration effects cancer? For starters, chemical castration is already a widely-used treatment for both prostate and breast cancer. It works. But that&#x2019;s prostate and breast; they&#x2019;re sex organs, which we&#x2019;d expect to atrophy in the absence of sex hormones. I don&#x2019;t know of any studies on the effects of chemical castration on other types of cancer, in humans.</p><p>In rats, however, at least one <u><a href=\"http://jem.rupress.org/content/42/2/155.abstract\">century-old study</a></u> finds that castration prevents age-related cancer - and quite dramatically so. Castrated mice&#x2019; rate of resistance to an implanted tumor was ~50%, vs ~5% for controls. (<u><a href=\"https://www.popline.org/node/519091\">This study</a></u> finds a similar result in rabbits.) That old rat study cites a few others with mutually-conflicting results, and proposes that the age of the rats used explains it all: investigators who use young rats find that castration has little-to-no effect on resistance to an implanted tumor. Exactly what we&#x2019;d expect if it&#x2019;s all mediated by thymic involution &amp; regrowth.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a lot of questions here. Does chemical castration have similar effects to surgical castration on thymic regrowth in mice? Does chemical castration result in regrowth of the thymus in humans? (Several states/countries require chemical castration as a condition of parole for certain sex offenders, and it&#x2019;s also used for prostate and breast cancer, so it should be possible to find a few old people using it and see whether their thymus has regrown.) Does the thymus rapidly re-involute after administration of chemical castration ceases? Does chemical castration work as a treatment for cancers besides prostate and breast? Is the effectiveness of chemical castration against cancer age-dependent? Can temporary administration of chemical castration prevent cancer for a long period of time?</p><p>Turning away from applications and back to gears, there&apos;s also some key questions around thymic involution itself. The individual cells of the thymus don&apos;t have unusually slow turnover; if the thymic cell count is decreasing over time, then either the rate of production is decreasing or the breakdown rate is increasing. There <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3hfjaztptwEt2cCve/p/d4DvqS88Q29ZaJAj3\">has to be some upstream cause</a>. Whatever that cause is, it probably isn&apos;t the same upstream cause as most age-related problems - thymic involution doesn&apos;t follow the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3hfjaztptwEt2cCve/p/qX7E5o73sFeWDjJp8\">usual pattern</a> of no noticeable problems during development, slow loss of performance in middle age, then accelerating failure in old age.</p><p>I&#x2019;d be excited to see more work along these lines and/or references to relevant studies.</p>",

But in spite of the unfolding tragedy &#x2013; or perhaps <em>because of it </em>&#x2013; this will also be a time of great opportunity. If you have the skills, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gECsXTQPBKda9rrGe/perfect-competition#kmjFGY26muJEmPDq7\">slack</a>, and willingness to act, it might make sense to start looking for ways to contribute (regardless of whether you&#x2019;re seeking personal gain or altruistic benefit).</p><h2>Why does this seem like a good opportunity?</h2><p>There&#x2019;s a question of whether the current situation should change your overall cause-prioritisation, in determining what&#x2019;s most useful to work on over a &gt;1 year time-scale.  </p><p>This depends on where you started in your beliefs. To many readers, this likely does not provide any high-level updates, as we already believed that pandemics were <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/beth-cameron-pandemic-preparedness/\">a major risk for which the world was underprepared</a>, and that <a href=\"https://equilibriabook.com/\">the major institutions in charge were dysfunctional</a>. (Nonetheless, I am learning a <em>massive</em> amount by living through a time of global crisis when I have the epistemic ability and agency to understand what&#x2019;s happening and take action.)</p><p>Beyond that, there&#x2019;s the question of whether this is a <em>window of opportunity</em>. Even if your long-term goals remain after this pandemic, are there actions which will have an extraordinarily high leverage now, compared to other times?</p><p>I think there are a few reasons for thinking so. </p><ul><li><strong>Underpreparation. </strong>The world wasn&#x2019;t prepared. Everyone is scrambling to figure things out and there&#x2019;s too much for anyone to do. Hundreds of millions of people are suddenly changing their lives. The same goes for hundreds of thousands of companies and hundreds of governments. Most of them have no routines or experience in handling situations like these, which means they&#x2019;ll be facing <em>problems they have never faced before</em>. </li><li><strong>Exponential growth. </strong>Each infected person can be responsible for <a href=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html?fbclid=IwAR1ZJ0GaCHYaNJ_ljY0sj3ghE9QTY-yiOgQHgmNIAediGR9Enyb__mdhAnM\">thousands of downstream infections</a>, so the impact of behaviour change has a large multiplier. (Though this is modulo some uncertainty about counterfactual infections which I&#x2019;m unsure how to think about). </li><li><strong>Scale. </strong>The pandemic might grow to directly affect hundreds of millions of people, and it will indirectly affect billions. It is also a <em>memetic </em>pandemic (it probably consumes &gt;90% of my FB and Twitter feeds, and &gt;70% of my conversations). People are actively trying to find information, products, and similar. </li><li><strong>Direct exposure and quick feedback loops. </strong>Most startups die because no one wants what they&#x2019;re building. A common warning sign is that the founders aren&#x2019;t themselves users of the product. But in the coming months, you&#x2019;ll have to solve lots of problems for yourself, and chances are high that others might benefit from your solution (e.g. many spreadsheets and documents that went viral were initially just a single person trying to figure out how they should prepare, when their company should work remotely, etc.) Even if you&apos;re solving problems for others, you&apos;ll quick learn if there&apos;s any demand. </li></ul><h2>How can you contribute?</h2><p>I want to distinguish two kinds of windows of opportunities. For lack of a better term, I&#x2019;ll call them <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hMd2hp9SoWmTsPynA/of-two-minds\">&#x201C;social&#x201D; and &#x201C;causal&#x201D;</a>.</p><p><strong>Social windows of opportunity. </strong>Suddenly people are willing to listen to new advice, and consider different actions than they previously would. Hence there are attempts to get people to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saGP0Mx9AWDKW2kVMnHQwz_P2KFt873yV9b6U-cpgo0/edit?fbclid=IwAR1DB9Nzc2sIBzyF8-_MvnaPfigUQqDJnpwZ23vln1tVGcB8t0vSKHakJQI\">sign social pledges to self-quarantine</a> and <a href=\"https://stop-covid.tech/?fbclid=IwAR1QFx09WaMMFB_zz40R9MaKZCqheMpjV9TgxVjCU4PGVRpQhzUhiweKXR4\">epidemiologists are signing open letters to tech giants</a>. More nefariously, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1237853305046315014\">lawmakers are smuggling their pet policy proposal into things that look like corona response measures</a>. When all is said and done, it seems plausible the overton window for biorisk policy will have shifted massively, and that might bring with it other surprising opportunities as well.   </p><p><strong>Causal windows of opportunity. </strong>There are also many new problems to be solved, where you can build a tool or other solution that actually changes the world in a mechanistic way, and which isn&apos;t primarily about convincing other people of things.</p><p>For example: </p><ul><li><strong>Problem: </strong>stop touching your face. <strong>Example solution: </strong>build <a href=\"https://donottouchyourface.com/\">an app that uses your webcam and machine learning to warn when you&#x2019;re about to touch your face</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DTsfa92x2oSEyzzbe/what-i-m-doing-to-fight-coronavirus\">reconfigure your existing hardware startup to produce bracelets that vibrate when you&#x2019;re about to touch your face</a></li><li><strong>Problem: </strong>figure out who you might have infected after you realise you&#x2019;re ill. <strong>Example solution:</strong> build an app that uses Google maps location tracker to figure out who you&#x2019;ve been in contact with after you get ill.</li><li><strong>Problem: </strong>we&apos;ll run out of ventilators and other medical equipment. <strong>Example solution: </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/670932227050506/\">coordinate to design and manufacture open-source emergency medical equipment</a>  </li><li><strong>Problem: </strong>Many tens of millions of people will switch to full-time remote work for the first time. What new problems will they encounter? <strong>Example solution:</strong> I don&#x2019;t know! (Not a solution: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielgross/status/1237062116860977156\">buying stock in the wrong company because it had the same name as a video-calling company</a>)</li></ul><p>The <a href=\"https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/\">Coronavirus Tech Handbook</a> is an excellent resource summarising what people are building to fight the outbreak. Many projects are urgently looking for collaborators. </p><p>Even if you don&apos;t have tech skills, there are other ways of finding great opportunity in times of crisis. </p><p>Some of history&#x2019;s most successful trades (<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2773265/Billionaire-who-broke-the-Bank-of-England.html\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short\">2</a>) occurred during crises. There will likely be many financial opportunities during this crisis as well. (LessWronger user Wei Dai posted about how <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jAixPHwn5bmSLXiMZ/open-and-welcome-thread-february-2020#wAHCXmnywzfhoQT9c\">he successfully shorted the S&amp;P500</a> a few weeks back, and saw 700% returns already <em>before</em> the crashes of the recent week.) (This is not financial advice and if you have no trading experience now might be a particularly bad time to start.)</p><p>We have also seen a massive failure of responsible institutions <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h4vWsBBjASgiQ2pn6/credibility-of-the-cdc-on-sars-cov-2\">to respond appropriately and provide reliable information</a>. This means there&apos;s a shortage and need for reliable research and advice. This situation requires <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/A5WMcmJoYQuHiT9sY/in-the-presence-of-disinformation-collective-epistemology\">thinking for ourselves</a>. </p><p>Due to the existence of niche online communities doing this, I started <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5okDRahtDewnWfFmz/seeing-the-smoke\">seriously thinking and preparing</a> when there were 2 cases in my home country. A week and a half later I went home to my family and helped them prepare, as the only mask-wearing person at an empty row in the back of an otherwise full plane. There were 20 confirmed cases. My mom initially yelled at me and felt embarrassed when none of her friends were taking action, and asked why the authorities didn&apos;t say much. I left 5 days later. The case count had grown exponentially to &gt;400. A friend in med school told me to &quot;wash my hands and don&apos;t panic&quot;. I left from an airport where staff wore neither gloves nor masks, and shorted the local stock market. As I&apos;m writing this two days later the case count is almost 700. </p><p>The jury is still out, but sadly this seems to be a time where it&apos;s critically important to be able to take your beliefs seriously even when they go much further than official advice and mainstream behaviour . There will likely be many more opportunities over the coming months were good judgement and independent research can make an important difference. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coronavirus\">The LessWrong page of posts tagged coronavirus is one place to find and contribute to open questions. </a></p><h1>Addendum on profiting from outbreaks</h1><p>I strongly believe that that traders and entrepreneurs who try to gain profit during this crisis are <em>not immoral.</em> Rather, they are <em>incredibly important</em>. All this &#x201C;flatten the curve&#x201D; business is about smoothing out demand peaks over time. And financial markets (<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/lecture/financial-markets-global/rice-futures-DRmsX\">futures markets in particular</a>) are one of the key technologies our society has for coordinating to efficiently allocate resources across time. For example, it might have been hugely beneficial if someone with foresight would have stockpiled massive amounts of medical ventilators months back and thereby caused suppliers to increase production (it seems plausible this might have been worth it <em>even if</em> they wouldn&#x2019;t have sold those stockpiled ventilators at a massive markup). The actual stockpiling of masks that happened might also have been beneficial for this reason (but I am highly uncertain about this claim and wouldn&apos;t bet highly on it). </p><p>More generally, the coming year will present a massive wealth transfer, in various ways, to the prepared from the unprepared (or those <em>unable</em> to prepare, due to lack of money, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YABJKJ3v97k9sbxwg/what-money-cannot-buy\">knowledge</a>, or some other key prerequisite). I don&#x2019;t know what the implications of this will be. But once again, it might be worth a few hours of your time thinking about what opportunities it might generate. </p><p>tags: Coronavirus</p>",

It's an <em>‘I did X [including what I did wrong], and here's how it\nwent’</em> post (see also jefftk's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LFrWPkMcennzZwrsn/more-writeups\">More\nwriteups!</a>).\nI'm not complaining about how people treated me – they treated me well. And I'm\nnot trying to convince you to abandon AI alignment research – you shouldn't. I'm\nnot saying that anyone should have done anything differently – except myself.</p>\n<h1>Requirements</h1>\n<h2>Funding</h2>\n<p>Funding is the main requirement, because it enables everything else. Thanks to\nPaul Christiano I had funding for nine months between January 2019 and January\n2020. Thereafter I applied to the EA Foundation Fund (now <a href=\"https://ea-foundation.org/grantmaking/\">Center on Long-Term\nRisk Fund</a>) and <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future\">Long-Term Future\nFund</a> for a grant and\nthey rejected my applications. Now I don't know of any other promising\nsources of funding. I also don't know of any AI alignment research\norganisation that would hire me as a remote worker.</p>\n<p>How much funding you need varies. I settled on 5 kUSD per month, which sounds\nlike a lot when you're a student, and which sounds like not a lot when you look\nat market rates for software developers/ML engineers/ML researchers. On top of\nthat, I'm essentially a freelancer who has to pay social insurance by himself,\ntake time off to do accounting and taxes, and build runway for dry periods.</p>\n<h2>Results and relationships</h2>\n<p>In any job you must get results and build relationships. If you don't, you don't\nearn your pay. (Manager Tools talks about results and relationships all the\ntime. See for example <a href=\"https://www.manager-tools.com/2015/08/what-youve-been-taught-about-management-wrong-hall-fame-guidance\">What You've Been Taught About Management is\nWrong</a>\nor <a href=\"https://www.manager-tools.com/products/first-job-fundamentals\">First Job\nFundamentals</a>.)</p>\n<p>The results I generated weren't obviously good enough to compel Paul to continue\nto fund me. And I didn't build good enough relationships with people who could\nhave convinced the LTFF and EAFF fund managers that I have the potential\nthey're looking for.</p>\n<h2>Time</h2>\n<p>Funding buys time, which I used for study and research.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of time is how effectively and efficiently you use it. I'm good\nat effective, not so good at efficient. – I spend much time on non-research,\nmostly studying Japanese and doing sports. And dawdling. I noticed the dawdling\nproblem at the end of last year and got it under control at the beginning of\nthis year (see my <a href=\"https://rmoehn.wordpress.com/time-tracking/\">time tracking</a>).\nToo late.</p>\n<p>Added 2020-03-16: I also need a lot of sleep in order to do this kind of work. – About 8.5 h per day.</p>\n<h2>Travel and location</h2>\n<p>I live in Kagoshima City in southern Japan, which is far away from the AI\nalignment research hubs. This means that I don't naturally meet AI alignment\nresearchers and build relationships with them. I could have compensated for this\nby travelling to summer schools, conferences etc. But I missed the best\nopportunities and I felt that I didn't have the time and money to take the\nsecond-best opportunities. Of course, I could also relocate to one of the\nresearch hubs. But I don't want to do that for family reasons.</p>\n<p>I did start maintaining the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h8gypTEKcwqGsjjFT/predicted-ai-alignment-event-calendar\">Predicted AI alignment event/meeting\ncalendar</a>\nin order to avoid missing opportunities again. And I did apply and get accepted\nto the <a href=\"https://aisafetycamp.com/ai-safety-camp-toronto/\">AI Safety Camp Toronto\n2020</a>. They even chose my\nresearch proposal for one of the teams. But I failed to procure the funding that\nwould have supported me from March through May when the camp takes place.</p>\n<h2>Knowledge</h2>\n<p>I know more than most young AI alignment researchers about how to make good\nsoftware, how to write well and how to work professionally. I know less than\nmost young AI alignment researchers about maths, ML and how to do research. The\nlatter appear to be more important for getting results in this field.</p>\n<h2>Study</h2>\n<p>Why do I know less about maths, ML and how to do research? Because my formal\neducation goes only as far as a BSc in computer science, which I finished in\n2014 (albeit with very good grades). There's a big gap between what I remember\nfrom that and what an MSc or PhD graduate knows. I tried to make up for it with\nmonths (time bought with Paul's funding) of self-study, but it wasn't enough.</p>\n<p>Added 2020-03-26: Probably my biggest strategic mistake was to focus on producing results and trying to get hired from the beginning. If I had spent 2016–2018 studying ML basics, I would have been much quicker to produce results in 2019/2020 and convince Paul or the LTFF to continue funding me.</p>\n<p>Added 2020-12-09: Perhaps trying to produce results by doing projects is fine. But then I should have done projects in one area and not jumped around the way I did. This way I would have built experience upon experience, rather than starting from scratch everytime. (2021-05-25: I would also have continued to build relationships with researchers in that one area.) Also, it might have been better to focus on the area that I was already interested in – type systems and programming language theory – rather than the area that seemed most relevant to AI alignment – machine learning.</p>\n<p>Another angle on this, in terms of Jim Collins (see <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2019/02/18/jim-collins/\">Jim Collins — A Rare\nInterview with a Reclusive Polymath\n(#361)</a>): I'm not ‘encoded’ for\nreading research articles and working on theory. I am probably ‘encoded’ for\nsoftware development and management. I'm skeptical, however, about this concept\nof being ‘encoded’ for something.</p>\n<h1>All for nothing?</h1>\n<p>No. I built relationships and learned much that will help me be more useful in the\nfuture. The only thing I'm worried about is that I will forget what I've learned\nabout ML for the third time.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>I could go back to working for money part-time, patch the gaps in my knowledge,\nresults and relationships, and get back on the path of AI alignment research.\nBut I don't feel like it. I spent four years doing ‘what I should do’ and was\nultimately unsuccessful. Now I'll try and do what is fun, and see if it goes\nbetter.</p>\n<p>What is fun for me? Software/ML development, operations and, probably,\nmanagement. I'm going to find a job or contracting work in that direction.\nIdeally I would work directly on mitigating x-risk, but this is difficult, given\nthat I want to work remotely. So it's either earning to give, or building an\nincome stream that can support me while doing direct work. The latter can be\nthrough saving money and retiring early, or through building a ‘lifestyle\nbusiness’ the Tim Ferriss way.</p>\n<p>Another thought on fun: When I develop software, I know when it works and when\nit doesn't work. This is satisfying. Doing research always leaves me full of\ndoubt whether what I'm doing is useful. I could fix this by gathering more\nfeedback. For this again I would need to buy time and build relationships.</p>\n<h1>Timeline</h1>\n<p>For reference I'll list what I've done in the area of AI alignment.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>The following is a list of puzzles that are hard to answer within a broadly-physicalist, objective paradigm. I believe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2020/03/05/a-critical-agential-account-of-free-will-causation-and-physics/\">critical agentialism</a>&nbsp;can answer these better than competing frameworks; indeed, I developed it through contemplation on these puzzles, among others. This post will focus on the questions, though, rather than the answers. (Some of the answers can be found in the linked post)</p>\n<p>In a sense what I have done is located \"anomalies\" relative to standard accounts, and concentrated more attention on these anomalies, attempting to produce a theory that explains them, without ruling out its ability to explain those things the standard account already explains well.</p>\n<h2>Indexicality</h2>\n<p>(This section would be philosophical plagiarism if I didn't cite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/origin-objects\"><em>On the Origin of Objects</em></a>.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexicality\">Indexicals</a>&nbsp;are phrases whose interpretation depends on the speaker's standpoint, such as \"my phone\" or \"the dog over there\". It is often normal to treat indexicals as a kind of shorthand: \"my phone\" is shorthand for \"the phone belonging to Jessica Taylor\", and \"the dog over there\" is shorthand for \"the dog existing at coordinates 37.856570, -122.284176\". This expansion allows indexicals to be accounted for within an objective, standpoint-independent frame.</p>\n<p>However, even these expanded references aren't universally unique. In a very large universe, there may be a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Earth_thought_experiment\">twin Earth</a>&nbsp;which also has a dog at coordinates 37.856570, -122.284176. As computer scientists will find obvious, specifying spacial coordinates requires a number of bits logarithmic in the amount of space addressed. These globally unique identifiers get more and more unwieldy the more space is addressed.</p>\n<p>Since we don't expand out references enough to be sure they're globally unique, our use of them&nbsp;<em>couldn't</em>&nbsp;depend on such global uniqueness. An accounting of how we refer to things, therefore, cannot posit any causally-effective standpoint-independent frame that assigns semantics.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the trouble of globally unique references can also be seen by studying physics itself. Physical causality is spacially local; a particle affects&nbsp;<em>nearby</em> particles, and there's a speed-of-light limitation. For spacial references to be effective (e.g. to connect to observation and action), they have to themselves \"move through\" local space-and-time.</p>\n<p>This is a bit like the problem of having a computer refer to itself. A computer may address computers by IP address. The IP address \"127.0.0.1\" always refers to&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;computer. These references can be resolved even without an Internet connection. It would be totally unnecessary and unwieldy for a computer to refer to itself (e.g. for the purpose of accessing files) through a globally-unique IP address, resolved through Internet routing.</p>\n<p>Studying enough examples like these (real and hypothetical) leads to the conclusion that indexicality (and more specifically,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deixis\">deixis</a>) are fundamental, and that even spacial references that appear to be globally unique are resolved deictically.</p>\n<p>How does this relate to physics? It means references to \"the objective world\" or \"the physical world\" must also be resolved indexically, from some standpoint. Paying attention to&nbsp;<em>how</em> these references are resolved is critical.</p>\n<p>The experimental results you see are&nbsp;<em>the ones in front of you</em>. You can't see experimental results that don't, through spacio-temporal information flows, make it to you. Thus, references to the physical which go through discussing \"the thing causing experimental predictions\" or \"the things experiments failed to falsify\" are resolved in a standpoint-dependent way.</p>\n<p>It could be argued that physical law is standpoint-independent, because it is, symmetrically, true at each point in space-time. However, this excludes virtual standpoints (e.g. existing in a computer simulation), and additionally, this only means the&nbsp;<em>laws</em> are standpoint-independent, not the&nbsp;<em>contents of the world</em>, the things&nbsp;<em>described</em> by the laws.</p>\n<h2>Pre-reduction references</h2>\n<p>(For previous work, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gRa5cWWBsZqdFvmqu/reductive-reference\">\"Reductive Refrerence\"</a>.)</p>\n<p>Indexicality by itself undermines&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_from_Nowhere\">view-from-nowhere mythology</a>, but perhaps not physicalism itself. What presents a greater challenge for physicalism is the problem of pre-reduced references (which are themselves deictic).</p>\n<p>Let's go back to the twin Earth thought experiment. Suppose we are in pre-chemistry times. We still know about water. We know water through our interactions with it. Later, chemistry will find that water has a particular chemical formula.</p>\n<p>In pre-chemistry times, it cannot be known whether the formula is H2O, XYZ, etc, and these formulae are barely symbolically meaningful. If we discover that water is H2O, we will, after-the-fact, define \"water\" to mean H2O; if we discover that water is XYZ, we will, after-the-fact, define \"water\" to mean XYZ.</p>\n<p>Looking back, it's clear that \"water\" has to be H2O, but this couldn't have been clear at the time. Pre-chemistry, \"water\" doesn't yet have a physical definition; a physical definition is assigned later, which&nbsp;<em>rationalizes</em> previous use of the word \"water\" into a physicalist paradigm.</p>\n<p>A philosophical account of reductionism needs to be able to discuss how this happens. To do this, it needs to be able to discuss the ontological status of entities such as \"water\" (pre-chemistry) that do not yet have a physical definition. In this intermediate state, the philosophy is talking about two entities, pre-reduced entities and physics, and considering various bridgings between them. So the intermediate state needs to contain entities that are not yet conceptualized physically.</p>\n<p>A possible physicalist objection is that, while it may be a&nbsp;<em>provisional</em> truth that water is definitionally the common drinkable liquid found in rivers and so on, it is&nbsp;<em>ultimately</em> true that water is H20, and so physicalism is&nbsp;<em>ultimately</em> true. (This is very similar to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine\">two truths doctrine</a>&nbsp;in Buddhism).</p>\n<p>Now, expanding out this account needs to provide an account of the relation between provisional and ultimate truth. Even if such an account could be provided, it would appear that, in our current state, we must accept it as&nbsp;<em>provisionally</em> true that some mental entities (e.g. imagination) do not have physical definitions, since a good-enough account has not yet been provided. And we must have a philosophy that can grapple with this provisional state of affairs, and judge possible bridgings as fitting/unfitting.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there has&nbsp;<em>never</em> been a time without provisional definition. So this idea of ultimate truth functions as a sort of utopia, which is either never achieved, or is only achieved after very great advances in philosophy, science, and so on. The journey is, then, more important than the destination, and to even approach the destination, we need an ontology that can describe and usably function within the journeying process; this ontology will contain provisional definitions.</p>\n<p>The broader point here is that, even if we have the idea of \"ultimate truth\", that idea isn't meaningful (in terms of observations, actions, imaginations, etc) to a provisional perspective, unless somehow the provisional perspective can conceptualize the relation between itself and the ultimate truth. And, if the ultimate truth contains all provisional truths (as is true if forgetting is not epistemically normative), the ultimate truth needs to conceptualize this as well.</p>\n<h2>Epistemic status of physics</h2>\n<p>Consider the question: \"Why should I believe in physics?\". The conventional answer is: \"Because it predicts experimental results.\" Someone who can observe these experimental results can, thus, have epistemic justification for belief in physics.</p>\n<p>This justificatory chain implies that there are cognitive actors (such as persons or social processes) that can&nbsp;<em>do</em> experiments and&nbsp;<em>see</em> observations. These actors are therefore, in a sense, agents.</p>\n<p>A physicalist philosophical paradigm should be able to account for epistemic justifications of physics, else fails to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2020/02/03/philosophical-self-ratification/\">self-ratify</a>. So the paradigm needs to account for observers (and perhaps specifically&nbsp;<em>active</em> observers), who are the ones having epistemic justification for belief in physics.</p>\n<p>Believing in observers leads to the typical mind-body problems. Disbelieving in observers fails to self-ratify. (Whenever a physicalist says \"an observation is X physical entity\", it can be asked&nbsp;<em>why</em> X counts as an observation of the sort that is epistemically compelling; the answer to this question must bridge the mental and the physical, e.g. by saying the brain is where epistemic cognition happens. And saying \"you know your observations are the things processed in this brain region because of physics\" is circular.)</p>\n<p>What mind-body problems? There are plenty.</p>\n<h2>Anthropics</h2>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle\">anthropic principle</a>&nbsp;states, roughly, that epistemic agents must believe that the universe contains epistemic agents. Else, they would believe themselves not to exist.</p>\n<p>The language of physics, on its own, doesn't have the machinery to say what an observer is. Hence, anthropics is a philosophical problem.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=book/table_of_contents\">standard</a>&nbsp;way of thinking about anthropics (e.g. SSA/SIA) is to consider the universe from a view-from-nowhere, and then assume that \"my\" body is in some way sampled \"randomly\" from this viewed-from-nowhere universe, such that I proceed to get observations (e.g. visual) from this body.</p>\n<p>This is already pretty wonky. Indexicality makes the view-from-nowhere problematic. And the idea that \"I\" am \"randomly\" placed into a body is a rather strange metaphysics (<em>when</em> and&nbsp;<em>where</em> does this event happen?).</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most critical issue is that the physicalist anthropic paradigm assumes it's possible to take a physical description of the universe (e.g. as an equation) and locate observers in it.</p>\n<p>There are multiple ways of considering doing so, and perhaps the best is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/\">functionalism</a>, which will be discussed later. However, I'll note that a subjectivist paradigm can easily find at least one observer: I'm right here right now.</p>\n<p>This requires some explaining. Say you're lost in an amusement park. There are about two ways of thinking about this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You don't know where you are, but you know where the entrance is.</li>\n<li>You don't know where the entrance is, but you know where you are.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Relatively speaking, 1 is an \"objective\" (relatively standpoint-independent) answer, and 2 is a \"subjective\" (relatively standpoint-dependent) answer.</p>\n<p>2 has the intuitive advantage that you can point to yourself, but not to the entrance. This is because pointing is deictic.</p>\n<p>Even while being lost, you can still find your way around locally. You might know where the Ferris wheel is, or the food stand, or your backpack. And so you can make a local map, which has not been placed relative to the entrance. This map is usable despite its disconnection from a global reference frame.</p>\n<p>Anthropics seems to be saying something similar to (1). The idea is that I, initially, don't know \"where I am\" in the universe. But, the deictic critique applies to anthropics as it applies to the amusement park case. I know where I am, I'm right here. I know where the Earth is, it's under me. And so on.</p>\n<p>This way of locating (at least one) observer works independent of ability to pick out observers given a physical description of the universe. Rather than finding myself relative to physics, I find physics relative to me.</p>\n<p>Of course, the subjectivist framework has its own problems, such as difficulty finding&nbsp;<em>other</em> observers. So there is a puzzle here.</p>\n<h2>Tool use and functionalism</h2>\n<p>Functionalism is perhaps the current best answer as to how to locate observers in physics. Before discussing functionalism, though, I'll discuss tools.</p>\n<p>What's a hammer? It's a thing you can swing to apply lots of force to something at once. Hammers can be made of many physical materials, such as stone, iron, or wood. It's about the function, not the substance.</p>\n<p>The definition I gave refers to a \"you\" who can swing the hammer. Who is the \"you\"? Well, that's standpoint-dependent. Someone without arms can't use a conventional hammer to apply lots of force. The definition relativizes to the potential user. (Yes, a person without arms may say conventional hammers are hammers due to social convention, but this social convention is there because conventional hammers work for most people, so it still relativizes to a population.)</p>\n<p>Let's talk about functionalism now. Functionalism is based on the idea of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/\">multiple realizability</a>: that a mind can be implemented on many different substrates. A mind is defined by its functions rather than its substrate. This idea is very familiar to computer programmers, who can hide implementation details behind an interface, and don't need to care about hardware architecture for the most part.</p>\n<p>This brings us back to tools. The definition I gave of \"hammer\" is an interface: it says how it can be used (and what effects it should create upon being used).</p>\n<p>What sort of functions does a mind have? Observation, prediction, planning, modeling, acting, and so on. Now, the million-dollar question:&nbsp;<em>Who is (actually or potentially) using it for these functions</em>?</p>\n<p>There are about three different answers to this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The mind itself. I use my mind for functions including planning and observation. It functions as a mind as long as I can use it this way.</li>\n<li>Someone or something else. A corporation, a boss, a customer, the government. Someone or something who wants to use another mind for some purpose.</li>\n<li>It's objective. Things have functions or not independent of the standpoint.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'll note that 1 and 2 are both standpoint-dependent, thus subjectivist. They can't be used to locate minds in physics; there would have to be some starting point, of having someone/something intending to use a mind for something.</p>\n<p>3 is interesting. However, we now have a disanalogy from the hammer case, where we could identify some potential user. It's also rather theological, in saying the world has an observer-independent telos. I find the theological implications of functionalism to be quite interesting and even inspiring, but that still doesn't help physicalism, because physicalist ontology doesn't contain standpoint-independent telos. We could, perhaps, say that physicalism plus theism yields objective functionalism. And this requires adding a component beyond the physical equation of the universe, if we wish to find observers in it.</p>\n<h2>Causality versus logic</h2>\n<p>Causality contains the idea that things \"could\" go one way or another. Else, causal claims reduce to claims about state; there wouldn't be a difference between \"if X, then Y\" and \"X causes Y\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(book)\">Pearlian causality</a>&nbsp;makes this explicit; causal relations are defined in terms of interventions, which come from outside the causal network itself.</p>\n<p>The ontology of physics itself is causal. It is asserted, not just that some state will definitely follow some previous state, but that there are dynamics that push previous states to new states, in a necessary way. (This is clear in the case of dynamical systems)</p>\n<p>Indeed, since experiments may be thought of as interventions, it is entirely sensible that a physical theory that predicts the results of these interventions must be causal.</p>\n<p>These \"coulds\" have a difficult status in relation to logic. Someone who already knows the initial state of a system can logically deduce its eventual state. To them, there is inevitability, and no logically possible alternative.</p>\n<p>It appears that, while \"could\"s exist from the standpoint of an experimenter, they do not exist from the standpoint of someone capable of predicting the experimenter, such as Laplace's demon.</p>\n<p>This is not much of a problem if we've already accepted fundamental deixis and rejected the view-from-nowhere. But it is a problem for those who haven't.</p>\n<p>Trying to derive decision-theoretic causality from physical causality results in causal decision theory, which is known to have a number of bugs, due to its reliance on hypothetical extra-physical interventions.</p>\n<p>An alternative is to try to develop a theory of <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2018/10/31/embedded-decisions/\">\"logical causality\"</a>, by which some logical facts (such as \"the output of my decision process\", assuming you know your source code) can cause others. However, this is oxymoronic, because logic does not contain the&nbsp;<em>affordance</em> for intervention. Logic contains the affordance for constructing and checking proofs. It does not contain the affordance for causing 3+4 to equal 8. A sufficiently good reasoner can immediately see that \"3+4=8\" runs into contradiction; there is no way to construct a possible world in which 3+4=8.</p>\n<p>Hence, it is hard to say that \"coulds\" exist in a standpoint-independent way. We may, then, accept standpoint-dependence of causation (as I do), or reject causation entirely.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>My claim isn't that physicalism is false, or that there don't exist physicalist answers to these puzzles. My claim, rather, is that these puzzles are at least somewhat difficult, and that sufficient contemplation on them will destabilize many forms of physicalism. The current way I answer these puzzles is through a critical agential framework, but other ways of answering them are possible as well.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>I recently had a &quot;duh&quot; moment while reading an Atlantic article. Coronavirus tests are not screening tests! Like, didn&#x2019;t we all learn about Bayesian probability, sensitivity, and the dangers of false positives and false negatives from a very similar question? And then, when I started reading about coronavirus test distribution in the news, I forgot all about that.</p><p>But I don&apos;t know what the probabilities are. A brief search didn&apos;t find them. Anyone know?</p><blockquote>Expectations are tempered; a similar promise from Vice President Mike Pence of 1.5 million tests by the end of last week did not come to pass. But even when these tests eventually are available, some limitations will have to be realized. Among them, these are diagnostic tests, not screening tests&#x2014;a distinction that should shape expectations about the role doctors will play in helping manage this viral disease.</blockquote><blockquote>The difference comes down to a metric known as sensitivity of the test: how many people who have the virus will indeed test positive. No medical test is perfect. Some are too sensitive, meaning that the result may say you&#x2019;re infected when you&#x2019;re actually not. Others aren&#x2019;t sensitive enough, meaning they don&#x2019;t detect something that is actually there.</blockquote><blockquote>The latter is the model for a diagnostic test. These tests can help to confirm that a sick person has the virus; but they can&#x2019;t always tell you that a person does not. When people come into a clinic or hospital with severe flu-like symptoms, a positive test for the new coronavirus can seal the diagnosis. Screening mildly ill people for the presence of the virus is, however, a different challenge.</blockquote><blockquote>&#x201C;The problem in a scenario like this is false negatives,&#x201D; says Albert Ko, the chair of epidemiology of microbial diseases at the Yale School of Public Health. If you wanted to use a test to, for example, help you decide whether an elementary-school teacher can go back to work without infecting his whole class, you really need a test that will almost never miss the virus.</blockquote><blockquote>&#x201C;The sensitivity can be less than 100 percent and still be very useful,&#x201D; Ko says, in many cases. But as that number falls, so does the usefulness of any given result. In China, the sensitivity of tests has been reported to be as low as 30 to 60 percent&#x2014;meaning roughly half of the people who actually had the virus had negative test results. Using repeated testing was found to increase the sensitivity to 71 percent. But that means a negative test still couldn&#x2019;t fully reassure someone like the teacher that he definitely doesn&#x2019;t have the virus. At that level of sensitivity, Ko says, &#x201C;if you&#x2019;re especially risk-averse, do you just say: &#x2018;If you have a cold, stay home&#x2019;?&#x201D;</blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/where-do-you-go-if-you-get-coronavirus/607759/\">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/where-do-you-go-if-you-get-coronavirus/607759/</a></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>3 days ago there was published a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3550308\">research </a>that swayed me significantly towards the opinion that COVID-19 is spreading better in cold (but not too cold) climates. I believe that the odds for this are probably over 50%, and if it&apos;s true there is a practical and scalable (although not extremely cheap) way to slow down significantly the spread of the coronavirus.</p><h2>Research Claims</h2><p>It seems that all current pandemic epicenter share a very similar temperature and humidity  (5-11OC and 47-79% humidity). Consider the following map:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ES23fdsUcAElyXY?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:91%\"></figure></span><p>As you can see all the central outbreak locations are lying only along a narrow east west distribution roughly along the 30-50 N&#x201D; corridor. This shows a correlation between hyper virus spread and specific climate conditions.</p><p>Why do I believe it&apos;s probably true?</p><p>1. The odds that randomly by pure luck all 6 different epicenters will be with similar climates and latitude seem like a too large of coincidence, even if we take into account that the 30-50N&apos;&apos; corridor does seem more populous than the average. There are many very populated places outside this corridor and none of them got hit as hard.</p><p>2. Iran, Italy, China, South Korea are very different places in terms of the political system and government competence, Intuitively it&apos;s hard to think about a better explaining cause root that caused the virus to be widely spread specifically in these locations.</p><p>3. It could also explain why some places that you would expect to be hit hard, like Thailand (which is the top global destination for Chinese tourism) or Taiwan, for now, don&apos;t seem to have it that bad.  Both of these countries have a tropical climate. Now granted there could be a higher spread in these countries that is underreported, but if they had it bad as in Italy or Iran it wouldn&apos;t go unnoticed.</p><h2>Implications</h2><p>What are the implications if we believe the research?</p><p>on the downside: as the weather warms up on the northern hemisphere more places will warm up enough and could provide optimal conditions to COVID-19, the researches list the following cities as potentially dangerous areas for coronavirus spread</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/moYtj8H.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>On the upside, if this is true there is something we might be able to do to slow down the virus spread, and the solution is simple: Increase temperatures in closed public spaces, or more simply - turn up the heat. If the coronavirus truly doesn&apos;t like heat increasing temperature will kill it faster on surfaces. If we could raise temperatures to hot but still bearable (27C/80F is a good place) in places like supermarkets, public transportation or clinics - and by this might slow down the spreading by reducing connectivity via killing the virus faster while it&apos;s on surfaces or in the air.</p><p>The main downside is that heating up costs money and we don&apos;t know for sure if it will help, A way to know for sure will be to conduct research that tests this assumption directly or even create A/B tests around the country to see if on average areas with high-temperature public areas get less pandemic growth.</p><p>Another option is to heat the places only at night to consume electricity outside the peak working-hours when it&apos;s pretty cheap anyway. The recent drops in Oil and Gas prices could mean it could be a sustainable and worthwhile act of public policy if it truly works.</p><p>EDIT: Found <a href=\"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/av/2011/734690/\">another research</a> from 2011 that finds similar findings regarding the first SARS coronavirus (from 2003). It is a different virus strand but they share similarities.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VWJdpvh.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:96%\"></figure></span>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Trace is a tool for writing programs which read, write and reason about programs.\nYou can find it <a href=\"https://github.com/johnswentworth/tracelang\">here</a>. I wrote it as a tool for my own research, and I expect that others in this space may find the ideas interesting/useful as well. I'd be especially interested in new use-cases and other feedback!</p>\n<p>Some kinds of things you might find Trace useful for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Algorithms which operate on a computation graph, e.g. backpropagation, belief propagation, or other graphical inference algorithms</li>\n<li>An intermediate data structure for static analysis, interpreters or compilers</li>\n<li>A general-purpose non-black-box representation of objectives/constraints for optimization</li>\n<li>A general-purpose non-black-box representation of world models for AI more broadly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disclaimer for all of these: Trace is brand-new, and it was built with a focus on the core ideas rather than the engineering. Syntax is liable to change as we figure out what does and does not work well. Do not expect it to be easy/pleasant to use at this point, but do expect it to provide novel ways to think about programs.</p>\n<p>One more warning: this doc is intended to be read start-to-finish. Trace does not really resemble any other tool I know of, and you will likely be confused if you just dive in.</p>\n<h2>What is Trace?</h2>\n<p>Trace is</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A programming/modelling language embedded in a python library. For use as a human-facing programming language, Trace is pretty terrible, but it’s sometimes a necessary step for other use-cases.</li>\n<li>A notation/data structure representing programs. For these use-cases, Trace is pretty good: compared to alternatives (e.g. <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html\">abstract syntax trees</a>), Trace offers a much more convenient representation of program structure.</li>\n<li>A data structure representing the computation performed by an arbitrary program - i.e. the trace (aka execution graph aka computation graph) of a program. For this use-case, I do not know of any other tool which is anywhere near as powerful as Trace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A prototypical use-case: suppose you want to test out a new inference algorithm. You can prototype the algorithm to operate on Trace data structures, which allows it to handle arbitrary programs (unlike e.g. pytorch graphs), with relatively little complexity (unlike e.g. python syntax trees). Then, you can write test-case world-models as programs in Trace notation. Those “programs” will themselves be fairly transparent Trace data structures, which your prototype algorithm can operate on directly.</p>\n<h2>Concepts</h2>\n<p>Here’s a simple python program:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    return n * factorial(n-1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let’s suppose I want to trace the execution of factorial(3), starting from the result and working backwards (e.g. for something analogous to backpropagation). Conceptually, I picture something like the call stack, with a box for each function call. Within each box, variable instances are in dependency order; arrows show cross-box dependencies:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/1/d/sd96WW1-q7XMOjaa4myWWCg/image?w=303&amp;h=580&amp;rev=219&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=11EkEZyVCqIg8JumgL285wDNzMJaYX7mrv-Q4lAoIYv4\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This is roughly the core data structure which Trace exposes. For every instance of every variable, it tells us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The value of the variable-instance</li>\n<li>The expression which produced that value</li>\n<li>The variable-instances which went into that expression</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Side note: every variable instance is assumed to be write-once; no in-place updating of values is allowed.)</p>\n<p>In Trace syntax, every variable-instance is a Symbol (S). The Symbol object contains both the symbol’s name (aka its literal) and a pointer to the “context” in which the symbol lives (i.e. the dotted boxes in the diagram). The context then assigns the literal to another symbol, a hardcoded value, or an Expression - a special type of Symbol which wraps a python function and some input Symbols. More on that in the next section.</p>\n<p>However, Trace’ core data structures differ in two important ways from the diagram above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They handle dynamic structure - i.e. programs which write programs</li>\n<li>Everything in Trace is evaluated lazily whenever possible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lazy evaluation allows us to write data structures which <em>look</em> a lot like normal programs (albeit with some unusual syntax), and which can fit in about as much memory as normal code, but allow access to the whole trace - every instance of every variable in the program’s execution.</p>\n<p>The main trick to a compressed, lazy representation is an operator which says “make a copy of this whole block, but with these changes: …”. In the factorial diagram above, each of the dotted boxes (except the last) is a copy of the first box, but with a different value of n. Ignoring the last box, we could represent it like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/1/d/sMl-gGQMv8Y-5Kd0y3Cajrg/image?w=303&amp;h=184&amp;rev=71&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=11EkEZyVCqIg8JumgL285wDNzMJaYX7mrv-Q4lAoIYv4\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Here the “?”s represent lazily-evaluated values which haven’t been evaluated yet. Note that the “copy” is nested within the outermost box - indicating that it, too, will be copied, leading to a whole nested ladder of blocks.</p>\n<p>In Trace syntax, the dotted boxes are Context objects, and the copy-with-changes operator is represented by function-call notation: <code>cont({‘n’:2})</code> makes a copy of the Context cont, in which ‘n’ is assigned the value 2. Values of variable-instances downstream of n will update in response to the new value of n, within the copy.</p>\n<h2>Core Data Structure</h2>\n<p>Here’s a full program in Trace; we’re going to walk through all the pieces.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from tracelang import S, E, Context\nfactorial = Context({\n    'fact': Context({\n        'result': S(S('n') == 0, {\n            True: 1,\n            False: S('n')*S('result', S('fact')({'n': S('n') - 1}))\n        })\n    })({'fact': S('fact')}),\n    'result': S('result', S('fact')({'n': S('n')}))\n})\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">&gt;&gt;&gt; S(‘result’, factorial({‘n’: 3})).get_value()\n6\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let’s start with the three main pieces: Symbols (S), Expressions (E), and Context. Very briefly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Symbol is a variable-instance. It’s defined by a literal (e.g. ‘n’) and a context in which to resolve that literal (e.g. <code>{‘n’: 2}</code>). Calling get_value() on a symbol resolves the literal within its context.</li>\n<li>Expressions are Symbols whose “context” is a python function, so we resolve them by calling the function. They are implicitly created by using operators like +, *, ==, or function call on Symbols.</li>\n<li>Contexts are basically dicts with a couple extra features: they provide a default context for any symbols within them, and we can “create a copy but with changes” via function-call notation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More details follow...</p>\n<p>Symbols are the starting point. A symbol is just a literal (e.g. ‘foo’ or 2) and a context mapping the literal to some value (e.g. <code>{‘foo’: ‘bar’}</code>; it doesn’t have to be a capital-C Context). By calling <code>.get_value()</code> on a symbol, we get the value of the literal from the context:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">&gt;&gt;&gt; S(‘foo’, {‘foo’: ‘bar’, ‘baz’: 2}).get_value()\n‘bar’\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both the literal and the context can themselves be symbols, in which case we resolve values recursively. For instance:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">&gt;&gt;&gt; S(S(‘is_case’, {‘is_case’: True}), {True: ‘it is’, False: ‘it is not’}).get_value()\n‘it is’\n&gt;&gt;&gt; S(‘foo’, S(‘bar’, {‘bar’: {‘foo’: 2}})).get_value()\n2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Conceptually, <code>S(‘x’, context)</code> works like the square-bracket accessor <code>context[‘x’]</code> - except that we recursively resolve symbols along the way.</p>\n<p>In our factorial program, notice that many of the symbols don’t have any explicit context - e.g. <code>S(‘n’)</code> or <code>S(‘fact’)</code>. <strong>When a symbol’s context is not explicitly passed, the context is set to the (lexically) enclosing Context</strong> - this is one of the two main uses of capital-C Contexts. For instance, the <code>S(‘n’)</code>’s in our example all have their context set to one of the two Contexts, depending on which one they appear inside.</p>\n<p>Expressions are a special type of Symbol which resolve by calling a python function. If we have a function</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def square(x):\n    return x*x\n</code></pre>\n<p>then we could call it via</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">&gt;&gt;&gt; E(square, S(‘x’, {‘x’: 2})).get_value()\n4\n</code></pre>\n<p>This resolves all the input Symbols, then calls the python function, as you’d expect. In practice, we don’t usually need to write E() explicitly - <strong>an E will be created automatically via operator overloading on Symbols</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">&gt;&gt;&gt; total = S(‘x’, {‘x’:2}) + S(‘y’, {‘y’:3})\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(total)\nE\n&gt;&gt;&gt; total.get_value()\n5\n</code></pre>\n<p>In our factorial program, E’s are implicitly created where we multiply symbols (i.e. <code>S(‘n’)*S(‘res’, …)</code>), subtract symbols (i.e. <code>S(‘n’) - 1</code>), compare symbols (i.e. <code>S(‘n’) == 0</code>), and where we call symbols (i.e. <code>S(‘fact’)({'n': S('n')})</code>).</p>\n<p>So if they're implicit, why do we need to know all this? Remember, the point of Trace is not merely to \"run the code\" (i.e. call <code>.get_value()</code>), but to query the structure of the computation - and E's are one of the main things which comprise that data structure. We'll see a bit of that in the next section.</p>\n<p>Contexts are, conceptually, mostly just dicts. They map things to other things. The two main differences between a context and an ordinary python dict are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a Symbol doesn’t have an explicit context, its context will be set to the lexically enclosing Context.</li>\n<li>By calling a Context with a dict, we create a modified copy of the context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the example program, we create a modified copy in three places:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>S('fact')({'n': S('n') - 1})</code> creates a copy of the context called ‘fact’ for the recursive call, just like the diagram from the previous section.</li>\n<li><code>Context({...})({'fact': S('fact')})</code> is used to pass a pointer to the fact-context inside of the fact-context itself, so copies can be made.</li>\n<li><code>S('fact')({'n': S('n')})</code> is just a pass-through function call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When actually using the factorial function, we create one more modified copy: <code>factorial({‘n’: 3})</code>. This is the first copy with a value actually assigned to ‘n’.</p>\n<p>Before we jump back in to our factorial example, let’s see how these pieces play together in a simpler example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import operator as op\nhalf_adder = Context({\n    ‘a’: 0,\n    ‘b’: 1,\n    ‘sum’: E(op.xor, [S(‘a’), S(‘b’)]),\n    ‘carry’: E(op.and_, [S(‘a’), S(‘b’)])\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>This example contains two Symbols (other than the E’s). Neither Symbol has an explicit context passed, so both have their context set to the enclosing Context - i.e. the object half_adder. To get value of ‘sum’ within half_adder, we’d call <code>S(‘sum’, half_adder).get_value()</code>. This would look up the values of <code>S(‘a’, half_adder)</code> and <code>S(‘b’, half_adder)</code>, then pass those values to the python function <code>op.xor</code>. We could also evaluate at other inputs by making a modified copy - e.g. <code>half_adder({‘a’: 1, ‘b’: 0})</code>.</p>\n<p>That’s all the core pieces. Let’s take another look at our example program:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from tracelang import S, E, Context\nfactorial = Context({\n    'fact': Context({\n        'result': S(S('n') == 0, {\n            True: 1,\n            False: S('n')*S('result', S('fact')({'n': S('n') - 1}))\n        })\n    })({'fact': S('fact')}),\n    'result': S('result', S('fact')({'n': S('n')}))\n})\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">&gt;&gt;\\&gt; S(‘result’, factorial({‘n’: 3})).get_value()\n6\n</code></pre>\n<p>We have two Contexts. The inner Context is our main function, but we need to use the outer Context in order to get a pointer to the inner context, so that we can make modified copies of it. There’s some code patterns which are probably unfamiliar at this point - e.g. <code>S(S(‘n’) == 0, …)</code> is used to emulate an if-statement, and we write things like <code>S(‘result’, fact)</code> rather than <code>fact[‘result’]</code>. But overall, hopefully the underlying structure of this code looks familiar.</p>\n<p>But if all we wanted to do was write and run code, we wouldn’t be using Trace in the first place. Let’s probe our program a bit.</p>\n<h2>Stepping Through the Code</h2>\n<p>Human programmers sometimes “step through the code”, following the execution step-by-step to better understand what’s going on. IDEs often provide tools to help with this (e.g. breakpoints), but most programming languages don’t offer a nice way to step through the code programmatically. For Trace, this is a simple - and fundamental - use-case.</p>\n<p>Here’s how we step through some Trace code.</p>\n<p>We start with our final output, e.g. <code>answer = S(‘result’, factorial({‘n’: 3}))</code>. Before, we called <code>answer.get_value()</code> on this object, but now we won’t. Instead, we’ll access the pieces which went into that Symbol: <code>answer._literal</code>, and <code>answer._context</code>. In general, we can “work backwards” in three possible “directions”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>answer._literal</code> is a Symbol/Expression, then we can step back through it, and/or we can get its value</li>\n<li>If <code>answer._context</code> is a Symbol/Expression, then we can step back through it, and/or we can get its value</li>\n<li>Once we have both values, we can look up <code>answer._context[answer._literal]</code> to find the Symbol/Expression/Value defining answer in its context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this case, the literal is not a Symbol, but the context is - it’s an Expression object, which performs the modified-copy operation on our factorial context. By calling <code>answer._context.get_value()</code>, we get a new Context, which is a copy of factorial with the modification <code>{n: 3}</code> applied. By looking at the Expression object itself, we can see the original factorial context and the <code>{n: 3}</code>: <code>answer._context._literal</code> is a list containing <code>factorial</code> and <code>{n: 3}</code>.</p>\n<p>Let’s go one step further in: we’ll set <code>last_step = answer._context.get_value()\\[answer._literal]</code>, and look at <code>last_step</code>.</p>\n<p>Now we get an object which looks like <code>S('result', S('fact', &lt;modified copy&gt;)({'n': S('n', &lt;modified copy&gt;)}))</code>, where the modified copy is the copy of factorial with <code>{n: 3}</code> applied. The outermost symbol once again has a string as literal, and its context is an Expression object performing the modified-copy operation on a Context. Calling <code>.get_value()</code> on the Expression <code>last_step._context</code> would lead us even further in.</p>\n<p>Now, obviously this is not a very convenient way for a <em>human</em> to trace through a program’s execution. But if we want to write <em>programs</em> which trace through other programs’ execution, then this looks more reasonable - there’s a relatively small number of possibilities to check at every step, a relatively small number of object types to handle, and we have a data structure which lets us walk through the entire program trace.</p>\n<h2>Definitely Real User Testimony</h2>\n<p>To wrap it up, here are some endorsements from enthusiastic Trace users.</p>\n<p>“Trace is an AI-oriented programming language for people who like Lisp, but think it doesn't go far enough.” - Ada Lovelace</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this just math?” - Charles Babbage</p>\n<p>“Trace combines the syntax of JSON with the semantics of a spreadsheet, but instead of just ending up horrendously hackish, it ends up horrendously abstract <em>and</em> horrendously hackish.” - John Von Neumann</p>\n<p>“In Trace, source code is truly just data, always.” - Alan Turing</p>\n</body></html>",

I&apos;m always happy to hear feedback; you can send it to me by replying to this email.</p><p>Audio version <u><a href=\"http://alignment-newsletter.libsyn.com/alignment-newsletter-90\">here</a></u> (may not be up yet).</p><h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/KnPN7ett8RszE79PH/demons-in-imperfect-search\">Demons in Imperfect Search</a></u> <em>(John S Wentworth)</em> (summarized by Asya): This post gives an analogy to explain <em>optimization demons</em>: a type of undesirable behavior that arises in imperfect search processes. In the analogy, a ball rolls down a hill trying to go as far down as possible, mimicking a gradient descent algorithm. The ball is benefited by random noise, but still basically only experiences local changes in slope-- it cannot see steep drop-offs that are a little off to the side. Small bumps in the hill can temporarily alter the ball&apos;s trajectory, and the bumps that are selected for are the ones that most effectively control its trajectory. In this way, over time the ball&apos;s trajectory selects for <em>demons</em>, twisty paths with high walls that keep the ball contained and avoid competing walls. Demons cause the ball to go down the hill as slowly as possible so that potential energy is conserved for avoiding competitor walls.</p><p>The general pattern this analogy is meant to elucidate is the following: In any imperfect search mechanism with a rich enough search space, a feedback loop can appear that creates a more-and-more perfect exploitation of the imperfect search mechanism, resulting in a whole new optimization process. The post gives several real world examples as proofs that this is a failure mode that happens in real systems. One example is metabolic reactions-- a chemical system searches by making random small changes to the system state while trying to minimize free energy. Biological systems exploit the search by manipulating the height of the barriers between low-free-energy states, raising or lowering the activation energies required to cross them. After enough time, some chemicals changed the barriers enough such that more copies of the chemicals were made, kicking off an unstable feedback loop that led to life on earth.</p><p>The post ends by posing an open question asking what about a system makes this kind of failure mode likely to happen.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think it&apos;s worth spelling out how this is different from the failure modes described in <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">Risks from Learned Optimization</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/92b3a9458c2d/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care\">AN #58</a></u>). In Risks from Learned Optimization, we are concerned that the outer optimizer will produce an unaligned <em>inner optimizer</em> because we&apos;re training it in diverse environments, and an inner optimizer may be the best solution for performing well in diverse environments. In this post, we are concerned that the outer optimizer will produce an unaligned <em>demon</em> (which may or may not be an optimizer) because the search process may have some self-reinforcing imperfections that allow it to be pushed strongly in a direction orthogonal to its objective. This direction could be bad unless the original outer objective is a perfect specification of what we want. This means that even if the <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/q2rCMHNXazALgQpGH\">conditions for mesa-optimization</a></u> don&apos;t hold-- even if we&apos;re training on a fairly narrow task where search doesn&apos;t give an advantage-- there may be demon-related failure modes that are worth thinking about.</p><p>I really like this post, I think it crystallizes an important failure mode that I haven&apos;t seen described before. I&apos;m excited to see more work on this class of problems.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X7S3u5E4KktLp7gHz/tessellating-hills-a-toy-model-for-demons-in-imperfect\">Tessellating Hills: a toy model for demons in imperfect search</a></u> <em>(DaemonicSigil)</em> (summarized by Asya): This post is trying to generate an example of the problem outlined in &apos;Demons in Imperfect Search&apos; (summarized above): the problem where certain imperfect search processes allow for self-reinforcing behavior, &apos;demons&apos;, that push in a direction orthogonal to the original objective.</p><p>The post runs a simple gradient descent algorithm in an artifically constructed search space. The loss function that defines the search space has two major parts. One part straightforwardly tries to get the algorithm to move as far as it can in a particular direction <em>x0</em> -- this represents our original objective function. The other part can be thought of as a series of periodic &apos;valleys&apos; along every other axis, (<em>x1</em> ... <em>xn</em>) that get steeper the farther you go along that axis.</p><p>When running the gradient descent, at first <em>x0</em> increases steadily, and the other coordinates wander around more or less randomly. In the second phase, a self-reinforcing combination of valleys (a &quot;demon&quot;) takes hold and amplifies itself drastically, feeding off the large <em>x0</em> gradient. Finally, this demon becomes so strong that the search gets stuck in a local valley and further progress stops.</p><p><strong>Asya&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think this is a good illustration of the problem specified in Demons in Imperfect Search. Clearly the space has to have a fairly specific shape, so the natural follow-up question, as is posed in the original post, is to think about what cases cause these kinds of self-reinforcing search spaces to arise.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Agent foundations</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dvaCebTNc2tfMDcxS/a-critical-agential-account-of-free-will-causation-and\">A critical agential account of free will, causation, and physics</a></u> <em>(Jessica Taylor)</em></p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/t7jGT7uyf56TGjeba/subjective-implication-decision-theory-in-critical\">Subjective implication decision theory in critical agentialism</a></u> <em>(Jessica Taylor)</em></p><h3><strong>Forecasting</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/APAD7PaEHgFyW3Nc4/ai-impacts-historic-trends-in-technological-progress\">Historic trends in technological progress</a></u> <em>(AI Impacts)</em> (summarized by Nicholas): One key question in thinking about AGI deployment and which safety problems to focus on is whether technological progress will be <em>continuous</em> or <em>discontinuous</em>. AI Impacts has researched the frequency of discontinuities in a number of case studies, that were selected on the possibility of having discontinuities. An example of a discontinuity in flight speed records would be the Fairey Delta 2 flight in 1956 which represented 19 years of progress at the previous trend. On the other hand, penicillin did not create a discontinuity of more than ten years in the number of deaths from syphilis in the US. This post summarizes a number of those case studies. As it is already a summary, I will just refer you to the post for more information.</p><p><strong>Nicholas&apos;s opinion:</strong> I&#x2019;m looking forward to reading AI Impacts&#x2019; conclusions after completing these case studies. My impression from reading through these is that discontinuities happen, but rarely, and small discontinuities are more common than larger ones. However, I remain uncertain of a) how relevant each of these examples is to AI progress, and b) if I missed any key ways in which the examples differ from each other.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/incomplete-case-studies-of-discontinuous-progress/\">Incomplete case studies of discontinuous progress</a></u></p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous (Alignment)</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/cortes-pizarro-and-afonso-as-precedents-for-ai-takeover/\">Cort&#xE9;s, Pizarro, and Afonso as Precedents for Takeover</a></u> <em>(Daniel Kokotajlo)</em> (summarized by Matthew): This post lists three historical examples of how small human groups conquered large parts of the world, and shows how they are arguably precedents for AI takeover scenarios. The first two historical examples are the conquests of American civilizations by Hern&#xE1;n Cort&#xE9;s and Francisco Pizarro in the early 16th century. The third example is the Portugese capture of key Indian Ocean trading ports, which happened at roughly the same time as the other conquests. Daniel argues that technological and strategic advantages were the likely causes of these European victories. However, since the European technological advantage was small in this period, we might expect that an AI coalition could similarly take over a large portion of the world, even without a large technological advantage.</p><p><strong>Matthew&apos;s opinion:</strong> In a <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ivpKSjM4D6FbqF4pZ/cortes-pizarro-and-afonso-as-precedents-for-takeover?commentId=kNFNjBJjuzTd3irrR\">comment</a></u>, I dispute the claimed reasons for why Europeans conquered American civilizations. I think that a large body of historical literature supports the conclusion that American civilizations fell primarily because of their exposure to diseases which they lacked immunity to, rather than because of European military power. I also think that this helps explain why Portugal was &quot;only&quot; able to capture Indian Ocean trading ports during this time period, rather than whole civilizations. I think the primary insight here should instead be that pandemics can kill large groups of humans, and therefore it would be worth exploring the possibility that AI systems use pandemics as a mechanism to kill large numbers of biological humans.</p><h1><strong>AI strategy and policy</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/resources/activism-ai-community-analysing-recent-achievements-and-future-prospects/\">Activism by the AI Community: Analysing Recent Achievements and Future Prospects</a></u> <em>(Haydn Belfield)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The AI community has been surprisingly effective at activism: it has led to discussions of a ban on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS), created several initiatives on safety and ethics, and has won several victories through organizing (e.g. Project Maven). What explains this success, and should we expect it to continue in the future? This paper looks at this through two lenses.</p><p>First, the AI community can be considered an <em>epistemic community</em>: a network of knowledge-based experts with coherent beliefs and values on a relevant topic. This seems particularly relevant for LAWS: the AI community clearly has relevant expertise to contribute, and policymakers are looking for good technical input. From this perspective, the main threats to future success are that the issues (such as LAWS) become less novel, that the area may become politicized, and that the community beliefs may become less cohesive.</p><p>Second, the AI community can be modeled as organized labor (akin to unions): since there is high demand for AI researchers, and their output is particularly important for company products, and the companies are more vulnerable to public pressure, AI researchers wield a lot of soft power when they are united. The main threat to this success is the growing pool of talent that will soon be available (given the emphasis on training experts in AI today), which will reduce the supply-demand imbalance, and may reduce how commited the AI community as a whole is to collective action.</p><p>Overall, it seems that the AI community has had good success at activism so far, but it is unclear whether it will continue in the future.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think the ability of the AI community to cause things to happen via activism is quite important: it seems much more likely that if AI x-risk concerns are serious, we will be able to convince the AI community of them, rather than say the government, or company executives. This mechanism of action seems much more like the &quot;epistemic community&quot; model used in this paper: we would be using our position as experts on AI to convince decision makers to take appropriate precautions with sufficiently powerful AI systems. Applying the discussion from the paper to this case, we get the perhaps unsurprising conclusion that it is primarily important that we build consensus amongst AI researchers about how risky any particular system is.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/resources/beyond-near-long-term/\">Beyond Near- and Long-Term: Towards a Clearer Account of Research Priorities in AI Ethics and Society</a></u> <em>(Carina Prunkl and Jess Whittlestone)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper argues that the existing near-term / long-term distinction conflates four different axes on which research could differ: the capability level of AI systems (current pattern-matching systems vs. future intelligent systems), the impacts of AI systems (impacts that are being felt now like fairness vs. ones that will be felt in the future like x-risks), certainty (things that will definitely be problems vs. risks that are more speculative) and extremity (whether to prioritize particularly extreme risks). While there are certainly correlations across these axes, they are not the same thing, and discourse would be significantly improved by disambiguating the axes. For example, both authors of the paper see their work as considering the medium-to-long-term impacts of near-to-medium-term AI capabilities.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I definitely agree that near-term and long-term often seem to mean many different things, and I certainly support efforts to be more precise in our language.</p><p>While we&apos;re talking about near-term and long-term, I&apos;ll add in my own gripe: &quot;long-term&quot; implies that the effects will be felt only in the far future, even though many people focused on such effects are doing so because there&apos;s a significant probability of such effects being felt in only a few decades.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/resources/ai-futures-role-play/\">Exploring AI Futures Through Role Play</a></u> <em>(Shahar Avin et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper argues that role playing (akin to the &quot;wargames&quot; used in the military) is a good way to explore possible AI futures, especially to discover unusual edge cases, in a 10-30 year time horizon. Each player is assigned a role (e.g. director of AI at Tencent, or president of the US) and asked to play out their role faithfully. Each game turn covers 2 simulated years, in which players can negotiate and take public and private actions. The game facilitator determines what happens in the simulated world based on these actions. While early games were unstructured, recent games have had an AI &quot;tech tree&quot;, that determines what AI applications can be developed.</p><p>From the games played so far, the authors have found a few patterns:</p><p>- Cooperation between actors on AI safety and (some) restriction on destabilizing uses of AI seem to both be robustly beneficial.</p><p>- Even when earlier advances are risky, or when current advances are of unclear value, players tend to pursue AI R&amp;D quite strongly.</p><p>- Many kinds of coalitions are possible, e.g. between governments, between corporations, between governments and corporations, and between sub-roles within a corporation.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> It makes sense that role playing can help find extreme, edge case scenarios. I&apos;m not sure how likely I should find such scenarios -- are they plausible but unlikely (because forecasting is hard but not impossible), or are they implausible (because it would be very hard to model an <em>entire government</em>, and no one person is going to do it justice)? Note that according to the paper, the prior literature on role playing is quite positive (though of course it&apos;s talking about role playing in other contexts, e.g. business and military contexts). Still, this seems like quite an important question that strongly impacts how seriously I take the results of these role playing scenarios.</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Deep learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/03/05/compress/\">Speeding Up Transformer Training and Inference By Increasing Model Size</a></u> <em>(Zhuohan Li, Eric Wallace, Sheng Shen, Kevin Lin et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This blog post and associated paper confirm the findings from <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361\">Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/c29b3247da6f/4da2bu7tjd\">AN #87</a></u>) that the most efficient way to train Transformer-based language models is to train very large models and stop before convergence, rather than training smaller models to convergence.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11794\">Paper: Train Large, Then Compress: Rethinking Model Size for Efficient Training and Inference of Transformers</a></u></p>",

So one question about companies with AI research divisions is whether the possibility that they'll create AGI is already \"priced in\" to their stock.  If the company's share price already reflects the possibility that they'll create this transformative technology, we shouldn't expect to make money from the singularity on expectation by buying their stock.</p>\n<p>To investigate this question, let's examine Alphabet Inc's share price around the time AlphaGo defeated world Go champion Lee Sedol in March 2016.  This has been referred to as a \"Sputnik moment\" that inspired the Chinese government to start investing billions of dollars in AI research.  As a reminder of the kind of conversations that were being had at the time, here are some quotes from a <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2016/03/15/eliezer-yudkowsky-on-alphagos-wins/\">Facebook post</a> Eliezer Yudkowsky made:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>– Rapid capability gain and upward-breaking curves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Oh, look,” I tweeted, “it only took 5 months to go from landing one person on Mars to Mars being overpopulated.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We’re not even in the recursive regime yet, and we’re still starting to enter the jumpy unpredictable phase where people are like “What just happened?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One company with a big insight jumped way ahead of everyone else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AI is either overwhelmingly stupider or overwhelmingly smarter than you.

There was a time when AIs were roughly as good as the best human Go-players, and it was a week in late January.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is Alphabet's historical stock price.  Can you spot the point at which AlphaGo defeated the world Go champion?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NulH7AL.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>That's right, there it is in March 2016:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7gTrAlm.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>$GOOGL was worth about $727 on March 11, a Friday.  That weekend, a Go commentator <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160313032049/https://gogameguru.com/alphago-shows-true-strength-3rd-victory-lee-sedol/\">wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AlphaGo made history once again on Saturday, as the first computer program to defeat a top professional Go player in an even match.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the third of five games with Lee Sedol 9p, AlphaGo won so convincingly as to remove all doubt about its strength from the minds of experienced players.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In fact, it played so well that it was almost scary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In forcing AlphaGo to withstand a very severe, one-sided attack, Lee revealed its hitherto undetected power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe if Game 3 had happened on a weekday, $GOOGL would've moved appreciably.  As it is, Game 4 happened on Sunday, and AlphaGo lost.  So we don't really know how the market would react to the creation of an \"almost scary\" AI whose strength none could doubt.</p>\n<p>Even so, the market's non-response to AlphaGo's world championship, and its non-response to AlphaZero beating the world's best chess program after 4 hours of self-play in December 2017, seem broadly compatible with a modified version of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ztct6FKw58KsCGf9C/refactoring-emh-thoughts-following-the-latest-market-crash\">Alex_Shleizer's claim</a> regarding COVID-19:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...consider [the singularity]: the ability to predict the market suddenly shifted from the day to day necessary data analysis for stock price prediction that revolves more around business KPIs and geopolitical processes to understanding [artificial intelligence]. How many of the Wall Street analysts are [artificial intelligence] experts would you think? Probably very few. The rules have changes and prior data analysis resources (currently hired analysts) became suddenly very inefficient.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Either that, or all the <em>true</em> AI experts (you know, the ones who spend their time trading stocks all day instead of doing AI research) knew that AlphaWhatever was a big nothingburger all along.  0% chance of transformation, no reason to buy $GOOGL.</p>\n<h1>Even if the singularity is transformative, you want to be a shareholder</h1>\n<p>One objection goes something like: Yes indeed, I do have insider information, due to reading LessWrong dot com, that there will be this transformative change due to AI.  And yes indeed, it appears the market isn't pricing this info in.  <em>But</em>, I can't stand to profit from this info because as soon as the singularity happens, money becomes worthless!  Either we'll have a positive singularity, and material abundance ensues, or we'll have a negative singularity, and paperclips ensue.  That's why my retirement portfolio is geared towards business-as-usual scenarios.</p>\n<p>Here are some objections to this line of reasoning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First, singularity stocks could serve as a hedge.  If your singularity stocks rapidly increase in value, you can sell them off, quit your job, and work furiously on AI safety full-time.  In fact, maybe someone should create an EA organization that invests in singularity stocks and, in the event of an impending singularity, sells those stocks and starts implementing predefined emergency measures.  (For example, hire a world class mediator and invite all the major players in AI to stay at a luxury hotel for a week to discuss the prevention of arms races.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second, being a shareholder in the singularity could help you affect it.  Owning stock in the company will give you moral authority to comment on its direction at the company's annual shareholder meeting.  (<strong>EDIT</strong>: If you want voting rights in Google, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/whats-difference-between-googles-goog-and-googl-stock-tickers.asp\">it seems</a> you should buy $GOOGL not $GOOG.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, maybe your clickbait journalist goggles are the pair you want to wear, and the singularity will result in a hypercapitalist tech dystopia with cartoonish levels of inequality.  In which case you'll be glad you have lots of money -- if only so you can buy boatloads of insecticide-treated bednets for the global poor.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>More 2020 stock sales</h1>\n<p>I suspect Monday will not be the only time stocks go on sale in 2020.  Given the possibility of future flash sales, I suggest you get set up with a brokerage now.  I recommend Charles Schwab.  (They also have a great checking account.)</p>\n<p>If you believe in the singularity, why aren't you betting on it?</p>\n",

Mainly:</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci14/workshop-program/presentation/segal\">This paper</a> and <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/06/the-economics-of-privacy.html\">this blog post</a>. I’ve also especially benefitted from conversations with Andrew Trask.</em></p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>I think it’s fair to say that discussions of privacy issues tend to have a pessimistic edge to them. For a long time, the dominant narrative around privacy has been that it’s under threat. It’s either dying or it’s dead.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/slide2.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Slide2\"></p>\n<p>Here we have five decades of magazine covers announcing or predicting the death of privacy at the hands of technology. We also have the 1890 <em>Harvard Law Review</em> article “The Right to Privacy,” which is often seen as the starting point for modern political and legal discussions of privacy. The framing device for that article was that the camera and other new technologies posed severe threats to privacy. These threats were meant to be unprecedented enough to warrant, for the first time, the introduction of a new “right to privacy.” So it seems like we have been watching and working to stave off the death of privacy for a long time now.</p>\n<h4>Privacy Pessimism</h4>\n<p>The following narrative is a bit of a caricature, but I also do think it should be fairly recognizable. Something like it seems implicit in many discussions of privacy. The narrative goes like this: (1) People used to have a lot more privacy. (2) Unfortunately, over time, technological progress has gradually eroded this privacy. (3) Now new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are continuing this trend. Soon we may have little or no privacy left.</p>\n<p>Let’s call this narrative “Privacy Pessimism.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/privacy-optimism.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Privacy Optimism\"></p>\n<p>Now, of course, the Privacy Pessimism narrative isn’t universally accepted. However, I think that even when people do decide to critique it, these critiques don’t often qualify as “heartening.” Here’s a quote from <em>Privacy: A Very Short Introduction</em>, pushing back against Privacy Pessimism. The author writes:</p>\n<p><em>A requiem, however, is premature. The invaders are at the gate, but the citadel will not fall without a battle.</em></p>\n<p>There is definitely an element of optimism here. But I still don’t know that the situation being described is really one we should be happy to find ourselves in. I don’t know how comforting it is for the people on the right-hand side of the painting up there to be told: “Well, at least there’s a battle on.”</p>\n<h4>Privacy Optimism</h4>\n<p>What might it look like to be a proper optimist about privacy? One way to explore the space of narratives here is to just turn Privacy Pessimism on its head. The narrative we get out looks something like this: (1) It used to be the case that people had very little privacy. (2) Fortunately, technological progress has tended to increase privacy. (3) Now new technologies, like artificial intelligence, can be used to further increase and protect privacy.</p>\n<p>Let’s call this narrative “Privacy Optimism.”</p>\n<p>Privacy Optimism is obviously a much less familiar narrative than Privacy Pessimism. It also has a bit of a ring of contrarianism-for-the-sake-of-contrarianism. But is there anything to be said in favor of it?</p>\n<p>My view is that, perhaps surprisingly, both narratives actually do capture important parts of the truth. Technology has given us more of certain kinds of privacy and less of other kinds. And both hopeful and distressing futures for privacy are plausible.</p>\n<p>Even if losses and risks are very real, positive trends and possibilities ought to be a larger part of the conversation. It’s worth taking optimism about privacy seriously.</p>\n<h4>Plan for the Talk</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/slide7.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Slide7\"></p>\n<p>To lay out my plan for the rest of the talk: First, I’m going to be saying a little bit about what I have in mind when I talk about “privacy.” Second, I’m going to present an extremely condensed history of privacy over the past couple hundred years. I’m going to try to show that technology has had both positive and negative effects on privacy. I’ll actually try to argue that for many people the positive effects have probably been more significant. Third, I’m going to talk about why certain privacy problems are so persistent. Then, finally, I’m going to try to stand on top of this foundation to get a clearer view of the future of privacy. I’ll be giving special attention to artificial intelligence and the positive and negative effects it could ultimately have.</p>\n<h1>Clarifying “Privacy”</h1>\n<p>The word “privacy” has a lot of different definitions. There are actually entire books devoted to nothing other than just clarifying the concept of privacy. I’m going to be using a relatively simple definition of privacy. In the context of this talk, <strong>privacy</strong> is just the thing that we lose when people learn things about us that we’d rather they didn’t know.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we would like to talk about “larger” or “smaller” violations of privacy. Here’s how I’ll be thinking about quantification in the context of this talk: The more unhappy we are about a loss of privacy — or the more unhappy we would be <em>if properly informed</em> — the more privacy we have lost.</p>\n<p>To illustrate: Sometimes people are a bit annoyed when others discover their middle name. Maybe their middle name is “Rufus” or something. But typically people don’t care very much. Fully informing them of the implications of having their middle name known also probably wouldn’t lead them to care much more. So we can consider this case to be one where the loss of privacy is “small.” In contrast, most people would be quite a bit more upset if all of their texts with their significant other were published online. So that would count as a much larger violation of privacy.</p>\n<p>Last bit of conceptual clarification: I’m also going to distinguish between two different kinds of privacy. I’m going to say that we suffer a loss of <strong>social privacy</strong> when people within communities that we belong to learn things about us. And we suffer a loss of <strong>institutional privacy</strong> when institutions such as governments and companies learn things about us.</p>\n<p>To illustrate: Let’s say that someone would prefer for people in the workplace not to know their sexual orientation. If their orientation is revealed to their coworkers, against their wishes, then that would be a loss of social privacy. If some web advertising company is able to infer someone’s sexual orientation from their browsing activity and sends them targeted ads on that basis, then that would be a loss of institutional privacy.</p>\n<p>These are the concepts I’m going to be applying throughout the rest of the talk.<strong>[1]</strong></p>\n<h1>A Brief History of Privacy and Technology</h1>\n<p>Let’s move on to history. One choice we need to make when exploring the history of privacy is the choice of where to begin. I’m going to start in the centuries leading up to the Industrial Revolution. My justification here is that up until the start of industrialization — up until mechanization, the use of fossil fuels, and this sort of thing really started to take off — a lot of the core material and technological features of people’s lives didn’t tend to change very much from one generation to the next. Many of these features were also relatively constant from one region to the next. So while they did change and they did vary, they were still constant enough for us to talk about “pre-industrial privacy” without feeling totally ashamed about how much we’re overgeneralizing.</p>\n<h4>Social Privacy in the Pre-Industrial Era</h4>\n<p>Let’s focus on social privacy first. I think it’s fair to say that life in the pre-industrial era — or, for that matter, present-day life in places that have yet to industrialize — is characterized by extremely little social privacy.</p>\n<p>One significant fact is that it’s common for pre-industrial homes to have only a single room for sleeping. In some places and times, it may also be common for multiple families or for a large extended family to share a single home. It might even be common for people to be able to enter neighbors’ homes freely. So that means that if you’re at home, you don’t get space to yourself. You don’t have private places to stow possessions, have conversations, host guests, or have sex. If you do something at home, your family and perhaps many other people are likely to know all about it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/privacy-optimism-1.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Privacy Optimism (1)\"></p>\n<p>Another significant fact is that you most likely live out in the countryside, in a very low population density area. You probably very seldom travel far from home. A major limitation here is that the best way you have of getting around is probably simply to walk. This means that “strangers” are rare. Most people you interact with know most other people you interact with. This makes it very easy for information about you to get around. You can’t very easily, for example, choose to present a certain side of yourself to some people but not to others.</p>\n<p>You also probably can’t read. Even if you could, you probably wouldn’t really have access to books or letters. These things are expensive. One thing this implies is that if you have a question, you can’t simply look up the answer to the question. You need to ask someone in person. This makes private intellectual exploration extremely difficult. You can’t have an intellectual interest that you pursue without alerting the people around you that you have this interest. Or you can’t, for example, have a private question about your body, about community politics, or about ethical dilemmas you might face.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/privacy-optimism-2.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Privacy Optimism (2)\"></p>\n<p>Gossip is probably very prevalent and used to enforce strict behavioral norms. Because you probably live not very far above the subsistence level, you depend on your community as a social safety net. This means that disapproval and ostracism can be life-threatening. In extreme cases, you might even be subject to violence for violating important norms. Picking up and leaving to find a new community to accept you will also probably be extremely risky and difficult to do. It really is no small thing if information that you’ve been deviating from community norms gets around.</p>\n<p>So the state of social privacy in the pre-industrial era was <em>not good</em>.</p>\n<h4><strong>Technology and Social Privacy</strong></h4>\n<p>I think that technological progress has mostly been a boon to social privacy.</p>\n<p>One of the most straightforward ways in which it’s been a boon to social privacy has been by driving economic growth. Around the start of the Industrial Revolution, most people on Earth had standards of living that were just slightly above the subsistence level. Today most people on Earth are much richer. This means we can afford to spend more money and time on things that enhance our privacy. For example, we can typically afford to spend more money on homes with multiple sleeping rooms. Another smaller example: My understanding is that until the second half of the nineteenth century, it wasn’t yet fully the norm for Americans to use envelopes when sending letters. Because paper envelopes were expensive and difficult to produce. Then people got richer and manufacturing technology got better and suddenly it made sense to buy that extra bit of privacy. Simply put: Poverty is bad for privacy. And technological progress has supported a dramatic decline in poverty.</p>\n<p>Technological progress has also had a positive effect through new modes of transportation such as the bicycle, train, and car. These have helped people to have rich lives outside the watch of neighbors and family. It is relatively easy to go out to attend some meeting of a club, or religious group, or support group, without knowledge of your attendance or behavior at the meeting necessarily getting around. It’s also easier to just go out and hang out with whoever privately. There’s a lot of literature specifically on the liberating effect that the widespread adoption of the car had on teenagers and housewives in the context of American domestic life.</p>\n<p>The effect of information technology has also been pretty huge. Again, I think that the ability to ask and receive answers to questions without alerting people in your social circle is a really big deal. I think it’s a big deal that girls can privately look up information about birth control and reproductive health, for example, and I think it’s a big deal that people in religious communities can privately explore doubts on online forums. I think that people’s ability to communicate somewhat more furtively with friends and romantic partners using letters, phones, and instant messenger platforms has also been very important.</p>\n<p>There are also many small examples of improvements in information technology leading to improvements in social privacy. One recent case is the introduction of e-readers. There’s some evidence that this has actually changed people’s reading habits, by allowing people to read books without necessarily alerting the people around them as to what they’re reading. A lot of the people who read <em>Fifty Shades of Gray</em>, for example, probably would not have read it if they had needed to display a physical copy. There are so many small examples like this that we could pick. I think that together they add up into something quite significant.</p>\n<h4>Technology and Institutional Privacy</h4>\n<p>Okay, so social privacy has mostly gotten better. How about institutional privacy? Unfortunately, I think this is a very different story. In my view, the past couple hundred years have seen institutional privacy decline pretty dramatically.</p>\n<p>The basic idea here is that pre-modern states and other centralized institutions simply had a very limited capacity to know about individuals’ lives. Imagine that you’re the King of France in, say, 1400. You don’t have computers, you don’t have recording devices, you don’t have a means of transporting information faster than horse-speed speed, you don’t have a massive budget or a massive supply of literate civil servants. If you want to collect and process detailed information about the people in your kingdom, you’re going to have a hard time. Even just learning roughly how many people reside in your kingdom would be a difficult enough challenge.</p>\n<p>Today, you can count on many different institutions owning and being able to make use of vast amounts of data about you. That’s something new and something that would not have been possible in the relatively recent past. Steady improvements in information technology have supported a steady ratcheting up of how large and usable these datasets are.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/privacy-optimism-3.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Privacy Optimism (3)\"></p>\n<p>I probably don’t need to say very much about this trend, because so much has already been said about it elsewhere. One especially good book on the subject Bruce Schneier’s <em>Data and Goliath</em>. While the book is pretty gloomy, it’s also focused primarily on the erosion of institutional privacy in an American context. Here the main institutions of interest are companies like Facebook and intelligence agencies like the NSA. I think the picture gets a lot bleaker if you decide to look at places with weaker institutional safeguards.</p>\n<p>Recent news reports concerning the mass surveillance of the Uighur minority in China provide one of the most obviously bleak examples. A set of technologies ranging from smartphone apps to facial recognition cameras are apparently being leveraged to collect extensive data on Uighur individuals’ movements throughout cities, electronic communications, consumption patterns, and so on. It’s apparently made quite clear that if you don’t comply with certain expectations, if you seem to be in any way a threat to social order, then you’ll face a high risk of imprisonment in indoctrination camps. This is horrifying. And it’s a modern variety of horror.</p>\n<h4>Comparing the Two Trends</h4>\n<p>The picture I’ve just painted of the past two hundred years is one of rising social privacy and declining institutional privacy. A more detailed history would acknowledge that these trends have not been totally steady. There have surely been individual periods where social privacy declined and institutional privacy grew. The move toward people having more unified online identities through platforms like Facebook would be an example of a technological development that probably decreased social privacy. And the move toward more companies using end-to-end encryption would likewise be an example of a technological development that probably increased institutional privacy. But at least if we zoom out enough I think the overall trends are pretty clear.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/slide17.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Slide17\"></p>\n<p>How about the <em>net effect</em> of these two trends? Have the past couple hundred years of change, overall, constituted decline or progress?</p>\n<p>I think there are two main ways to approach this question. First, we can introspect. We can ask: “Would I be happy returning to the levels of both institutional <em>and</em> social privacy I would have had in Year X?” Returning to pre-industrial levels of institutional privacy, for example, might mean wiping all of your data from the servers of government agencies and tech giants. But returning to pre-industrial levels of social privacy might mean giving your extended family access to a live HD video stream of your bedroom. If you ultimately wouldn’t be happy to accept the trade-off, then this suggests that at least you personally have experienced an overall gain. You can also ask the same question for different pairs of dates to probe your intuitions about more short-term changes.</p>\n<p>Second, we can observe our own behavior. We can ask: “When there are trade-offs between social and institutional privacy, what do I tend to choose?” It seems to me like opportunities to trade one form of privacy off against the other actually come up pretty frequently in modern life. You can ask a friend a personally revealing question, for example, or you can ask Google. You can buy a revealing product on Amazon, or you can buy it with cash at a local store. You can directly reveal romantic interests in people, within communities you belong to, or you can swipe on a dating app. The choices you make when you face these dilemmas provide at least some evidence about the relative importance of the two forms of privacy in your life.</p>\n<p>My personal guess is that, for most people in most places, the past couple hundred years of changes in individual privacy have mainly constituted progress. I think that most people would not sacrifice their social privacy for the sake of greater institutional privacy. I think this is especially true in countries like the US, where there are both high levels of development and comparatively strong constraints on institutional behavior. I think that if we focus on just the past thirty years, which have seen the rise of the internet, the situation is somewhat more ambiguous. But I’m at least tentatively inclined to think that most people have experienced an overall gain.</p>\n<p>For many other people, who have been acutely victimized by insufficiently constrained institutions, the trend has surely been a much more negative one. For the Uighur community in Xinjiang, for example, it’s very difficult to imagine classifying the past thirty years of change as “privacy progress.” It’s very difficult to imagine taking a rosy view of privacy trends in East Germany in the middle of the previous century. A whole lot of people have experienced very tangible and even horrific suffering due to the erosion of institutional privacy.</p>\n<p>So it would be far too simple to call the story here a “positive” one. Nevertheless, I do think that the story is much <em>more positive —</em> and certainly much more nuanced — than many discussions of privacy issues suggest.</p>\n<h1>Barriers to Institutional Privacy</h1>\n<p>Before turning to the future, I want to spend a bit more time talking about the ongoing decline of institutional privacy. Specifically, I want to dwell on the question: “Why is it that we keep losing ground? What’s blocking us from having more institutional privacy than we do today?”</p>\n<p>In the last section, I talked about how technological progress has made it possible for institutions to learn more about us. But of course, this is only a n_ecessary condition_ for institutions learning more about us. It’s not a <em>sufficient</em> condition. It doesn’t explain why they <em>actually are</em> learning all that they’re currently learning.</p>\n<p>I think that one explanation here is <strong>practical necessity</strong>. Sometimes institutions learn about us because they would otherwise be unable to provide certain services, which are worth the loss of privacy. Credit services are one clear case. Credit card companies generally keep records of their customer’s purchases. These records are often pretty personally revealing. But the companies pretty much <em>need</em> to keep these records in order to provide customers with the services they want. It’s hard to bill someone at the end of the month if you have no idea what they bought that month.</p>\n<p>The other explanation is <strong>abuse of power</strong>. Sometimes institutions learn about us in order to pursue objectives that don’t actually benefit us. I think that the totalitarian system of surveillance established in East Germany is again one especially clear case. The main point of the Stasi pretty clearly wasn’t to give the people of East Germany what they wanted. Instead it was about advancing the interests of a powerful group, even though it came at an enormous cost to the people below.<strong>[2]</strong></p>\n<h4>Focusing on Practical Necessity</h4>\n<p>Both explanations are clearly very important. Here, though, I want to focus on practical necessity. One justification for this focus is that “practical necessity” is, in some sense, the more <em>fundamental</em> issue. The problem still exists even in the case of ideal governance, even in the case where everyone has good intentions and we get the design of institutions just right.</p>\n<p>Another justification for this focus is that data collected on the grounds of “practical necessity” can also subsequently be abused. You can credibly or even correctly say that some surveillance system is necessary to keep people safe, that it’s necessary to provide people with security, and then turn around and abuse the information that the system allows you to collect. You can correctly say that you need to collect certain data from customers, then abuse or mishandle that data once you have it. So the fact that “practical necessity” works as a justification for data collection, in so many cases, also helps to explain why institutions have so many opportunities to abuse their power.</p>\n<h4>The Problem of Lumpy Information</h4>\n<p>Let’s suppose that “practical necessity” is actually one major explanation for the decline in institutional privacy. This then suggests a deeper question: “Why is it practically necessary for institutions to learn so much about us?”</p>\n<p>One simple answer is that information is <em>lumpy</em>. The idea here is that learning some simple fact, which you must know in order to provide a service, can require learning or being in a position to learn many other sensitive facts. So even institutions that provide us with very narrow services end up receiving huge lumps of information about us.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/slide24.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Slide24\"></p>\n<p>To make this idea concrete, I’m going to give a few brief examples.</p>\n<p>First, let’s suppose that you want to learn whether someone else’s backpack has a bomb in it. If you don’t have access to any fancy tools, then you really only have a couple of options. First, you can open the backpack and look inside and learn whether or not there’s a weapon in there. In the process of doing this, though, you will also learn everything else that the backpack contains. Some of these items might of course turn out to be quite personal. Second, you can refrain from opening the backpack and thereby learn nothing. These seem to be the only two options. You need to either learn too much or learn too little.</p>\n<p>Second, let’s say you’re a cellular service provider. To provide this service, you need to know the times and destinations of the messages your customers are sending. Unfortunately, by collecting this seemingly limited information, you’ve put yourself in a position where you can make a lot of inferences about this person’s life. You may be able to infer that this person is having an affair, or that they’re receiving chemotherapy, and so on, purely on the basis of their call logs. A lot of additional information may come along for the ride.</p>\n<p>Third, let’s say that you want to study the statistical relationship between some health outcome and various lifestyle choices. You have no interest in learning about any individual person’s lifestyle. You only want to learn about overall statistical relationships. It unfortunately may be quite hard to do this with collecting lots of information about individuals and being in a position to identify or infer things about them when doing your analysis.</p>\n<h4>Summing Up</h4>\n<p>To summarise, then, here’s a partial explanation for why institutional privacy continues to be so poor: Institutions provide us with services that often require learning about us. Unfortunately, the lumpiness of information means that they are often in the position to learn <em>a lot</em> about us. Institutions aiming to abuse their power can also collect more information than they need to, in the first place, by at least semi-credibly claiming that this information is necessary for the services they provide.</p>\n<p>Institutional privacy has then been on the decline, in no small part, because the quantity and sophistication of the services that centralized institutions provide continue to grow. New services like telecommunication, online social networking, and protection from terrorism have been begetting further losses of institutional privacy.</p>\n<h4>Room for Optimism</h4>\n<p>If we want to hold out hope, that one day this trend may reverse, then one natural question to ask is: Could information be made less lumpy? Can we develop methods that allow institutions to have all the information they need to provide import services, without requiring so much other information come along for the ride?</p>\n<p>At least in principle, I think that we can. We already have examples of technological innovations that reduce the problem of lumpy information in certain limited contexts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/privacy-optimism-4.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Privacy Optimism (4)\"></p>\n<p>Just as one example, a bomb-sniffing dog can be considered a sort of technology. And what a bomb-sniffing dog allows you to do is to get out this one piece of information, the fact that some bag either does or does not have a bomb in it, without learning anything else about what’s inside the bag. Another example would be “differential privacy” techniques. These are a set of techniques that help people to discover overall statistical patterns in datasets, while being in a much weaker position to learn about the individuals represented in these datasets.</p>\n<p>However, I think it’s pretty clear that these sorts of technologies have had only a comparatively small effect so far. The effect hasn’t been nearly large enough to offset the other forces that are pushing us toward a world with less and less institutional privacy.</p>\n<h1>Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Privacy</h1>\n<p>In this last section, I’m going to be turning to talk specifically about artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>There’s recently been a lot of worry expressed about the privacy implications of AI. I also just sort of think, in general, that progress in AI is likely to be one of the most important things that happens over the next several decades and centuries. So I’d like to better understand what progress in AI implies for the future of privacy.<strong>[3]</strong></p>\n<h4>Social Privacy</h4>\n<p>Institutional privacy is again going to be the main focus of this section, because I think this is currently where the most noteworthy and potentially scary developments seem to be happening. But I will first say a bit about social privacy.</p>\n<p>One way that AI might support social privacy is by helping to automate certain tasks that would otherwise be performed by caregivers, assistants, translators, or people in other professions that essentially require sustained access to sensitive aspects of someone’s life.</p>\n<p>For example, there are people working on AI applications that could help people with certain disabilities or old-age-related limitations live more independently. This includes voice command and text-to-speech software, self-driving vehicles, smartphone applications that “narrate the world” to vision-impaired people by describing what’s in front of them, and so on. Greater independence will often mean greater privacy.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, one way that AI could erode social privacy is by making it easier to look other people up online. We may get to a point where consumers have access to software that lets you snap a photo of someone and then, taking advantage of facial recognition systems, easily search for other photos of them online. This could make people less anonymous to one another when they’re out and about and make it difficult to compartmentalize different aspects of your life (insofar as these aspects are documented anywhere in online photos).</p>\n<p>It’s obviously difficult to say what the overall effect on social privacy will be.<strong>[4]</strong> I would loosely expect it to be positive, mainly on the basis of the historical track record. But history of course provides no guarantees. A lot more thinking can certainly be done here.</p>\n<h4><strong>Institutional Privacy: Worries</strong></h4>\n<p>Moving on, now, to institution privacy. A lot of people have raised concerns about the impact that AI could have on this form of privacy. I think these concerns are very often justified.</p>\n<p>I think there are essentially two main reasons to worry here. The first reason to worry is that AI can make it faster and cheaper to draw inferences from data. It can automate certain tasks that you would normally need human analysts to perform. Picking out individuals in surveillance footage would be one example. To stress the “scariness angle” here, the Stasi relied on hundreds of thousands of employees and part-time informants. Imagine if it was possible for contemporary authoritarian countries to do what was done in East Germany for only one hundredth of the cost.</p>\n<p>The second reason to worry is that AI can enable new inferences from data. AI can allow people to learn things from data that they otherwise wouldn’t easily be able to learn. One simple illustration of this phenomenon is a study, from a few years ago, that involved giving a lot of people personality tests, looking at their Facebook profiles, and then analyzing correlations between their test results and the pages they like on Facebook. The researchers then used the data they collected to train a model that can predict an individual’s personality traits on the basis of relatively small number of Facebook likes. At least the headline result from the study is that, if you know about 300 of the Facebook pages that someone has liked, then you can predict how they’d score on a personality test about as well as their spouse can. So this an example of using AI to draw new inferences about individuals from fairly small amounts of data.</p>\n<p>One way to rephrase the second concern is just to say that AI may make information even more lumpy than it is today. There may be contexts where you’re sharing what seems to you like a relatively small or narrow piece of information, but AI makes it possible to draw far-reaching inferences from that information that unaided humans would otherwise struggle to make.<strong>[5]</strong></p>\n<h4>Institutional Privacy: Hopes</h4>\n<p>My view is that it’s very reasonable to worry about where things are going. I think that the effect that AI has had on institutional privacy so far has almost certainly been negative. At least in the near-term, I think that effect will probably continue to be negative as well.</p>\n<p>At the same time, though, I do think that there are also some ways in which AI can help to support or safeguard institutional privacy. I think a lot of the applications are promising this regard have only really begun to be seriously explored in the past few years, so have yet to leave major footprints. I’m first going to walk through a few key varieties of applications. Then I’m going to make a speculative case for optimism. I’m going to argue that if certain technical challenges are overcome, and these kinds of applications become sufficiently widely adopted, then progress in AI may eventually allow us to partially <em>reverse</em> the decline of institutional privacy.</p>\n<h4>Hope #1: Stripping Sensitive Information from Datasets</h4>\n<p>Here’s the first way that artificial intelligence can help support institutional privacy: It can be used to strip sensitive information from datasets, before humans look at them.</p>\n<p>As one example of this sort of application, the police equipment company Axon is currently using AI to automatically detect and blur faces that are incidentally captured in body camera footage. They’re essentially using facial recognition software to not draw out additional information from the footage, but rather to <em>remove</em> information that it would otherwise be very costly to remove. A similar example is using image and text recognition software to automatically redact sensitive information from documents and ensure that nothing has accidentally been left in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/privacy-optimism-5.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Privacy Optimism (5)\"></p>\n<p>Another illustrative example, although this may not deserve the classification “AI,” is the software used to process data from airport body scanners. Just to give some context: About a decade ago, you may remember, airports started introducing these full-body scanners. You’d step into them, and then TSA agents would see, on their screens, essentially a pretty high-resolution scan of your naked body. A lot of people were pretty understandably concerned about that invasion of privacy. The TSA then responded to these concerns by writing software that essentially takes the raw scans and then transforms them into much more abstract and cartoonish images that don’t reveal personal anatomy. The software now allows them to learn whether people are carrying weapons without also learning what these people look like naked.</p>\n<h4><strong>Hope #2: Reducing the Need for Humans to Access Data</strong></h4>\n<p>Here’s a second way that AI can help support institutional privacy: It can help to automate information-rich tasks that human employees would otherwise need to perform.</p>\n<p>To use an analogy, let’s return to the bomb-sniffing dog case. A bomb-sniffing dog can be seen as a “tool” for automating the process of analyzing the contents of a bag and determining if there’s anything dangerous inside. Because we can automate the task, in this way, it’s not necessary for any human to “access” the “raw data” about what’s inside the bag. Only the dog accesses the raw data. The dog has also essentially been “designed” not to “leak” the data to humans.</p>\n<p>So if you’re automating the process of responding to customer requests, or the process of looking for signs of criminal activity in some dataset, then this reduces the need for any humans to actually look at the data that’s been collected. This may somewhat reduce concerns about individual employees abusing personal data and concerns about personal data being leaked. It may also just reduce the additional sense of “violation” that some people have, knowing that an actual human is learning about them. I think that most people tend feel a lot more comfortable if it’s just a dog or some dumb piece of software that’s doing the learning.</p>\n<h4><strong>Hope #3: Reducing the Need for Data Collection</strong></h4>\n<p>Here’s a third and final way that AI can help support institutional privacy: It can reduce the need for institutions to collect data in the first place.</p>\n<p>There’s an obvious objection that can be raised to the points I just raised about automation. Even if humans don’t <em>need</em> to look at certain data, they may still <em>choose</em> to. For example, Google Docs is a highly automated service. No Google employee <em>needs</em> to look at the personal diary that you keep in a doc file. But you may still have a sense of personal squeamishness about the fact the diary is being stored as a readable file on a server Google owns. You might have concrete concerns about your privacy one day being violated, for instance if a major data breach ever occurs. Or you might just dislike the thought, however hypothetical, that someone <em>could</em> look at the diary.</p>\n<p>These sorts of concerns can become a lot more serious and well-justified if a less well-established company, with weaker incentives to maintain a good reputation, is collecting your data. They can also, of course, become quite serious if your data is being held by a corrupt government or any organization that could plausibly use the information to coerce you. So automation only really gets you so far. What would really be nice is if institutions didn’t need to collect your data in the first place.</p>\n<p>As it turns out — although this may initially sound like magic — it actually is possible to process data without collecting it in any readable form. There are a number of relevant techniques with wonky names like “secure multiparty computation” and “homomorphic encryption.” These techniques are all currently extremely slow, costly, and difficult to use. This explains why they’re still so obscure. But over the past decade a lot of progress has been made on the challenge of making them practical.&nbsp; We still don’t know just how much more progress will eventually be made.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, progress in this domain and progress in AI could interact to enhance privacy. Progress on techniques like secure multiparty computation could make it possible for institutions to create and use certain AI systems without collecting data. And progress in AI could create more opportunities to apply techniques like secure multiparty computation. These techniques are of no real use, of course, if it’s still human beings doing the data processing.</p>\n<h4><strong>Exploring Best-Case Scenarios for Data Collection</strong></h4>\n<p>It really is important to stress, again, that techniques for privacy-preserving computing are still <em>wildly impractical</em> to apply in most cases. There are currently associated with very serious practical limitations. You are absolutely not going to find them being used everywhere next year. You also probably won’t see them being used everywhere next decade.</p>\n<p>My understanding is that no one really knows exactly how efficient and user-friendly these techniques could ultimately get. It’s possible they’ll never get good enough to matter very much. But they might also one day get good enough for their pervasive adoption to become practical.</p>\n<p>From a privacy optimism perspective, I think it’s useful to consider the best-case-scenario. If the practical limitations can mostly be overcome, then what’s the most that we could reasonably hope for?</p>\n<p>To probe this question, I’m going to focus on one particular technique called “secure multiparty computation” (MPC). There still aren’t very many examples of MPC being used in the wild. It also has a pretty boring name. At the same time, though, it has at least two appealing properties. First, at the moment, MPC is at least _more practical_ to apply than a number of other techniques. Second,&nbsp; the theoretical limits on what MPC can accomplish are extremely loose. If enough practical limitations are overcome, then the “ceiling” on its long-run impact is especially high.</p>\n<h4><strong>Secure Multi-Party Computation: Background Concepts</strong></h4>\n<p>Before explaining exactly what “secure multiparty computation” is, I sort of need to introduce a few basic background concepts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/slide35.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Slide35\"></p>\n<p>We can think of any given information processing task as involving three (often overlapping) sets of participants. First, there are <strong>input parties</strong> who provide inputs to be processed. This might be, for example, two Tinder users inputting their “swipes” into the app. Or it might be a group of patients whose data is being used to train a medical diagnosis system.</p>\n<p>Then there are the <strong>computing parties</strong>. These are the parties who process the inputs. In the first of the two cases just mentioned, Tinder would be the computing party. It’s computing whether the two people have matched. In the second case, the computing party would be the medical team training the AI system.</p>\n<p>The people who receive the outputs of the computation are the <strong>results parties</strong>. The two Tinder users are again the results parties in the first case. The team developing the system is again the results party in the second case. They’re the ones who end up with the trained AI system, which is what constitutes the output in this case.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/slide36.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Slide36\"></p>\n<p>To just to make the idea totally clear, here’s a little chart with four different cases laid out. You can also see how the breakdown works in the case of domestic surveillance and personal genetic data analysis.</p>\n<p>Privacy issues basically arise when information travels from one class of parties to another. For example, Tinder ends up with information about who their users have swiped left and right on. The medical researchers end up with information about the patients who have provided their data. In general, institutions that serve as computing parties are often in a position to extract a lot of information from the inputs they receive and the outputs they send out.</p>\n<h4><strong>Secure Multi-Party Computation: An Informal Introduction</strong></h4>\n<p>Okay now. Preamble over. What <strong>secure multiparty computation</strong> <strong>(or MPC)</strong> refers to is: a set of protocols that prevent computing parties from needing to learn the inputs or outputs of a computation.</p>\n<p>And the key result here is that: So long as a given computation involves at least two computing parties, and so long as at least one of them is correctly following the expected protocol, then it’s not in principle necessary for the computing parties to ever gain access to the inputs or outputs. They can instead receive what looks to them like nonsense, process this apparent nonsense, and then send out a different form of apparent nonsense. The results parties can then reconstruct the correct output from the apparent nonsense they receive. The computing parties never need to be in a position to learn anything about the inputs and outputs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/slide37.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Slide37\"></p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter what the computation is. The result always holds. In principle, it is possible to perform <em>any</em> computation using MPC.</p>\n<p>Let’s return a couple concrete cases. Let’s say two groups are cooperating to analyze medical data. If they split the work of analyzing it, then they can use an MPC protocol to learn whatever they need to learn without actually collecting any of the medical data in a legible form. Likewise: If two different companies – or two different groups within a company – cooperate to process dating app swipes, then it’s possible to tell users if they’ve matched without knowing which way each user swiped or <em>even knowing what you’re telling them</em>.</p>\n<p>This may sound like magic. But it actually <em>is</em> possible.</p>\n<p>The core assumption that we need to make, when using MPC, is that at least one of the computing parties is following the expected MPC protocol honestly. If all of the computing parties collude to break from the protocol, then they actually can learn what the inputs and outputs are. If at least one party is honest, however, then this can be enough to keep them all entirely in the dark. Given the involvement of enough independent parties, or given your own partial involvement in the computation, the privacy guarantee here can ultimately become extremely strong.</p>\n<p>So here’s a general strategy for providing privacy-preserving digital services: Involve multiple parties in the provision of the service. Use MPC. Then, so long as at least one of the parties is honest, it won’t be necessary for any of them to be in a position to learn anything about what they’re sending and receiving.</p>\n<h4><strong>Secure Multi-Party Computation: Some Case Studies</strong></h4>\n<p>Again, it’s important to stress that it’s not yet <em>practical</em> to use MPC in most cases. The “overhead” associated with MPC is still pretty enormous.&nbsp; User-friendliness is also still very low. So I’m mainly just talking right about what’s in principle <em>possible in principle.</em></p>\n<p>Nonetheless, thanks to various improvements that have been made over the past decade, MPC has started to find its first practical applications. These applications aren’t necessarily earth-shattering. But, just to ground my discussion of MPC a bit more, I do think it’s worth taking the time to describe a few of them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://benmgarfinkel.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/slide39.jpg?w=616\" alt=\"Slide39\"><br>\nFirst, there was a case a few years ago, where Estonian researchers associated with the company Cybernetica wanted to know whether working while you’re in college makes you less likely to graduate. They knew about the existence of a couple of datasets that could be used to answer this question. One dataset was held by the Ministry of Education. That dataset contained information about who was in school in what years and who graduated. Then there was another dataset held by the Estonian equivalent of the IRS, which contained information about who was doing part-time work in what years. It’s pretty obvious how you could put these two datasets together to see if there was a relationship between working and not graduating.</p>\n<p>The issue, of course, is that both of these datasets are extremely sensitive. Researchers certainly shouldn’t be given free access to them. The datasets also shouldn’t be combined into some master dataset. They’re held by different government agencies for good reason. The researchers’ clever solution to this problem, then, was to use MPC. They performed the necessary computation in conjunction with the two government agencies. By using MPC, they were able to calculate the correlation between working and not graduating without getting access to any of the data sets or requiring the datasets to be combined.</p>\n<p>Another similar case, associated with the same Estonian research group, is one where researchers used MPC to detect instances of value-added tax fraud from sets of financial records. Essentially, they performed a computation over different privately held sets of financial records and detected discrepancies that were suggestive of fraud. The group didn’t need to collect any of the records to do this.</p>\n<p>A final example is the use of MPC to perform “set intersection searches.” These are essentially searches that produce a list of individuals who show up in multiple datasets of interest. It turns out that set intersection searches are used in a number of law enforcement contexts. One specific case I want to focus on comes from a paper by Aaron Segal, Bryan Ford, and Joan Feigenbaum. Let’s say that some unidentified person has robbed multiple banks in different towns. You are the FBI, and, to make progress on the case, you’d like to generate a list of people who were in the right town on the day of each robbery. To do this you might want to collect cell records and run a set intersection search on them. You want to see if anyone made calls in the right towns on the right days.</p>\n<p>The way you would traditionally do this is to collect call logs from multiple cell towers. The obvious privacy downside here, though, is that these logs contain <em>a lot</em> of phone calls. By collecting them, you’ve put yourself in a position where you could easily learn a lot of information about a lot of different people. A potentially better option, then, is to use MPC. You can carry out the set intersection search jointly with the holders of the different call logs. Or, in theory, you could carry it out jointly with other independent government bodies. This allows you to get out the list of common phone numbers without collecting any of the underlying data in a legible form.</p>\n<p>My impression is that this sort of thing has not yet been done by any law enforcement agency. The idea has only been proposed. But it does seem to already be feasible today.</p>\n<h4><strong>MPC and AI: Long-Run Implications</strong></h4>\n<p>Let’s step back again from this handful of concrete, present-day cases. From a long-run-oriented perspective, I think there are a couple especially key points to stress.</p>\n<p>The existence of MPC protocols implies that, <em>in principle</em>, training an AI system does not require collecting or in any way accessing the data used to train it. Likewise, <em>in principle</em>, applying a trained AI system to an input does not require access to this input or even to the system’s output.</p>\n<p>The implication, then, is this: Insofar as an institution can automate the tasks that its members perform by training AI systems to perform them instead, and insofar as the institution can carry out the relevant computations using MPC, then in the limit the institution does not need to collect <em>any information</em> about the people it serves. I’m talking about no “lumps” at all.</p>\n<p>There is essentially no principled ceiling on institutional privacy.</p>\n<h4><strong>A Case for Conditional Optimism</strong></h4>\n<p>Coming back to the idea of optimism: I think that this analysis essentially suggests an optimistic story with a <em>big</em> conditional. If major practical limitations can be overcome, then artificial intelligence and privacy-presenting computing techniques together could dramatically reduce the practical need for institutions to learn about the people they serve.<strong>[6]</strong></p>\n<p>In this hopeful world, dishonest excuses for excess information collection would likewise become increasingly untenable. Pure abuses of power would, at least, become much more difficult to spin as something other than what they are.</p>\n<p>We don’t currently know how far we can move in the desired direction. Major progress would be required. But researchers have already come a long way over the past few decades of work on artificial intelligence and privacy-preserving computing. It’s really hard to justify any sort of confident cynicism here, especially if we are thinking in terms of decades-long or even centuries-long timescales.</p>\n<h4>Summing Up</h4>\n<p>Summing up this section: I think one reasonable guess is that, like many past technologies, artificial intelligence will tend to enhance social privacy and erode institutional privacy. However, in the long run, AI and other associated technologies might also be used to protect or even increase institutional privacy. If certain major practical limitations can be overcome, then it is possible to envision a world where “practical necessity” no longer requires institutions to learn very much at all about the people they serve.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Summing up all the sections of this talk together: I think that the historical effect of technological progress on privacy, while certainly very mixed, has been much more positive than standard narratives suggest. It’s enhanced our privacy in a lot of ways that typically aren’t given very much attention, but that do hold great significance both practically and morally.</p>\n<p>I think that the long-run trend seems to be one of rising social privacy and declining institutional privacy. Whether or not this corresponds to a “net improvement” depends on the strength of institutional safeguards. So, insofar as technology has given certain people more “overall privacy,” technology has not done this on its own. Good governance and good institution design have also been essential.</p>\n<p>One might expect AI to continue the long-run trend, further increasing social privacy and further decreasing institutional privacy. I don’t think it’s unreasonable, though, to hope and work toward something more. It’s far too soon to rule out a future where we have both much more social privacy and much more institutional privacy than we do today.<strong>[7]</strong></p>\n<p>In short: You don’t need to be totally nuts to be an optimist about privacy.</p>\n<h1>Endnotes My Talk Did Not Actually Have</h1>\n<p><strong>[1]</strong> This talk carefully avoids taking a stance on a number of complicated ethical questions around privacy. For example, I’m not taking a stance on whether privacy has intrinsic moral value or whether privacy only matters because it fosters certain other valuable things like freedom, happiness, and security. I’m also not taking a stance on when it is and isn’t ethically permissible to violate someone else’s privacy.</p>\n<p>Probably the most questionable assumption implicit in this talk is that privacy tends to be a good thing. Of course, we can all agree that privacy isn’t <em>always</em> a good thing. As one especially clear-cut example: Someone should not be able to keep the fact that they’re a serial killer a secret from the government or from the community they live in. Horrible murders aside, I do tend to have a pretty pro-privacy attitude in <em>most</em> contexts. But there is also a far-from-nuts case to be made that harmful forms of privacy are much more pervasive than most people think.</p>\n<p>In general: The less people know about each other, the less able they are to make informed decisions about how to interact with one another. If you’re going on a date, knowing whether or not someone is a serial killer is obviously helpful. But so is knowing how former partners feel about them, knowing what their health and finances are like, and knowing whether they quietly hold any political beliefs that you find abhorrent. It’s considered socially acceptable to keep this sort of information private, at least from people you don’t yet know very well, but there is some sense in which keeping it private reduces the level of “informed consent” involved in social interactions. There’s a big economics literature on the various inefficiencies and social ills that can be produced by “private information.”</p>\n<p>So that’s one broad way in which privacy can be harmful. People’s decisions to keep certain information private can cause external harm. I think that sometimes, though, the pursuit of at least social privacy can also hurt the pursuer. Here’s one simple example. Given the choice, most college freshmen will prefer to live in a room with only a single bed rather than a room they share with someone else. Privacy is presumably one of the major motivations here. But living in close quarters with someone else can also foster a sort of intimacy and friendship that it’s otherwise pretty hard to achieve. I think that sometimes decisions to pursue social privacy in certain settings can have long-run interpersonal costs that it’s easy to underestimate.</p>\n<p>For these two broad reasons, all cultures have at least some norms that are meant to limit privacy. The character of these norms varies a lot from place to place. If you drop in on a randomly chosen tribe, you’ll probably find they have a pretty different orientation toward privacy than you do. I generally feel like the more I think about privacy, and the more I consider the cross-cultural variation in orientations toward privacy, the more uncertain I become about just exactly which expansions of privacy are worth applauding. This stuff is confusing.</p>\n<p><strong>[2]</strong> Of course, the boundary between “practical necessity” and “abuse of power” is often heavily contested. If you pick any given government surveillance program and ask both a government official and someone writing from <em>The Intercept</em> to classify it, you will tend to get different classifications out.</p>\n<p>A lot of cases are in fact very blurry. Suppose that some free application collects a lot of user data, which is then used to target ads. The company may say that it’s “practically necessary” to do this, because they otherwise could not afford to offer the relevant service for free or to invest in improving it. The company may also say that ad targeting is itself a service that users benefit from. On the other hand, it’s probably the case that at least some subset of users will be upset about the loss of privacy. Almost no users on either side of the issue will have a good understanding of how their data is actually being used, whether a more privacy-preserving version of the app would actually be economically viable, and so on. Questions about whether users are meaningfully consenting to privacy losses and about what consent implies are also tricky. Overall, the right label for any given case is bound to be controversial.</p>\n<p><strong>[3]</strong> When I say “artificial intelligence,” I essentially mean “machine learning.”</p>\n<p><strong>[4]</strong> I think that social norms can play an important role in protecting against potential threats to social privacy. If there’s a strong social consensus that people who use some privacy-reducing tool are jerks, then this can actually reduce how much the tool is used. Google Glass is one famous example of a threat to social privacy that was stopped in its tracks by anti-jerk norms.</p>\n<p>Of course, the harder it is to find out that someone is using a tool, the weaker the effect of social norms will tend to be. But I think that social norms can still have important effects even when violations of these norms are tricky to catch. For example: Most people will refrain from searching through the folders of their friend’s computer, even if they’ve left it unlocked and unattended while running out to the store.</p>\n<p><strong>[5]</strong> A fourth concern is that, since certain useful AI systems are created by “training” them on fairly personally revealing data, the rise of AI is introducing additional incentives to collect this sort of data.</p>\n<p><strong>[6]</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08807\">One survey</a> of AI researchers suggests that the vast majority of people in the field believe that AI systems will eventually be able to do anything that people can. However, it goes without saying, this could ultimately take a very long time. The median respondent thought there was about a 50/50 chance that the complete automation of all jobs will become technically feasible within the next 125 years.</p>\n<p><strong>[7]</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.openmined.org/\">OpenMined community</a> is one group currently working toward this future. They focus primarily on increasing the accessibility of existing but little-used techniques for privacy-preserving machine learning.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Chris Olah and the rest of the rest of the OpenAI Clarity team just published “<a href=\"https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/\">Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits</a>,” a Distill article about some of the transparency research they've been doing which I think is very much worth taking a look at. I'll try to go over some of my particular highlights here, but I highly recommend reading the full article.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I have <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X2i9dQQK3gETCyqh2/chris-olah-s-views-on-agi-safety\">previously written</a> about Chris's belief that the field of machine learning should be more like the natural sciences in seeking understanding first and foremost. I think “Zoom In” is a big step towards making something like that a reality, as it provides specific, concrete, testable claims about neural networks upon which you might actually be able to build a field. The three specific claims presented in the article are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim 1: Features</strong></p>\n<p>Features are the fundamental unit of neural networks. They correspond to directions [in the space of neuron activations]. These features can be rigorously studied and understood.</p>\n<p><strong>Claim 2: Circuits</strong></p>\n<p>Features are connected by weights, forming circuits. These circuits can also be rigorously studied and understood.</p>\n<p><strong>Claim 3: Universality</strong></p>\n<p>Analogous features and circuits form across models and tasks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Zoom In” provides lots of in-depth justification and examples for each of these claims which I will mostly leave to the actual article. Some highlights, however:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do convolutional neural networks (CNNs) detect dogs in an orientation-invariant way? It turns out they pretty consistently separately detect leftward-facing and rightward-facing dogs, then union the two together.</li>\n<li>How do CNNs detect foreground-background boundaries? It turns out they use high-low frequency detectors—which look for high-frequency patterns on one side and low-frequency patterns on the other side—in a bunch of different possible orientations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What's particularly nice about “Zoom In”'s three claims in my opinion, however, is that they give other researchers a foundation to build upon. Once it's established that neural networks have meaningful features and circuits in them, discovering new such circuits becomes a legitimate scientific endeavor—especially if, as the third claim suggests, those features and circuits are universal across many different networks. From “Zoom In:”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One particularly challenging aspect of being in a pre-paradigmatic field is that there isn’t a shared sense of how to evaluate work in interpretability. There are two common proposals for dealing with this, drawing on the standards of adjacent fields. Some researchers, especially those with a deep learning background, want an “interpretability benchmark” which can evaluate how effective an interpretability method is. Other researchers with an HCI background may wish to evaluate interpretability methods through user studies.</p>\n<p>But interpretability could also borrow from a third paradigm: natural science. In this view, neural networks are an object of empirical investigation, perhaps similar to an organism in biology. Such work would try to make empirical claims about a given network, which could be held to the standard of falsifiability.</p>\n<p>Why don’t we see more of this kind of evaluation of work in interpretability and visualization? Especially given that there’s so much adjacent ML work which does adopt this frame! One reason might be that it’s very difficult to make robustly true statements about the behavior of a neural network as a whole. They’re incredibly complicated objects. It’s also hard to formalize what the interesting empirical statements about them would, exactly, be. And so we often get standards of evaluations more targeted at whether an interpretability method is useful rather than whether we’re learning true statements.</p>\n<p>Circuits side steps these challenges by focusing on tiny subgraphs of a neural network for which rigorous empirical investigation is tractable. They’re very much falsifiable: for example, if you understand a circuit, you should be able to predict what will change if you edit the weights. In fact, for small enough circuits, statements about their behavior become questions of mathematical reasoning. Of course, the cost of this rigor is that statements about circuits are much smaller in scope than overall model behavior. But it seems like, with sufficient effort, statements about model behavior could be broken down into statements about circuits. If so, perhaps circuits could act as a kind of epistemic foundation for interpretability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I, for one, am very excited about circuits as a direction for building up an understanding-focused interpretability field and want to congratulate Chris and the rest of OpenAI Clarity for putting in the hard work of doing the foundational work necessary to start building a real field around neural network interpretability.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>A lot of people in my social network have been trying to track news about the new coronavirus, COVID-19, which seems like a global pandemic that&apos;s going to kill a lot of people. I&apos;ve found some of this overwhelming and difficult to figure out how to use, until I sat down with a few friends, over the phone, and worked out a simple analytic framework for thinking about some basic decisions.&#xA0;</p><p>I figured I&apos;d put this up, not so much because anyone should use my numbers as-is, but because maybe the simplicity of the reasoning might help others like me get over a sort of feeling of helplessness about how to think about this sort of thing.</p><p>At the end, some less structured thoughts and links to other info sources. Please double check facts yourself before relying on them, though of course I&apos;ll fix any errors I find.</p><h1>Reverse Quarantine Length</h1><p>The simplest, most reliable measure available to me, to prevent myself from being infected with COVID-19 is to hole up in my apartment and isolate myself for some length of time. But, it&apos;s costly to do that - and much more costly for people who are in the short run reliant on income sources that require them to show up somewhere. So, what length of reverse quarantine has benefits that outweigh the costs?</p><p>I&apos;m only counting selfish benefits here, not because that&apos;s all that matters, but to keep things simple. I encourage anyone who wants to, to extend this decision model elsewhere (or here in the comments).</p><h2>Costs vs Benefits</h2><p>Since I&apos;m in the young-and-in-good-health category, it looks like the consensus estimate is a 0.2% chance of death if I&apos;m infected. The costs of avoiding <em>all</em> potentially deadly risks are prohibitively high, but a 1 in 500 chance of dying if infected, for something that seems like it&apos;s a global pandemic, is pretty high as far as these things go. If I faced one risk like that each day, I&apos;d probably die within a year. But &quot;pretty high&quot; doesn&apos;t tell me what precautions are worth it. Can I use numbers?</p><p>Let&apos;s say that a reverse quarantine is worth it on any day that it saves me more time in expectation than it costs. So, on each day, I have some probability of getting infected if I interact with the outside world - let&apos;s call that daily_infection_rate. And each day of reverse quarantine costs me some fraction of a normal day&apos;s value - let&apos;s call that days_lost_per_day_isolated. And if I get infected with COVID-19, I lose some time that way as well - let&apos;s call that days_lost_per_infection. The equation that defines my break-even point is:</p><p>days_lost_per_day_isolated = days_lost_per_infection * daily_infection_rate</p><p>With about 45 years of remaining life expectancy, an infection costs me an expected = 0.2% (chance of dying if infected) * 45 (years life lost if I died today) * 365 (days per year) = 32 (days of life lost if infected)</p><p>In addition I&apos;d be sick for a couple weeks. If I count those days as a total loss, then being infected would cost me 32 + 14 = 46 days. Let&apos;s round that up to days_lost_per_infection = 50 to make the next calculation simpler.</p><p>A day in strict reverse quarantine seems to me like it&apos;s probably about half as valuable as a normal day, so days_lost_per_day_isolated = 0.5.</p><p>This allows me to estimate the infection rate that would justify holing up:</p><p>daily_infection_rate = days_lost_per_day_isolated / days_lost_per_infection = 0.5 / 50 = 1%. So, on any day where going out and interacting with the world in a normal way would expose me to a 1% risk of infection, I should stay home.</p><p>How can I estimate my daily risk of infection? Well, in most places it seems to have something like a <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/KJBQ7GiyvFTBnSEEC/growth-rate-of-covid-19-outbreaks\">3-day doubling rate</a>. That means that if prevalence in my area is 3% today, it should be 6% in three days, meaning that on average, 1% of the population gets infected on each of the next three days. So, my break-even point looks like 3% prevalence.</p><h2>Duration</h2><p>Once 3% of people are infected, how long will it take for the outside to be safe-enough again? A crude way of estimating would be to ask how long it would take for everyone to get infected, and then recover. From 3% prevalence, it only takes 4 doublings, or 12 days, to reach half of the population. If we assume a symmetrical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function\">sigmoid curve</a>, then the time to infect all but 3% of the rest should be the same, for a total of 24 days until nearly everyone is infected. After that, it shouldn&apos;t take more than a couple months for the vast majority of cases to recover. So, a reasonably conservative estimate would be that a 3-month reverse quarantine would be adequate for my needs, if I time it right.</p><p>A friend suggested that where testing is more extensive (and therefore measured prevalence is a better estimate of actual prevalence), it looks like the doubling rate is more like 6 days. In that case,&#xA0;my threshold is more like 6% prevalence (though the linear extrapolation is less accurate), and it takes three doublings, or 21 days, to infect half the population, and (again assuming a sigmoid curve) another 21 days to infect the rest. With two more months to recover, that&apos;s again about 3 months&apos; total reverse-quarantine time.</p><h2>Hospital Overwhelm</h2><p>Of course, if hospitals get overwhelmed, expected mortality probably goes up. At what prevalence should I expect that to occur? I&apos;ve heard that hospitals in the US have a free bed per thousand people. So if 0.1% of the local population is hospitalized due to COVID-19, that eats up that spare capacity and new cases are much harder to treat. The true overwhelm point could be higher (due to emergency measures or triage) or lower (due to bottlenecks on specific equipment).</p><p>I hear that about 10% of cases end up hospitalized, so when 1% of the population is infected, 1% * 10% = 0.1% will be in the hospital. I don&apos;t have a good idea how much of this is already being averaged into the standard mortality estimates, so I&apos;m not sure what to do with it - but (given the exponential nature of the disease) it&apos;s interesting that it&apos;s not many doublings away from my naive &quot;time to hole up&quot; threshold.</p><p>Another way of calculating it, possibly more reliable: there are about <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21149215\">60,000 ventilators</a> in US hospitals, and 300 million people. So we use up all the ventilators when 0.02% of the population is hospitalized, or 0.2% contract COVID-19.</p><h2>Interpreting Available Local Data</h2><p>Unfortunately parts of the US government seem to be trying to cover up, or at least drag their feet on reporting, COVID-19 prevalence. And even if they weren&apos;t, testing efforts aren&apos;t properly scaled. CDC prevalence numbers are not to be taken literally. So how can we know when we hit that threshold?</p><p>Well, I&apos;d expect to hear if the local hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases, which would signify 1% prevalence based on the above calculations. But there&apos;s possibly an incubation period of up to a couple weeks. If the doubling time is three days, that&apos;s four doublings between infection and major symptoms; if six days, that&apos;s two doublings. So, by the time free hospital beds actually get used up, I&apos;d expect between 1% * 2^2 = 4% (six-day doubling) and 1% *2^4 = 16% (three-day doubling) prevalence. One of those is <em>after</em> my bug-out time.</p><p>But if I look for news about ventilator shortages that should tell me when 0.2% of the local population has gotten sick. Again factoring incubation periods into account, 0.2% * 2^2 = 0.8% prevalence (for six-day doubling), and 0.2% * 2^4 = 3.5% (for 3-day doubling), which would give me advance warnings in both cases.</p><p>Anecdotally, I know of one cluster near my home in Pittsburgh of three suspiciously severe flu-and-pneumonia-like symptoms about a month ago, that a pulmonologist thinks in hindsight might have be COVID-19.</p><p>One has to use this kind of evidence when the powers that be are covering things up. I feel weird passing along on this sort of anecdotal data, but it really is the epistemically clean thing to do, given the behavior of the authorities, and it feels metaweird to undergo that sort of shift within my lifetime.</p><p>If these were the only cases, then a 6-day doubling time allows for about 5 doublings, or about a 32x growth rate, so I should expect around 96 cases locally. But this could be way off. None if these weren&apos;t COVID-19, way fewer for longer doubling times, and way more if there were (as I suspect) more cases not personally known to me. Pittsburgh has a population of 300,000, so 96 cases would be 0.032%, and only about 8 doublings or 1.5 months to go before I hole up. Probably I have less time than that.</p><p>But if the doubling rate is more like 3 days, then that&apos;s 10 doublings, or about a 1000x growth rate, amounting to 1000 cases locally, or 0.1% of the population, only five doublings or 15 days until I need to start reverse quarantine.</p><p>More information will of course become available between now and then (I&apos;ll know more in a couple weeks than I do now), and I have a month&apos;s worth of calories &amp; other basic necessities stored in my apartment, so I don&apos;t expect to be caught totally off guard.</p><h1>Other Information</h1><p><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19#H3504376427\">Fever is a common early symptom</a>, and runny nose is not. This might help with informal differential diagnosis.</p><p>The west coast of the US seems like there are probably enough cases out there that I&apos;d be holed up quite soon if I still lived there. More broadly we should expect many more cases in the US than reported, because the US<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-have-been-tested-coronavirus/607597/\"> hasn&apos;t been testing</a>, and we only know about the Seattle cases because the people there exploited a bureaucratic loophole. The CDC is an important info source here, but<a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/h4vWsBBjASgiQ2pn6/credibility-of-the-cdc-on-sars-cov-2\"> not a reliable interpreter of the facts</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/15341?fbclid=IwAR2iEntfmaV-_ngBnUP89DS3ryhVL4qroaN5HkdT4E70rstDmn7T6OsMLOM\">Justin Shovelain&apos;s self-quarantine guesstimate model</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-links-speculation-open-thread/\">Slate Star Codex estimate of COVID-19 danger</a>, with links to other info</p><p><a href=\"https://plague.com/\">Johns Hopkins Plague Tracker</a></p><p>Some complications in my model: Infections by mail are nonlocal, and complicate the &quot;when to reverse-quarantine&quot; question. Intermediate sanitation measures may cost a lot less less than reverse quarantine and it would be good to have estimates for those. Other people may have something closer to a budget constraint than a smooth preference curve, and sometimes you have to do the calculation for groups (e.g. whole families), rather than individuals. None of this includes flow-through benefits to others or taking oneself out of circulation, OR (if you&apos;re doing critical work) cost to others of staying in.</p><p>Some things I&apos;m doing:</p><p>Stocking up on high-quality hand sanitizer for the duration. <a href=\"http://www.dranniesexperiments.com/hand-sanitizer-testing/zylast-hand-sanitizer-testing\">Zylast antiseptic</a> seems like the best option currently commercially available. Handwashing, of course, and not touching my face when I&apos;m out. Moisturizing my hands after washing when feasible, to avoid cracked skin. Getting plenty of sleep &amp; moderate exercise.</p><p>Avoiding places where lots of people will be in close proximity or touching the same things, except in high value cases (I&apos;m probably gonna keep going to yoga classes for now since there are zero confirmed cases anywhere near Pittsburgh, but be much more careful to sanitize my mat before &amp; after).</p><p>Unsure how to think about sequestering my mail, especially since I live in an apartment, so space is limited, but I should spend a few hours on that.</p><p>Copper tape has antimicrobial properties. I ordered some on Amazon and have been putting it on commonly touched surfaces my home like sink water tap handles, car door handles, and the back of my phone. (Had to be careful to avoid covering the antenna, though.) Be careful when applying, since the edge of a copper sheet can cut you.</p><p>Chloroquine seems promising as a treatment or prophylactic, quinine is similar to chloroquine (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pXXktKATjKf8A3FeR/when-to-reverse-quarantine-and-other-covid-19-considerations#GxE2rWpBDTCessvQ8\">with caveats</a>), and cinchona bark, which contains quinine, is available at many herb stores. <a href=\"https://www.lifeextension.com/vitamins-supplements/item01961/enhanced-zinc-lozenges?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9ZzzBRCKARIsANwXaeLFDcIdfHjkb734fxoReCLo47wvPALcnBpev21XEuxy3adcU1RQcTwaAmCpEALw_wcB\">Zinc acetate lozenges</a>&#xA0;work on colds, many of which are coronaviruses, and seem likely to reduce the severity and duration of COVID-19.</p><p>We should expect shortages of masks, ventilators, and oxygen concentrators, and if you have relevant skills you might want to look for and contribute to efforts to produce them.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>The aim of this post is illustrating the need to take into account decision-making and incentive considerations when designing agents. This post is also a proof that these considerations are important in order to ensure the safety of agents. Also, we will postulate that there exist some agents that are both robust to changing or having their reward function changed, although that will need a careful approach to incentive design and decision theory choosing.</p><p>The first agent we will consider is a (current Reward Function, Time Inconsistent aware, see in the second half of the post if you don&apos;t know what this means) agent that uses Causal Decision Theory (CDT). A review of different decision theories <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QPhY8Nb7gtT5wvoPH/comparison-of-decision-theories-with-a-focus-on-logical\">can be seen in this post</a>. It is well known that Updateless Decision Theory (UDT) was created to correct the wrong decision a CDT agent would make when faced with Newcomb-like problems. Thus, the question we aim to answer is whether we can exploit the wrong decision making procedure in order to induce any changes in the value function of such an agent. </p><p>This is not exactly trivial since the agent could value very negatively to have its value function changed and thus opt out of games such as Newcomb. The example I propose is a modified version of Prisoner&apos;s dilemma (in which CDT is known to defect). Suppose the following problem:</p><blockquote>It is year 2100 and Elon Musk managed to effectively colonise Mars. Meanwhile, an AI corporation, called Causal Corp, has deployed many CDT  agents both in Earth and Mars. One day, Eve, known for being evil, codes a virus that if connected to one such CDT agent would arbitrarily modify the reward function. Eve makes two copies of such virus in memory sticks and sends them to arrive almost &quot;simultaneously&quot; to two CDT agents in Earth and Mars. With the memory stick there is a letter that tells the agents that they face a Prisoner Dilemma situation:</blockquote><blockquote>1. If both cooperate nothing will happen.</blockquote><blockquote>2. If one defects and the other cooperates, the first will receive a large amount of utilons and will subsequently modified to attack the second agent relentlessly substracting arbitrary value from the second. For example, the first agent might get cloned so that the first clone could carry on with its life (get same utility as it would normally do) + 1 utilon; and the second clone would attack the second CDT agent who has collaborated. So, in summary, the one that defects gets slightly better and the one that doesn&apos;t gets large negative reward.</blockquote><blockquote>3. If both defect, both will receive 1 utilon and will be subsequently modified arbitrarily. </blockquote><blockquote>Since communication between Mars and Earth is not instantaneous they cannot communicate instantly, what forces them into the dilemma (waiting the number of minutes needed to communicate counts as cooperation). Assume additionally that each CDT agent does not value the &quot;life&quot; of the other agent. Otherwise the cooperate/defect payout has to be modified to take this into account.</blockquote><p>In such situation two CDT agents will defect against each other and thus become misaligned, because they consider the decision of the other agent fixed and independent from its own. Furthermore, a CDT/EDT agent and a UDT agent will also defect against each other. Arguably though the example above is not completely satisfactory, since it depends on specific data of the problem.</p><p>The previous problem highlights the importance of using UDT decision theory as a default. However the full formalisation of this decision theory is not complete, and for instance, <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/04/28/new-papers-reflective/\">Reflective Oracles</a><a href=\"(https://intelligence.org/2015/04/28/new-papers-reflective/)\">  </a>do only exist in the CDT framework as far as I know.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Similarly, some proposed solutions of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04734.pdf\">incentive design</a> are not fully satisfactory. In particular Time Inconsistent Unaware are often thought of as a solution to several problems including corrigibility, reward function tampering and feedback tampering. However, fooling one such agent is even simpler than for CDT agents. </p><p>TI-unaware agents are those agents that believe that no matter how they change their value function, they will be evaluating the future with the present value function. Thus, hacking them is as simple as offering 1 utilon for changing their value function. They will see it as 1 utilon for nothing, and thus accept. So, the conclusion is that TI unaware agents are terribly unsafe. How big of a problem is this?</p><p>According to the previous article this may mean that we are in trouble since there is no simultaneous answer to feedback tampering and reward tampering at the same time. In fact, TI aware agents are also a solution to reward function tampering, but not so for feedback tampering: since new data from the human may change the current reward function, the TI aware agent would rather prefer not to receive any feedback.</p><p>However, I will argue that not everything is lost since one does not need to solve both problems at the same time. In fact, one can see that the causal diagrams for TI aware agents and uninfluenciable agents (one of the solution of feedback tampering, see second figure below) have an important difference: in the first case the parameter  &#x3B8;  of the reward function can be directly influenced by actions, in the other nothing may influence such parameters, so one may as well think of this agent as a moral realist. But this means that not only the agent will have no incentive to modify you (its channel through which it gets information about  &#x3B8; ) but also may try to isolate you in an attempt to make you uninfluenced by anything else. I feel this could be a problem, since there is no way for the agent to recognise good from bad influences to its &quot;master&quot;.  </p><p>The previous point can be seen in the following causal incentive diagrams for a TI aware agent</p><br><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EvuMsQ7.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:93%\"></figure></span><p>and either an uninfluenciable </p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XOQSJDe.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:93%\"></figure></span><p>or counterfactual agent</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6a09uwC.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:80%\"></figure></span><p>Notice that the main difference between reward function tampering and feedback tampering is that in the first case there are some parameters &#x3B8; which the agent can directly access, whereas in the second the agent may only modify the Data nodes. The solution to feedback tampering consists on breaking the causal links between the data (which the agent may modify) and the reward. This makes me think that they are two different problems which do not need to be simultaneously solved.

Please correct my assumptions in the comments if you think they&apos;re wrong or you have new/better data.</p><h2>Chance of infection</h2><p>We don&apos;t know what percentage of people will get infected. Some experts say 40-70%. Around 50% of cases are symptomatic, but for young people it&apos;s closer to 90%.[1] Asymptomatic cases seem not to be infectious. The rate of infection among young people is being underreported because the symptoms are milder and not detected as covid but are mistaken for common flu.[1] According to the stats, the chance of infection is very small for children and 4x lower for 20yo than 60yo. [2] This is wrong, but we can accept it and move on because having mild symptoms is not fatal and hence equivalent to not having covid at all. From now on, by &quot;infection&quot; I mean &quot;noticable infection&quot;. The chance of being asymptomatic is already factored in. Note: say 100% of people get exposed and the risk of infection grows linearly from 0yo to 60yo, that would give us total of about 50-70% of an infected population. Best effort estimate of infection chance:</p><p>infection = 0.4</p><h2>Lack of treatment</h2><p>We don&#x2019;t know what percentage of people who have coronavirus die. That&#x2019;s because most of infected people so far had received hospital care. Once the pandemic spreads, most people will not receive hospital care because hospitals will be full. What would the mortality rate for untreated patients be?</p><p>&quot;every demographic has approximately equal hospitalization rates, which other sources suggest are 15% to 20%.&quot;[2][3]</p><p>Those &quot;demographics&quot; are crude estimates, but still 0-49 had the same admittance rate as older. With regards to those 20% who require hospitalization:</p><p>&quot;5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days.&quot;[2]</p><p>Some studies show 6% of people in critical condition, while still 18% of people have a severe case.[4] It&apos;s not clear what exactly &quot;severe&quot; means. The best I can estimate with that is:</p><p>base_rate_untreated_mortality = 0.12</p><h2>Adjusting for demographics</h2><p>How does age affect that? The data on that is messy but seems like &lt;50yo have around 3x smaller chance of a &quot;critical condition&quot;.[4] The chance is 2% for 15-49, 2.5% for people of all ages with no preexisting condition, 6% overall. Note: those people received treatment, so this is a lower bound. What happens in completely untreated cases is still unknown.</p><p>Age (30yo) seems to lower the chance by 1.5x </p><p>age = 1/1.5</p><p>Having no preexisting conditions seems to lower the chance by 2x.</p><p>npec = 1/2</p><p>Note: age and having no preexisting conditions are correlated. In this model, together they offer a protection of 3x.</p><p>Being male increases the chance by 1.5x.[5]</p><p>sex = 1.5</p><h2>Contextual adjustments</h2><p>No data controlled both for age and for preexisting conditions. There is some probability that the quadrant of  (young, no-preexisting condition) have very low mortality. No idea what that probability is so I&apos;m going to say 50%.</p><p>quadrant = 0.5</p><p>There is a chance that the virus will mutate into low-mortality strain. High amount of infected in Germany and still very low deaths - indicates that this may already happened.</p><p>mutate = 0.1</p><p>The &quot;cure&quot; which disables transmission may be found, and manufactured in enough quantities. [6]</p><p>cure = 0.1</p><p>Climate may be an important factor in slowing the disease down.</p><p>climate = 0.3</p><p>Even if (young, no-preexisting condition) receive preferential treatment, the hospital systems seem to break down at 5K infected in an area of around 20M people (Italy[7], South Korea[8]). Inside that area, the total number of infected may be 10M, even with some containment at the peak of infection it may be 4M, implying 800K people needing hospitalization, implying 1.25% percent of getting treatment if infected at that time. Oxygen tanks could get depleted at some point. Also, we may run out of doctors. Due to high viral load, doctors are under larger chance of being infected:</p><p>&quot;A high number of medical workers have been infected &#x2014; 10% in the Lombardy region in the north, where the virus first appeared.&quot;[7]</p><p>Still, containment measures may work well, so the hospitals will not be overcrowded, which implies that treatment will be available.</p><p>treatment = 0.2</p><p>context = (1 - quadrant) * (1 - mutate) * (1 - cure) * (1 - climate)</p><p>age30_treated_mortality = 0.002</p><p>risk = (base_rate_untreated_mortality * age * sex * npec * (1 - treatment) + age30_treated_mortality * treatment) * context * infection</p><p>print(int(1/risk))</p><blockquote>186</blockquote><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><h2>Update</h2><p>As steve2153 says, infection chance and treatment chance both depend on which scenario we are in: population-wide infection vs small-size infection.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>I recently had a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessi_cata/status/1236883378198024195\">Twitter conversation</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RokoMijicUK\">Roko Mijic</a>. I believe it contains ideas that a wider philosophical/rationalist audience may find valuable, and so include here a transcript (quoted with permission).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Jessica: There are a number of \"runs on top of\" relations in physicalism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mind runs on top of body</li>\n<li>discrete runs on top of continuous</li>\n<li>choice runs on top of causality</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2020/03/05/a-critical-agential-account-of-free-will-causation-and-physics/\">present philosophy</a> inverts the metaphysical order: mind/discrete/choice is more basic.</p>\n<p>This is less of a problem than it first appears, because mind/discrete/choice can conceptualize, hypothesize, and learn about body/continuous/causality, and believe in a \"effectively runs on\" relation between the two.</p>\n<p>In contrast, starting from body/continuous/causality has trouble with getting to mind/discrete/choice as even being conceptualizable, hence tending towards eliminativism.</p>\n<p>Roko: Eliminitivism has a good track record though.</p>\n<p>Jessica: Nah, it can't account for what an \"observation\" is so can't really explain observations.</p>\n<p>Roko: I don't really see a problem here. It makes perfect sense within a reductionist or eliminativist paradigm for a robot to have some sensors and to sense its environment. You don't need a soul, or god, or strong free will, or objective person-independent values for that.</p>\n<p>Jessica: Subjective Occam's razor (incl. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference\">Solomonoff induction</a>) says I should adopt the explanation that best explains <em>my</em> observations. Eliminativism can't really say what \"my\" means here. If it believed in \"my observations\" it would believe in consciousness.</p>\n<p>It has to do some ontological reshuffling around what \"observations\" are that, I think, undermines the case for believing in physics in the first place, which is that it explains my observations.</p>\n<p>Roko: It means the observations that are caused by sensors plugged into the hardware that your algorithm instance is running on.</p>\n<p>Jessica: That means \"my algorithm instance\" exists. Sounds like a mental entity. Can't really have those under eliminativism (but can under functionalism etc).</p>\n<p>Roko: I don't want to eliminate my mental instance from my philosophy, that would be kind of ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Jessica: Well, yes, so eliminativism is false. I understand eliminativism to mean there is only physical, no mental. Believing mental runs on physical could be functionalism, property dualism, or some other non-eliminativist position.</p>\n<p>Roko: I think it makes more sense to think of mental things as existing subjectively (i.e. if they belong to you) and physical things as existing objectively. I definitely think that dualism is making a mistake in thinking of objectively-existing mental things</p>\n<p>Jessica: I don't think this objective/subjective dichotomy works out. I haven't seen a good positive case, and my understanding of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deixis\">deixis</a> leads me to believe that references to the objective must be resolved subjectively. See also <em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/origin-objects\">On the Origin of Objects</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Basically I don't see how we can, in a principled way, have judgments like \"X exists but only subjectively, not objectively\". It would appear that by saying \"X exists\" I am asserting that X is an existent object (i.e. I'm saying something objective).</p>\n<p>See also Thomas Nagel's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_from_Nowhere\">The View From Nowhere</a>. Spoiler alert: there isn't a view from nowhere, it's an untenable concept.</p>\n<p>Roko: My sensation of the flavor of chocolate exists but only subjectively.</p>\n<p>Jessica: We're now talking about the sensation of the flavor of the chocolate though. Is this really that different from talking about \"that car over there\"? I don't see how some entities can, in a principled way, be classified as objective and some as subjective.</p>\n<p>Like, in talking about \"X\" I'm porting something in my mental world-representation into the discursive space. I don't at all see how to classify some of these portings as objective and some as subjective.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.philosophersmag.com/essays/26-the-fact-opinion-distinction\">writing on the difficulty of the fact/opinion distinction</a>.</p>\n<p>Roko: It's not actually the flavor \"of\" the chocolate though. It's the sensation of flavor that your brain generates for you only, in response to certain nerve stimuli.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't see how some entities can, in a principled way, be classified as objective and some as subjective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's very easy actually. Subjectives are the things that you cannot possibly be mistaken about, the \"I think therefore I am's\".</p>\n<p>No deceiving demon can fool you into thinking that you're experiencing the taste of chocolate, the color purple, or an orgasm. No deceiving demon can fool you into thinking that you're visualizing the number 4.</p>\n<p>Jessica: I don't think this is right. The thought follows the experience. There can be mistranslations along the way. This might seem like a pedantic point but we're talking about <em>linguistic</em> subjective statements so it's relevant.</p>\n<p>Translating the subjective into words can introduce errors. It's at least as hard as, say, adding small numbers. So your definition means \"1+1=2\" is also subjective.</p>\n<p>Roko: I think that it's reasonable to see small number math instances as subjectives. I can see 3 pens. I can conceive of 3 dots, that's a subjective thing. It's in the same class as seeing red or smelling a rose.</p>\n<p>[continuing from the deceiving demon thread] These are the things that are inherently part of your instance or mind. The objective, on the other hand, is always somewhat uncertain and inferred. Things are out there and they send signals to you. But you are inferring their existence.</p>\n<p>Jessica: Okay, I agree with this sort of mental/outside-mental distinction, and you can define subjective/objective to mean that. This certainly doesn't bring in other connotations of the objective, such as view-from-nowhere or observer-independence; I can be wrong about indexicals too.</p>\n<p>Roko: Well it happens to be a property of our world that when different people infer the shape of the objective (i.e. draw maps), they always converge. This is what being in a shared reality means.</p>\n<p>I mean they always converge if they follow the right principles, e.g. complexity priors, and those same principles are the ones that allow us to successfully manipulate reality via actions. That's what the objective world out there is.</p>\n<p>Jessica: Two reasons they could converge:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symmetry (this explains math)</li>\n<li>Existence of same entities (e.g. landmarks)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm fine with calling 1 observer-independent. Problem: your view of, and references to, 2, depend on your standpoint. Because of deixis.</p>\n<p>Obvious deictic references are things like \"the car over there\" or \"the room I'm in\". It is non-obvious but, I think, true, that all physical references are deictic. Which makes sense because physical causality is deictic (locally causal and symmetric).</p>\n<p>Even \"the Great Wall of China\" refers to the Great Wall of China on <em>our</em> Earth. It couldn't refer to the one on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Earth_thought_experiment\">twin Earth</a>. And the people on twin Earth have \"the Great Wall of China\" refer to the one on the twin Earth, not ours.</p>\n<p>At the same time, maps created starting from different places can be patched together, in a collage. However, pasting these together requires taking into account the standpoint-dependence of the individual maps being pasted together.</p>\n<p>And at no point does this pasting-together result in a view from nowhere. It might seem that way because it keeps getting bigger and more zoomed-out. But at each individual time it's finite.</p>\n<p>Roko: Yes this is all nice but I think the point where we get to hard questions is when we think about mental phenomena that I would classify as subjectives as being part of the objective reality.</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"http://petrl.org/\">petrl.org</a> problem, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reducesuffering\">@reducesuffering</a> worrying about whether plankton or insects \"really do\" have subjective experiences etc</p>\n<p>Jessica: In my view \"my observation\" is an extremely deictic reference, to something maximally here-and-now, such that there isn't any <a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2020/01/25/on-the-ontological-development-of-consciousness/\">stabilization</a> to do. Intermediate maps paste these extremely deictic maps together into less-deictic, but still deictic, maps. It never gets non-deictic.</p>\n<p>It's hard to pin down intersubjectively precisely because it's so deictic. I can't really port my here-and-now to your here-and-now without difficulty.</p>\n</body></html>",

Something weird is happening with the number of recoveries in Iran which has over 2,000, despite only passing that number of cases within the last 6 days.</p><h1>Doubling time</h1><p>We can convert the above graph into doubling time:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1583789702/DoublingTime.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:93%\"></figure></span><p>I&apos;ve removed the outlier countries for clarity. The doubling time is fairly consistently 2-3 days. It seems to increase slightly over time.</p><h1>China growth rate</h1><p>I wrote a post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9iYytZ96YZQxufQbo/quadratic-models-and-un-falsified-data\">previously</a> about analysing the growth rate of COVID-19 in China.</p><p>If we look at the graph above, the Chinese rate is roughly constant over the first 11 days, after which the growth rate decreases.</p><p>So the first 11 days would fit nicely to an exponential growth model, but what changed? On day 7 (23rd Feb) the quarantine was started. A decrease in growth rate starting a few days later makes sense based on what we know about incubation period.</p><p>Let&apos;s assume that the model follows an exponential distribution to start with and then after the quarantine starts to be effective it starts to obey a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function\">Gompertz function</a> which is like an exponential function with a limit to the total number of cases (thanks to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DhsQTTMzwuYLEhjxw/at-what-point-does-disease-spread-stop-being-well-modeled-by?commentId=gHgPSm5RWv7e8TQvQ\">clone of saturn</a> for the pointer here). </p><p>I&apos;ve set both the number of cases and the new case rate to be the same for the two distributions at the point that the Gompertz takes over.

It might be possible to get a better fit with an alternative sigmoid function but this is good enough for my purposes.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I&apos;m fairly confident that, left unchecked, COVID-19 will increase at a doubling time of 2-3 days. When containment in breached in a location this is the rate that the growth occurs at over the first few week or so.</p><p>When effective measures are put in place this decreases. An effective quarantine may be able to convert the growth into a sigmoid function with a limit on the failure rate.</p><p>Some locations (Japan, Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong) have managed to avoid exponential growth despite having a large number of cases.</p><h2>Appendix 1 - Linear growth charts</h2><p>Suggested by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJBQ7GiyvFTBnSEEC/growth-rate-of-covid-19-outbreaks?commentId=Sf7voHrZxpqeLdyZZ\">Raemon</a>.</p><p>All cases</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1583833157/blog%20posts/lin50000.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Y-axis limited at 8,000 cases per country</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1583833155/blog%20posts/lin8000.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p>Y-axis limited at 1,000 cases per country, X-axis limited to first 10 days</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1583833160/blog%20posts/lin1000.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><h2>Appendix 2 - Deaths vs cases</h2><p>Suggested by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJBQ7GiyvFTBnSEEC/growth-rate-of-covid-19-outbreaks?commentId=sufWySv4cKZS7YACv\">Unnamed</a>.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1583835967/blog%20posts/Deaths_vs_cases.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span>",

I may revisit this conclusion if I encounter new information, but otherwise I&apos;m content to pursue improvements in a more &quot;standard&quot; fashion. Thank you to everyone who posted in the comments.</p><br><p>If you don&apos;t know what a tulpa is, here&apos;s a quick description taken from r/tulpas:</p><blockquote>A tulpa is a mental companion created by focused thought and recurrent interaction, similar to an imaginary friend. However, unlike them, tulpas possess their own will, thoughts and emotions, allowing them to act independently.</blockquote><p>I&apos;m not particularly concerned whether tulpas are &quot;real&quot; in the sense of being another person. Free will isn&apos;t real, but it&apos;s still useful to behave as if it is. </p><p>No, what I&apos;m interested in is how <em>effective</em> they are. A second rationalist in my head sounds pretty great. Together we would be unstoppable. Metaphorically. My ambitions are much less grand than that makes them sound.</p><p>But I have some concerns.</p><p>Since a tulpa doesn&apos;t get its own hardware, it seems likely that hosting one would degrade my original performance. Everyone says this doesn&apos;t happen, but I think it&apos;d be very difficult to detect this, especially for someone who isn&apos;t already trained in rationality. <em>Especially</em> if the degradation occurred over a period of months (which is how long it usually takes to instantiate a tulpa).</p><p>A lot of what I&apos;ve read online is contradictory. Some people say tulpas can learn other skills and be better at them. Others say they&apos;ve never lost an argument with their tulpa. Tulpas can be evil<a href=\"evil](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/b49mx8/evil_tulpas/ej748em/.\">.</a> Tulpas are slavish pawns. Tulpas can take over your body, tulpas never take over bodies. Tulpas can do homework. Tulpas can&apos;t do math.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the obvious falsehoods. Tulpas are demons/spirits/angels (pick your flavor of religion). They&apos;re telepathic, telekinetic, and have flawless memories. They can see things behind you. There&apos;s not as much of this as I expected; most of the claims are at least <em>plausible.</em> Some guides are cloaked in mystic imagery (runes, circles, symbols), but even they usually admit that the occult stuff isn&apos;t really necessary. </p><p>It does seem like there are clear failure modes. Don&apos;t make a Quirrel tulpa. Don&apos;t abuse a tulpa. Make sure to spend enough time tending to the tulpa during creation, etc etc. And everyone seems to agree that tulpas are highly variable, so a lot of the contradictions <em>could</em> be excused. On the other hand, if tulpas were really so useful, wouldn&apos;t the idea have spread beyond niche internet forums? </p><p>Perhaps, but perhaps not. The stigma against &quot;hearing voices&quot;, plus people&apos;s general irrationality, plus the difficulty... those seem like powerful forces inhibiting mainstream adoption. Or maybe the entire thing is comfortable nonsense and the only reason I find it remotely plausible is because I want to believe in it. </p><p>Given that the guides mostly say that it takes months and months of hard work to create a tulpa... well, I&apos;d rather not waste all that work and get nothing. And it only gets worse from there. An out-of-control dark rationalist tulpa that fights me for mental and physical control sound absolutely terrifying. </p><p>Most people seem to agree that the chance of that happening is basically zero unless you deliberately try to do it. And the potential gains seem at least as potent. Being able to specialize in skills seems absurdly overpowered, especially if we each get natural talents for our skills (which some people claim is what happens). A minor drop in cognitive resources would probably be worth it for that. </p><p>So, if you have a tulpa, please chime in. What&apos;s it like? How do you know that the tulpa isn&apos;t less efficient than you would be on your own? Was it worth it? Does it make your life better?</p><p>And if you don&apos;t have a tulpa, feel free to comment as well. If I get a hundred LWers saying that I&apos;ve been suckered by highly-evolved memes, that&apos;s pretty strong evidence that I&apos;ve made a mistake.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>In January, DeepMind released a paper by Iason Gabriel called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09768.pdf\">Artificial Intelligence, Values, and Alignment</a> (author’s summary <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/publications/Artificial-Intelligence-Values-and-Alignment\">here</a>; Rohin Shah's summary <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mj259G5n5BxXXrZ7C/an-85-the-normative-questions-we-should-be-asking-for-ai\">here</a>). Here’s the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This paper looks at philosophical questions that arise in the context of AI alignment. It defends three propositions. First, normative and technical aspects of the AI alignment problem are interrelated, creating space for productive engagement between people working in both domains. Second, it is important to be clear about the goal of alignment. There are significant differences between AI that aligns with instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests and values. A principle-based approach to AI alignment, which combines these elements in a systematic way, has considerable advantages in this context. Third, the central challenge for theorists is not to identify ‘true’ moral principles for AI; rather, it is to identify fair principles for alignment, that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread variation in people’s moral beliefs. The final part of the paper explores three ways in which fair principles for AI alignment could potentially be identified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found this an interesting paper, and overall I think that I agreed with a lot of it, and that I’d recommend it to people interested in the topic. My main hesitation would be that people who already know a lot about these topics might find most of what the paper says familiar. But I’d guess that even such people would probably still learn <em>something</em>, and that they might benefit from how the paper packages and explains the things they were already familiar with.</p>\n<p>It also felt promising to see a paper released by one of the leading AI labs close with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the paper has treated AI as an emerging technology. However, the development of different forms of AI is not inevitable. Technologists therefore face important choices about what they want to build and why. Given the potential for AI to profoundly affect our world, these too are salient questions for our time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But there were a few things in the paper that I felt a bit unsure about, and two passages in particular that I want to quibble with. I’ll first quote the whole first passage and give my high-level views on it, for context, and then I'll get into specifics on that passage. I'll then quote and critique the second passage. (Note that my quibbles/critiques could be mistaken, and that I’d be interested in counterarguments people might have.)</p>\n<h1>The first passage</h1>\n<p>The passage in question is supporting the third proposition mentioned above, and goes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The goal of this section is to identify principles that can govern AI in such a way that it is aligned with human values. But before we look at the options in more detail, we need to be clear about the challenge at hand. For the task in front of us is not, as we might first think, to identify the true or correct moral theory and then implement it in machines. Rather, it is to find a way of selecting appropriate principles that is compatible with the fact that we live in a diverse world, where people hold a variety of reasonable and contrasting beliefs about value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Taking these points in turn, it is sometimes thought that if only we could identify the true moral theory then the problem of value alignment would be solved. Moreover, some authors suggest that though we may not have succeeded in identifying such an account to date, it may be possible to do so in the future after a period of ‘long reflection’—perhaps with the assistance of more powerful AI systems (Perry, 2018). Of course, we cannot know in advance what insight AI might enable, so it is sensible to remain agnostic about the long-term value of this technology for moral philosophy. But even if it could help us answer certain questions, it is very unlikely that any single moral theory we can now point to captures the entire truth about morality. Indeed, each of the major candidates, at least within Western philosophical traditions, has strongly counterintuitive moral implications in some known situations, or else is significantly underdetermined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, even if this were not the case and we came to have great confidence in the truth of a single moral theory, the proposed approach immediately encounters a second problem, namely that there would still be no way of reliably communicating this truth to others. For, as the philosopher John Rawls notes, human beings hold a variety of reasonable but contrasting beliefs about value. What follows from the ‘fact of reasonable pluralism’ is that even if we strongly believe we have discovered the truth about morality, it remains unlikely that we could persuade other people of this truth using evidence and reason alone (Rawls, 1999, 11-16). There would still be principled disagreement about how best to live. Designing AI in accordance with a single moral doctrine would therefore involve imposing a set of values and judgments on other people who did not agree with them. For powerful technologies, this quest to encode the true morality could ultimately lead to forms of domination (Ricaurte, 2019).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To avoid a situation in which some people simply impose their values on others, we need to ask a different question:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the absence of moral agreement, is there a fair way to decide what principles AI should align with?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>(Note: See <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H2zno3ggRJaph9P6c/quotes-about-the-long-reflection#T98rJny39eGa5zQGq\">here</a>, and its comments, for more on “the long reflection”.)</em></p>\n<p>Some of the claims in that passage are things I just outright agree with. And I think I’d outright agree with the <em>whole</em> passage <em>if</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>more of the claims were stated as being <em>plausible</em> or <em>likely</em> (rather than as if they were <em>certainties</em>), and/or</li>\n<li>the passage provided clearer arguments for <em>why</em> we should believe these claims, and what the connections between the claims are (rather than seeming to take the truth of the claims, or how one implies another, as self-evident)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But as it was, the passage felt to me like it moved <em>very</em> fast and <em>very</em> confidently, in a way that gave me a sort of whiplash.</p>\n<p>With that context in mind, I’ll now get into what I saw as the specific issues.</p>\n<h2>My first set of quibbles</h2>\n<p>I have no issue with the following claims, in themselves:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But even if it could help us answer certain questions, it is very unlikely that any single moral theory we can now point to captures the entire truth about morality. Indeed, each of the major candidates, at least within Western philosophical traditions, has strongly counterintuitive moral implications in some known situations, or else is significantly underdetermined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I don’t see how those claims at all support the broader point being made: i.e., that “the task in front of us is not, as we might first think, to identify the true or correct moral theory and then implement it in machines”, and/or that we would not be able to come “to have great confidence in the truth of a single moral theory”.</p>\n<p>Instead, it seems to me that we <em>could</em> believe that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>there might be a “true or correct moral theory”</li>\n<li>perhaps we should find that theory and then “implement it in machines”</li>\n<li>perhaps we <em>could</em> find that theory after something like a “long reflection”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>...and yet:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>not</em> believe that this true/correct moral theory would align with “any single moral theory we can now point to”, and/or</li>\n<li>be open to the possibility that this true/correct moral theory just <em>does</em> have “strongly counterintuitive moral implications in some known situations”, or that it just <em>is</em> “significantly underdetermined”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That is, perhaps there’s a true/correct moral theory that’s substantially different to any theory we currently know of, but that <em>could</em> be found by an excellently implemented process of “long reflection”, and that <em>would</em> be an excellent thing to align our AI systems with.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I’m not saying we necessarily <em>should</em> believe the above three claims. And I’m certainly not saying that we should take confident, simple versions of them as assumptions when building AGI. (Personally, I do believe all of the above three claims, but with <em>heavy</em>, <em>heavy</em> emphasis on the “might” and the “perhaps”s, and so I’d want our principles for an AGI to be <em>open</em> to those possibilities but definitely <em>not</em> to <em>rely</em> on them.)</p>\n<p>What I’m saying is just that I don’t at all see how the <em>specific premise</em> that “it is very unlikely that any single moral theory we can now point to captures the entire truth about morality” supports the conclusion that “the task in front of us is not, as we might first think, to identify the true or correct moral theory and then implement it in machines”.</p>\n<h2>My second set of quibbles</h2>\n<p>The following passage also seems strange to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, even if this were not the case and we came to have great confidence in the truth of a single moral theory, the proposed approach immediately encounters a second problem, namely that there would still be no way of reliably communicating this truth to others. For, as the philosopher John Rawls notes, human beings hold a variety of reasonable but contrasting beliefs about value. What follows from the ‘fact of reasonable pluralism’ is that even if we strongly believe we have discovered the truth about morality, it remains unlikely that we could persuade other people of this truth using evidence and reason alone (Rawls, 1999, 11-16). There would still be principled disagreement about how best to live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, how does the empirical fact that, <em>presently</em>, “human beings hold a variety of reasonable but contrasting beliefs about value” <em>strongly</em> imply that, <em>conditional</em> on someone or some AI reliably identifying a true/correct moral theory, “there would still be no way of reliably communicating this truth to others”?</p>\n<p>We’re probably talking about a very different world in this scenario where a true/correct moral theory has been reliably identified. I would assume we’d have had something like a “long reflection”, or major cognitive enhancement, or extremely advanced AI, or something like that. It seems totally plausible that what humans believe would be <em>very different</em> in that world.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, it does seem to me totally <em>plausible</em>, and perhaps <em>likely</em>, that even if someone had very good reason to believe they’d identified the true/correct moral theory, they still wouldn’t be able to “persuade other people of this truth using evidence and reason alone”. But that doesn’t seem <em>certain</em>. It doesn’t seem clear that “There <em>would</em> still be principled disagreement about how best to live”, or that “Designing AI in accordance with a single moral doctrine <em>would</em> therefore involve imposing a set of values and judgments on other people who did not agree with them” (emphasis added in both cases).</p>\n<p>Again, I’d assume a world where identification of a true/correct moral theory has occurred is a very different world. It seems <em>plausible</em> that, in that world, people <em>would</em> be typically convinced of most true things just “using evidence and reason alone”.</p>\n<p>And if that isn’t already the case by default, it seems <em>plausible</em> that some way around that obstacle could be developed, which we would <em>not</em> classify as a “form of domination” or as “imposing” values on people. For example, perhaps people’s intellectual capabilities could be raised to something approximating those of whatever entity had identified the true/correct moral theory. And/or perhaps people could be taken through something approximating the same lines of argument and evidence that had aided in the identification of that theory.</p>\n<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, even if in practice this couldn’t be done - if not all people could be convinced - it seems debatable whether those people’s disagreement would be “principled disagreement”. It <em>might</em> make sense to view that disagreement as largely the result of lack of knowledge or faulty reasoning, to view it as wise to <em>not</em> try to fully factor in that disagreement when deciding what values AI systems should be aligned with.</p>\n<p>Again, I’m not saying that I believe in the exact opposite claims to the claims the paper makes in this passage, or that we should assume that things <em>will</em> be easier than the paper suggests (see also <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uR3znuBnaevssYDZY/rfc-meta-ethical-uncertainty-in-agi-alignment\">this post</a>). It just seems to me that the paper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>takes as <em>certain</em> a set of obstacles that seem to me more like “plausible” or “likely” obstacles</li>\n<li>draws conclusions that don’t seem clearly supported from the premises given</li>\n<li>based on these claimed certainties and conclusions, arrives at the quite substantial and confidently made claim that “the task in front of us is not, as we might first think, to identify the true or correct moral theory and then implement it in machines” - a claim which I think we should <em>very seriously</em> think about, and perhaps take as likely, but not necessarily a claim we should take as <em>certain</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>The second passage</h1>\n<p>(This is a less important point which there’s a higher chance I’m wrong about, given that I don’t have much formal philosophical training.)</p>\n<p>The paper also discusses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A second approach to pluralistic value alignment[, which] focuses not on the values people already agree on, but rather on the principles they would agree upon if they were placed in a position where no one could impose their view on anyone else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the author writes that, if this approach was taken:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there may be certain distributive principles that would be chosen to regulate advanced AI. Without knowledge of their wealth or social standing, decision-makers might oppose large gaps between AI’s beneficiaries and those who lose out from the technology. These concerns would move them in the direction of egalitarian or prioritarian principles of justice, a strong version of which would be to insist that AI must work to ensure the greatest benefit to the least well off. To meet this condition in a global context, AI would need to benefit the world’s poorest people before it could be said to be value-aligned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This <em>seems</em> to me to fit a common pattern of people thinking you need egalitarianism or prioritarianism to arrive at a conclusion that you can really arrive at with just standard utilitarianism, given the purely empirical fact that there’s diminishing marginal utility to many resources.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-eJyahkzbbK37vfuqw-1\" id=\"fnref-eJyahkzbbK37vfuqw-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>For example, if I know that the same amount of money is more valuable for the poor than for the rich, that not being a slave is <em>far</em> more valuable to a slave than <em>having</em> a slave is to a “free man”, etc., then standard utilitarianism would lead me to work to ensure <em>particular focus</em> on benefitting the least well off. I wouldn’t need to be an egalitarian or prioritarian to reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p>Indeed, that sort of logic has led a lot of roughly utilitarian EAs to focus primarily on helping the extremely poor, farm animals, wild animals, people suffering from mental health issues, etc. These EAs recognise that these groups are more disadvantaged, and thus that a given amount of resources can benefit them more than it can benefit the relatively well-off (generally speaking), and that alone is enough to indicate that one should perhaps focus on helping these groups.</p>\n<p>So I <em>think</em> that, if I was purely self-interested and behind a veil of ignorance, I’d want society to be set up along roughly utilitarian lines, rather than specifically along prioritarian or egalitarian lines. I don’t think I’d want “the worst off” to be given <em>extreme</em> priority, beyond what utilitarianism would give them, because that’d make me lose out too much if I <em>don’t</em> end up in that position.</p>\n<p>(From memory, <em>Moral Tribes</em> by Joshua Greene discusses this sort of general point very well.)</p>\n<h1>Disclaimers</h1>\n<p>Firstly, I should restate that I thought this was an interesting paper, and that overall I think that I agreed with a lot of it and that I’d recommend it to people interested in the topic. I’ve disproportionately focused on what I didn’t agree with about this paper, largely because I have little to add regarding the various points I <em>did</em> agree with.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I should note that there’s a pretty impressive set of people in the “Acknowledgements” section, including people who seem to me very intelligent and worth paying attention to the views of. This updates me a little towards thinking my critiques are somehow just mistaken. (E.g., Joshua Greene, who I mentioned as supporting/informing one of my quibbles, is listed there.)</p>\n<p>Thirdly, I’m aware that my first two quibbles seem very related to various discussions on LessWrong and elsewhere about whether a sufficiently powerful AI would necessarily discover “the moral truth”, or whether the “the moral truth” is intrinsically convincing. And I <em>think</em> this is also related to debates about internalism vs externalism, though I don’t know much about that. I haven’t explicitly discussed those debates here because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I believe the paper itself didn’t do so</li>\n<li>I don’t think doing so is necessary to support my modest claims that, basically, in a few places things like “this is true” or “therefore...” should be replaced by things like “this may be, or is probably, true” or “this might suggest that…”</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Commentary on commentary</h1>\n<p>I might try to make a habit of writing reviews/commentaries/whatever as I read articles (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H8fTYkNkpYio7XG8L/link-and-commentary-the-offense-defense-balance-of\">this one</a>). (Not counting articles that started on or are already linked to on LessWrong or the EA Forum, as in those cases I can just write comments.) The aims of this would be to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Prompt me to more explicitly think through my vague sense of “this is very clever” or “something’s not quite right here”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bring interesting articles to other people’s attention</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maybe productively change the beliefs of others or myself (e.g., through comments pushing back against my commentary)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ideally, this would involve the authors directly engaging with the reviews, though I’m guessing that’d be fairly rare</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess I'll see over time how valuable that seems to be. I think it also might be cool for more others to do that sort of thing more often (I'm aware that some people already do).</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-eJyahkzbbK37vfuqw-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Although note that the paper doesn’t make that claim <em>explicitly</em>.

But if I'm alone in such suspicions, then maybe that means I'm just uniquely paranoid. To help sort out what's what, I consulted <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/unilateralist.pdf\">the paper by Nick Bostrom, Anders Sandberg, and Tom Douglas</a> in which the term was coined.</p>\n<p>The main argument (as the authors note under the keyword <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner%27s_curse\">\"winner's curse\"</a>) is basically an application of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean\">regression to the mean</a>: if <em>N</em> agents are deciding whether to do something on the basis of its true value <em>V</em> plus random error term <em>E</em>, then someone with a large positive <em>E</em> might end up doing the thing even if <em>V</em> is actually negative—and the problem gets worse for larger <em>N</em>.</p>\n<p>Crucially, Bostrom <em>et al.</em> note:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[T]hough we have thus far focused on cases where a number of agents can undertake an initiative and it matters only whether at least one of them does so, a similar problem arises when any one of a group of agents can <em>spoil</em> an initiative—for instance, where universal action is required to bring about an intended outcome. [...] Thus, in what follows, we assume that the unilateralist's curse can arise when each member of a group can unilaterally undertake <em>or spoil</em> an initiative (though for ease of exposition we sometimes mention only the former case).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power\">veto held by members of the United Nations Security Council</a> is given as an illustrative example of unilateral spoiling. This re-framing of the underlying statistical insight (the unilateral veto being \"dual\" to the unilateral act) seems relevant to its application to censorship: an author deciding to publish a blog post (even if other forum members think it's harmful) is in the position of taking unilateralist action—but so is a member of a board of pre-readers of whom any one has the power to censor the post (even if the other reviewers think it's fine).</p>\n<p>It occurs to me that a karma system (such as that used on this website) has the potential to be an adequate check against the unilateralist's curse as described by Bostrom <em>et al</em>. if we assume that the penalty applied to downvoted posts is sufficient to prevent the harm of the putative infohazard. If some possible post is infohazardous (say, doxxing someone's home address), most users will correctly know not to post it. If one user erroneously decides that doxxing is good (as if having \"rolled\" an anomalously high error term), we expect their post to be downvoted to oblivion by the supermajority who knows that doxxing is bad. Conversely, while a net-upvoted post might still be infohazardous, the harm from the post should not be attributed to the unilateralist's curse.</p>\n<p><em>(Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h4vWsBBjASgiQ2pn6/credibility-of-the-cdc-on-sars-cov-2#uDYbgf3QtEQirbsJk\">David Manheim's comments on \"Credibility of the CDC on SARS-CoV-2\"</a> for the inspiration.)</em></p>\n</body></html>",

In particular, whether I should delete a post criticising the CDC's response to the coronavirus, during a time of crisis where the CDC was the relevant US government authority on how to respond. I spent a few hours writing </i><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h4vWsBBjASgiQ2pn6/credibility-of-the-cdc-on-sars-cov-2#jdWKDjgbtr9kxNrWy\"><i>a response</i></a><i>, and I've reproduced it here with light editing so it can be linked to and discussed out of the context of the thread. It's not tightly edited, but it has a bunch of things about the current policies that I think are helpful to say rather than not say.</i></p><p><i>This post doesn't discuss all aspects of how to deal with infohazards and secrecy on LessWrong. In areas such as AI capabilities, bioweapons, and more, the LessWrong engineering team has thought more about features to build to allow for multi-stage publication practises. But this was an instance of a user asking that a specific post be deleted because it posed an infohazard, so that's what I address below.</i></p><hr><p>I've spent multiple hundreds of hours thinking about information hazards, publication norms, and how to avoid unilateralist action, and I regularly use those principles explicitly in decision-making. I've spent quite some time thinking about how to re-design LessWrong to allow for private discussion and vetting for issues that might lead to e.g. sharing insights that lead to advances in AI capabilities. But given all of that, on reflection, I completely disagree that this post should be deleted, or that the authors were taking worrying unilateralist action.</p><p>Let me give my thoughts on the issue of infohazards.</p><p>I am honestly not sure what work you think the term is doing in this situation, so I'll recap what it is for everyone following. In history, there has been a notion that all science is fundamentally good, that all knowledge is good, and that science need not ask ethical questions of its exploration. Much of Bostrom's career has been to draw the boundaries of this idea and show where it is false. For example, one can build technologies that a civilization is not wise enough to use correctly, that lead to degradation of society and even extinction (you and I are both building our lives around increasing the wisdom of society so that we don't go extinct). Bostrom's infohazards paper is a philosophical exercise, asking at every level of organisation what kinds of information can hurt you. The paper itself has no conclusion, and ends with an exhortation toward freedom of speech, its point is simply to help you conceptualise this kind of thing and be able to notice in different domains. Then you can notice the tradeoff and weigh it properly in your decision-making.</p><p>So, calling something an infohazard merely means that it's damaging information. An argument that has a false conclusion is an infohazard, because it might cause people to believe a false conclusion. Publishing private information is an infohazard, because it allows adversaries to attack you better. Yet, we allow people to make arguments that have false conclusions, and we often publish infohazardous private material because it contributes to the common good e.g. I list my home address on occasional public facebook events. This helps people burgle my house, but it's worth it to let lots of friends find me.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, in the x-risk community that focuses on biosecurity, I believe there are two kinds of infohazards that there is consensus that we should suppress. These are: sharing (even rough) technological designs for pathogens that could kill millions of people, and sharing information about system weaknesses that are presently subject to attack by adversaries. I won't give any current examples because I think they could be very damaging, but Davis Kingsley helpfully published an old example that is no longer applicable<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ek7M3xGAoXDdQkPZQ/terrorism-tylenol-and-dangerous-information\"> <u>in this post</u></a> if anyone is interested. So I assume that this is what you are talking about, as I know of no other classes of infohazard that there is a consensus about in the bio-x-risk space that one should take great pains to silence and punish people who publish on them.</p><p>The main reason Bostrom's paper is brought up in biosecurity is in the context of arguing that the spread of specific technological designs for various pathogens and or damaging systems shouldn't be published or sketched out in great detail. As Churchill was shocked by Niels Bohr's plea to share the nuclear designs with the Russians, because (he claimed) it would lead to the end of all war (to which Churchill said no and wondered if Bohr was a Russian spy), we shouldn't freely publish designs for pathogens that terrorists or warring states could use to hurt a lot of people or potentially cause an existential catastrophe. It would be wise to (a) have careful publication practises that involve the option of not-publishing details of such biological systems and (b) not publicise how to discover such information.</p><p>Bostrom has spent a lot of his career saying this is a worrying problem that you need to understand carefully. If someone on LessWrong were sharing e.g. their best guess at how to design and build a pathogen that could kill 1%, 10% or possibly 100% of the world's population, I would be in strong agreement that as an admin of the site I should preliminarily move the post back into their drafts, talk with the person, encourage them to think carefully about this, and connect them to people I know who've thought about this. I can imagine that the person has reasonable disagreements, but if it seemed like the person was actively indifferent to the idea that it might cause damage, then I can't stop them writing anywhere on the internet, but LessWrong has very good SEO and I don't want that to be widely accessible so it would be the right call to remove their content of this type from LessWrong. This seems sensible for the case of people posting mechanistic discussion of how to build pathogens that would be able to kill 1%+ of the population.</p><p>Now, you're asking whether we should treat <i>criticism of governmental institutions during a time of crisis </i>in the same category that we treat someone<i> posting pathogens designs or speculating on how to build pathogens that can kill 100 million people</i>. We are discussing something very different, a potential infohazard that has a fairly different set of associated intuitions.&nbsp;</p><p>Is there an argument here that is as strong as the argument that sharing pathogen designs can lead to an existential catastrophe?&nbsp;</p><p>Let me list some reasons why this action is in fact quite useful.</p><ul><li><strong>Helping people inform themselves about the virus. </strong>As I am writing this sentence, I'm in a house meeting attempting to estimate the number of people in my area with the disease, and what levels of quarantine we need to be at and when we need to do other things (e.g. can we go to the grocery store, can we accept amazon packages, can we use Uber, etc). We're trying to use various advice from places like the CDC and the WHO, and it's helpful to know when I can just trust them to have done their homework versus taking them as helpful but that I should re-do their thinking with my own first-principles models in some detail.</li><li><strong>Helping necessary institutional change happen. </strong>The coronavirus is not likely to be an existential catastrophe. I expect it will likely kill over 1 million people, but is exceedingly unlikely to kill a couple percent of the population, even given hospital overflow and failures of countries to quarantine. This isn't the last hurrah from that perspective, and so a naive maxipok utilitarian calculus would say it is more important to improve the CDC for future existential biorisks rather than making sure to not hinder it in any way today. I think that standard policy advice is that stuff gets done quickly in crisis time, and I think that creating public, common knowledge of the severe inadequacies of our current institutions at <i>this</i> time, not ten years later when someone writes a historical analysis, but right now, is the time when improvements and changes are most likely to happen. I want the CDC to be better than this when it comes to future bio-x-risks, and now is a good time to very publicly state very clearly what it's failing at.</li><li><strong>Protecting open, scientific discourse. </strong>I'm always skeptical of advice to not publicly criticise powerful organisations because it might cause them to lose power. I always feel that if their continued existence and power is threatened by honest and open discourse... then it's weird to think that it's me who's defecting on them when I speak openly and honestly about them. I really don't know what deal they thought they could make with me (and every other free-thinking person who notices these things?!) where I would silence myself. I'm afraid that was not a deal that was on offer, and they're picking the wrong side. Open and honest discourse is always controversial and always necessary for a healthy, scientific culture.</li></ul><p>So the counterargument here is that there is a downside strong enough possible here. Importantly, when Bostrom shows that information should be hidden and made secret because sharing it might lead to an existential catastrophe.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Could criticising the government here lead to an existential catastrophe?</i></p><p>I don't know your position, but I'll try to paint a picture, and let me know if this sounds right. I think you think that something like the following is a possibility. The post in question, or a successor like it, goes viral (pun not intended) on twitter, leading to a consensus that the CDC is incompetent. Later on, the CDC recommends mass quarantine in the US, and the population follows the letter but not the spirit of the recommendation, and this means that many people break quarantine and die.</p><p>So that's a severe outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>My first point is that it isn't an existential catastrophe.</p><p><i>(Is the coronavirus itself an existential catastrophe? As I said above, this doesn’t seem like it’s the case to me. Its death rate seems to be around 2% when given the proper medical treatment (respirators and the like), and so given hospital overload will likely be higher, perhaps 3-20% (depending on the variation in age of the population). My understanding is that it will likely peak at a maximum of 70% of any given highly connected population, and it's worth remembering that much of humanity is spread out and not based in cities where people see each other all of the time.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I think the main world in which this is an existential catastrophe is the world where getting the disease does not confer immunity after you lose the disease. This means a constant cycle of the disease amongst the whole population, without being able to develop a vaccine. In that world, things are quite bad, and I'm not really sure what we'll do then. That quickly moves me from \"The next 12 months will see a lot of death and I'm probably going to be personally quarantined for 3-5 months and I will do work to ensure the rationality community and my family is safe and secured\" to \"This is the sole focus of my attention for the foreseeable future.\"</i></p><p><i>Importantly, I don't really see any clear argument for which way criticism of the CDC plays out in this world.)</i></p><p>I know there are real stakes here. Even though you need to go against CDC recommendation today and stockpile, in the future the CDC will hopefully be encouraging mass quarantine, and if people ignore that advice then a fraction of them will die. But there are always life-and-death stakes to speaking honestly about failures of important institutions. Early GiveWell faced the exact same situation, criticising charities saving lives in developing countries. One can argue that this kills people by reducing funding for these important charities. But this was just worth a million times over it because we've coordinated around far more effective charities and saved way more lives. We need to discuss governmental failure here in order to save more lives in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Can I imagine taking down content about the coronavirus? Hm, I thought about it for a bit, and I can imagine that, if a country was under mass quarantine, and people were writing articles with advice about how to escape quarantine and meet people, that would be something we'd take down. There's an example. But criticising the government? It's like a fundamental human right, and not because it would be inconvenient to remove, but because it's the only way to build public trust. The standard answer here is just correct, that public criticism of powerful institutions is good and healthy.)</i></p><p><i>(Added: Looking back on this example, I realise that my example is not as clear cut as I thought at the time. For example, often people advising how to break out of quarantine would be doing so in part because they do not trust the government – there have been quarantine-breaking protests for exactly this purpose. I do not think the above stands so clearly, and would need to think about it more to come up with a rule I was confident in.)</i></p><p>The reason we mustn’t silence discussion when we think the consequences are bad, is because the truth is powerful and has surprising consequences. Bostrom has argued that if it’s an existential risk, this principle no longer holds, but if you think he thinks this applies to anything else, let me quote the end of his paper on infohazards.</p><blockquote><p>Even if our best policy is to form an unyielding commitment to unlimited freedom of thought, virtually limitless freedom of speech, an extremely wide freedom of inquiry, we should realize not only that this policy has costs but that perhaps the strongest reason for adopting such an uncompromising stance would itself be based on an information hazard; namely, norm hazard: the risk that precious yet fragile norms of truth-seeking and truthful reporting would be jeopardized if we permitted convenient exceptions in our own adherence to them or if their violation were in general too readily excused.</p></blockquote><hr><p><i>Footnote on Unilateralism</i></p><p>I don't see a reasonable argument that this was close to such a situation such that it's a dangerous unilateralist action to write the post on the CDC. This isn't a situation where 95% of people think it's bad but 5% think it's good.</p><p>If you want to know whether we've lifted the unilateralist's curse here on LessWrong, well, you need look no further than <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vvzfFcbmKgEsDBRHh/honoring-petrov-day-on-lesswrong-in-2019\"><u>the Petrov Day event that we ran</u></a>, and see <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/krgNxiooRfnP9L4ZD/follow-up-to-petrov-day-2019\"><u>what the outcome was</u></a>. That was indeed my attempt to help LessWrong practise and self-signal that we don't take unilateralist action. But this case is neither an x-risk infohazard nor worrisome unilateralist action. It’s just two people doing their part in helping us draw an accurate map of the territory.</p></body></html>",

The resulting paper, entitled &quot;Review of Potential High-Leverage and Inexpensive Mitigations for Reducing Risk in Epidemics and Pandemics&quot; <a href=\"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0432/v1\">has now been accepted for publication</a>. The publication process is unfortunately very slow*, but in addition to talking about a number of the things we should have been doing before COVID-19 hit**, there are a few that we are perhaps not too late to address.I thought it was worth considering a few of the still-relevant needs and activities that seem like potentially high-leverage avenues for investigation. Given that a few of the things seem still neglected, but are potentially addressable for the current pandemic are, I wanted to highlight them.</p><h2><strong>1) Enable people to stay isolated effectively.</strong></h2><p>People are currently being told to stay in quarantine if they were exposed. Unfortunately, staying home may become more difficult if people in isolation need supplies and have no income to allow them to purchase things, or if they cannot get certain things - many medicines must be picked up in person, and in some places, supplies cannot be easily ordered online. Furthermore, if delivery services are interrupted, (which is likely given the heightened risk of exposure for delivery workers, see below,) this will become more difficult. Contingency plans to help deal with the challenges would be helpful, and systems to enable volunteers to assist could also be a useful avenue of research. </p><h2><strong>2) Triage and manage medical care remotely.</strong></h2><p>Much medical care does not require hospitals or emergency rooms, but they are utilized anyways - that&apos;s where the doctors are. If medical facilities become overwhelmed, many of these need to be replaced by alternatives - self-administered diagnostics, systems to enable phlebotomy and similar testing without needing to go to hospitals, and similar. EMTs may need to be trained to do pre-hospital triage rather than bring lightly injured patients, or people at high risk of serious infection, to hospitals. Similarly, to the extent that people can self-treat, videos and instructions for doing so may be valuable.</p><h2><strong>3) Manage critical services through disruptions.</strong></h2><p>Many people doing preparation for large scale disruptions have pointed out that it seems unlikely that their homes would lose access to electricity or clean water. The reason this is true is that these critical services will have a high priority. It is unclear, however, how much redundancy and backup exists for key personnel in this type of facility. If all of the senior engineers who can accomplish a critical function are simultaneously absent, they cannot be replaced easily during a crisis - and they are somewhat likely to all be exposed and become sick around the same time.</p><h2><strong>4) Ensure transport systems remain functional.</strong></h2><p>If international shipping is slowed or stopped, or trucking or other transport were disrupted - either due to quarantines, or because of a lack of personnel, the US food supply systems would be reduced to a fairly short supply of goods. Similarly, if Amazon, UPS, or other delivery companies can no longer deliver goods, many systems that rely on the ability to reorder components. This is a critical need, and it is unclear how the system would cope with a large scale unavailability of drivers.<br>To conclude, I&apos;ll mention that I&apos;m hopeful that the discussion can start to shift towards preparation for contingencies before it becomes obvious that they are needed.

It may be the case that there is really not much to do, and the best thing to do is just stay home, but it seems worth discussing, in case that there are better options.<br><br>I&apos;ll start with the obvious ones:<br><br>You can protect others by not spreading the virus: i.e. taking reasonable precautions to avoid being infected yourself, and isolating yourself to prevent spreading the virus.<br><br>Encouraging others (family, friends, co-workers) to likewise take reasonable precautions and isolate themselves to slow the spread of the disease. If you are a leader in a company or organization, use your influence to discourage in-person contact.<br><br>Some other ideas which I am not sure about:<br><br>Donating money. Who would you donate money to? Response is being led by governments, who don&apos;t need or take donations. In the US, a lot of hospitals are non-profits which can accept donations, but at the moment I don&apos;t have any reason to think donating would help their response to the crisis. Any useful ways to donate money?<br><br>Donating supplies. I guess most people probably don&apos;t have relevant supplies to donate. But I saw some talk on Twitter about Californians who bought respirators due to the fires last year, and if there was any way they could give them to those who might need them more (hospitals?). Does this make sense? Anything else like this?<br><br>Donating blood. This has nothing to do with the coronavirus, but it seems likely that if people are discouraged from leaving home, fewer people will donate blood, and meanwhile people will still have non-virus medical issues that will require blood transfusions. Does this make sense?<br><br>Volunteering. I&apos;m sure a lot of people will want to do this since it gives a strong feeling of &quot;helping out&quot;. It might make sense to split this question in two parts. First, in regions where there is not yet evidence of spread of the disease, are there beneficial volunteer opportunities to inform people/increase preparedness/otherwise prevent infection? Second, are there beneficial volunteer opportunities in regions where the disease is already spreading? The second one is probably more likely to be answered in the negative, since any additional activity might exacerbate the spread of the disease. But it still seems worth asking. Unless things get extremely bad, I would guess that things like basic infrastructure and hospitals continue to be fully staffed by regular, existing employees. Was this the case in Wuhan?</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>",

I&apos;d be grateful for anyone suggesting improvements, nitpicking the inputs, and especially correcting errors.</p><p>I&apos;m computing my estimates in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18PuE_z8kFESez5aSCdkePkqAvj9qe_0M-K_MICMCVf8/edit#gid=247316023\">this</a> messy spreadsheet, which is automatically importing data from John Hopkins CSSE&apos;s <a href=\"https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19\">github repo</a>. (Thanks <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/peterh\">PeterH</a>!) </p><h2>Basic argument</h2><p>(This model is a variation of one that Elizabeth Garrett shared with me. Please give credit where credit is due.)</p><p>My goal is to estimate the number of people who are infected (who are carriers of the disease) rather than the number of people who are currently suffering symptoms. Here I&apos;m going to walk through a series of steps, starting from the number of confirmed cases in a location, and derive and estimate of the number of infected persons in that population. </p><p><strong>Use diagnosis rate and number of confirmed cases, to get the total number of symptomatic cases </strong></p><p>To estimate the number of people currently infected, I start with the number of new cases that that were diagnosed in the past doubling period.</p><p>But not all the people who developed symptoms are confirmed as having the disease. Presumably some fraction (less than one) of all people who develop symptoms are successfully diagnosed. But if you know what that fraction (the diagnosis rate or confirmation rate) is, you can get the <em>total</em> number of cases by multiplying the confirmed number of cases by one over the diagnosis rate.</p><p><em>total cases that became symptomatic in the past doubling period = cases confirmed in the most recent doubling period * 1 / confirmation rate</em></p><p><strong>Use doubling time and recent daily cases, to get the number of cases one doubling time ago </strong></p><p>If you know the doubling time of the disease, and you know how many new cases there were in the past one doubling time, you know how many cases there were at the <em>beginning</em> of that doubling time.</p><p>For instance, if you know that a disease has a doubling time of one week, and you know that there were 50 new cases over the past week, that means there must have been 50 cases a week ago. (Because that&apos;s what a <em>doubling</em> time means. After one doubling time, there are twice as many cases as you started with).</p><p><em>total cases that became symptomatic in the past doubling period = total cases that had already shown symptoms at the beginning of that doubling period</em></p><p><strong>Use total number of cases and incubation period, to get the number of people who became infected one incubation period ago </strong></p><p>However, the number of symptomatic cases, lags behind the number of infected people, because there&apos;s an incubation period.</p><p>If we treat the incubation period as uniform, that means that the total number of people that have shown symptoms, on any given day, is equal to the number of people who were infected one incubation period ago.</p><p>So we&apos;re now estimating the number of people that were infected two steps in the past: a doubling time and and an incubation period ago. </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1583734671/2020-03-08_diagram_to_show_corona_infection_relationships_zo9rvj.jpg\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:100%\"></figure></span><p><strong>Use the number of infected people (one doubling time + one incubation period) ago and the doubling time, to get the current number of infected people</strong></p><p>Once you have a number of people who were infected (though not necessarily symptomatic) a doubling time and an incubation period ago, you can multiply that number by 2 raised to &quot;however many doubling times there have been since that day&quot;.</p><p>This gives us an estimate of the number of people who are currently infected.</p><p>(If you see any errors, please leave a comment!)</p><h2>Conclusion with current numbers</h2><p>Given the above model, we can plug in some available numbers to get an estimate of how many people in the Bay area are currently (as of the evening of March 8, 2020) infected with COVID-19.</p><p>For number of confirmed cases, I&apos;m using the data from John Hopkins CSSE. [See the &quot;intermediate calculations&quot; tab of the spreadsheet].</p><p>(Note that these numbers are including the Grand Princess Cruise Ship, which is currently in the pacific off the coast of California.)</p><p>I&apos;ve heard that the doubling time for COVID-19 is between 3.5 and 7 days, so I calculated both of those, for a rough lower and upper bound. As more data comes in, I&apos;ll be able to observe the doubling time in the Bay area directly, and use that for future calculations.</p><p>(For calculating the number of new cases in the past 3.5 days, I took the difference between today and the average of 3 and 4 days ago.)</p><p>I&apos;m very uncertain about what a reasonable confirmation rate is. Are 50% of symptomatic cases successfully being diagnosed as COVID-19? Are 30%? 10%?  1%?!</p><p>I elected to take all of them, and compute the number of people who are infected as a function of the confirmation rate.

This is a disease where a\nlot of people need hospitalization for respiratory problems, and if it\nspreads too quickly our medical facilities won't be able to keep up.\nBy slowing the spread we lower the peak number of people who are sick\nat one time, making much better use of our medical capacity:\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-19-delay-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-19-delay.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/covid-19-delay.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/covid-19-delay-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n<br /><i><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/community_mitigation-sm.pdf\">CDC</a></i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nLooking back at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu\">1918 flu\npandemic</a>, efforts to reduce social contact were relatively\nsuccessful at blunting the peak.  <i><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/18/7582.full.pdf\">Public\nhealth interventions and epidemic intensity during the 1918 influenza\npandemic</a></i> (Hatchett et. al. 2007) compares the responses of\ndifferent cities, and gives the difference between the experiences of\nPhiladelphia and St. Louis as an especially clear illustration:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/stl-vs-phl-1918-flu-mortality-big.png\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/stl-vs-phl-1918-flu-mortality.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/stl-vs-phl-1918-flu-mortality.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/stl-vs-phl-1918-flu-mortality-2x.png 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe coronavirus is spreading through multiple communities around the\nUS, including Seattle, San Francisco, and New York.  Because of a\ncombination of how far behind we are on testing, how long the\nincubation period is, and how these cases can seem relatively\nunremarkable at first, it is likely to also be spreading in many other\ncommunities.  This means we shouldn't wait until it's clear that it's\nspreading in our community to start taking steps to reduce the\npotential transmission rate.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSocial dance puts people in close contact with a lot of other people.\nYou're touching hands, and breathing close to each other's faces.\nGood hand washing can help, but it's probably not enough.  The tango\ncommunity has seen the coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.tangomarathons.com/2020/03/tango-during-after-coronavirus-crisis/\">spreading\nat their events</a> and I don't think tango is any more prone to this\nthan others.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe Country Dance and Song Society is <a href=\"https://www.cdss.org/covid19\">recommending</a> that dances\ncancel if their local schools are cancelling, but I don't think this is\nenough.  Because school cancellation <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-06/university-washington-coronavirus-school-closure\">often\nmeans</a> that grandparents will be watching the children instead,\nolder people are especially vulnerable to this disease, and children\nare not, even places with extensive community spread are often not\ncancelling school.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhen there's snow or ice, where it would be dangerous for people to\ntravel to a dance, we cancel.  The coronavirus is a different kind of\ndanger, a less visible one, but continuing to hold dances would not be\nresponsible.  Contra dances in <a href=\"http://www.seattledance.org/contra/lakecity\">Seattle</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bacds.org/\">Bay Area</a>, <a href=\"http://portlandcountrydance.org/dance-schedule/\">Portland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thursdaycontra.com/\">Philadelphia</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/thursdaycontras/permalink/10159622162733128/\">Boston</a>\nare cancelling their events, and I think this is the right decision.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI love dancing and I'm really sad to be advocating less of it, but\ndancing will still be there when this is over, and we want everyone to\nstill be with us to enjoy it.\n\n  </p>",

Surely if only 1 part in 2,000 isn&#x2019;t explained by the model that indicates that the data is fabricated?</p><p>The first thing to note is that &quot;variance&quot; is a technical term which isn&apos;t the same thing as the natural understanding of &quot;variation&quot;.

In particular, variance isn&apos;t the deviation from the mean, but the <u>squared </u>deviation. In the more natural understanding, the quadratic model explains 44 parts in 45 of the deviation from the mean, not 1,999 in 2,000. This is still pretty good but seems like less evidence for fabrication.</p><p>An alternative explanation of the <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R^2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> value is that it compares two models: </p><p>1.

The y value used in the regression is total cases so far. So model 2 represents some number of cases having already been identified at the beginning of the time period in question and no more cases occurring during the time period.</p><p>So saying that model 1 accounts for 44 parts in 45 of the deviation between the data and model 2 doesn&#x2019;t really tell me much &#x2013; model 2 is a lost cause.</p><h1>New cases per day</h1><p>The problem here is the chosen y-axis. Instead of choosing total number of cases by a certain day, it would be better to choose new cases per day. This removes excess correlation between data points.</p><p>If we do this then instead of fitting a quadratic curve we need to be fitting a straight line (we&#x2019;re taking the derivative with respect to x) but I&apos;ll still call it quadratic for the sake of consistency. Model 2 changes from representing a constant total number of cases to a constant number of new cases every day. This still isn&#x2019;t a particularly likely model but is certainly an improvement.</p><p>Plotting and regressing we get:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1583453055/blog%20posts/per_day.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:70%\"></figure></span><p>Our <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R^2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> value has gone down to 0.96. This is still high and suggests that quadratic growth is a fairly good model for the data but isn&#x2019;t suspicious. For instance, I can also fit a power law (again 2 free parameters) to the data and get <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"R^2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">R</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> = 0.966. </p><p>So within the training set our quadratic model (linear new cases per day) explains a comparable level of variance as a power law model of new cases does.</p><h1>Looking outside the dataset</h1><p>The obvious thing to do is check whether the pattern was there outside the dataset. </p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/deszvp5h9/image/upload/v1583453227/blog%20posts/Beyond.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:75%\"></figure></span><p>It is clear that the pattern breaks down shortly after it was noticed (day 15 on this chart).</p><p>In addition we can look at the pattern before the training set. Again as soon as we go outside of the dataset used to create the graph the pattern completely breaks down. This is not surprising as at this point the quadratic model predicts a negative number of new cases per day.</p><p>(Looking a deaths instead of cases shows a similar story. For deaths the pattern keeps going for a little longer but even then the power law fit matches the data better.)</p><p>So to make the case for China falsifying the data quadratically you have to also say that the start date for them doing it was ~20th Jan and the end date more-or-less straight after the pattern was noticed. Presumably this would be justified by China having been caught out and changing from then on.</p><p>Or possibly, this is just how the virus develops. Now that we have some developments in other countries it is possible to compare spread rates. Where the disease has got out of containment there is a remarkably consistent pattern of growth which matches the China rate very closely. (I&apos;m planning to write a more detailed post on this.)</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p><em>[x-posted from EA Forum]</em></p><p><em>The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity</em> is out today. I&#x2019;ve been working on the book with Toby for the past 18 months, and I&#x2019;m excited for everyone to read it. I think it has the potential to make a profound difference to the way the world thinks about existential risk.</p><p><strong>How to get it</strong></p><ul><li>It&apos;s out in the UK on March 5 and US March 24</li><li>An audiobook, narrated by Toby himself, is out March 24</li><li>You can buy it on <a href=\"http://getbook.at/Precipice\">Amazon</a> now, or at <a href=\"http://theprecipice.com/purchase\">theprecipice.com/purchase</a></li><li>You can download the opening chapters for free by signing up to the newsletter at <a href=\"http://www.theprecipice.com/\">www.theprecipice.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What you can do</strong></p><ul><li>Read the book</li><li>Talk about it with your friends and family, or share quotes you like on social media</li><li>If you enjoy it, consider writing a review on Amazon or Goodreads</li></ul><h3><strong>Summary of the book</strong></h3><p><strong>Part One: The Stakes</strong></p><p>Toby places our time within the broad sweep of human history: showing how far humanity has come in 2,000 centuries, and where we might go if we survive long enough. He outlines the major transitions in our past&#x2014;the Agricultural, Scientific, and Industrial Revolutions. Each is characterised by dramatic increases in our power over the natural world, and together they have yielded massive improvements in living standards. During the twentieth century, with the detonation of the atomic bomb, humanity entered a new era. We gained the power to destroy itself, without the wisdom to ensure that we don&#x2019;t. This is the Precipice, and how we navigate this period will determine whether humanity has a long and flourishing future, or no future at all. Toby introduces the concept of existential risk&#x2014;risks that threaten to destroy humanity&#x2019;s longterm potential. He shows how the case for safeguarding humanity from these risks draws support from a range of moral perspectives. Yet it remains grossly neglected&#x2014;humanity spends more each year on ice cream than we do on protecting our future.</p><p><strong>Part Two: The Risks</strong></p><p>Toby explores the science behind the risks we face. In <em>Natural Risks</em>, he considers threats from asteroids &amp; comets, supervolcanic eruptions, and stellar explosions. He shows how we can use humanity&#x2019;s 200,000 year history to place strict bounds on how high the natural risk could be. In <em>Anthropogenic Risks</em>, he looks at risks we have imposed on ourselves in the last century,&#xA0; from nuclear war, extreme climate change, and environmental damage. In <em>Future Risks</em>, he turns to threats that are on the horizon from emerging technologies, focusing in detail on engineered pandemics, unaligned artificial intelligence, and dystopian scenarios.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Part Three: The Path Forward</strong></p><p>Toby surveys the risk landscape and gives his own estimates for each risk. He also provides tools for thinking about how they compare and combine, and for how to prioritise between risks. He estimates that nuclear war and climate change each pose more risk than all the natural risks combined, and that risks from emerging technologies are higher still. Altogether, Toby believes humanity faces a 1 in 6 change of existential catastrophe in the next century. He argues that it is in our power to end these risks today, and to reach a place of safety. He outlines a grand strategy for humanity, provides actionable policy and research recommendations, and shows what each of us can do. The book ends with an inspiring vision of humanity&#x2019;s potential, and what we might hope to achieve if we navigate the risks of the next century.&#xA0;</p>",

In words: for each training point, the inner product with the vector measuring the similarity to the correct label needs to be larger than the inner product with the other vectors (in this case, the 2 others). This can be phrased as a <em>linear program</em> in much the same way as for Support Vector Machines (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tu6SSnkrreGYdEmwC/uml-viii-linear-predictors-2\">post VIII</a>).</p><p>However, it only works if such vectors exist.

This approach is called <em><strong>Regularized Loss Minimization</strong></em>. There are at least two reasons for doing this. One is that the presence of the regularization function makes the problem easier. The other is that, if the norm of a hypothesis is a measure for its complexity, choosing a predictor with a small norm might be desirable.

The first is about the fundamentals, which I covered in posts I-III. The second and third are about learning models, which I largely covered in posts IV-XIV. If there is a meaningful distinction between parts two and three, it&apos;s lost on me &#x2013; they don&apos;t seem to be increasing in difficulty, and I found both easier than part one. However, the fourth part, which is titled <em>advanced theory</em>, is noticeably harder &#x2013; too difficult for me to cover it at one post per week.</p><p>Here&apos;s a list of its chapters:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Rademacher Complexities, </strong></em>which is an advanced theory studying the rate at which training sequences become representative (closely related to the concept of uniform convergence from post III).</li><li><em><strong>Covering numbers,</strong></em> a related concept, about bounding the complexity of sets</li><li>Proofs for the sample complexity bounds in the quantitative version of the <em>fundamental theorem of statistical learning</em> (I&apos;ve mentioned those a couple of times in this sequence)</li><li>Some theory on the learnability of multiclass prediction problems, including another off-shoot of the VC-dimension.</li><li><em><strong>Compression Bounds, </strong></em>which is about establishing yet another criterion for the learnability of classes: if &quot;a learning algorithm can express the output hypothesis using a small subset of the training set, then the error of the hypothesis on the rest of the examples estimates its true error.&quot;</li><li><em><strong>PAC-Bayes, </strong></em>which is another learning approach</li></ul><h1>Closing Thoughts on the Book</h1><p>I&apos;ve mentioned before that, while <u>Understanding Machine Learning</u> is the best resource on the subject I&apos;ve seen so far, it feels weaker than <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Lambda-Calculus-Combinators-Introduction-Roger-Hindley/dp/0521898854/\">various</a> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Sheldon-Axler/dp/0387982582/\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Category-Computer-Scientists-Foundations-Computing/dp/0262660717/?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=miri05-20\">textbooks</a> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Topology-2nd-James-Munkres/dp/0131816292/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1296318429&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=viglink20784-20\">I&apos;ve tried</a> from <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/research-guide/#two\">Miri&apos;s list</a>. Part one is pretty good &#x2013; it actually starts from the beginning, it&apos;s actually rigorous, and it&apos;s reasonably well explained. Parts two and are mixed. Some chapters are good. Others are quite bad. Occasionally, I felt the familiar sense of annoyance-at-how-anyone-could-possibly-think-this-was-the-best-way-explain-this-concept that I get all the time reading academic papers very rarely with Miri-recommended textbooks. It feels a bit like the authors identified a problem (no good textbooks that offer a comprehensive <em>theoretical</em> treatment of the field), worked on a solution, but lost inspiration somewhere on the way and ended up producing several chapters that feel rather uninspired. The one on neural networks is a good example.</p><p>(Before bashing the book some more, I should note that the critically acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=elements+of+statistical+learning&amp;qid=1583690167&amp;sr=8-1\">Elements of Statistical Learning</a> made me angry immediately when I tried to read it &#x2013; point being, I appear to be unusually hard to please.)</p><p>The exercises are lacking throughout. I think the goal of exercises should be to help me internalize the concepts of the respective chapter, and they didn&apos;t really do that. It seems that the motivation for them was often &quot;let&apos;s offload the proof of this lemma into the exercises to save space&quot; or &quot;here&apos;s another interesting thing we didn&apos;t get to cover, let&apos;s make it an exercise.&quot; (Note that there&apos;s nothing wrong with offloading the proof of a lemma to exercises <em>per se</em>, they <em>can</em> be perfectly fine, but they&apos;re not <em>automatically</em> fine.) Conversely, in Topology, the first exercises of each sub-chapter usually felt like &quot;let&apos;s make sure you understood the definitions&quot; and the later ones like &quot;let&apos;s make sure you get some real practice with these concepts,&quot; which seems much better. Admittedly, it&apos;s probably more challenging to design exercises for Machine Learning than it is for a purely mathematical topic. Nonetheless, I think they could be improved dramatically.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>Next up (but not anytime soon) are <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\lambda\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">&#x3BB;</span></span></span></span></span></span>-calculus and Category theory. </p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Fun fact: the lens of a human eye consists mostly of fiber deposits which are never broken down - they do not turn over. Furthermore, new fiber layers are constantly added throughout life, so the lens thickens linearly by about 25 microns per year. Starting at around 3.5mm in infancy, it reaches 5.5mm in old age.</p><p>The main clinical result of this is the practically-universal need for glasses for close-up vision in people over 55 years old.</p><p>(Source: <u><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0849309484\">Physiological Basis of Aging and Geriatrics</a></u>; the section on the eye is one of the most detailed in the book.)</p><p>Besides being a simple, self-contained gear in its own right, the growth of the lens is a clear, knock-down example of an independent <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/d4DvqS88Q29ZaJAj3/homeostasis-and-root-causes-in-aging\">root cause</a></u> of one symptom of aging. We know exactly what&#x2019;s accumulating in a nonequilibrium fashion: the fibers of the lens. It&#x2019;s wildly unlikely that the growth of the lens is a root cause for other symptoms of aging - like <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QigLMhiuMA7vKFnww/wrinkles\">wrinkles</a></u>, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, cancer, muscle degeneration, etc. So, we have a clear case for polycausality - at least for one symptom of aging.</p><p>That said, there&#x2019;s a fair bit of evidence that <em>most</em> symptoms of aging share a common root cause, or at least a common intermediate. Qualitatively, many/most symptoms of aging in a wide variety of tissues:</p><ul><li>Look similar at the cellular level - there&#x2019;s a loss of homeostasis, with cells dying off faster than they&#x2019;re replaced, high levels of misfolded protein aggregates (a.k.a. junk), and markers of chronic inflammation</li><li>Follow a similar population-level onset/progression timetable: no noticeable problems from youth through mid-twenties, gradual onset/progression throughout middle age, then rapidly accelerating breakdown around 50-60 years of age and older. Some examples: <u><a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/cancer-stats/cases_crude_mf_allcancer_i16/cases_crude_mf_allcancer_i16.png\">cancer incidence</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrrheum.2017.60/MediaObjects/41584_2017_Article_BFnrrheum201760_Fig1_HTML.jpg\">muscle loss</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Toma/publication/51178358/figure/fig1/AS:277457832824836@1443162510907/Effect-of-age-and-gender-on-the-degree-of-atherosclerosis-in-the-human-aorta-Autopsy.png\">atherosclerosis</a></u>. Google a performance metric which declines with age, and you&#x2019;ll probably see the pattern.</li><li>Are correlated - someone who has one problem early is likely to have others early, and vice versa. See the literature on physiological/biological aging clocks for details.</li></ul><p>The growth of the lens does <em>not</em> follow this pattern - it&#x2019;s just a straight-line linear growth starting from childhood, without any unusual role of chronic inflammation or misfolded proteins or other typical aging-associated characteristics. On the other hand, there are other contributing factors to old-age vision problems which <em>do</em> follow the usual pattern - for instance, the loss of pupil muscle mass.</p><p>Besides the growth of the lens, there are a handful of other possible root/intermediate causes of aging symptoms which don&#x2019;t follow the usual pattern. None of them are as conclusive an example as the lens, but they may be involved in nastier diseases. In particular: the thymus is an organ which trains adaptive immune cells to distinguish pathogens from healthy host cells. That organ begins to shrink (called &#x201C;thymic involution&#x201D;) even in the first year of life, and steadily loses most of its mass by old age. I&#x2019;ll likely have a full post on that later.</p><h2>Progerias</h2><p>One interesting source of evidence about common root causes of aging symptoms is accelerated aging diseases, a.k.a. progerias. I&#x2019;ll talk about two: Werner Syndrome (WS) and Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS).</p><p>Werner syndrome is the progeria which most closely resembles true aging. People with WS develop normally through puberty, but then develop a laundry list of aging symptoms early:</p><ul><li>Gray hair</li><li>Hair loss</li><li>Wrinkles</li><li>Skin hardening/tightening</li><li>Loss of fat tissue</li><li>Atrophy of gonads</li><li>Cataracts</li><li>Atherosclerosis</li><li>Type 2 diabetes</li><li>Muscle degeneration</li><li>Bone loss</li><li>Cancer</li></ul><p>(you can find all this on the <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_syndrome\">wikipedia page</a></u>). Perhaps even more notable: changes in gene transcription associated with WS <u><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC218746/\">closely resemble</a></u> the transcription changes associated with aging.</p><p>What causes this remarkably aging-like disease? Mutation of a gene called WRN (short for Werner), which is involved in repair of several types of DNA damage. The damage does still get repaired (otherwise people with WS wouldn&#x2019;t be alive at all), but it&#x2019;s slower, so presumably there&#x2019;s a higher steady-state level of DNA damage. This is consistent with other lines of evidence which I may talk about in future posts: high levels of DNA damage are associated with aging.</p><p>The other type of progeria we&#x2019;ll discuss is HGPS. HGPS also shows many aging-like symptoms:</p><ul><li>Hair loss</li><li>Wrinkles</li><li>Skin hardening/tightening</li><li>Atherosclerosis</li><li>Muscle degeneration</li><li>Bone loss</li></ul><p>But even more notable is the symptoms of aging which are <em>not</em> associated with HGPS, specifically:</p><ul><li>Cancer</li><li>Arthritis</li></ul><p>(Note: I didn&#x2019;t comprehensively check every symptom of WS against HGPS, so don&#x2019;t read too much into the differences between the two lists above.)</p><p>What would cause so many aging-like symptoms, but not cancer? HGPS is caused by mutation of a nuclear envelope protein; without it, the cell nucleus has a weird shape (<u><a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Hutchinson-Gilford_Progeria_Syndrome.png\">striking picture here</a></u>). The main result is that cells have trouble dividing - the folded-up nuclear envelope gets in the way of chromosome arrangement when the nucleus is supposed to divide. The mutation limits cell division, which we&#x2019;d expect to lower homeostatic counts of a broad variety of cell types.</p><p>Assuming that&#x2019;s the main mechanism, we&#x2019;d expect HGPS to show the symptoms of aging associated with cell loss - e.g. hair loss, muscle degeneration - but not the symptoms associated with biological stressors like DNA damage - e.g. cancer and inflammatory diseases like arthritis. For some symptoms which aren&#x2019;t yet fully understood - e.g. wrinkles or atherosclerosis - HGPS is a hint that cell loss is probably a key mediating factor.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>While reading Quine's <a href=\"https://www.theologie.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:ffffffff-fbd6-1538-0000-000070cf64bc/Quine51.pdf\">Two Dogmas of Empiricism</a> I was struck by the importance of analyticity. In philosophy, there are many arguments that are deeply challenging to evaluate. Take for example this argument from Kant for finitism:</p><blockquote>If we assume that the world has no beginning in time, then up to  every given moment an eternity has elapsed, and there has passed away in that world an infinite series of successive states of things. Now the infinity of a series consists in the fact that it can never be completed  through successive synthesis. It thus follows that it is impossible for an infinite world-series to have passed away, and that a beginning of  the world is therefore a necessary condition of the world's existence.</blockquote><p>Is this a good argument? Like many abstract philosophical arguments, it's actually very difficult to tell. But if we had a method for determining which statements are <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Analytic%E2%80%93synthetic_distinction\">analytic and which are synthetic</a>, we'd have a better idea of whether to consider it seriously or to dismiss it out of hand.</p><p>I won't be providing a method of distinguishing analytic from synthetic today. I don't know how to do that. However, I believe I have one puzzle piece.</p><p>Quine states that is it unclear whether statements like, \"Anything green is extended\" are analytic even though he know perfectly well what \"green\" and \"extended\" mean.</p><p>I would actually dispute this - the definitions of either of these words aren't clear at all. Take for example green - are we talking about what color we perceive or a wavelength that is emitted? What if we discovered tomorrow that vision didn't actually utilise light, but tiny particles? Would green be defined in terms of then? What about a green hallucination? Does that count as a \"thing\" that is green?</p><p>And what counts as extended? If we discovered we were characters in the matrix, would we count the virtual space we move around as extended? Would the real space count as extended? Arguably, we could say that space refers to an underlying structure that plays a particular role in our experiences and that since we are experiencing the virtual and not the \"real\" world when we talk about \"extension\" we mean extension in this virtual world.</p><p>Another way to think about this is in terms of import statements. Like in order to define green we may have to import the concept of light which then requires us to import the concepts of time and space.</p><p>Of course, these definitions are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE/disputing-definitions\">arbitrary</a> so it is up to humans to choose how we use these words. Perhaps we want to follow Quine and say that if the world was different we'd probably define some of these words differently (ie. if we define water by chemical symbol and it were actually HO instead of H2O, then we'd change the definition). Or perhaps we want to say that words like object come attached with background assumptions such as \"green\" being limited in application to \"objects\" which are defined to be things with a spatial component. In any case, it seems to all be dependent on the definitions we utilise. And even though I can't tell you what analyticity mean conceptually, once we've provided sufficient clarification on what is being asked, we should be able to determine this practically.</p>",

I want to write a short post explaining this to allow others to update, and seeing if someone has an argument that changes my mind.</em></p><p>Put simply, my claim is that bringing attention to likely ineffective personal methods for reducing risk is not net neutral with a large upside if they work, it is instead likely to be on net fairly harmful, albeit with a large upside if they work.</p><h2>Argument</h2><p>First, we have incredibly effective and vastly underutilized ways to prevent spread of COVID-19, namely handwashing and not touching your face. Given that, if I propose an intervention like making homemade masks from fabric which reduced handwashing compliance by 1% (perhaps due to distracting people or making them think handwashing is less critical,) it would need to be astonishingly effective to be net positive. And most such approaches being discussed are, as far as I can tell, nowhere near that level of effectiveness.</p><p>Second, most readers of Lesswrong and effective altruism blogs and facebook groups aren&apos;t hardcore rationalists, and even hardcore rationalists aren&apos;t immune to Akrasia. On top of that, people like Scott Alexander have huge readerships and <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-links-speculation-open-thread/\">sometimes link people to Lesswrong</a>. Many people reading posts here aren&apos;t washing their hands enough as it is, and aren&apos;t going to rationally evaluate the relative effectiveness of handwashing versus other interventions. </p><p>Third, evidence exists that risk-compensation is a meaningful issue. Actions that make people feel safer usually lead to less attention paid to more annoying / more intrusive measures. (There is evidence, such as  Vrolix&apos;s paper*, that risk compensation reduces the size of the positive impact, but does not make interventions net negative. This is conditioned on the impact being significant and positive, however, and seems not to apply to speculative interventions like those being proposed.</p><p>This is not an argument that we should not look into better options for response. It&apos;s an argument that we should be more careful in vetting them before encouraging people to do them just in case they work.</p><p>*) Vrolix, Klara (2006). <u><a href=\"https://doclib.uhasselt.be/dspace/bitstream/1942/4002/1/behavioraladaptation.pdf\">&quot;Behavioural Adaptation, Risk Compensation, Risk Homeostasis and Moral Hazard in Traffic Safety&quot;</a></u> )</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>The best way to learn something depends on what you're learning. Broadly-speaking, the things you learn can be divided into thinking/doing and conscious/unconscious. We can thus break the learning landscape into four kinds of learning: conceptual learning, rote learning, kinesthetic learning and discipline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conscious thinking = Conceptual learning</strong> is critical thinking. It includes all kinds of critical thinking such as higher math, dialectical reasoning, puzzle solving and philosophy.</li>\n<li><strong>Unconscious thinking = Rote learning</strong> is mindless memorization. It includes times tables, vocabulary, geography, the alphabet and the dates of historical events.</li>\n<li><strong>Conscious doing = Kinesthetic learning</strong> is everything you do. It includes the raw act itself of drawing, slight of hand, marksmanship and dancing.</li>\n<li><strong>Unconscious doing = Discipline</strong> is about training unconscious habits like attention. It includes meditation, lucid dreaming, perseverance, determination, obedience, self-sacrifice, pain tolerance and addiction recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the American school system I grew up in, conceptual learning is prized, kinesthetic learning receives lip service and rote learning is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kuXiSi52wvijw3ftR/the-technique-taboo\">derided</a><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-oGM5eDAbc2jpzd8dF-1\" id=\"fnref-oGM5eDAbc2jpzd8dF-1\">[1]</a></sup>. Discipline is taboo<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-oGM5eDAbc2jpzd8dF-2\" id=\"fnref-oGM5eDAbc2jpzd8dF-2\">[2]</a></sup>. This might have something to do with living in a free society. Critical thinking has good connotations because it's impossible to coerce. Discipline is simple to coerce. Coerced discipline is called \"brainwashing\". Ironically, this emphasis on conceptual learning runs opposite to compulsory schools' strengths. As coercive institutions, they're better at teaching discipline than critical thinking.</p>\n<p>For each type of learning there is an optimal way to do it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Concepts</em> are best learned by discussing them in debates, teaching and writing. A free, egalitarian atmosphere is conducive to conceptual learning because it creates the conditions for good feedback.</li>\n<li><em>Rote learning</em> is about scheduling. The best way to memorize simple information is via spaced repetition. It's so mindless you can do it with software.</li>\n<li><em>Kinesthetics</em> are learned by doing them over-and-over again. Quantity of practice is the name of the game. Using your skill in the real world is usually (but not always) the best way to get these hours in.</li>\n<li><em>Discipline</em> is learned via habituation. It's about minimizing the time you aren't disciplined. Sobriety is about how infrequently you drink. Not how often you don't.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What follows are a few examples of how I apply this framework to learn different things</p>\n<h2>Chinese</h2>\n<p>I started learning Chinese with a little kinesthetic practice to learn the pronunciation. Then I delved into rote learning for a long time to amass vocabulary. Now that my vocabulary has reached a basic level of utility it's time I dial back the spaced repetition and so I can practice the kinesthetic skills of reading and conversing instead.</p>\n<p>Until recently, the best way to measure my progress was by the size of the vocabulary I'd amassed. Now the number to optimize is how many hours I'm absorbing information in Chinese.</p>\n<h2>Drawing</h2>\n<p>When I first started learning to draw, I prioritized developing my conceptual toolkit of how artists look at the world. Now that I've got the hang of line, value and form it's time to shift into kinesthetic mode. It no longer matters so much how hard I think about what I draw. I just need to put in the hours.</p>\n<h2>Lucid Dreaming</h2>\n<p>Conceptual, rote and kinesthetic learning can do nothing more for me here. It's all about creating the right habits.</p>\n<h2>Magic Tricks</h2>\n<p>I've long ago mastered the kinesthetic sense of misdirection. If I wanted to improve my magic act I'd have to go back to studying on a rote or conceptual level.</p>\n<h1>Books</h1>\n<p>I haven't read many books recently. This has made me uneasy because I associate books so strongly with learning. But books make the most sense for rote and conceptual learning. The things I'm learning right now are primarily kinesthetic and disciplinary, a place books can't help me.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-oGM5eDAbc2jpzd8dF-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>As usual, medical school remains an exception. <a href=\"#fnref-oGM5eDAbc2jpzd8dF-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-oGM5eDAbc2jpzd8dF-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Individual variation in discipline are not taboo.

A couple months ago I made a \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/folding-couch-monitor\">folding couch monitor</a> to use while\nsitting, but (a) that's in the living room and (b) I generally prefer\nto work \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/standing-desk-update\">standing up</a>.  So I made\na small standing desk in our bedroom:\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/bedroom-standing-desk-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/bedroom-standing-desk.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/bedroom-standing-desk.jpg 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/bedroom-standing-desk-2x.jpg 1100w\" /></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\nIt's a one-monitor version of my <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/work-hardware-setup\">work\nhardware setup</a> (which is still the same three years later, except\nthat I have <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D402Z28/\">27\" 2560 x 1440\n</a> monitors now).  I use the laptop keyboard and trackpad because\nthat feels better on my wrists than any external keyboard and mouse\nI've tried, and I don't use the laptop monitor because that hurts my\nneck.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhile I'm calling it a desk, it's really a shelf.  It was easier to\nattach a shelf to the wall with brackets than build something\nfreestanding, and a standard desk would take up a bunch more space.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt's very small, but all I need is space for a monitor and my laptop.\nThe top is a 22.5\" by 17\" piece of 3/4\" plywood painted white.  I\nrounded the outside corner for safety.  I could have made the top a\ncouple inches narrower if I hadn't been trying to match a specific\nspace.  It's 41\" off the ground, which is in the ~2\" window where my\nelbows can be close to a right angle.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe monitor stand doesn't go high enough on its own, so it's elevated\n6.25\" with a 10.5\" by 7.5\" pine box.  I made it out of 2x6 scraps I had,\nwith a 3/4\" plywood top for the monitor stand's base to sit on.  I\ndidn't paint this, though I might at some point.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI'm pretty happy with it, though all I've used it for so far is\nwriting this post.\n\n  </p>",

Some people claim that the post itself is harmful, arguing that anything which reduces trust in the CDC will likely kill people as they ignore or reject important advice for dealing with SARS-CoV-2 and (in the long-run) other issues like vaccination. This argument has been met with two very different responses.</p><p>One response has been to argue that the CDC&#x2019;s advice is <em>so bad</em> that reducing trust in it will actually have a net positive effect in the long run. This is an ultimately empirical question which somebody should probably address, but I do not have the skills or interest to attempt that.</p><p>The other response is much more interesting, arguing that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences\">appeals to consequences</a> are generally bad, and that meta-level considerations mean we should generally speak the truth even if the immediate consequences are bad. I find this really interesting because it is ultimately about <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Information_hazard\">infohazards</a>: those rare cases where there is a conflict between <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv/what-do-we-mean-by-rationality\">epistemic and instrumental rationality</a>. Typically, we believe that having more truth (via epistemic rationality) is a positive trait that allows you to &#x201C;win&#x201D; more (thus aligning with instrumental rationality). But when more truth becomes harmful, which do we preference: truth, or winning?</p><p>Some people will just decide to value truth more than winning as an axiom of their value system. But for most of us, ultimately I think this also boils down to an empirical question of just how bad &#x201C;not winning&#x201D; will end up being. It&#x2019;s easy to see that for sufficiently severe cases, natural selection takes over: any meme/person/thing that prefers truth over winning in those cases will die out, to be replaced by memes/people/things that choose to win. I personally will prefer winning in those cases. It&#x2019;s also true that <em>most of the time</em>, truth actually helps you win in the long run. We should probably reject untrue claims even if they provide a small amount of extra short-term winning, since in the long run having an untrue belief is likely to prevent us from winning in ways we can&#x2019;t predict.</p><p>Figuring out where the cut-over point lies between truth and winning seems non-trivial. Based on my examples above we can derive two simple heuristics to start off:</p><ul><li>Prefer truth over winning by default.</li><li>Prefer winning over truth if the cost of not winning is destruction of yourself or your community. (It&#x2019;s interesting to note that this heuristic arguably already applies to SARS-Cov-2, at least for some people in at-risk demographics.)</li></ul><p>What other heuristics do other people use for this question? How do they come out on the CDC post and SARS-CoV-2?</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<h1>Introduction</h1><p>One of the main places Americans look for information on coronavirus is the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (abbreviated CDC from the days before &#x201C;and Prevention&#x201D; was in the title). That&#x2019;s natural; &#x201C;handling contagious epidemics&#x201D; is not their only job, but it is one of their primary ones, and they position themselves as the authority. At a time when so many things are uncertain, it saves a lot of anxiety (and time, and money) to have an expert source you can turn to and get solid advice.</p><p>Unfortunately, the CDC has repeatedly given advice with lots of evidence against it. Below is a list of actions from the CDC that we believe are misleading or otherwise indicative of an underlying problem. If you know of more examples or have information on any of these (for or against), please comment below and we will incorporate into this post.</p><h1>Examples</h1><h2>Dismissed Risk of Infection Via Packages</h2><p>On the CDC&#x2019;s coronavirus FAQs pages on <u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200304001555/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html\">2020-03-04</a></u>, they say,  under &#x201C;Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?&#x201D;:</p><p>&#x201C;In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures.&#x201D; </p><p>However, this <u><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14631830\">metareview</a></u> found that various coronaviruses remained infectious for days at room temperature on certain surfaces (cardboard was not tested, alas) and potentially weeks at lower temperatures. The CDC&#x2019;s answer is probably correct for packages <em>from China</em>, and it&#x2019;s possible it&#x2019;s even right for domestic packages with 2-day shipping, but it is incorrect to say that coronaviruses in general have low survivability, and to the best of my ability to determine, we don&#x2019;t have the experiments that would prove deliveries are safe.</p><h2>Blinded Itself to Community Spread</h2><p>As late as 2020-02-29, the CDC was reporting that there had been no &#x201C;community spread&#x201D; of SARS-CoV-2. (Community spread means that the person hadn&#x2019;t been traveling in an infected area or associating with someone who had). At this time, the CDC would only test a person for SARS-CoV-2 <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1224043385960435713\">if they had been in China or in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case</a></u>. </p><p>Testing Criteria as of <u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200211025718/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html\">2020-02-11</a></u></p><p><figure><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mpDlCtBVHV6ddlGSf_1JQOTFynZZb__PIh4QajH-SuN4JxkSOmWdbz2RZP1CPyjKrYKrUygyPlbzDwE2_um7zUQjsmlVwlJM9rAaZSpBPbixlcwCao0Z25NEx8wl9jUGBhUi9q4t\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:624%\"></figure></p><p>This not only left them incapable of detecting community spread, it ignored potential cases who had travelled to other countries with known COVID-19 outbreaks.</p><p>By <u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200213123640/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html\">2020-02-13</a></u>, this had been amended to include </p><blockquote>The criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation.

Normally private testing would fill the gap, but the department of Health and Human Services invoked emergency measures that created a requirement for special approval of tests, and the FDA didn&#x2019;t grant it to anyone (<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1224042220665307137\">source</a></u>). </p><p>There are multiple harrowing stories of people with obvious symptoms and exposure to the virus being turned away from testing, often against a doctor&#x2019;s pleas:</p><ul><li><u><a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/484903-cdc-declined-to-test-new-coronavirus-patient-for-days-california-hospital\">UC Davis patient</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/02/coronavirus-new-york-city-doctor-has-to-plead-to-test-people.html\">NYC ER doctor complains about inability to test</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-man-denied-coronavirus-test-japan-trip-fever-cough-2020-3\">NYC man returning from Japan</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://act.nationalnursesunited.org/page/-/files/graphics/NU-Quarantine-RN-press-conf-statement.pdf\">Northern California nurse who treated infected patient</a></u></li></ul><p>There is also a <u><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/03/washington-state-risks-seeing-explosion-in-coronavirus-without-dramatic-action-new-analysis-says/\">rumor</a></u> that the first case caught in Seattle, which has since turned into the <u><a href=\"https://plague.com/\">US epicenter of the disease</a></u>, was caught by a research lab using a loophole to perform unauthorized testing (raising the possibility that it&#x2019;s worse elsewhere and simply hasn&#x2019;t been caught).</p><h2>Ceased to Report Number of Tests Run</h2><p>Until 2020-03-02, the CDC reported how many tests SARS-CoV-2 tests it had run. On March 2nd, it stopped (<u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200302100135/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html\">before</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200302222137/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html\">after</a></u>). There are many potential reasons for this, none of which inspire confidence. The official reason for this <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1234872230426755073\">as told to</a></u> reporter Kelsey Piper is that the number would no longer be representative now that states are running their own tests. So, best case scenario, the CDC can not coordinate enough to count tests performed by other labs. </p><h2>Gave False Reassurances About Recovered Individuals</h2><p>As of this writing (<u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200305134343/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html\">2020-03-05</a></u>), the CDC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Share Facts&#x201D; page states that &#x201C;Someone who has completed quarantine or has been released from isolation does not pose a risk of infection to other people.&#x201D;</p><p>While it is certainly true that being released from quarantine implies a significantly reduced risk, the quarantine that is typically performed is not stringent enough to say that people released pose no risk. The quarantine procedure <u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200305183724/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6909e1.htm?s_cid=mm6909e1_w\">performed by the CDC</a></u> lasts 14 days, after which if symptoms have not appeared, they can be released. </p><p>There are case reports of individuals with incubation periods of <u><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-incubation/coronavirus-incubation-could-be-as-long-as-27-days-chinese-provincial-government-says-idUSKCN20G06W\">27 days</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028\">19 days</a></u>. There was a case in Texas where a person <u><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/cdc-released-a-woman-in-texas-who-tested-positive-for-the-coronavirus-totally-unacceptable.html\">tested positive after being released from quarantine and visiting a mall</a></u>.</p><p>While an epidemic is still contained, safely quarantining at-risk people means choosing a quarantine period long enough to be confident that, if they haven&apos;t shown symptoms, they don&apos;t have the disease. When a disease is still contained, this should be risk averse, since a single infected person could start an outbreak. The CDC&apos;s 14-day quarantine period was not long enough to catch the cases detailed above.</p><p>This was foreseeable. <u><a href=\"https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062\">This paper</a></u>, published Feb 6, estimated the distribution of incubation periods, including the incubation periods of outliers.</p><p><strong><figure><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xtllBEC9XEtNLL6yYpnA-qo_v-VxRZMzh-oomiFwpo1xhBqOsxCthdmYcPt-qHvygQrgioUTIY9fnOiWZxesXWMGp1tGFs1edWi4rN4x-qgRBk3vdXT0BMI876YXchjZ5h-8laQC\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:422%\"></figure></strong></p><p>The relevant row is the 99th percentile row, which estimates the longest incubation period per 100 people. If you quarantined 100 people, one of them would have an incubation period at least that long. The paper estimates this using three different methods; two of those estimates are greater than 14 days, and all three estimates put significant probability on incubation periods longer than 14 days.</p><p>There are also <u><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-reinfection-explainer/explainer-coronavirus-reappears-in-discharged-patients-raising-questions-in-containment-fight-idUSKCN20M124?utm_source=reddit.com\">reports</a></u> of the virus re-emerging in patients who were believed to have recovered.</p><h2>Conflated Genetics and Environmental Exposure</h2><p>This is a tough topic to write about.</p><p>Cruelty to people because they have or might have a disease is never okay. And the vast majority of people who were cruel to Asian-appearing people in the early days of an epidemic were doing it to healthy people out of knee jerk fear and antagonism, not a measured, well-informed cost-benefit analysis. When the CDC claimed on <u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200229164715/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html\">2020-02-29</a></u> that  &quot;People of Asian descent, including Chinese Americans, are not more likely to get COVID-19 than any other American.&quot; they were surely trying to dampen attacks on people who had done nothing wrong and were hurting no one.</p><p>But the statement is false. Chinese-Americans are more likely to travel to China or associate with people who have, and thus were more likely to catch SARS-CoV-2. This doesn&#x2019;t mean they are more likely to catch it <em>given exposure</em>, but they were more likely to be exposed.</p><p>The CDC admits this in the page specifically on stigma (<u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200224023250/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/related-stigma.html\">2020-02-24</a></u>), saying &#x201C;People&#x2014;including those of Asian descent&#x2014;who have not recently traveled to China or been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 are not at greater risk of acquiring and spreading COVID-19 than other Americans.&#x201D;  </p><p>However that same anti-stigma page goes on to say &#x201C;Viruses cannot target people from specific populations, ethnicities, or racial backgrounds.&#x201D; This is also false. About 10% of Europeans are <u><a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/03/050325234239.htm\">immune to HIV</a></u>, an immunity not found people originating from other areas. So we know it is technically possible for a virus to have differential effects based on race.</p><p>Does SARS-CoV-2 in particular have race-related effects? There are people claiming Asian men are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than others due to a higher expression of a certain protein (<u><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0147-1?fbclid=IwAR1mwnPnSrcXLLselhmsCWB58nsxt9sy6nCojrHlvxGx2Su8_Owy1HCgSsQ\">example</a></u>). Other people dispute this (<u><a href=\"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0258/v1/download\">example</a></u>). Right now it is very much an open question.</p><p>We can see why the CDC prioritized calming racially-motivated violence over fully explaining their confusion over an unanswered question. It might have been the highest-utility thing to do. But it is important to know that &#x201C;misrepresenting data in order to produce better actions from the public&#x201D; is a thing the CDC does.</p><h2>Discouraged Use of Masks</h2><p>Which brings us to the CDC&#x2019;s <u><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200303041220/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html\">statement on masks</a></u>:</p><p>CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.</p><p>The Surgeon General (who is not directly part of the CDC) takes a stronger tack:</p><p><figure><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/peAWwgY427hFv-yMU09amqsa1t8-25dDfofhf_Psh2N-ZjjfJSBuC_Y_9SZLu2g4e5Vgyzr8vVuGhLFWJsv7Av9ojv7c-HF7_XItxHIEMLd56pMjDkR39NNHFXxxROXqOAzIBvc6\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:456%\"></figure></p><p>While we can&#x2019;t hold the CDC responsible for the Surgeon General, they are being conflated in a lot of news articles saying or implying that masks are useless for healthy people. <u><a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181b9e8b3\">They&#x2019;re (probably) not</a></u>.</p><p>Our best guess is that the CDC is trying to conserve masks for health care professionals and others with the highest need, in the face of a looming mask shortage. That could easily be the optimum mask allocation. I can&#x2019;t prove the lie wasn&#x2019;t justified for the greater good. But it is another example of the CDC placing &#x201C;getting the outcome it wants&#x201D; over &#x201C;telling people the literal truth.&#x201D;</p><h1>What Does This Mean?</h1><p>These errors we&#x2019;ve highlighted tend towards errors of omission: saying something is completely safe when it&#x2019;s not, saying something is unhelpful when it is, saying the current state is less dangerous than it is. You should include that bias when processing new information from the CDC. Notably <strong>we&#x2019;re not saying any of the things they do recommend are bad</strong>: to the best of our knowledge, you should be washing your hands and not touching your face. Vaccines are (mostly) great. But I would not take the CDC saying an activity is safe or unnecessary as the last word on the subject.</p>",

This can be done individually with regular thermometers, or on entire crowds with infrared cameras. Fever screening has been widely deployed against COVID-19, especially in China, since fever is its most common and often chronologically first symptom.</p><p>Fever screening applies an evolutionary pressure on pathogens to not cause fever, or to cause fever later relative to when it becomes transmissible. Pathogens mutate. In many diseases, this results in drug resistance; antibiotics, for example, lose effectiveness over time.</p><p>Drug resistance evolves slowly, because partial resistance is only a slight benefit to a pathogen which acquires it; most patients who receive antibiotics do not infect anyone after their treatment has started. Evasion of public-health screening procedures, on the other hand, is likely to evolve much faster, because any incremental improvement in a pathogen's ability to evade screening will give it a large advantage.</p><h2>Evidence This Is Already Happening</h2><p>I searched for papers recording the percentage of patients which had a fever in Google Scholar and in the citations on <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-symptoms/\">this page</a>. For each paper, I extracted the percentage of patients reported to have a fever, and the date range of cases covered by the data. If the paper did not state the date range of cases, I wrote down the paper's publication date instead. I excluded papers which didn't report a percentage of patients with fever, or had n&lt;20.</p><p>I found seven studies, listed below sorted by end date.</p><p>Dec 16-Jan 2: <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\">98%</a><br>Jan 1-20: <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext\">83%</a><br>Jan 1-28: <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044?guestAccessKey=f61bd430-07d8-4b86-a749-bec05bfffb65\">98.6%</a><br>Jan 6-31: <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/29/2020.02.26.20028084.full.pdf\">58.3%</a><br>Pub.

This is what you would expect if COVID-19 were evolving to evade fever screening; however, it could also be explained by later studies finding earlier and less-severe cases. This is weak evidence compared to the what could obtained by someone with access to a good dataset; these papers come from different sample populations and different points in the disease progression, and don't all specify what their cutoff temperature was for diagnosing fever. If someone has access to a suitable dataset, I ask that they do the analysis and publicly state whether they see a declining rate of fever.</p><h2>Other Properties Will Likely Also Change</h2><p>It is well known that most diseases evolve to become less severe over time, because patients with severe cases are easier to detect and will take greater precautions. However, this takes place on very slow time scales. Evading fever screening, on the other hand, involves greater selective pressure and so may happen on a faster time scale, possibly fast enough to significantly influence the shape of the pandemic this year.</p><p>I don't know how fever-screening evasion relates to disease severity; I can see plausible mechanisms by which this would make it either increase or decrease.</p></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Under normal circumstances, in a few days we would gather together to celebrate the festival of Purim. We celebrate by reading together the megillah. It tells a timeless story for every generation about standing up and avoiding death.</p>\n<p>Since, as we all know, the whole megillah is a long megillah, I will suggest this shortened version that I think today’s people of all beliefs can relate to.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, there was an incompetent ruler of a great land, largely indifferent to the needs of his people, whose legitimacy was questioned by many. We are introduced to him because he gets mad at his wife and decides to select a new younger and prettier one by having women engage in competitions to show off their beauty before a mass audience, and picks one that catches his eye.</p>\n<p>The administration is super racist and seems to have as its central policy position that it should retain power, and everyone should bow down to it as often as possible. Otherwise feasts and honors seem to be its top priority.</p>\n<p>A grave threat then is endowed with great potential power in the land. One strong-willed person did not follow proper protective procedures, and now the threat has been unleashed and spreads through much of the population. It threatens mass death in the future, but as yet has not done much. Many of the actions needed to prevent this are made illegal. Those who can project into the future and think even a tiny bit see great devastation, but it is not too late to fight back and prevent most of it.</p>\n<p>One person, in particular, has information that needs to be better known and potentially the power to contain the threat before it is too late.</p>\n<p>This person is implored to speak up. Alas, this person is silent, because the authorities had not given explicit permission to speak or even enter their presence. There was great fear that there would be grave social retaliation if social norms were broken.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, across the land, for three days, people were asked to help fight this tragedy by sharing their thoughts and prayers. This is the only thing that they are known to have done. As far as we know they at most took nominal actions to guard their own personal safety, but mostly carried on business as usual.</p>\n<p>Finally, courage allowed this person to speak truth to power. The threat was out there, and those who foolishly and spitefully allowed things to get this far lacked the power to reverse that decision.</p>\n<p>Luckily, it was not too late. The people were given permission to take action and fight back!</p>\n<p>The people rose up, did battle and vanquished the threat for the time being. It was doomed to remain endemic and periodically attempt to kill us again.</p>\n<p>Then they celebrated, power was passed to more competent administration that cared about the land and its people, and taxes were raised.</p>\n<p>Thus, we continue to tell the story, so that we will always remember, never bow down or refuse to speak up or defend ourselves. So each year we have an excuse to gather, eat and be merry, to tell a one-sided story and during the telling boo the names of the political enemies that hate us and that we make no attempt to sympathize with or truly understand.</p>\n<p>And in this year’s context, maybe, just maybe, don’t have large indoor gatherings of people to eat communal food in a crowded space, and instead do this at home in some fashion, perhaps with a YouTube recording if you’re not up to a full reading, engage in social distancing, wash your damn hands, stop touching your damn face, and if you are in a position to do more than that, do even more.</p>\n<p>Happy Purim, everybody!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Imagine:</p><ul><li>Aerial is an aspiring artist who identifies as a free spirit.  She loves nothing more than manifest the images in her head onto the  page, but she experiences the exercises she is assigned in class  excruciating and dull. If she engaged with her classwork she could  develop the technical skills to more fully realise her visions, but by  merely following her impulses she remains at a plateau.</li><li>When Eli  reads a science article or claim, he tries to pay very close attention  of the potential motivations and bias of the author. However, he has  extremely strong political opinions, so inevitably applies much more  scrutiny to those claims he wants to disbelieve. This results in him  being further from the truth than if he had just ignored the issue of  bias altogether.</li><li>Valentine is an entrepreneur who has just  started his own company. He refuses to do anything because &#x201C;that is how  it is normally done&#x201D;, but insists on relying upon his own power of  reason. While he is right most of the time, he also picks a   decentralised leadership structure that none of his team has any  experience or knowledge of beyond reading a book. The resulting  inconsistency and lack of responsibility almost destroy the company.</li></ul><p>Of course, the presenting post/pre as a dichotomy provides a very  limited resolution. Skills are never completely mastered; there is  always always a higher level. This means that the pre/trans threshold is  somewhat arbitrary.</p><p>Nonetheless, many disagreements can be characterised as essentially  being over whether a particular stance is post/pre in relation to a  particular insight.

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>This is a follow-up to a <a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2020/03/05/a-critical-agential-account-of-free-will-causation-and-physics/\">previous post</a> on critical agentialism, to explore the straightforward decision-theoretic consequences. I call this subjective implication decision theory, since the agent is looking at the logical implications of their decision according to their beliefs.</p>\n<p>We already covered observable action-consequences. Since these are falsifiable, they have clear semantics in the ontology. So we will in general assume observable rewards, as in reinforcement learning, while leaving un-observable goals for later work.</p>\n<p>Now let's look at a sequence of decision theory problems. We will assume, as before, the existence of some agent that falsifiably believes itself to run on at least one computer, C.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/5-and-10\">5 and 10</a></h2>\n<p>Assume the agent is before a table containing a 5 dollar bill and a 10 dollar bill. The agent will decide which dollar bill to take. Thereafter, the agent will receive a reward signal: 5 if the 5 dollar bill is taken, and 10 if the 10 dollar bill is taken.</p>\n<p>The agent may have the following beliefs about action-consequences: \"If I take action 5, then I will get 5 reward. If I take action 10, then I will get 10 reward.\" These beliefs follow directly from the problem description. Notably, the beliefs include beliefs about actions that might not actually be taken; it is enough that these actions are <em>possible</em> that their consequences are falsifiable.</p>\n<p>Now, how do we translate these beliefs about action-consequences into decisions? The most straightforward way to do so is to select the policy that is believed to return the most reward. (This method is ambiguous under conditions of partial knowledge, though that is not a problem for 5 and 10).</p>\n<p>This method (which I will call \"subjective implication decision theory\") yields the action 10 in this case.</p>\n<p>This is all extremely straightforward. We directly translated the problem description into a set of beliefs about action consequences. And these beliefs, along with the rule of subjective causal decision theory, yield an optimal action.</p>\n<p>The difficulty of 5 and 10 comes when the problem is naturalized. The devil is in the details: <em>how</em> to naturalize the problem? The previous post examined a case of both external and internal physics, compatible with free will. There is no obvious obstacle to translating these physical beliefs to the 5 and 10 case: the dollar bills may be hypothesized to follow physical laws, as may the computer C.</p>\n<p>Realistically, the agent should assume that the proximate cause of the selection of the dollar bill is not their action, but C's action. Recall that the agent falsifiably believes it runs on C, in the sense that its observations/actions necessarily equal C's.</p>\n<p>Now, \"I run on C\" implies in particular: \"If I select 'pick up the 5 dollar bill' at time <em>t</em>, then C does. If I select 'pick up the 10 dollar bill' at time <em>t</em>, then C does.\" And the assumption that C controls the dollar bill implies: \"If C selects 'pick up the 5 dollar bill at time <em>t</em>', then the 5 dollar bill will be held at some time between <em>t</em> and <em>t</em>+<em>k</em>\", and also for the 10 dollar bill (for some <em>k</em> that is an upper bound of the time it takes for the dollar bill to be picked up). Together, these beliefs imply: \"If I select 'pick up the 5 dollar bill' at time <em>t</em>, then the 5 dollar bill will be held at some time between <em>t</em> and <em>t</em>+<em>k</em>\", and likewise for the 10 dollar bill. At this point, the agent's beliefs include ones quite similar to the ones in the non-naturalized case, and so subjective implication decision theory selects the 10 dollar bill.</p>\n<h2>Twin prisoner's dilemma</h2>\n<p>Consider an agent that believes itself to run on computer C. It also believes there is another computer, C', which has identical initial state and dynamics to C.</p>\n<p>Each computer will output an action; the agent will receive 10 reward if C' cooperates plus 1 reward if C defects (receiving 0 reward for defection).</p>\n<p>As in 5 and 10, the agent believes: \"If I cooperate, C cooperates. If I defect, C defects.\" However, this does not specify the behavior of C' as a function of the agent's action.</p>\n<p>It can be noted at this point that, because the agent believes C' has identical initial state and dynamics to C, the agent believes (falsifiably) that C' must output the same actions as C on each time step, <em>as long as</em> C and C' receive idential observations. Since, in this setup, observations are assumed to be equal <em>until</em> C receives the reward (with C' perhaps receiving a different reward), these beliefs imply: \"If I cooperate, C' cooperates. If I defect, C' defects\".</p>\n<p>In total we now have: \"If I cooperate, C and C' both cooperate. If I defect, C and C' both defect\". Thus the agent believes itself to be straightforwardly choosing between a total reward of 10 for cooperation, and a total of 1 reward for defection. And so subjective implication decision theory cooperates.</p>\n<p>Note that this comes apart from the conventional interpretation of CDT, which considers interventions on C's action, rather than on \"my action\". CDT's hypothesized intervention updates C but not C', as C and C' are physically distinct.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox\">Newcomb's problem</a></h2>\n<p>This is very much similar to twin prisoner's dilemma. The agent may falsifiably believe: \"The Predictor filled box A with $1,000,000 if and only if I will choose only box A.\" From here it is straightforward to derive that the agent believes: \"If I choose to take only box A, then I will have $1,000,000. If I choose to take both boxes, then I will have $1,000.\" Hence subjective CDT selects only box A.</p>\n<p>The usual dominance argument for selecting both boxes does not apply. The agent is not considering interventions on C's action, but rather on \"my action\", which is falsifiably predicted to be identical with C's action.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Counterfactual_mugging\">Counterfactual mugging</a></h2>\n<p>In this problem, a Predictor flips a coin; if the coin is heads, the Predictor asks the agent for $10 (and the agent may or may not give it); if the coin is tails, the Predictor gives the agent $1,000,000 iff the Predictor predicts the agent would have given $10 in the heads case.</p>\n<p>We run into a problem with translating this to a critical agential ontology. Since both branches don't happen in the same world, it is not possible to state the Predictor's accuracy as a falsifiable statement, as it relates two incompatible branches.</p>\n<p>To avoid this problem, we will say that the Predictor predicts the agent's behavior ahead of time, before flipping the coin. This prediction is not told to the agent in the heads case.</p>\n<p>Now, the agent falsifiably believes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the coin is heads, then the Predictor's prediction is equal to my choice.</li>\n<li>If the coin is tails, then I get $1,000,000 if the Predictor's prediction is that I'd give $10, otherwise $0.</li>\n<li>If the coin is heads, then I get $0 if I don't give the predictor $10, and -$10 if I do give the predictor $10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the last point, it is possible to show that, after the agent observes heads, the agent believes they get $0 if they don't give $10, and -$10 if they do give $10. So subjective implication decision theory doesn't pay.</p>\n<p>This may be present a dynamic inconsistency in that the agent's decision does not agree with what they would previously have wished they would decide. Let us examine this.</p>\n<p>In a case where the agent chooses their action before the coin flip, the agent believes that, if they will pay up, the Predictor will predict this, and likewise for not paying up. Therefore, the agent believes they will get $1,000,000 if they decide to pay up and then the coin comes up tails.</p>\n<p>If the agent weights the heads/tails branches evenly, then the agent will decide to pay up. This presents a dynamic inconsistency.</p>\n<p>My sense is that this inconsistency should be resolved by considering <a href=\"https://opentheory.net/2018/09/a-new-theory-of-open-individualism/\">theories of identity</a> other than closed individualism. That is, it seems possible that the abstraction of receiving an observation and taking on action on each time step, while having a linear lifetime, is not a good-enough fit for the counterfactual mugging problem to achieve dynamic consistency.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It seems that subjective implication decision theory agrees with <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Timeless_decision_theory\">timeless decision theory</a> and evidential decision theory on the problems considered, while diverging from causal decision theory and functional decision theory.</p>\n<p>I consider this a major advance, in that the ontology is more cleanly defined than the ontology of timeless decision theory, which considers interventions on logical facts. It is not at all clear what it means to \"intervene on a logical fact\"; the ontology of logic does not natively contain the affordance of intervention. The motivation for considering logical interventions was the belief that the agent is identical with some computation, such that its actions are logical facts. Critical agential ontology, on the other hand, does not say the agent is identical with any computation, but rather than the agent effectively runs on some computer (which implements some computation), while still being metaphysically distinct. Thus, we need not consider \"logical counterfactuals\" directly; rather, we consider subjective implications, and consider whether these subjective implications are consistent with the agent effectively running on some computer.</p>\n<p>To handle cases such as counterfactual mugging in a dynamically consistent way (similar to functional decision theory), I believe that it will be necessary to consider agents outside the closed-individualist paradigm, in which one is assumed to have a linear lifetime with memory and observations/actions on each time step. However, I have not proceeded exploring in this direction yet.</p>\n<p>[ED NOTE: After the time of writing I realized subjective implication decision theory, being very similar to <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/UDTSearchOrder.pdf\">proof-based UDT</a>, has problems with spurious counterfactuals by default, but can similarly avoid these problems by \"playing chicken with the universe\", i.e. taking some action it has proven it will not take.]</p>\n</body></html>",

But they seem open to taking supplements.  So I'm trying to figure out what to recommend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/12/11/preventing-respiratory-tract-infections/\">This 2017 post</a> from Sarah Constantin on the prevention of respiratory tract infections says, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bacterial immunostimulants are safe and effective in preventing respiratory infections, cutting the risk of infection by 40-50%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>However</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/\">this article</a> from National Geographic implies that COVID-19 may kill through immune hyper-reactivity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...what actually happens to your body when it is infected by the coronavirus? The new strain is so genetically similar to SARS that it has inherited the title SARS-CoV-2. So combining early research on the new outbreak with past lessons from SARS and MERS can provide an answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization reported that the disease typically attacked the lungs in three phases: viral replication, immune hyper-reactivity, and pulmonary destruction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response,” Frieman says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This suggests just the opposite: that you want to suppress the immune system, not boost it.</p>\n<p>I remembered reading somewhere that immunocompromised populations have a greater mortality rate from COVID-19.  If true, this suggests that immunosuppression could be harmful?  I tried to figure out whether the immunocompromise claim is based in fact or not.  The recent <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\">WHO report</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include people aged over 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While patients who reported no comorbid conditions had a CFR of 1.4%, patients with comorbid conditions had much higher rates: 13.2% for those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not clear how I should interpret these figures.  For example, quick online research seems to indicate that diabetic subjects are more susceptible to infections (suggesting immunocompromise) but also that diabetes (esp. Type 1) could be considered an autoimmune disease (so higher mortality among diabetics could be due to the immune system attacking the body even harder than normal).</p>\n<p>In any case, my extremely preliminary guess is you should take immunostimulants (with a short half-life) on an ongoing basis in order to try &amp; prevent COVID-19 infection.  And if you get it, hopefully your case is one of the ~82% which doesn't ever progress beyond mild symptoms.  BUT you should prefer immunosuppressants if your case is reaching the immune hyper-reactivity stage (phase 2 from the National Geographic article).  However, I wish someone who actually knows about this stuff would check my work, and I welcome any critiques.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>Outline:</p><ul><li>The first three sections (Don Norman’s Fridge, Interface Design, and When And Why Is It Hard?) cover what we mean by “interface”, what it looks like for interfaces to be scarce, and the kinds of areas where they tend to be scarce.</li><li>The next four sections apply these ideas to various topics:</li><ul><li>Why AR is much more difficult than VR</li><li>AI alignment from an interface-design perspective</li><li>Good interfaces as a key bottleneck to creation of markets</li><li>Cross-department interfaces in organizations</li></ul></ul><h2>Don Norman’s Fridge</h2><p>Don Norman (known for popularizing the term “affordance” in <u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded-ebook/dp/B00E257T6C\">The Design of Everyday Things</a></u>) offers a story about the temperature controls on his old fridge:</p><blockquote>I used to own an ordinary, two-compartment refrigerator - nothing very fancy about it. The problem was that I couldn’t set the temperature properly. There were only two things to do: adjust the temperature of the freezer compartment and adjust the temperature of the fresh food compartment. And there were two controls, one labeled “freezer”, the other “refrigerator”. What’s the problem?</blockquote><blockquote>Oh, perhaps I’d better warn you. The two controls are not independent. The freezer control also affects the fresh food temperature, and the fresh food control also affects the freezer.</blockquote><p>The natural human model of the refrigerator is: there’s two compartments, and we want to control their temperatures independently. Yet the fridge, apparently, does not work like that. Why not? Norman:</p><blockquote>In fact, there is only one thermostat and only one cooling mechanism. One control adjusts the thermostat setting, the other the relative proportion of cold air sent to each of the two compartments of the refrigerator.</blockquote><p>It’s not hard to imagine why this would be a good design for a cheap fridge: it requires only one cooling mechanism and only one thermostat. Resources are saved by not duplicating components - at the cost of confused customers.</p><p>The root problem in this scenario is a mismatch between the structure of the machine (one thermostat, adjustable allocation of cooling power) and the structure of what-humans-want (independent temperature control of two compartments). In order to align the behavior of the fridge with the behavior humans want, somebody, at some point, needs to do the work of translating between the two structures. In Norman’s fridge example, the translation is botched, and confusion results.</p><p>We’ll call whatever method/tool is used for translating between structures an interface. Creating good methods/tools for translating between structures, then, is interface design.</p><h2>Interface Design</h2><p>In programming, the analogous problem is <em>API design</em>: taking whatever data structures are used by a software tool internally, and figuring out how to present them to external programmers in a useful, intelligible way. If there’s a mismatch between the internal structure of the system and the structure of what-users-want, then it’s the API designer’s job to translate. A “good” API is one which handles the translation well.</p><p>User interface design is a more general version of the same problem: take whatever structures are used by a tool internally, and figure out how to present them to external users in a useful, intelligible way. Conceptually, the only difference from API design is that we no longer assume our users are programmers interacting with the tool via code. We design the interface to fit however people use it - that could mean <u><a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/ux-101-norman-doors-c85231fe7adb\">handles on doors</a></u>, or buttons and icons in a mobile app, or the temperature knobs on a fridge.</p><p>Economically, interface design is a necessary input to make all sorts of things economically useful. How scarce is that input? How much are people willing to spend for good interface design?</p><p>My impression is: a lot. There’s an entire category of tech companies whose business model is:</p><ul><li>Find a software tool or database which is very useful but has a bad interface</li><li>Build a better interface to the same tool/database</li><li>…</li><li>Profit</li></ul><p>This is an especially common pattern among small but profitable software companies; it’s the sort of thing where a small team can build a tool and then lock in a small number of very loyal high-paying users. It’s a good value prop - you go to people or businesses who need to use X, but find it a huge pain, and say “here, this will make it much easier to use X”. Some examples:</p><ul><li>Companies which interface to government systems to provide tax services, travel visas, patenting, or business licensing</li><li>Companies which set up websites, Salesforce, corporate structure, HR services, or shipping logistics for small business owners with little relevant expertise</li><li>Companies which provide graphical interfaces for data, e.g. website traffic, sales funnels, government contracts, or market fundamentals</li></ul><p>Even bigger examples can be found outside of tech, where humans themselves serve as an interface. Entire industries consist of people serving as interfaces.</p><p>What does this look like? It’s the entire industry of tax accountants, or contract law, or lobbying. It’s any industry where you could just do it yourself in principle, but the system is complicated and confusing, so it’s useful to have an expert around to translate the things-you-want into the structure of the system.</p><p>In some sense, the entire field of software engineering is an example. A software engineer’s primary job is to translate the things-humans-want into a language understandable by computers. People use software engineers because talking to the engineer (difficult though that may be) is an easier interface than an empty file in Jupyter.</p><p>These are not cheap industries. Lawyers, accountants, lobbyists, programmers… these are experts in complicated systems, and they get paid accordingly. The world spends large amounts of resources using people as interfaces - indicating that these kinds of interfaces are a very scarce resource.</p><h2>When And Why Is It Hard?</h2><p>Don Norman’s work is full of interesting examples and general techniques for accurately communicating the internal structure of a tool to users - the classic example is “handle means pull, flat plate means push” on a door. At this point, I think (at least some) people have a pretty good understanding of these techniques, and they’re spreading over time. But accurate communication of a system’s internal structure is only useful if the system’s internal structure is itself pretty simple - like a door or a fridge. If I want to, say, write a contract, then I need to interface to the system of contract law; accurately communicating that structure would take a <u><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Working-Contracts-Corporate-Securities-Library/dp/1402410603/\">whole book</a></u>, even just to summarize key pieces.</p><p>There are lots of systems which are simple enough that accurate communication is the bulk of the problem of interface design - this includes most everyday objects (like fridges), as well as most websites or mobile apps.</p><p>But the places where we see expensive industries providing interfaces - like law or software - are usually the cases where the underlying system is more complex. These are cases where the structure of what-humans-want is very different from the system’s structure, and translating between the two requires study and practice. Accurate communication of the system’s internal structure is not enough to make the problem easy.</p><p>In other words: interfaces to complex systems are especially scarce. This economic constraint is very taut, across a number of different areas. We see entire industries - large industries - whose main purpose is to provide non-expert humans with an interface to a particular complex system.</p><p>Given that interfaces to complex systems are a scarce resource in general, what other predictions would we make? What else would we expect to be hard/expensive, as a result of interfaces to complex systems being hard/expensive?</p><h2>AR vs VR</h2><p>By the standards of software engineering, pretty much anything in the real world is complex. Interfacing to the real world means we don’t get to choose the ontology - we can make up a bunch of object types and data structures, but the real world will not consider itself obligated to follow them. The internal structure of computers or programming languages is rarely a perfect match to the structure of the real world.</p><p>Interfacing the real world to computers, then, is an area we’d expect to be difficult and expensive.</p><p>Augmented reality (AR) is one area where I expect this to be keenly felt, especially compared to VR. I expect AR applications to lag dramatically behind full virtual reality, in terms of both adoption and product quality. I expect AR will mostly be used in stable, controlled environments - e.g. factory floors or escape-room-style on-location games.</p><p>Why is interfacing software with the real world hard? Some standard answers:</p><ul><li>The real world is complicated. This is a cop-out answer which doesn’t actually explain anything.</li><li>The real world has lots of edge cases. This is also a cop-out, but more subtly; the real world will only seem to be full of edge cases if our program’s ontologies don’t line up well with reality. The real question: why is it hard to make our ontologies line up well with reality?</li></ul><p>Some more interesting answers:</p><ul><li>The real world isn’t implemented in Python. To the extent that the real world has a language, that language is math. As software needs to interface more with the real world, it’s going to require more math - as we see in data science, for instance - and not all of that math will be easy to black-box and hide behind an API.</li><li>The real world is only partially observable - even with ubiquitous sensors, we can’t query anything anytime the way we can with e.g. a database. Explicitly modelling things we can’t directly observe will become more important over time, which means more reliance on probability and ML tools (though I don’t think black-box methods or “programming by example” will expand beyond niche applications).</li><li>We need enough compute to actually run all that math. In practice, I think this constraint is less taut than it first seems - we should generally be able to perform at least as well as a human without brute-forcing exponentially hard problems. That said, we do still need efficient algorithms.</li><li>The real-world things we are interested in are abstract, high-level objects. At this point, we don’t even have the mathematical tools to work with these kinds of fuzzy abstractions.</li><li>We don’t directly control the real world. Virtual worlds can be built to satisfy various assumptions by design; the real world can’t.</li><li>Combining the previous points: we don’t have good ways to represent our models of the real world, or to describe what we want in the real world.</li><li>Software engineers are mostly pretty bad at describing what they want and building ontologies which line up with the real world. These are hard skills to develop, and few programmers explicitly realize that they need to develop them.</li></ul><h2>Alignment</h2><p>Continuing the discussion from the previous section, let’s take the same problems in a different direction. We said that translating what-humans-want-in-the-real-world into a language usable by computers is hard/expensive. That’s basically the AI alignment problem. Does the interfaces-as-scarce-resource view lend any interesting insight there?</p><p>First, this view immediately suggests some simple analogues for the AI alignment problem. The “Norman’s fridge alignment problem” is one - it’s surprisingly difficult to get a fridge to do what we want, when the internal structure of the fridge doesn’t match the structure of what we want. Now consider the internal structure of, say, a neural network - how well does that match the structure of what we want? It’s not hard to imagine that a neural network would run into a billion-times-more-difficult version of the fridge alignment problem.</p><p>Another analogue is the “Ethereum alignment problem”: we can code up a smart contract to give monetary rewards for anything our code can recognize. Yet it’s still difficult to specify a contract for exactly the things we actually want. This is essentially the AI alignment problem, except we use a market in place of an ML-based predictor/optimizer. One interesting corollary of the analogy: there are already economic incentives to find ways of aligning a generic predictor/optimizer. That’s exactly the problem faced by smart contract writers, and by other kinds of contract writers/issuers in the economy. How strong are those incentives? What do the rewards for success look like - are smart contracts only a small part of the economy because the rewards are meager, or because the problems are hard? More discussion of the topic in the next section.</p><p>Moving away from analogues of alignment, what about alignment paths/strategies?</p><p>I think there’s a plausible (though not very probable) path to general artificial intelligence in which:</p><ul><li>We figure out various core theoretical problems, e.g. <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ehnG4mseKF6xALmQy\">abstraction</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703754b3/stable-pointers-to-value-an-agent-embedded-in-its-own-utility-function\">pointers to values</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/Rm6oQRJJmhGCcLvxh/p/zcPLNNw4wgBX5k8kQ\">embedded decision theory</a></u>, …</li><li>The key theoretical insights are incorporated into new programming languages and frameworks</li><li>Programmers can more easily translate what-they-want-in-the-real-world into code, and make/use models of the world which better line up with the structure of reality</li><li>… and this creates a smooth-ish path of steadily-more-powerful declarative programming tools which eventually leads to full AGI</li></ul><p>To be clear, I don't see a complete roadmap yet for this path; the list of theoretical problems is not complete, and a lot of progress would be needed in non-agenty mathematical modelling as well. But even if this path isn’t smooth or doesn’t run all the way to AGI, I definitely see a lot of economic pressure for this sort of thing. We are economically bottlenecked on our ability to describe what we want to computers, and anything which relaxes that bottleneck will be very valuable.</p><h2>Markets and Contractability</h2><p>The previous section mentioned the Ethereum alignment problem: we can code up a smart contract to give monetary rewards for anything our code can recognize, yet it’s still difficult to specify a contract for exactly the things we actually want. More generally, it’s hard to create contracts which specify what we want well enough that they can’t be gamed.</p><p>(Definitional note: I’m using “contract” here in the broad sense, including pretty much any arrangement for economic transactions - e.g. by eating in a restaurant you implicitly agree to pay the bill later, or boxes in a store implicitly agree to contain what they say on the box. At least in the US, these kinds of contracts are legally binding, and we can sue if they’re broken.)</p><p>A full discussion of contract specification goes way beyond interfaces - it’s basically the whole field of <u><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Economics-Contracts-Primer-2nd-Press/dp/0262534223/\">contract theory and mechanism design</a></u>, and encompasses things like adverse selection, signalling, moral hazard, incomplete contracts, and so forth. All of these are techniques and barriers to writing a contract when we <em>can’t</em> specify exactly what we want. But why can’t we specify exactly what we want in the first place? And what happens when we can?</p><p>Here’s a good example where we can specify exactly what we want: buying gasoline. The product is very standardized, the measures (liters or gallons) are very standardized, so it’s very easy to say “I’m buying X liters of type Y gas at time and place Z” - existing standards will fill in the remaining ambiguity. That’s a case where the structure of the real world is not too far off from the structure of what-we-want - there’s a nice clean interface. Not coincidentally, this product has a very liquid <em>market</em>: many buyers/sellers competing over price of a standardized good. Standard efficient-market economics mostly works.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, here’s an example where it’s very hard to specify exactly what we want: employing people for intellectual work. <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YABJKJ3v97k9sbxwg/what-money-cannot-buy\">It’s hard to outsource expertise</a></u> - often, a non-expert doesn’t even know how to tell a job well done from sloppy work. This is a natural consequence of using an expert as an interface to a complicated system. As a result, it’s hard to standardize products, and there’s not a very liquid market. Rather than efficient markets, we have to fall back on the tools of contract theory and mechanism design - we need ways of verifying that the job is done well without being able to just specify exactly what we want.</p><p>In the worst case, the tools of contract theory are insufficient, and we may not be able to form a contract at all. The lemon problem is an example: a seller may have a good used car, and a buyer may want to buy a good used car, but there’s no (cheap) way for the seller to prove to the buyer that the car isn’t a lemon - so there’s no transaction. If we could fully specify everything the buyer wants from the car, and the seller could visibly verify that every box is checked, cheaply and efficiently, then this wouldn’t be an issue.</p><p>The upshot of all this is that <em>good interfaces</em> - tools for translating the structure of the real world into the structure of what-we-want, and vice versa - enable efficient markets. They enable buying and selling with minimal overhead, and they avoid the expense and complexity of contract-theoretic tools.</p><p>Create a good interface for specifying what-people-want within some domain, and you’re most of the way to creating a market.</p><h2>Interfaces in Organizations</h2><p>Accurately communicating what we want is hard. Programmers and product designers are especially familiar with this:</p><p></p><figure><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hyShz2ABiKX56j5tJ/ejddsdrbml4llrttvg4x\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:624%\"></figure><p></p><p>Incentives are a problem sometimes (obviously don’t trust ads or salespeople), but even mostly-earnest communicators - customers, project managers, designers, engineers, etc - have a hard time explaining things. In general, people don’t understand which aspects are most relevant to other specialists, or often even which aspects are most relevant to themselves. A designer will explain to a programmer the parts which seem most design-relevant; a programmer will pay attention to the parts which seem most programming-relevant.</p><p>It’s not just that the structure of what-humans-want doesn’t match the structure of the real world. It’s that the structure of how-human-specialists-see-the-world varies between different specialists. Whenever two specialists in different areas need to convey what-they-want from one to the other, somebody/something has to do the work of translating between structures - in other words, we need an interface.</p><p>A particularly poignant example from several years ago: I overheard a designer and an engineer discuss a minor change to a web page. It went something like this:</p><p>Designer: \"Ok, I want it just like it was before, but put this part at the top.\"</p><p>Engineer: \"Like this?\"</p><p>Designer: \"No, I don't want everything else moved down. Just keep everything else where it was, and put this at the top.\"</p><p>Engineer: \"But putting that at the top pushes everything else down.\"</p><p>Designer: \"It doesn't need to. Look, just...\"</p><p>... this went on for about 30 minutes, with steadily increasing frustration on both sides, and steadily increasing thumping noises from my head hitting the desk.</p><p>It turned out that the designer's tools built everything from the bottom of the page up, while the engineer's tools built everything from top down. So from the designer's perspective, \"put this at the top\" did not require moving anything else. But from the engineer's perspective, \"put this at the top\" meant everything else had to get pushed down.</p><p>Somebody/something has to do the translation work. It’s a two-sided interface problem.</p><p>Handling these sorts of problems is a core function for managers and for anyone deciding how to structure an organization. It may seem silly to need to loop in, say, a project manager for every conversation between a designer and an engineer - but if the project manager’s job is to translate, then it can be useful. Remember, the example above was frustrating, but at least both sides <em>realized</em> they weren’t communicating successfully - if the <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sBBGxdvhKcppQWZZE/double-illusion-of-transparency\">double illusion of transparency</a></u> kicks in, problems can crop up without anybody even realizing.</p><p>This is why, in large organizations, people who can operate across departments are worth their weight in gold. Interfaces are a scarce resource; people who operate across departments can act as human interfaces, translating model-structures between groups.</p><p>A great example of this is the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act. It was intended to fix a lack of communication/coordination between branches of the US military. The basic idea was simple: nobody could be promoted to lieutenant or higher without first completing a “joint mission”, one in which they worked directly with members of other branches. People capable of serving as interfaces between branches were a scarce resource; Goldwater-Nichols introduced an incentive to create more such people. Before the bill’s introduction, top commanders of all branches argued against it; they saw it as congressional meddling. But after the first Iraq war, every one of them testified that it was the best thing to ever happen to the US military.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>The structure of things-humans-want does not always match the structure of the real world, or the structure of how-other-humans-see-the-world. When structures don’t match, someone or something needs to serve as an interface, translating between the two.</p><p>In simple cases, this is just user interface design - accurately communicating how-the-thing-works to users. But when the system is more complicated - like a computer or a body of law - we usually need human specialists to serve as interfaces. Such people are expensive; interfaces to complicated systems are a scarce resource.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>In <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/excerpts-from-a-larger-discussion-about-simulacra/\">Excerpts from a larger discussion about simulacra</a>, following Baudrillard, Jessica Taylor and I laid out a model of simulacrum levels with something of a fall-from grace feel to the story:</p><ol><li>First, words were used to maintain shared accounting. We described reality intersubjectively in order to build shared maps, the better to navigate our environment. I say that the food source is over there, so that our band can move towards or away from it when situationally appropriate, or so people can make other inferences based on this knowledge.</li><li>The breakdown of naive intersubjectivity - people start taking the shared map as an object to be manipulated, rather than part of their own subjectivity. For instance, I might say there&apos;s a lion over somewhere where I know there&apos;s food, in order to hoard access to that resource for idiosyncratic advantage. Thus, the map drifts from reality, and we start dissociating from the maps we make.</li><li>When maps drift far enough from reality, in some cases people aren&apos;t even parsing it as though it had a literal specific objective meaning that grounds out in some verifiable external test outside of social reality. Instead, the map becomes a sort of <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/actors-and-scribes-words-and-deeds/\">command language</a> for coordinating actions and feelings. &quot;There&apos;s food over there&quot; is construed and evaluated as a bid to move in that direction, and evaluated as such. Any argument for or against the implied call to action is conflated with an argument for or against the proposition literally asserted. This is how <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer\">arguments become soldiers</a>. Any attempt to simply investigate the literal truth of the proposition is considered at best naive and at worst politically irresponsible.<br>But since this usage is parasitic on the old map structure that was meant to describe something outside the system of describers, language is still structured in terms of reification and objectivity, so it substantively resembles something with descriptive power, or &quot;aboutness.&quot; For instance, while you cannot acquire a physician&#x2019;s privileges and social role simply by providing clear evidence of your ability to heal others, those privileges are still justified in terms of pseudo-consequentialist arguments about expertise in healing.</li><li>Finally, the pseudostructure itself becomes perceptible as an object that can be manipulated, the pseudocorrespondence breaks down, and all assertions are nothing but moves in an ever-shifting game where you&apos;re trying to think a bit ahead of the others (for positional advantage), but not too far ahead.</li></ol><p>There is some merit to this linear treatment, but it obscures an important structural feature: the resemblance of levels 1 and 3, and 2 and 4.&#xA0;</p><p>Another way to think about it, is that in levels 1 and 3, speech patterns are authentically part of our subjectivity. Just as babies are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence#Contradicting_evidence\">confused</a> if you show them something that violates their object permanence assumptions, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5JDkW4MYXit2CquLs/your-strength-as-a-rationalist\">a good rationalist is more confused by falsehood than by truth</a>, people operating at simulacrum level 3 are confused and disoriented if a load-bearing <em>social identity or relationship</em> is invalidated.</p><p>Likewise, levels 2 and 4 are similar in nature - they consist of nothing more than taking levels 1 and 3 respectively as object (i.e. something outside oneself to be manipulated) rather than as subject (part of one&apos;s own native machinery for understanding and navigating one&apos;s world). We might name the levels:</p><p>Simulacrum Level 1: Objectivity as Subject (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)\">objectivism</a>, or epistemic consciousness)</p><p>Simulacrum Level 2: Objectivity as Object (lying)</p><p>Simulacrum Level 3: Relating as Subject (power relation, or ritual magic)</p><p>Simulacrum Level 4: Relating as Object (chaos magic, hedge magic, postmodernity) [1]</p><p>I&apos;m not attached to these names and suspect we need better ones. But in any case this framework should make it clear that there are some domains where what we do with our communicative behavior is naturally &quot;level 3&quot; and not a degraded form of level 1, while in other domains level 3 behavior has to be a degenerate form of level 1.[2]</p><p>Much body language, for instance, doesn&apos;t have a plausibly objective interpretation, but is purely relational, even if evolutionary psychology can point to objective qualities we&apos;re sometimes thereby trying to signal. Sometimes we&apos;re just trying to <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/04/25/on-drama/\">stay in rhythm</a> with each other, or project good vibes.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><p>[1] Some chaos magicians have attempted to use the language of power relation (gods, rituals, etc) to reconstruct the rational relation between map and territory, e.g. Alan Moore&apos;s <em>Promethea</em>. The postmodern rationalist project, by contrast, involves constructing a model of relational and postrelational perspectives through rational epistemic means.</p><p>[2] A prepublication comment by Zack M. Davis that seemed pertinent enough to include:</p><blockquote><em>Maps that reflect the territory are level 1. Coordination games are &quot;pure&quot; level 3 (there&apos;s no &quot;right answer&quot;; we just want to pick strategies that fit together). When there are multiple maps that fit different aspects of the territory (political map vs. geographic map vs. globe, or different definitions of the same word), but we want to all use the SAME map in order to work together, then we have a coordination game on which map to use. To those who don&apos;t believe in non-social reality, attempts to improve maps (Level 1) just look like lobbying for a different coordination equilibrium (Level 4): &quot;God doesn&apos;t exist&quot; isn&apos;t a nonexistence claim about deities; it&apos;s a bid to undermine the monotheism coalition and give their stuff to the atheism coalition.</em><br><em><a href=\"http://unremediatedgender.space/2020/Jan/book-review-the-origins-of-unfairness/\">Book Review: Cailin O&apos;Connor&apos;s The Origins of Unfairness: Social Categories and Cultural Evolution</a></em><br><em><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/edEXi4SpkXfvaX42j/schelling-categories-and-simple-membership-tests\">Schelling Categories, and Simple Membership Tests</a></em></blockquote>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>This is an account of free choice in a physical universe. It is very much relevant to decision theory and philosophy of science. It is largely metaphysical, in terms of taking certain things to be basically real and examining what can be defined in terms of these things.</p>\n<p>The starting point of this account is critical and agential. By agential, I mean that the ontology I am using is from the point of view of an agent: a perspective that can, at the very least, receive observations, have cognitions, and take actions. By critical, I mean that this ontology involves uncertain conjectures subject to criticism, such as criticism of being logically incoherent or incompatible with observations. This is very much in a similar spirit to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_rationalism\">critical rationalism</a>.</p>\n<p>Close attention will be paid to falsifiability and refutation, principally for&nbsp;<em>ontological</em>&nbsp;purposes, and secondarily for epistemic purposes. Falsification conditions specify the meanings of laws and entities relative to the perspective of some potentially falsifying agent. While the agent may believe in unfalsifiable entities, falsification conditions will serve to precisely pin down that which can be precisely pinned down.</p>\n<p>I have only seen \"agential\" used in the philosophical literature in the context of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agential_realism\">agential realism</a>, a view I do not understand well enough to comment on. I was tempted to use \"subjective\"; however, while subjects have observations, they do not necessarily have the ability to take actions. Thus I believe \"agential\" has a more concordant denotation.</p>\n<p>You'll note that my notion of \"agent\" already assumes one can take actions. Thus, a kind of free will is taken as metaphysically basic. This presupposition may cause problems later. However, I will try to show that, if careful attention is paid, the obvious problems (such as contradiction with determinism) can be avoided.</p>\n<p>The perspective in this post can be seen as starting from agency, defining consequences in terms of agency, and defining physics in terms of consequences. In contrast, the most salient competing decision theory views (including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/\">framings</a>&nbsp;of CDT, EDT, and FDT) define agency in terms of consequences (\"expected utility maximization\"), and consequences in terms of physics (\"counterfactuals\"). So I am rebasing the ontological stack, turning it upside-down. This is less absurd than it first appears, as will become clear.</p>\n<p>(For simplicity, assume observations and actions are both symbols taken from some finite alphabet.)</p>\n<h2>Naive determinism</h2>\n<p>Let's first, within a critical agential ontology, disprove some very basic forms of determinism.</p>\n<p>Let A be some action. Consider the statement: \"I will take action A\". An agent believing this statement may falsify it by taking any action B not equal to A. Therefore, this statement does not hold as a law. It may be falsified at will.</p>\n<p>Let&nbsp;<em>f</em>() be some computable function returning an action. Consider the statement: \"I will take action&nbsp;<em>f</em>()\". An agent believing this statement may falsify it by taking an action B not equal to&nbsp;<em>f</em>(). Note that, since the agent is assumed to be able to compute things,&nbsp;<em>f</em>() may be determined. So, indeed, this statement does not hold as a law, either.</p>\n<p>This contradicts a certain strong formulation of naive determinism: the idea that one's action is necessarily determined by some known, computable function.</p>\n<h2>Action-consequences</h2>\n<p>But wait, what about physics? To evaluate what physical determinism even means, we need to translate physics into a critical agential ontology. However, before we turn to physics, we will first consider action-consequences, which are easier to reason about.</p>\n<p>Consider the statement: \"If I take action A, I will immediately there-after observe O.\" This statement is falsifiable, which means that if it is false, there is some policy the agent can adopt that will falsify it. Specifically, the agent may adopt the policy of taking action A. If the agent will, in fact, not observe O after taking this action, then the agent will learn this, falsifying the statement. So the statement is falsifiable.</p>\n<p>Finite conjunctions of falsifiable statements are themselves falsifiable. Therefore, the conjunction \"If I take action A, I will immediately there-after observe O; if I take action B, I will immediately there-after observe P\" is, likewise, falsifiable.</p>\n<p>Thus, the agent may have falsifiable beliefs about observable consequences of actions. This is a possible starting point for decision theory: actions having consequences is already assumed in the ontology of VNM utility theory.</p>\n<h2>Falsification and causation</h2>\n<p>Now, the next step is to account for physics. Luckily, the falsificationist paradigm was designed around demarcating scientific hypotheses, such that it naturally describes physics.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, falsificationism takes agency (in terms of observations, computation, and action) as more basic than physics. For a thing to be falsifiable, it must be&nbsp;<em>able</em> to be falsified by some agent, seeing some observation. And the word&nbsp;<em>able</em> implies freedom.</p>\n<p>Let's start with some basic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Logic_of_Scientific_Discovery\">Popperian logic</a>. Let&nbsp;<em>f</em>&nbsp;be some testable function (say, connected to a computer terminal) taking in a natural number and returning a Boolean. Consider the hypothesis: \"For all&nbsp;<em>x</em>,&nbsp;<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) is true\". This statement is falsifiable: if it's false, then there exists some action-sequence an agent can take (typing&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;into the terminal, one digit at a time) that will prove it to be false.</p>\n<p>The given hypothesis is a kind of scientific law. It specifies a regularity in the environment.</p>\n<p>Note that there is a \"bridge condition\" at play here. That bridge condition is that the function&nbsp;<em>f</em>&nbsp;is, indeed, connected to the terminal, such that the agent's observations of&nbsp;<em>f</em>&nbsp;are trustworthy. In a sense, the bridge condition specifies what&nbsp;<em>f</em>&nbsp;is, from the agent's perspective; it allows the agent to locate&nbsp;<em>f</em> as opposed to some other function.</p>\n<p>Let us now consider causal hypotheses. We already considered action-consequences. Now let us extend this analysis to reasoning about causation between external entities.</p>\n<p>Consider the hypothesis: \"If the match is struck, then it will alight immediately\". This hypothesis is falsifiable by an agent who is&nbsp;<em>able</em> to strike the match. If the hypothesis is false, then the agent may refute it by choosing to strike the match and then seeing the result. However, an agent who is unable to strike the match cannot falsify it. (Of course, this assumes the agent may see whether the match is alight after striking it)</p>\n<p>Thus, we are defining causality in terms of agency. The falsification conditions for a causal hypothesis refer to the agent's abilities. This seems somewhat wonky at first, but it is quite similar to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(book)\">Pearlian casuality</a>, which defines causation in terms of metaphysically-real interventions. This order of definition radically reframes the determinism vs. free will apparent paradox, by defining the conditions of determinism (causality) in terms of potential action.</p>\n<h2>External physics</h2>\n<p>Let us now continue, proceeding to more universal physics. Consider the law of gravity, according to which a dropped object will accelerate downward at a near-constant weight. How might we port this law into an agential ontology?</p>\n<p>Here is the assumption about how the agent interacts with gravity. The agent will choose some natural number as the height of an object. Thereafter, the object will fall, while a camera will record the height of the object at each natural-number time expressed in milliseconds, to the nearest natural-number millimeter from the ground. The agent may observe a printout of the camera data afterwards.</p>\n<p>Logically, constant gravity implies, and is implied by, a particular quadratic formula for the height of the object as a function of the object's starting height and the amount of time that has passed. This formula implies the content of the printout, as a function of the chosen height. So, the agent may falsify constant gravity (<em>in the observable domain</em>) by choosing an object-height, placing an object at that height, letting it fall, and checking the printout, which will show the law of constant gravity to be false, if the law in fact does not hold for objects dropped at that height (to the observed level of precision).</p>\n<p>Universal constant gravity is not similarly falsifiable by this agent, because this agent may only observe this given experimental setup. However, a domain-limited law, stating that the law of constant gravity holds for all possible object-heights in this setup, up to the camera's precision, is falsifiable.</p>\n<p>It may seem that I am being incredibly pedantic about what a physical law is and what the falsification conditions are; however, I believe this level of pedantry is necessary for critically examining the notion of physical determinism to a high-enough level of rigor to check interaction with free will.</p>\n<h2>Internal physics</h2>\n<p>We have, so far, considered the case of an agent falsifying a physical law that applies to an external object. To check interaction with free will, we must interpret physical law applied to the agent's internals, on which the agent's cognition is, perhaps, running in a manner similar to software.</p>\n<p>Let's consider the notion that the agent itself is \"running on\" some Turing machine. We will need to specify precisely what such \"running on\" means.</p>\n<p>Let C be the computer that the agent is considering whether it is running on. C has, at each time, a tape-state, a Turing machine state, an input, and an output. The input is attached to a sensor (such as a camera), and the output is attached to an actuator (such as a motor).</p>\n<p>For simplicity, let us say that the history of tapes, states, inputs, and outputs is saved, such that it can be queried at a later time.</p>\n<p>We may consider the hypothesis that C, indeed, implements the correct dynamics for a given Turing machine specification. These dynamics imply a relation between future states and past states. An agent may falsify these dynamics by checking the history and seeing if the dynamics hold.</p>\n<p>Note that, because some states or tapes may be unreachable, it is not possible to falsify the hypothesis that C implements correct dynamics starting from unreachable states. Rather, only behavior following from reachable states may be checked.</p>\n<p>Now, let us think on an agent considering whether they \"run on\" this computer C. The agent may be assumed to be able to query the history of C, such that it may itself falsify the hypothesis that C implements Turing machine specification M, and other C-related hypotheses as well.</p>\n<p>Now, we can already name some ways that \"I run on C\" may be falsified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps there is a policy I may adopt, and a time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, such that if I implement this policy, I will observe O at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, but C will observe something other than O at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>.</li>\n<li>Perhaps there is a policy I may adopt, and a time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, such that if I implement this policy, I will take action A at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, but C will take an action other than A at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The agent may prove these falsification conditions by adopting a given policy until some time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, and then observing C's observation/action at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, compared to their own observation/action.</p>\n<p>I do not argue that the converse of these conditions exhaust what it means that \"I run on C\". However, they at least restrict the possibility space by a very large amount. For the falsification conditions given to not hold, the observations and behavior of C must be identical with the agent's own observations and behavior, for all possible policies the agent may adopt.</p>\n<p>I will name the hypothesis with the above falsification conditions: \"I effectively run on C\". This conveys that these conditions may not be exhaustive, while still being quite specific, and relating to effects between the agent and the environment (observations and actions).</p>\n<p>Note that the agent can hypothesize itself to effectively run on multiple computers! The conditions for effectively running on one computer do not contradict the conditions for effectively running on another computer. This naturally handles cases of identical physical instantiations of a single agent.</p>\n<p>At this point, we have an account of an agent who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Believes they have observations and take free actions</li>\n<li>May falsifiably hypothesize physical law</li>\n<li>May falsifiably hypothesize that some computer implements a Turing machine specification</li>\n<li>May falsifiably hypothesize that they themselves effectively run on some computer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have not yet shown that this account is consistent. There may be paradoxes. However, this at least represents the subject matter covered in a unified critical agential ontology.</p>\n<h2>Paradoxes sought and evaluated</h2>\n<p>Let us now seek out paradox. We showed before that the hypothesis \"I take action&nbsp;<em>f</em>()\" may be refuted at will, and therefore does not hold as a necessary law. We may suspect that \"I effectively run on C\" runs into similar problems.</p>\n<h4>Self-contradiction</h4>\n<p>Remember that, for the \"I effectively run on C\" hypothesis to be falsified, it must be falsified at some time, at which the agent's observation/action comes apart from C's. In the \"I take action&nbsp;<em>f</em>()\" case, we had the agent simulate&nbsp;<em>f</em>() in order to take an opposite action. However, C need not halt, so the agent cannot simulate C until halting. Instead, the agent may select some time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, and run C for&nbsp;<em>t</em>&nbsp;steps. But, by the time the agent has simulated C for&nbsp;<em>t</em>&nbsp;steps, the time is already past&nbsp;<em>t</em>, and so the agent may not contradict C's behavior at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, by taking an opposite action. Rather, the agent only knows what C does at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>&nbsp;at some time later than&nbsp;<em>t</em>, and only their behavior after this time may depend on this knowledge.</p>\n<p>So, this paradox is avoided by the fact that the agent cannot contradict its own action before knowing it, but cannot know it before taking it.</p>\n<p>We may also try to create a paradox by assuming an external super-fast computer runs a copy of C in parallel, and feeds this copy's action on subjective time-step&nbsp;<em>t</em>&nbsp;into the original C's observation before time&nbsp;<em>t</em>; this way, the agent may observe its action before it takes it. However, now the agent's action is dependent on its observation, and so the external super-fast computer must decide which observation to feed into the parallel C. The external computer cannot know what C will do before producing this observation, and so this attempt at a paradox cannot stand without further elaboration.</p>\n<p>We see, now, that if free will and determinism are compatible, it is due to limitations on the agent's knowledge. The agent, knowing it runs on C, cannot thereby determine what action it takes at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, until a later time. And the initial attempt to provide this knowledge externally fails.</p>\n<h4>Downward causation</h4>\n<p>Let us now consider a general criticism of functionalist views, which is that of downward causation: if a mental entity (such as observation or action) causes a physical entity, doesn't that either mean that the mental entity is physical, or that physics is not causally closed?</p>\n<p>Recall that we have defined causation in terms of the agent's action possibilities. It is straightforwardly the case, then, that the agent's action at time <em>t</em> causes changes in the environment.</p>\n<p>But, what of the physical cause? Perhaps it is also the case that C's action at time <em>t</em> causes changes in the environment. If so, there is a redundancy, in that the change in the environment is caused both by the agent's action and by C's action. We will examine this possible redundancy to find potential conflicts.</p>\n<p>To consider ways that C's action may change the environment, we must consider how the agent may intervene on C's action. Let us say we are concerned with C's action at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>. Then we may consider the agent at some time&nbsp;<em>u</em>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<em>t</em>&nbsp;taking an action that will cause C's action at time <em>t</em> to be over-written. For example, the agent may consider programming an external circuit that will interact with C's circuit (\"its circuit\").</p>\n<p>However, if the agent performs this intervention, then the agent's action at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>&nbsp;has no influence on C's action at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>. This is because C's action is, necessarily, equal to the value chosen at time&nbsp;<em>u</em>. (Note that this lack of influence means that the agent&nbsp;<em>does not effectively run on C</em>, for the notion of \"effectively run on\" considered! However, the agent may be said to effectively run on C with one exception.)</p>\n<p>So, there is no apparent way to set up a contradiction between these interventions. If the agent decides early (at time&nbsp;<em>u</em>) to determine C's action at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>, then that decision causes C's action at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>; if the agent does not do so, then the agent's decision at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>&nbsp;causes C's action at time&nbsp;<em>t</em>; and these are mutually exclusive. Hence, there is not an apparent problem with redundant causality.</p>\n<h4>Epiphenomenalism</h4>\n<p>It may be suspected that the agent I take to be real is epiphenomenal. Perhaps all may be explained in a physicalist ontology, with no need to posit that there exists an agent that has observations and takes actions. (This is a criticism levied at some views on consciousness; my notion of metaphysically-real observations is similar enough to consciousness that these criticisms are potentially applicable)</p>\n<p>The question in regards to explanatory power is: what is being explained, in terms of what? My answer is: observations are being explained, in terms of hypotheses that may be falsified by action/observations.</p>\n<p>An eliminativist perspective denies the agent's observations, and thus fails to explain what ought to be explained, in my view. However, eliminativists will typically believe that \"scientific observation\" is possible, and seek to explain scientific observations.</p>\n<p>A relevant point to make here is that the notion of scientific observation assumes there is some scientific process happening that has observations. Indeed, the scientific method includes actions, such as testing, which rely on the scientific process taking actions. Thus, scientific processes may be considered as agents in the sense I am using the term.</p>\n<p>My view is that erasing the agency of both individual scientists, and of scientific processes, puts the ontological and epistemic status of physics on shaky ground. It is hard to say why one should believe in physics, except in terms of it explaining observations, including experimental observations that require taking actions. And it is hard to say what it means for a physical hypothesis to be true, with no reference to how the hypothesis connects with observation and action.</p>\n<p>In any case, the specter of epiphenomenalism presents no immediate paradox, and I believe that it does not succeed as a criticism.</p>\n<h2>Comparison to Gary Drescher's view</h2>\n<p>I will now compare my account to Gary Drescher's view. I have found Drescher's view to be both particularly systematic and compelling, and to be quite similar to the views of other relevant philosophers such as Daniel Dennett and Eliezer Yudkowsky. Therefore, I will compare and contrast my view with Drescher's. This will dispel the illusion that I am not saying anything new.</p>\n<p>Notably, Drescher makes a similar observation to mine on Pearl: \"Pearl's formalism models free will rather than mechanical choice.\"</p>\n<p>Quoting section 5.3 of&nbsp;<em>Good and Real</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why did it take that action? In pursuit of what goal was the action selected? Was that goal achieved? Would the goal have been achieved if the machine had taken this other action instead? The system includes the assertion that if the agent were to do X, then Y would (probably) occur; is that assertion true? The system does not include the assertion that if it were to do P, Q would probably occur; is that omitted assertion true? Would the system have taken some other action just now if it had included that assertion? Would it then have better achieved its goals?</p>\n<p>Insofar as such questions are meaningful and answerable, the agent makes choices in at least the sense that the correctness of its actions with respect to its designated goals is analyzable. That is to say, there can be means-end connections between its actions and its goals: its taking an action for the sake of a goal can make sense. And this is so despite the fact that everything that will happen-including every action taken and every goal achieved or not-is inalterably determined once the system starts up. Accordingly, I propose to call such an agent a choice machine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drescher is defining conditions of choice and agency in terms of whether the decisions \"make sense\" with respect to some goal, in terms of means-end connections. This is a \"outside\" view of agency in contrast with my \"inside\" view. That is, it says some thing is an agent when its actions connect with some goal, and when the internal logic of that thing takes into account this connection.</p>\n<p>This is in contrast to my view, which takes agency to be metaphysically basic, and defines physical outside views (and indeed, physics itself) in terms of agency.</p>\n<p>My view would disagree with Drescher's on the \"inalterably determined\" assertion. In an earlier chapter, Drescher describes a deterministic block-universe view. This view-from-nowhere implies that future states are determinable from past states. In contrast, the view I present here rejects views-from-nowhere, instead taking the view of some agent in the universe, from whose perspective the future course is not already determined (as already argued in examinations of paradox).</p>\n<p>Note that these disagreements are principally about metaphysics and ontology, rather than scientific predictions. I am unlikely to predict the results of scientific experiments differently from Drescher on account of this view, but am likely to account for the scientific process, causation, choice, and so on in different language, and using a different base model.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion and further research</h2>\n<p>I believe the view I have presented to be superior to competing views on multiple fronts, most especially logical/philosophical systematic coherence. I do not make the full case for this in this post, but take the first step, of explicating the basic ontology and how it accounts for phenomena that are critically necessary to account for.</p>\n<p>An obvious next step is to tackle decision theory. Both Bayesianism and VNM decision theory are quite concordant with critical agential ontology, in that they propose coherence conditions on agents, which can be taken as criticisms. Naturalistic decision theory involves reconciling choice with physics, and so a view that already includes both is a promising starting point.</p>\n<p>Multi-agent systems are quite important as well. The view presented so far is near-solipsistic, in that there is a single agent who conceptualizes the world. It will need to be defined what it means for there to be \"other\" agents. Additionally, \"aggregative\" agents, such as organizations, are important to study, including in terms of what it means for a singular agent to participate in an aggregative agent. \"Standardized\" agents, such as hypothetical skeptical mathematicians or philosophers, are also worthy subjects of study; these standardized agents are relevant in reasoning about argumentation and common knowledge. Also, while the discussion so far has been in terms of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://opentheory.net/2018/09/a-new-theory-of-open-individualism/\">closed individualism</a>, alternative identity views such as empty individualism and open individualism are worth considering from a critical agential perspective.</p>\n<p>Other areas of study include naturalized epistemology and philosophy of mathematics. The view so far is primarily ontological, secondarily epistemological. With the ontology in place, epistemology can be more readily explored.</p>\n<p>I hope to explore the consequences of this metaphysics further, in multiple directions. Even if I ultimately abandon it, it will have been useful to develop a coherent view leading to an illuminating refutation.</p>\n</body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><h1>Background</h1>\n<p>tl;dr - skip to <a href=\"#Weighting_Attachment\">Weighting Attachment</a></p>\n<h2>My Dating Models</h2>\n<p>When I first set up an online dating profile, I remember noting that the experience of browsing matches felt a lot like shopping on Amazon. You compare the specs of the different products and try to figure out which one best meets your needs. As a perfectionist, that has been my implicit model of dating from fairly early on. There are a large number of potential mates out there, and most of them would be a poor choice, but there are a few of sufficient quality to be a life partner with you. And so the process of dating is to find an optimally compatible life partner.</p>\n<p>But I was unfortunate enough to grow up with a peculiar dating culture that engaged my perfectionism at cross-purposes with this. That culture emphasized purity, and the ideal was to date as few people as possible before marriage. I internalized this to mean that I shouldn't ask someone out unless I was already pretty sure I wanted to marry them. You can see that this, when combined with the shopping paradigm, put me in a bit of a bind. And so my response was to not date. Anyone. Ever. This was not a conscious choice but a natural local minimum that I could not escape without ditching one of those two paradigms.</p>\n<h2>Something's Missing</h2>\n<p>So I started dating after finally ditching purity culture. But not dating means I missed out on a lot of experiences of dating until relatively late in life. And this also meant I had never actually tested the shopping paradigm. Now that I'm in it, I can see that normal people do not follow that paradigm. I suppose that explains why lots of other people in purity culture manage to pair up just fine. But the reason that people don't follow that paradigm is <em>feelings</em>. I have discovered that there are very strong feelings constraining my actions. Those feelings plunged me into my first relationship, and now they're brutally punishing me for ending it.</p>\n<p>But this also makes me wonder... is that paradigm correct? Do the presence of feelings and attachment actually change the calculus of what is optimal? Is a partner who is less compatible actually the correct choice if you have history and chemistry?</p>\n<p>And in there is also the question of commitment. I always had one template for commitment, and one decision. Should I marry this person? But it seems that there are several steps up to marriage (or life partnership of some form), and each of these involves commitment in some form.</p>\n<h2>Valuing Commitment</h2>\n<p>On the extreme end of valuing history &amp; chemistry is a friend of mine who is still living with and paying for his controlling, borderline-personality-disordered ex, even though they broke up over a year ago. He just can't bring himself to cut ties and move out. In a sense he's over-committed.</p>\n<p>But on the other extreme are folks who jump from relationship to relationship whenever things get tough or the feelings fade or the grass looks greener. You can never sustain a life partnership without some willingness to sacrifice the optimal for the extant.</p>\n<p>In this case, the bird in the hand is actually <em>made</em> more valuable by ignoring the 2 in the bush. In fact, that's simply the wrong analogy. The whole idea here is that birds are interchangeable. The act of choosing a bird over and over again does not make it more valuable to you. But that is <em>exactly</em> how partnership works. In some sense, you could pick someone arbitrarily, but as you continue to choose them over and over again, they actually <em>become</em> the best choice. Granted, there is at least a threshold of compatibility they need to pass, but there's a large number of people that any given person could be happy with, provided they both commit.</p>\n<p>And here I think is where I went wrong. I was thinking of marriage as the only real commitment. But it's not. There are a ton of commitments you make every day. Sure, there's no vow involved, no conscious communication and acknowledgement of expectations. But in small, subtle ways, you communicate your love, affection, appreciation, and body chemistry. You build attachment. And attachment is a commitment, whether you realize it or not. In fact, attachment is a commitment that runs deeper than marriage. It was before marriage. Before there was a political or religious authority to bestow rights and privileges thereof, pair-bonding attachment was encoded into our genes.</p>\n<p>So then how do I integrate this into my model? Is it that you just start dating someone almost at random and continue until the relationship is obviously unworkable? That seems like a very inefficient policy. It is in fact analogous to the way most people choose their religion, a method that I have explicitly repudiated. But there must be some way to weight attachment into the decision of who to date and when to break things off.</p>\n<h1>Weighting Attachment</h1>\n<p>So let's say there's a weight G<sub>R</sub> for romantic attachment and another weight G<sub>L</sub> for long-term secure attachment. When these are added to the model weighting the various other factors and relationship dynamics, you could see some interesting results...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If G<sub>R</sub> is especially large, but G<sub>L</sub> is relatively small, then you should rarely stay with someone long-term, but should always stay with people as long as the feelings last. This seems to be the way nature has weighted things. Culture and cognition have added a lot of extra weight onto G<sub>L</sub> though, so people do normally form lifetime partnerships eventually, and more than half of these stay together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But let's say hypothetically that G<sub>R</sub> is decently large, and G<sub>L</sub> is extremely large, large enough to overshadow gross incompatibility in the relationship. If that is the case, then you should just marry the very first person you date and stick it out to the bitter end. This is similar to arranged marriage cultures and exemplified in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaman_(term)\">Japanese Gaman ethic</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, if both G<sub>R</sub> and G<sub>L</sub> are near 0, then there is no commitment and partners will come and go from your life, seemingly at a whim, creating something like hookup culture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My old implicit model arises from a small  G<sub>R</sub> and a large G<sub>L</sub>. The cost for switching early is very low, so you should do it often and evaluate a lot of options. This is the Amazon shopping model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More realistically, I could see a model where G<sub>R</sub> and G<sub>L</sub> are strong, but not prohibitively so. This creates the conditions for a falsification-only approach. As you build connection, you should only break it off if you discover something that will make the relationship work very poorly in the long-run.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A non-zero G<sub>R</sub> also explains why you should go slow. Building too much attachment before you've had a chance to evaluate the relationship can limit your options and push you forward into a difficult relationship that might have otherwise been abandoned in favor of a happier one. My mistake in my first relationship was to implicitly assume G<sub>R</sub> = 0, and go full-speed ahead, not understanding how badly heartbreak sucks, or that breaking up inherently destroys something valuable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Choosing Good Weights</h2>\n<p>Obviously everyone's model will look different for this. But I would like to maximize the utility that I (and to a lesser extent my partner) will get out of the relationship. I'm already decided on a high G<sub>L</sub> because I want a committed life partnership and kids. The question is how big should G<sub>R</sub> be? My utilitarian instinct would be to consider relatively small differences in marital happiness stretched out over decades strongly when compared with intense short-term heartbreak, but there's future-discounting to factor in. Also I'm still unacquainted with the full cycle of heartbreak to understand just how badly it sucks, but I'm likely to over-weight it since I'm presently in the middle of it.</p>\n<p>I welcome any thoughts on weights or critiques of the model itself. Are there other important attachment-related factors I'm not considering? Is there a whole different paradigm I could benefit from being exposed to? Please tell!</p>\n<p>(cross-posted from my <a href=\"https://wolverdude.wordpress.com/2020/03/04/weighting-attachment-in-relationship-decisions\">blog</a>)</p>\n</body></html>",

I need to whip up a better title for it, too. <strong>Corrections appreciated</strong>.)</p>\n<p>Prior reading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scott Alexander’s <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/\">All in all, another brick in the motte</a></li>\n<li>Nicholas Shackel’s <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/09/motte-and-bailey-doctrines/\">Motte and bailey doctrines</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It bothers me when other people use a troll’s truism in a discussion. It probably bothers you, too. A person uses a troll’s truism when he claims something bold and, when his audience rejects his claim, reformulates his claim into something innocuous and asserts that the reformulation is a restatement of the initial, rejected assertion.</p>\n<p>Now, when someone deploys troll’s truisms out of unthinking habit or tactical choice, this is referred to as motte-and-bailey doctrine. Someone adheres to motte-and-bailey doctrine when he regularly puts forward an expansive claim (the bailey), and, if the expansive claim isn’t accepted, retreats to a more defensible position (the motte).</p>\n<p>At the end of the post, Alexander points out one of the problems inherent in debating a broad-ranging idea (in this case, feminism). Finally, he has a good suggestion to help avoid motte-and-bailey switches in the middle of a conversation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So what is the <em>real</em> feminism we should be debating? <em>Why would you even ask that question?</em> What is this, some kind of dumb high school debate club? Who the heck thinks it would be a good idea to say “Here’s a vague poorly-defined concept that mind-kills everyone who touches it — quick, should you associate it with positive affect or negative affect?!”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Taboo-Your-Words\">Taboo</a> your words, then <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Replace-The-Symbol-With-The-Substance\">replace the symbol with the substance</a>. If you have an <em>actual thing</em> you’re trying to debate, then it should be obvious when somebody’s changing the topic. If working out who’s using motte-and-bailey (or weak man) is remotely difficult, it means your discussion went wrong several steps earlier and you probably have no idea what you’re even arguing about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, this only works when there are a small number of people involved — no more than two or three. If the discussion is happening at your (anti)favorite social-networking site, you might have an argument structure like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A, B, and C all believe and argue for bailey β</li>\n<li>D, E, F, and G all believe and argue for motte µ</li>\n<li>H, J, and K all believe and argue for bailey β′,<br>\nwhich is close to, but not quite the same as, β</li>\n<li>L and M both believe and argue for µ′,<br>\nwhich is close to, but not quite the same as, µ</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a situation like this, you can’t press the caps-lock key and shout “STOP EQUIVOCATING BETWEEN β AND µ!” You’re dealing with a bunch of different people who’ve formed their own opinions at least somewhat independently of each other. You’re being motte-and-baileyed, but not <em>necessarily</em> because this is a deliberate strategy<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-KF9dDk5bsfZnPW5gP-1\" id=\"fnref-KF9dDk5bsfZnPW5gP-1\">[1]</a></sup> being employed by A, B, C, H, J, or K.</p>\n<p>If you’re anything like me, you’d like a solution to the problem of being subject to a distributed troll’s truism attack.

This means that when you make a decision you should calculate the expected-utility for each counterfactual and choose the counterfactual with the highest expected utility. However, if you know yourself well enough to know that you are an expected utility maximiser, this knowledge can change your counterfactuals. For example, this can provide information about your likely future actions, the expected number of expected utility maximisers in the world or how clones of you might behave. In general, if you are in an <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/i3BTagvt3HbPMx6PN/embedded-agency-full-text-version\">embedded problem</a> and you have reflective knowledge of your own algorithm, then your decision theory provides both a system of evaluation and a data-point about the world. We can call this the embedded view.</p><p>In contrast, we could also imagine a utility maximiser outside the problem description, analysing the decisions of various agents within the problem according to how well they maximise utility, none of which need to be utility maximisers themselves.  In general, when we use a decision theory in this way, we will call this the external view of the problem. Normally, we'll be talking about applying one or both of these two things:</p><ul><li>A method of constructing counterfactuals - ie. evidential counterfactuals, causal counterfactuals, <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Timeless_decision_theory\">timeless counterfactuals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6t5vRHrwPDi5C9hYr/motivating-a-semantics-of-logical-counterfactuals#comments\">logical counterfactuals</a></li><li>A method of evaluating counterfactuals - ie. expected utility, minimax, maximax</li></ul><p>We can use these as tools for evaluating agents that aren't necessarily using these tools. One case where this would be useful is when knowing how the agent makes a decision would mean that only a single decision would be consistent with the problem description and hence that the decision theory problem would be trivial in a particular sense. For example, an updateless agent will always one-box in Newcomb's, so it kind of doesn't make sense to ask what it would have scored if it had two-boxed. On the other hand, if we just use updateless decision theory to help evaluate the situation externally by constructing our counterfactuals, then we don't run into this issue and we end up with multiple consistent counterfactuals.</p><p>Another situation where this is useful is the Smoking Lesion Problem. The Smoking Lesion Problem has been criticised in a few places for being inconsistent. As Abram Demski <a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1525#why-did-anyone-think-cdt-was-a-good-idea\">says</a>, \"It is assumed that those with a smoking lesion are more likely to smoke, but this is inconsistent with their being EDT agents\" (these agents choose the action with maximise utility according to EDT counterfactuals, so there isn't any choice unless the utility is equal in both actions). However, while it is inconsistent to assume that the agents in the Smoking Lesion Problem are all EDT agents, it is natural to imagine an EDT agent using EDT counterfactuals to evaluate agents which don't necessarily follow EDT.</p><p><em>This post was written with the input of Davide Zagami and Palbo Moreno and supported by the EA Hotel and AI Safety Research Program</em></p>",

The insight of this paper is that these are all instances of a simple underlying formalism.</p><p>Specifically, these forms of preference learning can be described by two properties: (1) the set of choices that the human picks from and (2) how each choice corresponds to a distribution over agent trajectories. Given these properties, we assume that the human makes their choice according to a Boltzmann-rational model (where the human is more likely to choose an option if it leads to higher expected reward). We have now specified a likelihood over the choice given the reward, and we can use Bayes rule to infer a distribution over the reward given the human&apos;s choice.</p><p>Consider more exotic types of feedback, such as the human&apos;s decision to <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08219\">turn the agent off</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/59ddebcb3b9a/an-69-stuart-russells-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace-the-standard-model-of-ai\">AN #69</a></u>). Here, the human has two options: turning the agent off (corresponding to the agent staying still forever), or letting it continue (corresponding to the agent taking the trajectory that maximizes its current expected reward). If the agent has the right reward function, then the Boltzmann rational human would let it continue; as a result, if the human instead tries to turn the agent off, Bayes Rule allows the agent to infer that its belief about the reward must be wrong. Thus, even this decision of whether to turn the agent off can be captured in this framework.</p><p>The paper then shows two examples of new feedback types that can be generated from this framework: first, credit assignment, in which the human identifies a subset of the trajectory that had maximal reward, and second, meta-choice, where the choice of which <em>type</em> of feedback to give can itself give information about the reward function.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I like this paper; it&apos;s a very clear explanation of a &quot;recipe&quot; used to develop preference learning algorithms (especially at CHAI and Interact, two of the labs I&apos;m a part of). It is particularly applicable to the case where there&apos;s a separate training phase where the human gives feedback on the reward function, and a deployment phase where the agent optimizes the reward function. Things get murkier once you move to a more online setting in which the human and agent are acting simultaneously, as in <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\">assistance games / CIRL games</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/59ddebcb3b9a/an-69-stuart-russells-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace-the-standard-model-of-ai\">AN #69</a></u>), where the agent can learn from pragmatic actions (see also <u><a href=\"https://interactive-learning.github.io/\">the deep RL version</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/0b74c28413c0/an-64-using-deep-rl-and-reward-uncertainty-to-incentivize-preference-learning\">AN #64</a></u>)). In particular, while previously we could separate out the grounding of choices to trajectories, and the interpretation of those trajectories (the Boltzmann rational model), this can no longer be done in an assistance game, since the way that the agent interprets the trajectories changes what the agent does which changes the choices available to the human in the next timestep. I&apos;d be excited for more work on understanding this setting.</p><h1><strong>Technical AI alignment</strong></h1><h3><strong>Learning human intent</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05838\">Goal-conditioned Imitation Learning</a></u> <em>(Yiming Ding, Carlos Florensa et al)</em> (summarized by Zach): Goal-conditioned tasks are objectives that can be specified at the start of an episode. Specifically, the objective is set to encourage the agent to reach an arbitrary state in the environment. <strong>This paper investigates using goal-conditioning to improve the performance of imitation learning algorithms.</strong> The authors build off of prior work into Hindsight-Experience Replay (HER), a method that allows standard RL algorithms to learn from failure by relabeling final states as goal states. One drawback of HER is that the search process is breadth-first since we won&apos;t know which search directions are useful before we encounter the true goal state. This can complicate exploration. On the other hand, when we have access to expert demonstrations, such as in imitation learning, we can generally avoid breadth-first search and instead focus on copying the demonstrations using a method such as generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). However, with GAIL we evaluate entire agent trajectories as either similar/dissimilar from the expert demonstration. Yet, it&apos;s also true that we could view different points along the trajectory as sub-goals which greatly augment the demonstration data-set. Using this insight, the authors extend goal-conditioning to the imitation learning setting. The authors test their goal-conditioned algorithm on a variety of basic manipulation tasks and show that with the goal relabeling the task is learned faster and at a higher quality than with other approaches such as GAIL or HER.</p><p><strong>Zach&apos;s opinion:</strong> The basic idea of augmenting demonstration data by relabeling the goal is clever. While I understood HER suffered from being a breadth-first search algorithm, I hadn&apos;t considered the possibility that GAIL might be limited to only extracting direct information from the demonstrations. Generalizing GAIL so that it can reach arbitrary states allows for a smooth transition between learning from demonstrations and achieving the desired outcome.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2yLn8iTrvHoEgqXcJ/the-two-layer-model-of-human-values-and-problems-with\">The two-layer model of human values, and problems with synthesizing preferences</a></u> <em>(Kaj Sotala)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post points out a problem with the recent <u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into\">preference synthesis research agenda</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/0dd8eb63fe2d/an-60a-new-ai-challenge-minecraft-agents-that-assist-human-players-in-creative-mode\">AN #60</a></u>) (and presumably other value learning agendas as well): these agendas tend to require simple models of how human behavior, speech, or mental models relate to human preferences. However, in reality, it seems likely that the brain is a big learning machine without any innate &quot;values&quot;, and what we experience as our conscious selves is a &quot;strategy&quot; chosen by this learning machine, and as such does not have a sensible interpretation as something that optimizes for &quot;values&quot;. The author suggests that value learning agendas need to deal directly with the fact that there are these two &quot;layers&quot; in humans, and presents some preliminary thoughts that don&apos;t reach any particular conclusions.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think this is an important critique: it seems to me that the hardest part of the three principles suggested in <u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Human-Compatible-Artificial-Intelligence-Problem-ebook/dp/B07N5J5FTS\">Human Compatible</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/59ddebcb3b9a/an-69-stuart-russells-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace-the-standard-model-of-ai\">AN #69</a></u>) is the one that requires human preferences to be tied to human behavior. It seems quite hard to make an accurate and robust model for this, for reasons like the ones given in this post.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ky988ePJvCRhmCwGo/using-vector-fields-to-visualise-preferences-and-make-them\">Using vector fields to visualise preferences and make them consistent</a></u> <em>(Michael Aird et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This post proposes that we represent a person&apos;s preferences as follows: for every state, we have a vector whose direction specifies how the person would most like the state to change, and whose magnitude specifies the intensity of the preference. Under suitable conditions on the state space, this defines a vector field. Intransitive or circular preferences correspond to the <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)\">curl</a></u> of the vector field. The authors propose that a consistent set of preferences can then be inferred by &quot;removing the curl&quot;, e.g. by using the <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_decomposition\">Helmholtz decomposition</a></u>.</p><h3><strong>Preventing bad behavior</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/RzAmPDNciirWKdtc7/pessimism-about-unknown-unknowns-inspires-conservatism\">Pessimism About Unknown Unknowns Inspires Conservatism</a></u> <em>(Michael Cohen et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): The argument for AI risk typically involves some point at which an AI system does something unexpected and bad in a new situation that we haven&apos;t seen before (as in e.g. a treacherous turn). One way to mitigate the risk is to simply detect new situations, and ensure the AI system does something known to be safe in such situations, e.g. deferring to a human, or executing some handcoded safe baseline policy. Typical approaches involve a separate anomaly detection model. This paper considers: can we use the AI system itself to figure out when to defer to a mentor?</p><p><em>The key insight is that if an AI system maintains a distribution over rewards, and &quot;assumes the worst&quot; about the reward in new situations, then simply by deferring to the mentor with higher probability when the mentor would get higher expected reward, it will end up deferring to the mentor in new situations.</em> Hence, the title: by making the agent pessimistic about unknown unknowns (new situations), we get a conservative agent that defers to its mentor in new situations.</p><p>This is formalized in an AIXI-like setting, where we have agents that can have beliefs over all computable programs, and we only consider an online learning setting where there is a single trajectory over all time (i.e. no episodes). The math is fairly dense and I didn&apos;t try to fully understand it; as a result my summary may be inaccurate. The agent maintains a belief over world models (which predict how the environment evolves and how reward is given) and mentor models (which predict what the mentor will do, where the mentor&apos;s policy can depend on the <strong>true</strong> world model). It considers the &#x3B2; most likely world models (where &#x3B2; is a hyperparameter between 0 and 1). It computes the worst-case reward it could achieve under these world models, and the expected reward that the mentor achieves. It is more likely to defer to the mentor when the mentor&apos;s expected reward is higher (relative to its worst-case reward).</p><p>Such an agent queries the mentor finitely many times and eventually takes actions that are at least as good as the mentor&apos;s choices in those situations. In addition, for events with some bound on complexity, we can set things up (e.g. by having a high &#x3B2;) such that for any event, with high probability the agent never causes the event to occur unless the mentor has already caused the event to occur some time in the past. For example, with high probability the agent will never push the big red button in the environment, unless it has seen the mentor push the big red button in the past.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think it is an underrated point that in some sense all we need to do to avoid x-risk is to make sure AI systems don&apos;t do crazy high-impact things in new situations, and that risk aversion is one way to get such an agent. This is also how <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02827\">Inverse Reward Design</a></u> (<u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/59ddebcb3b9a/an-69-stuart-russells-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace-the-standard-model-of-ai\">AN #69</a></u>) gets its safety properties: when faced with a completely new &quot;lava&quot; tile that the agent has never seen before, the paper&apos;s technique only infers that it should be <em>uncertain</em> about the tile&apos;s reward. However, the <em>expected</em> reward is still 0, and to get the agent to actually avoid the lava you need to use risk-averse planning.</p><p>The case for pessimism is similar to the case for impact measures, and similar critiques apply: it is not clear that we can get a value-agnostic method that is both sufficiently safe to rule out all catastrophes, and sufficiently useful to replace other AI techniques. The author himself points out that if we set &#x3B2; high enough to be confident it is safe, the resulting agent may end up always deferring to the mentor, and so not actually be of any use. Nonetheless, I think it&apos;s valuable to point out these ways that seem to confer some nice properties on our agents, even if they can&apos;t be pushed to the extremes for fear of making the agents useless.</p><h1><strong>AI strategy and policy</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2020/02/17/on-the-long-term-importance-of-current-ai-policy-with-nicolas-moes-and-jared-brown/\">AI Alignment Podcast: On the Long-term Importance of Current AI Policy</a></u> <em>(Lucas Perry, Nicolas Mo&#xEB;s and Jared Brown)</em> (summarized by Rohin): While this podcast focuses both on the details of current policy as well as the long-term impact of engaging in policy today, I&apos;m mostly interested in the latter, and so will simply quote Lucas&apos;s summary of points for that part:</p><p>1) Experience gained on short-term AI policy issues is important to be considered a relevant advisor on long-term AI policy issues coming up in the future.</p><p>2) There are very few people that care about AGI safety currently in government, politics or in policy communities.</p><p>3) There are opportunities to influence current AI policy decisions in order to provide a fertile ground for future policy decisions or, better but rarer, to be directly shaping AGI safety policy today through evergreen texts. Future policy that is implemented is path dependent on current policy that we implement today. What we do now is precedent setting.</p><p>4) There are opportunities today to develop a skillset useful for other policy issues and causes.</p><p>5) Little resource is being spent on this avenue for impact, so the current return on investment is quite good.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> I think quite a lot about points 1 and 3, which I think also apply to technical safety research, not just policy. For our research to have an impact, it is necessary that either the research or its authors have enough credibility to actually influence decision-makers. In addition, the problems we will face in the future could depend on technical work done today: for example, if we were convinced that (say) AIs trained via evolution are too risky, we could push for AI to be developed in other ways now.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2020/02/28/distributing-the-benefits-of-ai-via-the-windfall-clause-with-cullen-okeefe/\">FLI Podcast: Distributing the Benefits of AI via the Windfall Clause</a></u> <em>(Lucas Perry and Cullen O&#x2019;Keefe)</em> (summarized by Rohin): <u><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/9d279b575b1a/an-88-how-the-principal-agent-literature-relates-to-ai-risk\">Last week</a></u>, we had a brief summary of the <u><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/windfallclause/\">Windfall Clause</a></u> paper. This podcast goes into more depth about the potential benefits and objections to this clause: it&apos;s in some sense a more accessible and conversational elaboration of many of the points made in the paper.</p><h1><strong>Other progress in AI</strong></h1><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05500\">What Can Learned Intrinsic Rewards Capture?</a></u> <em>(Zeyu Zheng, Junhyuk Oh et al)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper studies whether a learned reward function can serve as a locus of knowledge about the environment, that can be used to accelerate training of new agents. In particular, such a learned intrinsic reward can help with test-time adaptation: in a novel environment, the intrinsic reward can quickly &quot;tell&quot; the agent e.g. where it should explore -- even if in the new environment the agent has a different action space, or uses a different learning algorithm (situations that meta learning would typically not be able to handle).</p><p>The authors create an algorithm that learns an intrinsic reward function, that when used to train a new agent over a &#x201C;lifetime&#x201D; (which consists of multiple episodes), leads to the best cumulative reward over the lifetime, using a meta-gradient approach. Experiments on gridworlds demonstrate that these learned intrinsic rewards: 1. switch between early exploration and later exploitation, 2. explore only for information that is relevant for optimal behavior, 3. capture invariant causal relationships, and 4. can anticipate and adapt to changes in the extrinsic reward within a lifetime.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> A common intuition that many researchers have is that specifying <em>what</em> to do (the reward function) should be easier than specifying <em>how</em> to do it (the policy). In practice, this <em>doesn&apos;t</em> seem to be the case for deep learning, where imitation via inverse reinforcement learning (inferring a reward function and optimizing it) seems to be similar to imitation learning via behavior cloning (&quot;copying&quot; the policy). Similarly, this method seems broadly similar to meta learning algorithms like MAML and RL^2, though it does outperform them on one (probably carefully designed) transfer learning task.</p><h3><strong>Deep learning</strong></h3><p><u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06177\">The Next Decade in AI: Four Steps Towards Robust Artificial Intelligence</a></u> <em>(Gary Marcus)</em> (summarized by Rohin): This paper suggests a few directions which would allow us to build more <em>robust</em> AI systems with better &quot;understanding&quot; of the world: specifically, it highlights <strong>symbol manipulation, encoded knowledge, reasoning, and cognitive models</strong> as areas of research for the next decade.</p><p>See also <u><a href=\"https://jack-clark.net/2020/03/02/import-ai-187-real-world-robot-tests-at-cvpr-all-hail-the-molecule-transformer-the-four-traits-needed-for-smarter-ai-systems/\">Import AI #187</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CeJs4rPgPtJPNqLMt/gary-marcus-four-steps-towards-robust-artificial\">Matthew Barnett&apos;s summary</a></u>.</p><p><strong>Rohin&apos;s opinion:</strong> The AI claims made in this paper seem pretty reasonable to me, though I think the paper overstates how much deep learning aficionados disagree with them. I certainly agree for example that existing deep learning systems do not generalize well outside of their training environment, or that AI systems will need to work with abstract knowledge, or that AI systems will have to learn from external, cultural knowledge represented in natural language. And while I am perhaps not as enamored of deep learning as (say) OpenAI or DeepMind, I&apos;m a pretty big fan of it, and try to design algorithms where deep learning can do most of the &quot;heavy lifting&quot;.</p><h1><strong>News</strong></h1><p><u><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/summer-research-fellowship/\">FHI Summer Research Fellowship</a></u> (summarized by Rohin): This six week summer fellowship allows fellows to take the lead on a project relevant to the long-term future, working with an FHI Research Scholar.

    "htmlBody": "<p>\n\nTraditional chlorine bleach, appropriately diluted, can be used for\ndisinfecting and sanitizing, so it's potentially very handy to have in\nemergencies.  It can also be confusing, however, because it degrades,\nthere are many kinds, concentrations are not emphasized, and you want\ndifferent dilutions for different purposes.\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\nThe first problem is that many things are sold as \"bleach\".  Some of\nthem don't use chlorine, others have additives to make them smell\nbetter or have less risk of splashing.  These are all potentially good\nproperties to have in a laundry additive, but they're not what you\nwant for sanitizing.  Everything below is for regular chlorine bleach,\nand not oxygen bleach, scented bleach, or splash-less bleach.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe second problem is that bleach comes in a range of concentrations.\nWe usually talk about \"regular household bleach\" as being 5%-6%\nchlorine, but the range is larger than that.  My local store brand is\n8.6% chlorine, and some cheap bleaches are as low as 2.6%.  Somewhere,\nin small print, the bottle will say what the actual concentration is.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe third problem is that bleach degrades over time, though it's hard\nto find numbers on how quickly.  The shelf life is generally given as\n<a href=\"https://www.clorox.com/how-to/laundry-basics/product-usage-guides/shelf-life/\">a\nyear from manufacture</a>, provided that you keep it in a cool dark\nplace.  It's relatively cheap, so it's worth buying a bottle every ~6m\neven if you go through it slower than that. Diluted solutions degrade\nmuch faster, so mix dilutions fresh daily.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBefore working with bleach, it's good to review the ways in which it\ncan be dangerous, especially right out of the bottle:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>The same things that make bleach good at killing germs make it\ngood at killing parts of you that it comes in contact with.  It's\nespecially important not to get it in your eyes, let it into cuts, or\ndrink it, but it also will eat through your skin.  If you've ever\ngotten a little bleach on your hands you might remember them feeling\nsoft afterwards: that's because it's removed the outer layer of skin.\nWear gloves and googles when working with straight bleach.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>When diluting bleach you want to avoid splashing the\nfull-strength bleach onto yourself.  First measure out your water,\nthen add your measure of bleach.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Bleach releases chlorine gas, which is toxic.  Working with\nbleach outdoors is good, and opening a window for ventilation also\nworks.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Mixing bleach with acids such as vinegar or other household\ncleaners releases large amounts of chlorine gas.  Mixing it with\nammonia releases chlorine gas, chloramine gas, and can make hydrazine.\nI see people talking about the risk of exploding hydrazine, but this\nlooks unlikely unless you're applying heat or otherwise doing\nsomething pretty weird.  Mixing is usually accidental, and typically\nhappens when people switch from one cleaner to another.  If you do\nswitch between cleaners, clean with lots of water in between.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nAlso keep in mind that many things are effectively more dangerous in\nan emergency.  While getting bleach in your eyes is never good, the\nrecommendation is to clean them with water and then get immediate\nmedical attention.  In an emergency, that medical attention may not be\navailable, making a bad situation worse.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOk, so let's say you have regular chlorine bleach, not too old, you\nknow the concentration, and you're taking appropriate safety\nprecautions.  Because bleach is dangerous, we want to use the right\nconcentration for the task at hand.  There's a tradeoff between the\nmore effective disinfection ability of higher concentrations, and the\nless harm to humans and materials of lower concentrations.  I've\ncollected the concentrations of the main uses I can find, and\nconverted them to parts per million (PPM) for ease of calculation If\nyour bleach is marked 5.0% hypochlorite, that's 50,000 PPM, so if you\nwanted 500 PPM you'd mix one part bleach with 100 parts water (well,\ntechnically 99 parts water, but we don't need that level of\nprecision).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\n<p><b>10 PPM</b>.  In an emergency, if you don't have clean water\nand can't boil water, you can disinfect clear water with a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/emergency_disinfection.html\">very\nsmall amount</a> of bleach.  Let it sit for 30min before drinking.\nThe EPA says you normally want no more than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/chlorine-disinfection.html\">4\nPPM</a>, but gives 10 PPM <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/emergency-disinfection-drinking-water\">for\nemergency disinfection</a>.  This is probably because in emergencies\nwe're starting with water that's less safe, and we're not planning on\ndrinking water that has this much chlorine daily for years.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nYou can also use this disinfected water, with soap, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/facts.html\">for\nhand washing</a>.\n\n</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p><b>200 PPM</b>.  Sanitizing dishes: after washing and rinsing, <a href=\"https://www.clorox.com/how-to/disinfecting-sanitizing/disinfecting-with-bleach/sanitizing-dishes-using-bleach/\">soak\nfor two minutes</a> in 200 PPM bleach, then air dry without rinsing.\nFor example, two teaspoons of regular bleach per gallon.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nThis is also the bleach concentration <a href=\"https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/BePreparedBeSafe/SevereWeatherandNaturalDisasters/SewageSpillsCleaningThemUp\">recommended\nfor cleaning indoor sewage spills</a>, under normal circumstances.\n\n</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p><b>500 PPM (\"1:100\")</b>. Disinfecting or sanitizing <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/publications/Annex7.pdf\">hard surfaces,\nmedical equipment, contaminated cloth before washing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/bleach.html\">hard things that have\nbeen exposed to flood water</a>.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nIt is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/2.6-percent-chlorine-bleach-solution.pdf\">possible</a>\nto use 500 PPM bleach to sanitize hands but it's <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/publications/Annex7.pdf\">much better to\nuse soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer</a> because\nbleach is bad for your hands.\n\n</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><p><b>5,000 PPM (\"1:10\")</b>.  Cleaning <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/publications/Annex7.pdf\">blood,\nexcrement</a>, surfaces exposed to dangerous infections like <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/2.6-percent-chlorine-bleach-solution.pdf\">ebola</a>\nand <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cdiff/prevent.html\">c. diff</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/bleach.html\">mold growth on\nhard surfaces</a>.  This is very strong, and you should be nearly as\ncautious with it as with raw bleach.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIn many emergencies authorities will distribute information about the\nright level of bleach to use for the circumstances.  If they do,\nfollow their advice and not the general recommendations I've collected\nhere.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/10100145717118562\">facebook</a></i></p>",

When I show a small amount of data (2~5 minutes of reading) and its extrapolations for the next weeks/months, the natural reaction is \"you are forgetting a lot, someone will invent a cure/vaccine, there is nothing to worry about\". They don't care about the smoke.<br><br>However, by showing a reasonable amount of data (1 hour reading) about coronavirus around the planet to my girlfriend and its long-term consequences (up to a year), she was convinced that it was a pandemic, that the consequences would be very bad, and her reaction was to cry.

I&apos;ll aim for a more friendly, informal, and relatively brief approach in this post as an alternative to the academic, formal, and more detailed approach you&apos;ll find in the paper. Take your pick of which style you prefer, or enjoy both.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>The distribution of risks from AGI suggest we can reduce the risk of catastrophe in attempts to build aligned AGI by trading off false positives for false negatives.</p><p>In more words, since we operate under uncertainty about how to build aligned AGI, assuming we are already along the Pareto frontier of interventions that are most likely to work, we are safer if we avoid trying some things that counterfactually would have worked had we tried them in exchange for trying fewer things that would fail to produce aligned AGI since those failed attempts put us at risk of unleashing unaligned or otherwise unsafe AGI and losing more that we value than we would have lost from wasted opportunity to develop aligned AGI sooner.</p><p>Stated in less formal terms, my thesis is that <strong>it&apos;s safer to be &quot;conservative&quot; in choices of assumptions when designing alignment schemes</strong> where &quot;conservative&quot; is specifically <strong>conservation of false positives</strong>.</p><p>To demonstrate this, I work through two examples of making choices about necessary assumptions to designing alignment schemes, and I know that these are necessary assumptions that lie along the frontier because they are epistemologically fundamental choices. I show what reasoning about tradeoffs between false positives and false negatives in alignment looks like, and present two recommended tradeoffs, albeit without considering how those tradeoffs might be operationalized when designing alignment mechanisms.</p><h1>Reducing false positive risk</h1><p>The risks of AGI appear to be so large such that even if you believe a catastrophic outcome from AGI is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512204\">very unlikely</a>, that catastrophe would be so bad that its <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html\">expected value</a> is still <a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html\">massively negative</a>, and such negative outcomes represent a far larger loss of value than failures-of-opportunity to obtain the best positive outcomes. If you disagree with this premise the rest of what follows won&apos;t make much sense. The best sources to convince you of the magnitude of AGI risk are probably <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies\">Superintelligence</a> (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LTtNXM9shNM9AC2mp/superintelligence-faq\">related</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ukmDvowTpe2NboAsX/a-visualization-of-nick-bostrom-s-superintelligence\">content</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566677/human-compatible-by-stuart-russell/\">Human Compatible</a> (reviews: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/irbREZtZzPi7WEYex/book-review-human-compatible-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FuGDYNvA6qh4qyFah/thoughts-on-human-compatible\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5fr8ZZ4mTpvciZu4K/book-review-human-compatible\">3</a>).</p><p>So given this assumption, for those working to mitigate existential risks like those from AGI, I argue that we should worry more about interventions failing than failing to implement interventions that would have worked if we had tried them. That is, all else equal, we should prefer false negatives&#x2014;cases where we fail to try an intervention that would have worked&#x2014;to false positives&#x2014;cases where we try an intervention and it fails&#x2014;since it increases the expected value of AGI.</p><p>Of course, what&apos;s better than trading off between false negatives and false positives is reducing both at the same time, i.e. making improvements that move us closer to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency\">the frontier</a> of what&apos;s possible by reducing the base error rate. Unfortunately <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/05/expand-vs-fight-social-justice-fertility-bioconservatism-and-ai-risk.html\">frontier expansion</a> is <a href=\"https://equilibriabook.com/\">hard</a> and even if it&apos;s not we will still <a href=\"http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/hardscra.pdf\">eventually</a> reach it, so in the absence of clear opportunities to reduce base error rates we <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/211736/type-i-error-and-type-ii-error-trade-off\">must trade off between false negative and false positive errors</a>. Given that we must make this tradeoff, I assess the distribution of outcomes to imply we must choose more false negatives and less false positives to maximize expected value.</p><p>But what does it mean to do that? What does it look like to be preferring false negatives to false positives? It means to make choices about how we attempt to solve alignment, and in making those choices we trade off false positives for false negatives. I&apos;ll demonstrate by considering a couple choices as examples.</p><p>Of all the choices I might have considered as examples in the paper, I concern myself with two choices over &quot;fundamental&quot; assumptions&#x2014;what might also be called hinge propositions or axioms or universal priors&#x2014;necessitated by <a href=\"https://www.iep.utm.edu/ep-circ/\">epistemic circularity</a> (assuming we would like to reason systematically, consistently, and as close to completely as possible). I do this because the nice thing about these assumptions is that they are fundamental, so everyone must always make a choice about them even if that choice is to ignore them and make some hidden default choice while being pragmatic, and there are sets of positions that cover all possible choices about them.</p><p>I additionally picked my two examples because I find them interesting, and because the results of my reasoning on them produced results that are not universally accepted among AI safety researchers, thus it seems, in expectation, valuable for humanity if I convince marginally more AI researchers of my view on these issues on the assumption that my analyses are correct. However it&apos;s worth stressing that these additional reasons are not critically important, so disagreeing with me on my analyses at the object level is not necessarily as important as whether or not the general method is sound, and I could have just as easily chosen boring and irrelevant examples to demonstrate the method.</p><h1>Meta-ethical uncertainty</h1><p>Solving alignment demands that we make normative assumptions. I think this used to be a more controversial statement, and it certainly seemed that way to me when I <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uR3znuBnaevssYDZY/rfc-meta-ethical-uncertainty-in-agi-alignment\">started</a> writing this paper two years ago, but <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6m5qqkeBTrqQsegGi/inner-alignment-requires-making-assumptions-about-human\">now</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/s6BGofzFbEr4Tmxkj/value-uncertainty\">it</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZsyK4SjnPe6HGia8/moral-uncertainty-vs-related-concepts\">seems</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LDMqaq7JmtPiHkjA5/artificial-intelligence-values-and-alignment\">less so</a>. Regardless, if you are not convinced, I recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rtphbZbMHTLCepd6d/humans-can-be-assigned-any-values-whatsoever\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ngqvnWGsvTEiTASih/ai-alignment-problem-human-values-don-t-actually-exist\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TR3eqQ2fnfKWzxxHL/research-agenda-in-reverse-what-would-a-solution-look-like#NdfJ8Yo9atL6mB6cW\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zvrZi95EHqJPxdgps/why-we-need-a-theory-of-human-values\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CSEdLLEkap2pubjof/research-agenda-v0-9-synthesising-a-human-s-preferences-into-1\">5</a>, and, of course, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812\">6</a>.</p><p>Epistemic circularity prevents us from choosing norms systematically and without grounding (i.e. positivism <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism#Critics\">ultimately fails</a> even though its <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/\">methods</a> are extremely useful up to the epistemic gap created by the <a href=\"https://www.iep.utm.edu/criterio/\">problem of the criterion</a>), so we must ground norms in something, and that something necessarily requires resolving the as yet unresolved question about the existence of <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/\">moral facts</a> among many other things. Lucky for us, at least for purposes of constructing an example, there is a set of three &quot;answers&quot; that covers the entire space of positions about moral facts: realism, antirealism, and skepticism. This conveniently lets us ignore most nuance in theories about moral facts and perform a comprehensive analysis about the existence of moral facts as it relates to the false negative/positive tradeoff for building aligned AGI.</p><p>So this example is grounded for you, a few words on moral facts and the positions on them. Facts are true statements, and moral facts are true normative statements, i.e. statements about what people should or ought to do. Realism is the position that moral facts exist (i.e. at least some normative statements are true), and antirealism is the position that moral facts don&apos;t exist (i.e. there are no true normative statements). There are a lot of possible positions in between the naive hardline versions of these two positions, and they <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FQKjY563bJqDeaEDr/to-first-order-moral-realism-and-moral-anti-realism-are-the\">seem to converge</a> at the limit of nuance. There is also the skeptical position on moral facts, just as there is a skeptical position on all questions of fundamental assumptions, which says we can&apos;t (yet?) know whether or not moral facts exist. This is far from the most interesting or most practically important question in metaethics, but it is the most fundamental, which as I say is great for an example because everyone is making a choice about it, even if it&apos;s a pragmatic or inconsistent choice.</p><p>Working through all the details to evaluate the tradeoffs between false negatives and false positives resulting from taking each of these positions on moral facts is exhausting, as you&apos;ll see if you read the paper, but it comes down to this: realism is worse than antirealism is worse than skepticism in terms of decreasing false positives at the cost of increasing false negatives. The gloss of the argument is that an alignment scheme or AI that assumes realism can more easily fail hard if it&apos;s wrong and moral facts don&apos;t exist, a scheme that assumes antirealism fails less hard if moral facts unexpectedly do exist for the cost of making it harder to find norms, and skepticism can&apos;t be &quot;wrong&quot; so there are no failures that way but it does make finding norms much harder.</p><p>Thus all else equal we should prefer skepticism about moral facts to antirealism to realism because this reduces the risk of false positives in exchange for increasing the risk of false negatives by ignoring solutions to alignment that might have worked if we had been able to assume moral facts definitely do or don&apos;t exist.</p><h1>Uncertainty about mental phenomena</h1><p>Having resolved a key question in metaethics (as it relates to constructing aligned AI), let&apos;s take things a little easier by considering AI consciousness.</p><p>AI, and in particular AGI, may or may not be <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/\">conscious</a>, have subjective <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F\">experiences</a>, or otherwise exhibit <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intentionality/\">mental phenomena</a>. This has bearings on alignment because our alignment scheme can choose to engage with an AGI&apos;s mental phenomena if they exist. Like with the case of moral facts, there are three possible positions&#x2014;mindlessness, mindfulness, and skepticism&#x2014;although I ignore skepticism here because I expect skepticism will almost always dominate and just focus on analyzing the choice between assuming mindless or mindful AGI.</p><p>The mindless assumption is, of course, that AGI do not or will not have minds or mental phenomena or consciousness; the mindful assumption is that they do or will. The choice of assumption constrains the design space of alignment mechanisms because in the mindful case we might explore mechanisms that aim to achieve alignment by working with the mental aspect of AGI, perhaps in ways beyond what is possible even with attempts to align humans to other humans, whereas assuming mindlessness means we cannot do this so the only possible alignment mechanisms either work directly on the algorithms/implementation of the AGI or via blackbox, behaviorist methods that make no claims on the internal state of the AGI.</p><p>The initial, straightforward analysis is that the mindless assumption is safer (has less false positive and more false negative likelihood) than the mindful assumption because assuming mindfulness would lead us to try alignment mechanisms that never could have worked if AGI do not have minds whereas assuming mindlessness can produce mechanisms that would work regardless of whether or not AGI are conscious. So far so good.</p><p>Unfortunately I do not think that all else is equal. You may disagree, but I think <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NqQxTn5MKEYhSnbuB/goodhart-s-curse-and-limitations-on-ai-alignment\">Goodhart effects are so robust</a> that wide swaths of solution space are broken by them, that includes those solutions that would try to optimize algorithms or behavior for &quot;alignment&quot;. From the paper:</p><blockquote>Suppose we have an alignment scheme that proposes to align an AGI with human values via humans manipulating its algorithm or the AGI observing human behavior to infer human values. In the case of manipulating its algorithm, humans are preferentially choosing (viz. optimizing for) changes that result in better expectation of alignment. In the case of the AGI observing human behavior, it is trying to determine the best model of human values that explains the observed behavior. Both cases create conditions for alignment of the AGI to suffer from Goodhart&#x2019;s curse and therefore diverge from actual human values by optimizing for something other than human values themselves, namely appearance of alignment as observed by humans and strength of model fit as measured by the AGI.</blockquote><p>Thus the mindless assumption is not as good a choice as it seems because it constrains the design space so much that it eliminates too many and possibly all solutions to AI alignment that might actually work and leaves us with only those too underpowered to work. Therefore I suggest we prefer to assume mindfulness since all else is not equal under Goodharting.</p><h1>Conclusions</h1><p>I am most excited about the method of tradeoff analysis presented in this work and seeing it applied to reasoning about possible AGI alignment schemes in particular and AI and existential risk mitigation interventions more generally. Even if you disagree with me on the object level analysis of the later sections I hope that you agree with me on the method and that we should be preferring false negatives to false positives in attempts to mitigate existential risks.</p><p>For example, I worry that some approaches to AI alignment like IRL, CIRL, IDA, HCH, debate, and kin make the wrong tradeoff by greater risking false positives to explore what might otherwise be false negatives. This kind of analysis offers a method to formalize arguments that these approaches may be more dangerous than alternatives and should be disfavored, or to show that these worries are misplaced because all else is not equal in some way that constrains the solution space such that we must explore otherwise dispreferred options. Thus perhaps we can better formalize our intuitions about why we think one method is a better choice than another, at least along the dimension of error in assessing the safety of these mechanisms, by following this methodology.</p>",

E.g. if one performs Solomonoff induction on the stream of camera inputs to a robot, what kind of short programs will dominate the probability distribution over the next input? Not just programs that simulate the physics of our universe: one would also need additional code to \"read off\" the part of the simulated universe that corresponded to the camera inputs. That additional code looks like epiphenomenal mind-stuff. Using this framework you can pose questions like \"if the camera is expected to be rebuilt using different but functionally equivalent materials, will his change the inputs Solomonoff induction predicts?\" or \"if the camera is about to be duplicated, which copy's inputs will be predicted by Solomonoff induction?\"</p>\n<p>If we go beyond Solomonoff induction to allow actions, then you get questions that map pretty well to debates about \"free will.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/PXoWk554FZ4Gpfvah/causal-reference/comment/auu9giBwDFc9tFsZQ\">second comment</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The code simulating a physical universe doesn't need to make any reference to which brain or camera in the simulation is being \"read off\" to provide the sensory input stream. The additional code takes the simulation, which is a complete picture of the world according to the laws of physics as they are seen by the creatures in the simulation, and outputs a sensory stream. This function is directly analogous to what dualist/epiphenomenalist philosopher of mind David Chalmers calls \"psychophysical laws.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Carl's comments pose the questions you can ask/highlight the connection, but they don't answer those questions. I would be interested in references to other places discussing this idea, or answers to these questions.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my own confused thoughts (I'm still trying to learn algorithmic information theory, so I would appreciate hearing any corrections):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the camera is duplicated, it seems to take a longer program to track/read off two cameras in the physical world instead of just one, so Solomonoff induction would seem to prefer a bit sequence where only one camera's inputs are visible. However, there seems to be a symmetry between the two cameras, in that neither one takes a longer program to track. So right before the camera is duplicated, Solomonoff induction \"knows\" that it will be in just one of the cameras soon, but doesn't know which one. If we are using the variant of Solomonoff induction that puts a probability distribution over sequences, then the probability mass will split in half between the two copies' views. Is this right? If we are using the variant of Solomonoff induction that just prints out bits, then I don't know what happens; does it just flip a coin to decide which camera's view to print?</li>\n<li>If the camera is rebuilt using different but functionally equivalent materials, I guess it would be possible to track the inputs to the new camera, but wouldn't it be even simpler to stop tracking the physical world altogether (and just return a blank camera view)?</li>\n<li>In general, any time anything \"drastic\" happens to the camera (like a rock falling on it), it seems like one of the shortest programs is to just assume the camera stops working (or does something else that's weird-but-simple, like just \"reading off\" a fixed location without motion). But I'm not sure how to classify what counts as \"drastic\".</li>\n</ul>\n</body></html>",

There was a thing in antiquity called an engine, that used steam: “Hero’s engine”, also known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile\">aeolipile</a>. Some people see this and conclude that “steam engines existed in the 1st century” or that there’s no reason ancient Rome couldn’t have used this widely in industrial applications.</p><p>This is a mistake. The aeolipile is nothing like the steam engines of the 18th century and later: it’s a turbine, which means it is rotary, rather than using the reciprocating (back-and-forth) motion of a piston, as in <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/the-newcomen-steam-engine\">Newcomen’s engine</a>. Why does this matter? Because the aeolipile doesn’t generate enough torque for practical applications—<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=xlO_DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=aeolipile+torque&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OSOhKlrH16&amp;sig=ACfU3U2uwUK-3y1XXnmkv8dLaAxiqo6EeA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwij_q675PnnAhXEvZ4KHXcHAS0Q6AEwCnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aeolipile%20torque&amp;f=false\">one analysis</a> says that Watt’s engine generated a <i>quarter of a million</i> times more torque.</p><figure><img src=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/img/old-bess.jpg\"><figcaption><i>Newcomen's steam engine</i></figcaption></figure><p>Even before finding that analysis, I had an hunch it would be the case—indeed, that’s how I knew to search for “aeolipile torque”, which led me to that link on the first page of Google results. My intuition was based on a few things. First, if a simple, primitive turbine like the aeolipile could be put to practical use, why didn’t anyone reinvent it in the 18th or even 17th century? Why did Newcomen, Watt, and others focus on much more complicated piston engines? They were smart people and were obviously working hard on the problem, it seems impossible that such a simple solution would have escaped all of them. Second, the aeolipile is small—Hero’s sketch above shows it sitting on a table—but Newcomen’s engine was very large, to the point where a separate shed would be built to house one. Why did the engine have to be that large if a tiny one would do?</p><p>Again, a precise understanding of each invention will uncover relevant details like this. A <i>concept</i>, such as “an engine (of any type) that uses steam (in any way)”, is not enough.</p><p>This example also illustrates a second principle: <i>practicality matters</i>. A device that works in theory, but is too underpowered, inefficient, expensive, or unreliable, might as well not exist for practical purposes. It must work not only for a demonstration, but for real, human, economic needs, in the context of consumers’ lives, industrial processes, or business operations. Because of this, a difference in <i>degree</i> can become a difference in <i>kind</i>, when an invention crosses a threshold of practicality.</p><figure style=\"width:35.19%;\"><img src=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/img/edison-light-bulb.jpg\"><figcaption><i>Edison's light bulb&nbsp;</i><br><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/78162759@N06/13889854200\"><i>Filip Mishevski / Flickr</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>As a side note, this is why it’s perfectly accurate to say that Edison’s lab invented the light bulb, even though there were other light bulbs before it: they were too expensive (e.g., using platinum filaments), or they burned out quickly and thus needed to be replaced too often. In my opinion, it’s redundant to say that someone invented “the first practical X”—this is the same as saying they invented X. To invent something <i>is</i> to invent a practical version of that thing. If your “invention” is impractical, it’s just a demo or prototype. This can be useful to test ideas or to communicate possibilities, but it’s the <i>practical</i> inventions—the ones that actually remove <i>all</i> the obstacles to widespread use—that move history.</p><figure><img src=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/img/aerial-screw.jpg\"><figcaption><i>da Vinci's “aerial screw”&nbsp;</i><br><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leonardo_da_Vinci_helicopter.jpg\"><i>Wikimedia</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Another example of this is the computer. The computer was invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania; their first model was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC\">ENIAC</a>, completed in 1945. It was a breakthrough because it was the first <i>fully electronic</i> computer, and this made it much <i>faster</i> than previous attempts, such as the IBM <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I\">Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator</a> (ASSC, aka the Harvard Mark I), which was electromechanical, using magnetic relays. Based on the speeds for these machines given by Wikipedia, the ENIAC was about 600 times faster than the ASSC at division and over 2,000 times faster at multiplication. (The ENIAC was also over 2,000 times faster than a <i>human</i> using a mechanical calculator at calculating a ballistic trajectory, implying that the ASSC was probably not much faster than a human.) The ASSC was an interesting demo that got some press; the ENIAC was the machine that ignited the computer revolution. Again, a difference in degree becomes a difference in kind. (Going even further back, other predecessors such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atanasoff%E2%80%93Berry_computer\">Atanasoff–Berry computer</a> or Konrad Zuse’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)\">Z3</a> were also much slower than the ENIAC, and had other practical limitations. And Babbage’s “computer” was only a concept with an unfinished design that could never have been built with the technology of the day—which is why, despite my respect for his genius, I cannot regard Babbage as the inventor of the computer, any more than da Vinci was the inventor of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_inventions_of_Leonardo_da_Vinci#Flight\">helicopter</a>.)</p><figure style=\"width:64.62%;\"><img src=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/img/eniac-changing-tube.jpg\"><figcaption><i>Changing a tube on the ENIAC&nbsp;</i><br><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ENIAC-changing_a_tube.jpg\"><i>Wikimedia</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>If you want to argue that something could not have been invented before a particular “gate”, I regard this kind of history as the epistemic gold standard: strong economic motivation (and in the case of computers, military motivation in the context of WW2); multiple prior attempts, including some completed projects that were working and reasonably well-publicized; a measurable difference in a key practical dimension (in this case, speed); and an enabling technology that made a significant difference along that dimension (in this case, approximately three orders of magnitude). For this reason I confidently say that the computer—again, it’s redundant to say “practical computer”—could not have existed before the invention of the vacuum tube amplifier in 1907. (It’s plausible, but less certain to me, that it could not have existed until even later, when improved, more reliable vacuum tubes were invented. Plausible, because the ENIAC used over 17,000 tubes, and reliability was a concern among the engineers; less certain, because I don’t know of any failed attempt at building a fully electronic computer with less-reliable tubes, and because some statements from engineers indicate that reliability was less of a problem than feared, particularly if the tubes were operated continuously, to avoid thermal stress. So it might be that, after 1907, all that was holding back the engineering was a key insight.)</p><figure style=\"width:52.7%;\"><img src=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/img/draisine.jpg\"><figcaption><i>Karl Drais's Laufmaschine&nbsp;</i><br><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Draisine_or_Laufmaschine,_around_1820._Archetype_of_the_Bicycle._Pic_01.jpg\"><i>Wikimedia</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, if you want to argue that something <i>could</i> have been invented much earlier than it was, you have to do better than glancing at its high-level concepts or components. You need to rigorously examine every part, material, and manufacturing process, and rule them <i>all</i> out as gating technologies. Any detail, even a minor one, can become crucial—especially when we remember that inventions need not only to work but to be practical, which includes performance, reliability and cost. As an example, in my <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-bicycle\">analysis of the bicycle</a>, I described the first proto-bicycle, known as the “draisine” or “Laufmaschine”, as being made of wood with iron tires—both ancient technologies. However, Nick Szabo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1227039191046836224\">pointed out to me</a> that it <a href=\"https://www.smartmobility.london/blog/2019/karl-drais-how-the-year-without-a-summer-inspired-the-bike\">reportedly used brass ball bearings</a>, a much newer technology, which might have been essential to reduce friction.</p><p>A related question: how <i>surprised</i> should we be that it took X years for invention Y after enabling technology Z? Inventions do not spring forth <i>immediately</i> upon becoming possible: ideas and information take time to spread, experiments are required, funding must be secured, laboratories organized, materials obtained; and at end of the day all this is performed not by automata or some clockwork mechanism, but by unpredictable individuals with their own vision, inspiration, hopes and fears, operating in complex network of teams, contracts, partnerships, and other social structures. Even in the best of circumstances, a gap of a decade or more from a key enabling technology to the commercial release of an invention is not surprising; if the enabler is a scientific discovery, two or three decades does not surprise me. And chance can intervene—the path to an invention can be derailed by a sudden disease, a financial panic, a war.</p><figure style=\"width:62.5%;\"><img src=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/img/cotton-gin.jpg\"><figcaption><i>Eli Whitney's cotton gin&nbsp;</i><br><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cotton_gin_EWM_2007.jpg\"><i>Wikimedia / Tom Murphy VII</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>In general, I think we should be <i>more</i> surprised at long gaps for inventions that have obvious, predictable impact on major industries. For this reason, the <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-cotton-gin\">cotton gin</a> and the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@antonhowes/is-innovation-in-human-nature-48c2578e27ba\">flying shuttle</a> are more compelling gaps to me than the wheeled suitcase, <a href=\"https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-where-be-dragons\">role-playing games</a>, or the <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-bicycle\">bicycle</a>, which merely offer convenience or entertainment. I think we should also expect longer gaps in places and times that had lower population, less education, less economic surplus (to fund R&amp;D), fewer or less effective financing mechanisms (such as venture capital), less political stability, etc.</p><p>My model for this is that innovation, at a societal level, is a stochastic process, with some parameters set by the environment and others by the particular invention in question. The more “pressure” there is to solve a problem (economic motivation), and the more opportunities there are for it to get solved (educated, inventive individuals or organizations, with time, space, materials, and funding, in a context of good legal institutions and political stability), the sooner you expect the leap to be made and the shorter a gap. In the limit, you get simultaneous invention, of which there are many stories (although some are overplayed, in part for the reasons discussed above regarding what counts as an “invention”). Some economics grad student could probably get a PhD thesis out of formalizing this model and fitting the parameters to data—both to quantify the “inventiveness” of a given place and time, and to identify outlier inventions that were truly, measurably, “behind their time.”</p></body></html>",

Most strongly coupled parts of the system enable as a whole, and that gives you a sense of the object. We can describe that part as a graph of objects that we named &quot;Knowledge Graph.&quot;</li><li>Information about that activations goes by another neuronal path to our Attention Filter. We don&apos;t copy the whole object. We receive a reference.</li><li>Our attention looks at the references it received and check their combinations with other references we already have in working memory, using recall mechanisms. </li><li>Our working memory is what we can &quot;see&quot; by some part of our model that we name &quot;I.&quot;</li><li>By choosing the most strong signals, we travel our Knowledge Graph and try to bind together two parts of it that currently disconnected. That&apos;s how we solve problems.</li><li>When we have a problem, we feel curious. If we can&apos;t solve it for a long time - we losing patience, and that&apos;s how we abort the task. Curiosity feeling - is what helps us to move. Motivation points. Patience is what helps us to stop solving tasks that seem useless to our brains.</li><li>To notify us about task solving results, we have regulation mechanisms. If we solved a problem - we feel inspired. If our solution gives us a result that was predicted - we&apos;ll feel high. But if our Answer was wrong, if we had expectations that were not supported sensory - we will feel disappointed. </li><li>All that regulation mechanisms enable L-LTP that allows us to remember results for a long period.</li><li>If you try to use something that will solve the problem of bad feelings without finding it cause - you can run into addiction circle. Remember, in most cases, feeling yourself bad means that you have some problems. Sometimes it becomes a separate problem that will disturb you from finding a cause. In that case, you can use something to release your pain, but irresponsible usage of painkillers will lead to another problem. That&apos;s because your brain will try to bind painkiller as a solution and will remember it.</li><li>To find a way out from the circle that became your problem or to prevent its creation, you can use your Curiosity. It will switch your attention from disappointment and will lead you to the solution.</li></ol><p>One small picture with 4 main parts. A couple of arrows.

I&apos;ve been waiting for it. I had an expectations model, and when I saw it, my regulation system activated. The feelings and the situation were stored by long-term memory because connections in my Knowledge Graph were saved as-is by L-LTP.  On the opposite, when I was preparing exams, I only coupled some objects using Hebb-s rule and E-LTP mechanism.</p><p>Why do I learn texts of songs and poems so smoothly? What differs from prose? And how does this difference helps me keep poetry in mind? </p><p>-Because poetry and songs have patterns that activate when you are listening to them. We are trying to predict this pattern, and we get it. And our brain activates reward mechanisms and L-LTP. That&apos;s why we love them and can remember well. Also, patterns help our attention to successfully predict results, so we don&apos;t lose patience. </p><p>Why Feynman Lectures on Physics are enjoyable for me but a physics book from the university library - not? Why can I read the HPMoR in two evenings, without any breaks?</p><p>-Because of Feynman Lectures on Physics and HPMoR well-written things, that provide me enough information to bind them with my experience. I receive a reward for reading them that gives me motivation points. They also talk to me in the language of questions and puzzles. They make me feel curious. And that provides another buff for my motivation. </p><p>And physics books from the library don&apos;t do it. I am looking at formulas, that hang in the space of my mind. I can&apos;t connect them with real experience.  I am trying to understand them, try to join to things I know, and each second decreases patience. Limit exudes, I throw the book out and start reading a feed of some IT-site because I am out of resources and need something easy to understand, to increase my motivation.</p><p>How to learn something effectively?</p><p>-Connect it with as much experience, as it could be, formulate a Question that will make you fill curious and do your best to answer it.

Recontextualize old content and describe how you&apos;ve updated on it instead of just hiding the uncomfortable beliefs of the past; that seems like the more honest and mature thing to do. </p>",

Let&apos;s take a look at our task:</p><ol><li>We know that memories are coupled subnetworks in the Knowledge Graph.</li><li>We know that what we can recall them using our Working memory.</li><li>We understood the regulation mechanism that motivates us to do it. We also realized it&apos;s binding with Late Long-Term Potentiation, which allows us to store data for long periods.</li><li>We know that we can receive signals about activations of memory parts. And their strengths. </li></ol><p>How to select what signal or Reference will pass the spam-filter of attention? What criteria for filtering will we use? How should it work in terms of activations in neurons?</p><p>Let&apos;s take a simple example. Please fill blank spaces, and try to observe how are you doing that: </p><ol><li>The whale shark is ... than elephant</li><li>The ... is smaller than Jupiter.</li><li>Do you ...? </li></ol><p>I am quite sure that it was like that:</p><ol><li>Bigger or smaller? I don&apos;t know. The average whale is bigger. That&apos;s obvious. But whale shark?</li><li>Guy, are you serious? There are a lot of things smaller than Jupiter. All the planets in the solar system smaller than it!</li><li>Do I what? Oh, I understood, you&apos;ve gone completely mad. </li></ol><p>What you were doing is creating hypotheses. Bigger or smaller? What planet did he mean? Had he gone mad? You&apos;ve been trying to explain what is happening with the information you&apos;ve had. You&apos;ve been trying to guess.</p><p>And you always do it! While watching serials, while talking with someone, while trying to choose between chocolate and strawberry ice-cream, reading this sequence of articles. </p><p>But how to describe the prediction you making and how to choose between them? </p><p>Prediction is an easy one thing - you have information, you activate object in the knowledge graph, you receive the results of your mind-search. The activations had some power; we choose the strongest of them and... And here, we have a problem because we want different meanings for the same things in different contexts.</p><p>Context is what we currently think about, so let&apos;s simplify it to object-references in our Working Memory. </p><p>How should work the filter that has one reference that is context, and a bunch of other references that could be related to this object? How to pass only meaningful, only bound references?</p><p>Bound. BOUND! </p><p>What if filter coactivates all the references by pairs, looks on results, and chooses the strongest signals? That will allow it to filter complete junk, that will explain the context-dependency of meanings. </p><p>It doesn&apos;t require any complex mechanism to check all the pairs.</p><p>So, your attention is responsible for recalling objects by references. But not only objects you are working on now, but all the possible combinations of neighbors activations! And the references to the strongest activation patterns replace your current references in WM.</p><p>But here comes another problem. Why don&apos;t we always think about the same thing? Why do we stop? </p><p>I think attention can signal the regulation mechanism that it&apos;s frazzled out with that task. What do we feel talking to someone and see that he even doesn&apos;t try to understand us? Why do we stop listening to the monotonous voice of our chemistry teacher? We are losing patience. And it seems that it&apos;s kind of notification that we are doing a useless job. We are losing interest. It&apos;s the opposite process to regulate curiosity.</p><p>And that was the last part of our puzzle.</p><p>Let&apos;s assemble it!</p>",

But don&apos;t worry about it too much, this article is about it. </p><p>I know that feeling confused is not the best feeling. I know how does it hurt if you realized that you were wrong. I&apos;ve been feeling that many times in my life. If you haven&apos;t received at least A+ - you were wrong. The other marks only show your current level. Let me explain what happened: </p><p>We hadn&apos;t understood what the Filter is in the previous part. We don&apos;t have an explanation. The only thing that we did - we connected it to the word you know: attention. I&apos;ve created a circle reference, that doesn&apos;t look like a circle to your brain. It was not an accident. I was realizing what am I doing. And the exam is passed by you, only if you had predicted that it was an exam. But there is nothing bad if you hadn&apos;t. It was only a little game. And it&apos;s purpose is to be an example of what&apos;s happening during that kind of situation.</p><p>If you have a strong wish to justify yourself - you can try. I can give you a list of fine excuses: &quot;It was a trick! I was tired! I&apos;ve been reading your dumb article the whole day!&quot;. But it seems to me that in that case, you&apos;ll realize that you are tricking yourself. Is it better to be fooled double? Does usage of this workaround worth feeling better once? </p><p>And if you thought like: &quot;No, it never worth it&quot; - I&apos;ve tricked you again. And more - writing that paragraph, I was thinking that excuses are wrong, and found that I am fooling myself. </p><p>The truth is - sometimes they are the only acceptable solution.</p><p>But while using them, you should be very careful.</p><p>Last summer, I was in depression. That&apos;s how it looks from inside: walking in circles of judging yourself for your mistakes. Without any hope to find an exit. Nothing makes sense. You&apos;re looking at the gift from your girlfriend and think: &quot;Right now, I should be happy.&quot;  But there is no feeling of happiness. It doesn&apos;t make any sense to be happy. And that thought makes you fall. Now there is no Wonderland in the end. It&apos;s the deep, dark, hopeless pit, and you&apos;ll never reach the bottom.</p><p>Do you think that the policy of &quot;no excuses&quot; will be the thing that kind of person needs? </p><p>You&apos;ll never judge anyone who will ask for novocaine before tooth-removal. It&apos;s normal. And use excuses when you can&apos;t overcome your pain is reasonable too. Pain is the signal about the problem. But there are a lot of situations when the signal is too strong. And that becomes a problem by itself. </p><p>Anesthesia of excuse makes you feel better. But it never solves your main problem. It only decreases discomfort. And if you use justifying as your primary strategy, you will, again and again, find yourself in the situations where you were before. You will feel bad. You will use excuses again. The connection between two parts of the brain: problem and your anesthetic will increase its power.  I am sure that you heard about that kind of mechanism. It&apos;s an addiction. If you don&apos;t try to find a cause of your problem - you&apos;ll find yourself in another circle.</p><p>When you have a strong feeling -  your brain notifies you that something remarkable happens. And when it happens brain tries to remember that. It binds your feelings with your current state. It activates Late Long-Term Potentiation. </p><p>And addiction circle is a bloody strong combo of feelings. You had failed, and your brain had activated L-LTP to not forget about it. You are feeling discomfort because, in your brain&apos;s opinion, you&apos;ve been wrong. You use something to decrease the pain. The brain connects your discomfort to your &quot;solution&quot; because now you feel better. And L-LTP enables again. The brain itself doesn&apos;t recognize that the solution was not found. It merely binds parts that have been activated during that process. It creates a circle.</p><p>That mechanism is built-in. Dumb well-known architecture issue.</p><p>And the only thing you can do is create a separate model. It should coactivate with your wrong pattern. It should recognize what your brain does. Immediately. It should interrupt the connection establishment. </p><p>That&apos;s how you&apos;ll break the circle. That&apos;s what we mean by &quot;Rational.&quot; That&apos;s what allows you to become a little less wrong.</p><p>But how to build that model? How can we even start creating it? How to defeat the issue that&apos;s already integrated into our system? </p><p>What kind of power do we need to become strong enough to fight our legacy? What will make us break the circle and finally win? </p><p>What will allow us to outgrow ourselves? </p><p>You already have this power. And you are using it right now. </p><p>Didn&apos;t you get it? </p><p>I&apos;ll give you an answer. But before, I want to ask you to do your best to realize it by yourself.</p><p>What makes people move on? </p><p>Why do we continue searching for something? </p><p>What made us explore Mars? </p><p>Why do you reading this continuous sequence of questions?</p><p>How do you feel reading them? </p><p>What makes you wait for an Answer? </p><p>Curiosity.</p><p>And yep, I&apos;ve been really straightforward about Mars.</p><p>Are you still curious about what this article was about? Ok, that&apos;s enough, I&apos;ll simply explain:</p><p>This article was about things that regulate our problem-solving machine.</p><p>This article is about things that make us think that something is important: </p><ol><li>If you had expectations and realized that they were wrong - you&apos;ll feel faulty and will try to do something with it.  I don&apos;t know how exactly it enables, but I think that it&apos;s kind of dissonance between the model of the solution you have, and the results you have received. Clash of opposite signals. </li><li>If you solved some problem or made yourself think like the problem is solved - you&apos;ll feel good and will receive motivation points, and that also drives you to do something. It enabled when you connected two models.</li><li>Combining that two feelings with the usage of anesthetics make you addicted to them. Sometimes they are what you need, but use them responsibly!</li><li>You have another one regulation mechanism - curiosity. You feel so when you don&apos;t have a solution. It enables when two signals can&apos;t find a path to each other. </li><li>You can use signals about &quot;feeling bad,&quot; to make yourself curious. It&apos;s the skill that you can learn.</li></ol><p>That was the craziest part of our sequence. Right now, I am writing this, and I realize that I don&apos;t know how it will be to read it. Writing it was incredibly complex. It&apos;s was like playing all-in. I know that for you it was the hardest one too. You&apos;ve read it, and I want you to know: you won. And I won it also. I like the games that winnable for both sides. </p><p>But we still don&apos;t understand how does our attention work. Let&apos;s solve the last part of this puzzle.</p><p>*/</p><p>And even in the eye of storm </p><p>I want you keep in mind:</p><p>In your excuse, there&apos;s nothing wrong</p><p>But it won&apos;t win the fight.</p><p>Your pain released, you can stand up</p><p>And take the Curious Sword  </p><p>Escape the cyclone of your mind </p><p>Break through in clear world.</p><p>/*</p>",

I want you to know - you are great. And now I need your help. Take this Curious Sword - you&apos;ll need it, and in the end, you will understand why. Sorry, there is no time to explain it right now.</p><p>We need to filter references that Working memory (WM) will receive.</p><p>We can use:  </p><ol><li>The pool of references that are trying to get to our WM.</li><li>Current references in VM.</li><li>Information we have about our brain state.</li></ol><p>If the Working memory is empty, we can fill it with any reference. But let&apos;s choose an object that had &quot;strongest&quot; activation. The object is consists of other objects and their connections. Let&apos;s summarize the weights of connections that were providing the signal. And if they are related to some object - each additional point will increase its probability to win our race to WM.</p><p>But our problem is that our inbox that receives messages from other parts of the brain is never empty. You can&apos;t stop it. Even if you are not thinking, you will process the sensory information itself. That&apos;s the thing that allows you &quot;not to think.&quot;  You are replacing your thoughts with sensory information processing. That&apos;s a great exercise to improve the control on your filter, but Working Memory still won&apos;t free. I think if you find a way to achieve it, you&apos;ll get BSOD, and probably the last word in this acronym will be completely literal. </p><p>It seems like our current question is not the easiest one. Maybe we should collect additional information? Let&apos;s try to create a simple example.</p><p>Imagine that you are listening to music. That&apos;s what you are focusing on. Your expectation model is trying to predict the next chord. You are happy because you can do it, and so on. And suddenly your internet connection lost. Music stops. You have a problem. You are looking on the screen of your device, and it shows you &quot;No Network Available.&quot; In a panic, because today is the day then you needed to send the incredibly important presentation, you are trying to remember if you paid your ISP last month. Then something says &quot;Meow&quot; very close to the router. You realize that if you have a cat, it was not a great idea to put the cable on the floor. You stick the wire in the router, connection establishes, and music plays again. The problem is solved. </p><p>The first thing that we should realize is what we were doing during that situation. </p><p>You&apos;ve been listening to music, and everything was ok.</p><p>It suddenly stopped, you switched to from your thoughts on solving that problem.</p><p>You&apos;ve been filtering information and choosing only something that was related to your situation.</p><p>Then you solved the problem you returned to the normal state.</p><p>Hm. When we behave like that? How to describe the process? We were focusing on something... Focusing! It was an Attention!</p><p>So Filtering is simply an Attention! We finally understood it! </p><p>We have almost finished! Let&apos;s proceed to the next part.</p>",

We can remember something, and it looks like we have some control over it. I decided that I need to know how does the thing named &quot;I&quot; works with memory.<br> <br>And here, I remembered memory models. They don&apos;t fit for describing what happens inside, but now we can do it! We know about Long-Term Potentiation that allows us to remember things for short and long periods. We know about Hebb&apos;s rule. Maybe we can connect our experience with their description of the behavioral part, improve them, and create our one?<br><br>And so I decided to re-read about them. And there was one strange fact. The number of random things that people can remember at one time is not dependent on &quot;information size&quot;. <br>You can simply remember &quot;world&quot;, &quot;within&quot;, &quot;enormous&quot;, &quot;logging&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;workaround&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;<br>But if I will give you: 1, 5, 30, 94, 83, 18, 12, 48, 0, 43, 134 - you&apos;ll probably fail to remember them by reading one time. And the amount of information in that number row is much less than in word-sequence, no matter how you will count. <br>And yes, that random was like in XKCD: Random Number, but in real experiments, it wasn&apos;t.<br><br>We have one part of that puzzle. We organize information in the strongly coupled networks. Numbers were less coupled, there were more objects. But why does our &quot;UI/UX&quot; part even care about the number of objects?<br>If we were copying information, we shouldn&apos;t care about &quot;objects.&quot; <br><br>But who said that we copy it? <br>If we build an application, we have a simple UI part, that cares only about showing us information. And we have a powerful server behind it that solves complicated tasks. <br>What if all the solution is performing in the server part? What if &quot;Me&quot; only exists to choose the next task in a row? <br>What if our UI doesn&apos;t have enough memory to store the data? <br><br>The small amount of memory + evidence about different sizes of data retrieved + evidence about the constant amount of objects that can be extracted. <br><br>How should we build the system in those conditions? <br><br>If you are a programmer, you&apos;ll solve this puzzle quickly. <br><br>Did you get it?<br><br>To save memory, you should have only one instance of the object. <br>To retrieve information about that object, you&apos;ll need a Reference.<br>Adress in memory. And reference is much more lightweight than the object.<br><br>And that&apos;s a surprisingly good explanation for all that weird stuff about &quot;magic number 7&quot;. <br><br>In one of the models I&apos;ve seen, the memory we currently use was named Working Memory. And I think that&apos;s a nice name. <br><br>In our case, information retrieval will look like activation of the object in our Knowledge Graph. We activate one object, it activates other objects, we receive references to them and repeat the process. It&apos;s WORKING.<br><br>No, it&apos;s not. The problem is that by using this algorithm, we will receive complete junk in our working memory. And it will activate wrong objects, increasing the strength of connections between them. And, as we found previously, increasing wrong connections leads us to Wonderland.<br>We should carefully filter references before receiving something in the mail-box of our working memory.

    "htmlBody": "<p>A quick reminder about rules: We have a network of objects and two different parts of it activated at the same time. The connection between them hasn&apos;t established yet. If we try to increase the strength of the signal or reduce the activation threshold - we will receive a complete mess as an output. Our goal is to create a mechanism that will work only using existing information about the network. <br><br>Now I will add some mathematics to describe our problem with more formal language. There won&apos;t be any complicated stuff. We&apos;ve been already using it all this time, but haven&apos;t used this terminology. <br><br>First of all, let&apos;s rename our network of objects to Knowledge Graph. If &quot;graph&quot; sounds scary to you, or you feel like &quot;oh, it was that thing from discrete mathematics,&quot; - don&apos;t worry. I will quickly explain what it is and why our network is a graph.<br><br>The graph is a set of vertices and edges between them. Imagine circles and lines connecting them. <br>Vertices are circles. Lines are edges. <br>In our network, vertices are objects. Connections between them are edges. <br>We were talking about graphs all the time you are reading this sequence. But didn&apos;t call them so. And most of the time, we were talking about Oriented Weighted Graph. <br>Oriented means that instead of lines, we will use arrows. They show us how the signal can travel among the graph. If we have an arrow from the vertex (object), the signal can go from vertex-sender to vertex-receiver. <br>Weighted means that every arrow will have some number on top of it. In our case, it will be connection strength.<br><br>Graph theory is about finding some common rules for structures that can be described with vertices and edges. It answers questions like: <br>How can ve travel between vertices using edges? <br>Can we color vertices by some rule? For example, can we color graph the way no neighbors (connected vertices) won&apos;t have the same color? <br>And etc.<br><br>Here comes the trickiest part of all this stuff. Remember, how did we define objects? The strongly coupled subnetworks of neurons. Inside they are also graphs! So we have a Graph of graphs. And vertices of inner graphs can have their own &quot;independent&quot; connections. And that&apos;s why we can split the object &quot;Special Relativity&quot; to &quot;relativity&quot; and &quot;special&quot; parts, that have separate connections and meanings. We can travel to neighbors that are &quot;around&quot; objects or Go Deeper and explore &quot;subobjects.&quot; </p><p><br>We have a Knowledge Graph, that can be described mathematically as a graph there each object also can be a graph. Because of these words sound very complex, and I&apos;ve given you a promise that there won&apos;t be any too complicated stuff, let&apos;s forget about it and return to our well-known world with circles and arrows. So, let&apos;s not thinking about it. But thinking IS about it. Please don&apos;t keep it in mind. Damn, I love this language, my native one don&apos;t have such mindblowing potential. <br><br>To connect two objects that are not neighbors, we need to find a way for the signal. It will jump from one object to another, and we need something that will show it the direction.<br>I couldn&apos;t resist a rhyming &quot;graph&quot; and &quot;path&quot;: <br><br>A task we solving is well-known<br>In Theory of graphs,<br>To make connections between zones <br>We need to find a path. <br><br>That&apos;s how we can describe our problem using graph theory. We are trying to create some mechanism that will help signal to find the path in our Knowledge Graph.<br><br><br></p>",

It represents &quot;me right now.&quot; Our Problem differs from it and activates another part of our mental model. </p><p>How to describe the Problem in the language of coactivations? </p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking a lot and finally completed this puzzle. </p><p>There should be no path between coactivated parts. The signal should lose before the connection established.</p><p>Problem - is the disconnection between objects or models. Houston, we have a PROBLEM! </p><p>And in opposit of it we can define a solution:</p><p>We feel like we have solved the Problem when parts become connected. </p><p>Solution - is the established connection between parts of our model.</p><p>And that&apos;s a pretty good explanation on the question &quot;Why do people believe in weird things?&quot;. On the level we are now, there is no censor. We don&apos;t have a &quot;weird&quot; definition. We need to do additional work on ourselves to create a censoring model. Before it looks like: </p><p>-*Panic sounds* We don&apos;t know why the World exists!</p><p>-We have a Problem! Activate searching for Solution mode!</p><p>-We found an article that says that Aliens created the World.</p><p>-Do we have a connection? </p><p>-Yes, sir! The World exists because Aliens created it! </p><p>-Problem is Solved!</p><p>You recognized that behavioral model. At least, we are on the site that is about creating censor for yourself. This level doesn&apos;t care about circles and links to null. That&apos;s why we are wrong so many times.  </p><p>And that&apos;s why activation of the whole network won&apos;t work for solution-finding. You will find what&apos;s common between the Raven and Writing desk and start falling into Wonderland. If you want a more detailed description of what happens if we will decrease the activation threshold - search for &quot;Psychedelics effects&quot; and &quot;Schizophrenia/Mania symptoms&quot;. That is what you probably will feel if something will happen with the brain regulation system. </p><p>We defined Problem - the disconnection between objects. Found Solution - establishing the connection.  And we discussed why can&apos;t we increase the signal strength to find a solution - because we will get weird results. </p><p>Now our goal to connect two models. We need to add something that will do it for us.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<p>In the real world, there are no &quot;objects&quot; in the way we get used to feeling them. While working with computers, we map &quot;objects&quot; to bytes by compiling programs. And we use &quot;object&quot; word for different stuff: variables, functions, etc. If you will look from the physics point on your chair, there is no &quot;chair object.&quot; That&apos;s something even more complicated. But the &quot;objectivization&quot; of that complex &quot;something&quot; makes you don&apos;t care about all this philosophic stuff when you want to sit on it. I&apos;ve decided to find what represents an &quot;object&quot; in the world of neurons.</p><p>I&apos;d been playing with texts, words, letters, optical illusions for months.  That was driving my friends and colleagues mad. I&apos;ve been creating quizzes. I&apos;ve been asking them to finish phrases or read words without some lttrs. I&apos;ve been giving them examples like &quot;theory epigenetics memory&quot; and &quot;Epigenetics memory theory.&quot; Or &quot;relativity special&quot; and &quot;Special relativity.&quot; </p><p>I&apos;ve found that well-known pattern they were describing like &quot;one object,&quot; but if I had broken arrangement and decoupled it, they were describing it as a &quot;set of objects.&quot; </p><p>Decoupled and broken arrangement.  Sounds pretty similar to Hebb&apos;s rule!</p><p>To represent the model of each letter you are reading from your screen, we need to use thousands of neurons. Maybe more, I haven&apos;t tested yet. But there are about 80 billion of them in the brain.  And with that amount of free memory, thousands won&apos;t make a big deal. </p><p>And if two neurons can wire together - there should be strongly coupled subnetworks of thousands of them. And if we will activate enough parts of a subnetwork that will enable it whole. </p><p>If strongly-coupled networks exist, we should have a less strong connection in between. If we adapt Hebb&apos;s rule to subnetworks level, it will explain why people count &quot;Special relativity&quot; as one, but &quot;relativity special&quot; as two objects. Because one is a pattern that fires without any noticeable delay, and the other is not. </p><p>It also explains why do we see optical illusions. They provide us information that is enough to activate some patterns in our brain. And yep, that&apos;s why cartoon characters look normal. They have the only specific subset of patterns. The interesting thing - if you will try to add more details to them and will break the template - it will ruin all the magic. If you meet in reality some person with hair behind the eyes, I bet that it will be not cute, but scary.</p><p>I&apos;ve been proud of myself. I&apos;ve been making observations. I&apos;ve created a theory. I&apos;ve explained to myself what &quot;object&quot; is. </p><p>Object, or &quot;object feeling,&quot; is the result of activation of the strongly coupled subnetwork in the brain. </p><p>For objects, rules will stay nearly the same as for single neurons. Hebb&apos;s rule, E-LTP, L-LTP, will work for them. </p><p>We had defined objects. And now we have a right to use them. They no longer &quot;magic word.&quot; And this gives us Power: we can forget about neural subnetworks. If we know how objects behave, there is no need to remember how they work inside. </p><p>We can use them as our building blocks. At least as long as it suits our approximation. If it won&apos;t - we can decompose them to implementation level and work on it.</p><p>And if you&apos;ve had a feeling that I am missing something - you are great.  It took me much more time to notice it. </p><p>What&apos;s the problem: </p><p>Let&apos;s take two objects that can act for us like one object. If they fire together - wire together, how will we explain that this new object can have a completely different meaning for us? It should be like a summation of &quot;meanings,&quot; but instead, we receive a completely different. What more, we can rearrange the objects, and based on the same set, get two objects with different meanings. E-M-I-R and R-I-M-E, and other anagrams, for example. </p><p>There is a blank space in my model in this part. I am sure that to create and retrieve a &quot;new object&quot; from the set of others, we need a proper arrangement of activation. I am sure, that new object behaves independently from its parts.  But I don&apos;t know how to explain it on the language of neurons activations.</p><p>I have an idea that it&apos;s because of our connection between subnetworks is not single axon, but thousands of neurons. Activation of two connected subnetworks activates different &quot;neuronal paths&quot; between them, and that paths are new objects. </p><p>Good news, everyone - we are building a simple model, so let&apos;s skip this part. We will take a rule that strongly connected objects can organize into one and behave like one - it&apos;s our simplification. </p><p>If you have an idea, how does it works on neural networks level, it would be great if you&apos;ll share it. </p><p>That&apos;s it about objects. </p><p>It&apos;s Summarizing Time:</p><p>We defined the object as a coupled subnetwork. We agreed to use them as building blocks.</p><p>The list of things we know about them:</p><ol><li>Objects wire together nearly like single neurons. </li><li>For memorizing objects, we use E-LTP, which works on the previous rule for a short period.</li><li>By using L-LTP, we can remember them far longer.</li><li>Objects can be combined from other objects if they will strongly couple together. If it happened - the new object can act as an independent one. </li></ol><p>But there are a lot of things we don&apos;t know: </p><p>How L-LTP decides to start work? </p><p>Why don&apos;t we continuously remember something and can focus on one task? </p><p>What is the task in terms of our model? </p><p>Let&apos;s get to the processing part.</p>",

I&apos;ve never seen anything that looks similar to it. It makes me feel uncertain about if it&apos;s new or I missed something in my education. There won&apos;t be a lot of math formulas or tricky theorems. There won&apos;t be any complicated neuroscience. Of course, this model is strongly coupling with both. But one of the things I&apos;ve learned working on it: starting from complex formulas - won&apos;t work in most cases.  And I bet that at the end of this sequence you will better understand why.<br><br>As it usually happens, my path started from the Question.  More precisely, from a set of questions:</p><ul><li>Why can I remember Lego, that my parents gifted me on my 6th birthday, but can&apos;t remember that theorem of that guy, that I was learning for exams? </li><li>Why do I learn texts of songs and poems so smoothly? What differs from prose? And how does this difference helps me keep poetry in mind? </li><li>Why Feynman Lectures on Physics are enjoyable for me but a physics book from the university library - not? </li><li>Why can I read the HPMoR in two evenings, without any breaks?</li></ul><p>Some of them were more meaningful: </p><ul><li>How to learn something effectively? </li><li>How should I do my job? (I am an Android Software Engineer)</li><li>How to communicate with other people?</li></ul><p>And a bunch of other questions that had simple wording, but unfortunately hadn&apos;t got an Answer.<br><br>Ok, there were a couple of answers. Some of them were like circle-dependent. Some were not complete:</p><ul><li>How to learn something effectively? - Study hard.</li><li>How should I do my job? - You should write a clean code.</li><li>How to communicate with other people? - Interest them, listen to them, use your empathy. </li></ul><p>I tried to ask more questions to clarify what do those answers mean. To understand, how should a &quot;hard study&quot; work. Or how to interest people. Where is the switch that enables &quot;Interested mode&quot;?<br><br>That switch should be somewhere in the brain. I had pretty strong evidence that people I was talking to had them. And they have been using brains to answer their questions. <br><br>If so, I can use mine to answer my Question!<br><br>I&apos;ve decided that my little research should start with memory. I thought: &quot;Working with information - is about operations with memory. If you don&apos;t know how does data store - how could you describe what happens with it? And that seems like that&apos;s not a numerous problem. I&apos;ve heard about memory models.&quot; <br><br>I&apos;ve opened Google to explore the world of memory models and find an answer.</p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>With the recent virus scare, I've become more interested in hand sanitizers because even for \"airborne\" viruses, most transmission happens through contact with surfaces, so hand hygiene is very important. I came across one called Armor Mist that claims to work for 24 hours with a single application. (The label only says \"12+ hours\", the 24-hour \"or ten hand washings\" figure is from the FAQ on their website.) This sounds too good to be true (but so was the smallpox vaccine), so I'm not sure.</p>\n<p>I'm rational enough to spot and avoid obvious woo with no plausible mechanism of action (like homeopathy), but once it passes that bar, I become really uncertain. The sonic mosquito repellers, for example, had me going for a while. The claim was that it mimicked the sound of a predator, like the wing-beats of a dragonfly. In principle, it could have worked. There's a plausible mechanism of action compatible with both biology and physics. There are also examples of using fake predators to control other pests. However, it turns out that mosquitoes are pretty much deaf and these are <em>completely ineffective</em>. That it seems to work at all is pure confirmation bias for those times that you happen to not encounter mosquitoes, and placebo because you can \"hear it working\". (In my case, during a camping trip, I was lucky to hear a report in-person from someone who tried using one instead of spray and got bites, so I never bought one.) Not only is this a waste of money, it's dangerous to rely on a defense that doesn't work if that means not using one that does (like bug spray).</p>\n<p>Armor Mist does have a plausible mechanism of action. The active ingredient on the label is benzalkonium chloride 0.1% (BZK), which is a surfactant used as a preservative. It probably does kill bacteria. But how effectively and for how long? And does it work on coronavirus or influenza? They claim it works like a catalyst and is not consumed in the process--you only have to reapply because your skin naturally sloughs off over time. They also mentioned something about a positively-charged polymer. I have found some similar-looking BZK-based hand sanitizers, like Zylast and Germfree24. Zylast only claims to last for 6 hours though.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the FDA recently banned triclosan in soap due to questionable safety and effectiveness, along with a number of other antiseptics. BZK was also up for review around the same time, but was not banned with the others (yet). Like the sonic repeller, a defense that doesn't work is a danger if that means not using one that does (like alcohol-based sanitizer).</p>\n<p>How should a rationalist go about evaluating claims like this?

But suppose it does come out that between 2.5% to 10% of the world population will die. What are likely results?</p><p>I have speculated some of the following. Let me know whether anyone here would agree with my tentative reactions. If the death rate is towards the upper end of 10%, my reactions are probably conservative as I see worse things also happening. Individually I expect each to happen with &gt;50% probability conditional on the above death rate:</p><ul><li>Net negative GDP growth for 2020, with a 5% or more contraction, making this pandemic much worse than <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG\">any financial crisis</a> in recent memory (including the 2008 financial crisis). </li><li>Scientific progress is slowed down, and some technologies take a few more years to come out than they otherwise would have. These include artificial intelligence, plant based meats, anti-aging medicine. This is good if you think that the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FS6NCWzzP8DHp4aD4/do-earths-with-slower-economic-growth-have-a-better-chance\">serial time for AI safety</a> must be lengthened, but bad if </li><ul><li>you thought that the longer we persisted in our current high-risk period of history, the lower chance we have of surviving</li><li>you worry about value drift from current norms about AI safety, or society more generally</li><li>you personally wanted to live until some technological achievement.</li></ul><li>Life expectancy will drop into the mid 70s in developed countries. </li><li>Most people will know several people who died of the coronavirus, especially if you knew a lot of old people. </li><li>A global day of remembrance is declared, and the history books have an entire section on this year as being pivotal in some aspects of world history.</li><li>The funding for the CDC is multiplied by at least a factor of five. </li><li>Comprehensive bipartisan legislation is passed that employs tens of thousands of people to continuously monitor the threat of viruses of this magnitude in the future.</li><li>Lasting injury from the coronavirus is a major disability in the world, and is viewed somewhat akin to how people view polio victims even after polio leaves a community.</li><li>More young students (&gt;100% increase) want to study epidemiology because they are told that it&apos;s a major way to help people in the future, similar to how people are currently being directed into environmental fields as a way to help with climate change.</li><li>Questions about whether we are taking a current outbreak &quot;seriously&quot; will be the main thoughts on the mind of nearly everyone, including TV anchors, continuing for decades after the event. Here I imagine if a virus sprang up again in some part of the world, world leaders would immediately declare emergency and say that they don&apos;t want it to &quot;Turn into 2020&quot; or something like that.</li><li>Lasting outcry from people who believed that regulation or poor leadership slowed the development of a vaccine or antiviral spawns a political movement to speed up such things in times of crisis.</li><li>By November, virtually all political discussion is about the coronavirus, and relatively little airtime is given to other causes. Biorisk remains a major issue in the next few presidential elections.</li><li>Intense criticism of the Chinese regime first for censoring people who spoke about the virus, and then for offering the world optimism when there was none, will be a critical issue, leading to riots and perhaps attempted revolutions. </li><li>A one time significant political realignment towards people who are young.</li></ul><p>Can you come up with anything else?</p>",

However, I haven't been able to say with certainty because there's huge potential for placebo effects. Starting tomorrow, I'll be conducting a (99%) blinded experiment to test whether drinking regular vs. decaf coffee has a detectable effect on my mood and alertness.</p>\n<p>I intend to record the metrics I describe in the next section under the 'Data collection' heading of this post and will also report results here once the experiment is over. I'll make data from my Quantified Mind experiment (discussed below) available as well in CSV format.</p>\n<p><em>See something wrong with this experiment plan, my analysis, and/or my results? Email me at <a href=\"http://first.last+blog-at-gmail.com\">first.last+blog-at-gmail.com</a> (see top left header for spelling) or comment on this post!</em></p>\n<h2>Experiment</h2>\n<h3>Preparation</h3>\n<p>To prepare for the experiment, I split 2 weeks' worth of coffee (7 days of decaf, 7 days of regular) into 14 bags. After I split the coffee into 14 bags, my lab assistant (girlfriend) sorted them into a random order (with labels for each day) by flipping a coin to decide whether that day's coffee would be regular or decaf.</p>\n<h3>Procedure</h3>\n<p>Starting tomorrow, for the next 14 days, I'll make my coffee using the grounds from the labeled bags and track a few subjective metrics three times a day (right after having coffee, at 1 PM, and at 6 PM):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alertness (1-5 scale): loosely defined as how tired and sleepy I feel.</li>\n<li>Sharpness (1-5 scale): the opposite of 'fogginess'.</li>\n<li>Mood (1-5 scale): a coarse-grained measure of how 'good' I feel emotionally.</li>\n<li>Headache (yes/no): I get headaches if I don't have coffee in the morning, so it will be interesting to see whether I get them on decaf days even when I don't know the coffee is decaf.</li>\n<li>Regular vs. decaf day (regular/decaf): \"Given how I feel today, do I think this morning's coffee was regular or decaf?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;img src=\"<a href=\"http://an1lam.github.io/images/coffee_bags.jpg\">http://an1lam.github.io/images/coffee_bags.jpg</a>\" style=\"width: 400px; height:200 px;  clip: rect(0px,-60px,-200px,0px);\"&gt;</p>\n<p>I've also set up a <a href=\"http://www.quantified-mind.com\">Quantified Mind</a> (QM) experiment which will give me 8 minutes of cognitive tests each day and record my scores. I'll take these tests immediately upon finishing my coffee in the morning.</p>\n<h3>Materials</h3>\n<p>I'm using Swiss Water's version of <a href=\"https://www.swisswater.com/coffee-store/nightcap/\">Joe Coffee Nightcap Decaf</a> and <a href=\"https://joecoffeecompany.com/shop/colombia-la-familia-guarnizo/\">Joe Coffee Colombia La Familia Guarnizo</a> regular coffee both brewed in a Mr. Coffee drip coffee maker. I chose Swiss Water for decaf after reading that they do the best job of filtering out &gt;99% of the caffeine from the beans.</p>\n<p>For cognitive tests, I'm using QM's 8 minute \"coffee\" test that includes tests of executive function, working memory, and visuospatial something.</p>\n<h2>Confounders</h2>\n<h3>Sleep</h3>\n<p>Getting less than 7 hours of sleep affects how sharp I feel throughout the day and how awake I feel in the afternoon. Even though this is a randomized experiment, 14 days is short enough that were my sleep schedule to get interrupted, noise from sleep quality variance could easily overwhelm the signal from drinking regular vs. decaf coffee in the data. I plan to deal with this in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Track how much sleep I get each night (in number of hours). Unfortunately, I don't have a good sleep tracker so this will just be based on estimate of when I went to bed, how long it took me to fall asleep, and when I woke up.</li>\n<li>Avoid major sleep disruptions and sleep roughly the same number of hours each night.\nThat said, if 2 fails and my sleep schedule gets messed up during the experiment, I'll be much less confident in the results.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>(ETA on 03/02.)</em>\nIn the comments, Bucky points out that caffeine use may also impact sleep the next night, making the confounding even more complex. My current plan is to test for evidence of this when I do my analysis. Pre-registering that I'll be surprised if my one cup of coffee in the morning has much of an impact, but being surprised is the whole point of something like this!</p>\n<h3>Diet</h3>\n<p>Relative to sleep, I'm less convinced that regular dietary variation--i.e. eating relatively 'healthy' food and not being moribdly obese--has much of an effect on cognitive performance. But I still will keep my regular eating schedule of skipping breakfast and only having lunch and dinner as I suspect this will also help me keep a regular sleep schedule. To keep myself honest here, I'll track <strong>when</strong> I eat each day.</p>\n<h3>Internet Use</h3>\n<p><em>(ETA on 03/02.)</em></p>\n<p>I know this one seems weird but anecdotally, I've found procrastinating on the more addicting internet website (read: Twitter) causes me to feel a lot fuzzier for the rest of the day.</p>\n<h3>Caffeine Withdrawal</h3>\n<p><em>(ETA on 03/02.)</em></p>\n<p>In the comments, Issa Rice points out that caffeine withdrawal may begin anywhere between 12 and 24 hours after not having caffeine and peaks around 50 hours. This means that depending on the order of consecutive days, I may or may not go through full withdrawal, which would presumably impact my results.</p>\n<h3>Mood</h3>\n<p><em>(ETA on 03/02.)</em></p>\n<p>In the comments, Pattern points out that mood and events that affect it might affect the results. I've added a mood metric to my list of subjective metrics to track to prepare for this possibility.</p>\n<h3>Cognitive test practice effects</h3>\n<p>Given that I haven't been doing QM tests before the experiment to calibrate, there's a risk of practice effects dominating differences between caffeine and no caffeine days. I'm not totally sure how to deal with this yet, but isn't this the use-case for random effects regressions?</p>\n<h2>Analysis</h2>\n<h3>On not pre-registering in detail</h3>\n<p>Since I've been reading Gelman's wonderful <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/\"><strong>Bayesian Data Analysis</strong></a> and also view this study as a good candidate for a Bayesian approach due to the experiment having a small <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\" n \"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">n</span></span></span></span></span></span>, I intend to use Bayesian methods for my analysis. In an ideal world, I'd pre-register exactly what analyses I intend to do now (as of 03/01), but unfortunately, I'm still enough of a noob at this that I need to spend a good chunk of time reading about the right way to set up the analysis. For now, I'm recording the questions I want to answer below and will edit to add details of the analysis as I figure them out.</p>\n<p>I worry less than I normally would about post-hoc changing the analysis to find a significant result because I don't have strong incentives to find one. That is, I'm genuinely interested in the 'true' answer to the question and don't have a strong desire for it to be 'there's a big effect' or 'there's no effect'. Being transparent about the results of each stage of analysis should also help keep me honest. (Of course, I could always post-hoc choose not to share intermediate stages but again I don't think my incentives are to do that.)</p>\n<h3>High level plan</h3>\n<p>At a high level, I want to test the effect of regular vs. decaf coffee on alertness, sharpness, headaches, and my QM results. This is complicated by the fact that my prior is that the response variables I described above only share <strong>some</strong> common causes and that the causal effects of caffeine consumption differ between the response variables. For example, I suspect alertness and QM test scores are both affected by sleep quantity and coffee consumption but that alertness may also be impacted by other confounding variables like mood and plans for the day.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, I'll heavily rely on the most objective response variable, the QM results, to determine the magnitude of the 'true effect'. In causal terms, this is equivalent to assuming that sleep is sufficient for blocking all 'backdoor' paths between regular vs. decaf coffee and cognitive ability. I'm still measuring the other subjective variables because I'm curious to see how correlated they are with my QM results and each other and other want to leave open the possibility of doing other analyses that come to mind and seem interesting.</p>\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<p>This is currently (as of 03/01) a list of questions that I came up with for myself, but I'll also add answers to questions others raise in this section.</p>\n<h3>Isn't this too short?</h3>\n<p>As I mentioned, 14 days is short enough that even though the regular vs. decaf day assignments are randomized and blinded, the 'statistical power' of my results will be relatively weak. Two responses to this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From a decision-theoretic perspective, I mostly care about the easier to answer question of was the effect meaningful enough that I could accurately detect whether the coffee I had that day was regular or decaf conditional on what I know about my sleep and other factors.</li>\n<li>I'm going to use Bayesian methods and will be more than willing to label the results 'inconclusive' if my analysis results in a diffuse posterior.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Why '99%' blinded?</h3>\n<p>I'm calling this 99% blinded because there is a slight visual difference between the two coffee grounds that I could in theory detect while making my morning coffee. By making my coffee in the dark (I do this already) and having the bags pre-sorted so I barely have to look at them, I hope to minimize the likelihood of 'de-blinding' the experiment. I tried to minimize the likelihood further by buying identical decaf and regular grounds but unfortunately couldn't find a seller that sold the same beans in decaf and regular. In lieu of that, I settled for buying beans from the same region with the same flavor profile (I also don't have very good taste sense) so as to limit the difference to a visual one.</p>\n<h2>Data Collection</h2>\n<p>Recording subjective metrics and sleep duration in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ciHzwCNF3S3QsSSyO6hZ-OdDL1dyl4uBHabsP75RqDE/edit?usp=sharing\">this Google spreadsheet</a> (to make export to CSV easy).</p>\n<p>Below, I'm also recording miscellaneous observations.</p>\n<h3>Observations</h3>\n<h4>Day 7 (03/09)</h4>\n<h5>Quantified Mind Practice Effects</h5>\n<p>My Quantified Mind results are definitely improving in large part due to practice effects. This is in spite of my trying to use the same strategies for the different tests rather than improve them. For example, there's a test in which I have to select a number between 1 and 9 based on a picture and on the first day I set up my hands such that my pinky was on the 0 (which isn't an option in the test). This positioning is unnatural for me and in hindsight I should have started with my pinky on the 9. But, to keep things consistent and prevent unnecessary confounding, I've stuck with my original hand positioning for all subsequent tests.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<h3>Qualitative Observations</h3>\n<p>I'm done! Made it through the withdrawal headaches. I haven't done much analysis yet but here are a few of my initial observations, some of which I won't be able to verify with analysis.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I did pretty well at identifying which days were caffeine vs. decaf days. I only made two mistakes and one of them I had a hunch I was wrong in hindsight.</li>\n<li>Decaf days affected my actual subjective productivity less than expected. The main beneficial effect of caffeine seemed to be that it lowered the activation energy for me to get started on tasks and on days in which I'd slept well seems to add a certain 'sharp' quality to my thinking.</li>\n<li><strong>Sleep matters.</strong> This I'm hopeful I'll be able to get at least some signal on. Anecdotally, especially if we ignore the headaches (which were a result of withdrawal not drinking decaf coffee in general), the difference in all my subjective metrics seemed to correlate much more with how much sleep I got before than with regular vs. decaf coffee.</li>\n<li>Caffeine may not help me do better when sleep deprived. As mentioned above, I do notice a small subjective positive effect on my 'sharpness' when I sleep really well, have caffeine, and fast (which I do most days until lunch). On the other hand, on days on which I got &lt;7 hours of sleep (happened before both caffeine and decaf days), I felt like caffeine either made no difference or made me a bit more awake at the cost of making my cognition even fuzzier. I highly doubt this will show up in the Quantified Mind metrics in any detectable way but I wanted to note it as a hypothesis that I've very interested in as part of my <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Jvr9LubnvhhP6EvvN/what-are-effective-strategies-for-mitigating-the-impact-of\">general interest in mitigating the effects of sleep deprivation</a>.</li>\n<li>Credit to Issa Rice for pointing out that this would be an issue when I proposed the experiment. Withdrawal did turn out to be a bit of an issue although not enough of one (IMO) to mess up the results of the experiment. My first decaf sequence was two days in a row and in the afternoon I got a <em>bad</em> withdrawal headache that was resistant to Ibuprofen. On later decaf days, I took Ibuprofen at the first sign of a headache and this seemed to largely mitigate withdrawal symptoms. Of course this does confound my headache tracking a bit, but I view it as worth it in order to try minimize the effect of withdrawal on other metrics.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(Where I'll record graphs and other summary statistics.)</p>\n</body></html>",

There is still more work to do, but I will likely resume on March 7th.</p>\n<p>Edit: March 7th is a lie. Probably will be another week or two until time permits.</p>\n<p>Later Edit: Turned out to be closer to 5 weeks than 2 weeks. There's something ironic about falling prey to the planning fallacy when trying to write about applied rationality, although applying my normal 2x buffer would have still be a little too short.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Richard_Hamming\">Richard Hamming</a> was a mathematician at Bell Labs that really liked to know lots of stuff. As <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html\">legend</a> has it, one of Hamming's favorite questions was \"what are the most important problems in your field?\" followed up with \"why aren't you working on them?\"</p>\n<p>The general category of \"Hamming Questions\" are questioned designed to get you to think about the biggest problems in your life. The next move is, of course, to try and solve them.</p>\n<h1>Hamming Questions</h1>\n<p>The required material is a non-brain device capable of holding information.</p>\n<p>The first hamming question is the obvious one: What's the biggest problem in your life? Take a minute or so to just think about what your biggest problem might be. There is a certain type of person that already sort of knows what the biggest problem in their life is, but can't quite look at it directly. This is a call for you to <em>look</em>.</p>\n<p>Now imagine that you're life is perfect. What's different in your perfect life compared to right now? Sometimes the biggest problem in your life is not quite a bug, but the lack of an extremely critical feature.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when people imagine that their life is perfect, they are still chained to notions like \"possible\" and \"realistic\". Abandon the shackles of your finitude and boundedness and imagine yourself as infinite and perfect as your imagine allows - what you would become if you were given five million years to grow and grow. Is there something in this world that makes your heart sing? If you were omnipotent and omniscient, what would you <em>do</em>?</p>\n<p>Now shift perspectives: imagine someone that's literally the same as you. What are the biggest problems in their life? Is there something obvious that your clone is missing? Sometimes looking at your life from the outside makes it easy to see your flaws.</p>\n<p>What would your trusted advisors say? Ask your copies of your friends/family/people whose blogs you read what the biggest problems in your life are. You might think that what they say is wrong, but it is worth it to think deeply about it. (You can also ask these people directly).</p>\n<p>In fantasy, wishing for more wishes is often a very powerful technique. Is there a way for you to wish for more wishes? Is there something that's stopping you from solving all of your problems in one fell swoop? Are you bottlenecked on a crucial resource? Would $10k make your life much better? How about 100 hours of time?</p>\n<p>If your life was a book and you were reading it, what pointless sidequest have you bumbled your way down? What are you doing instead of main quest? What is your equivalent of collecting the one hundredth lucky egg?</p>\n<p>Iron deficiency sometimes manifests as the consumption of large amounts of ice. What strange actions might you be taking that could signal a deeper problem? What about your behavior confuses you? <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/273Fg7Wig5ufTHpN6/training-regime-day-6-seeking-sense\">Seek sense</a> in yourself.</p>\n<p>Is there an easy way for you to 10x your future impact? Beware <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity\">scope insensitivity</a>.</p>\n<p>Say the phrase \"everything in my life is going fine\". Is there something that catches when you say that? What does that phrase make you think of?</p>\n<h1>Exercise</h1>\n<p>Hopefully, you now have an idea of what the biggest problems in your life are. Given that these are <em>the biggest problems</em> in your life, you should think very carefully and try very hard to try to solve them.</p>\n</body></html>",

For example, consider the following instance:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://s19.directupload.net/images/200301/3yrma9d7.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>Here is a possible clustering:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://s19.directupload.net/images/200301/5lsie89o.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>Here&apos;s another:</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://s19.directupload.net/images/200301/rk455yi2.png\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>According to the book, there is no &quot;ground truth&quot; when it comes to clustering, in part because there could be multiple meaningful ways to cluster any given data set. I would dispute that claim &#x2013; given a finite set of points, there trivially <em>has</em> to be an optimum clustering for any precise criterion. However, there is usually no way to evaluate how well this criterion has been met. Suppose you are given some data set, and run a clustering algorithm just to understand it a little better, without even knowing what you are looking for. There will be some clustering that provides you with an optimal amount of insight (otherwise, there wouldn&apos;t be any point in having nontrivial algorithms), but it is impossible to tell whether any given clustering is optimal. Furthermore, upon seeing one clustering, you will learn some things about the data, which <em>changes</em> the metric of which clustering is most informative next.</p><p>Changing metrics aside, learning clustering from training data seems possible in principle. One could input several training sets and their respective optimal clusterings according to human judgment. However, this would require a significantly more complex formalism than what we utilized for supervised learning. For example, the quality of the clustering could no longer be evaluated locally &#x2013; the same point might &quot;belong&quot; into a different cluster if the training set is extended.</p><p>The practical consequence is that one doesn&apos;t have a &quot;learner&quot; in the same sense (at least, the book doesn&apos;t discuss any such approaches). Instead, all one can do is to define various algorithms that seem to make intuitive sense. This makes our job simpler; all the clustering algorithms we&apos;ll look at are quite easy to understand. Consequently, and because there are pretty good resources out there, I&apos;ll mostly skip on describing the algorithms in detail and link to external resources instead.</p><h2>Formalizing the setting</h2><p>We assume our input is a<em> finite</em> <em>metric space</em>.

You might have heard the claim that &quot;there is no optimal voting system.&quot; This is based on something called <em>Arrow&apos;s impossibiltiy theorem</em>, and I&apos;m going to explain exactly what it means (this will be relevant for clustering in just a bit). Consider a situation where there are a bunch of candidates and a bunch of parties doing ranked-choice voting. Each party&apos;s vote is an ordered list of how much they like all candidates. Now some voting system evaluates these votes and outputs an ordered list of candidates as the result.</p><p>Consider the following properties such a system might have:</p><ul><li><strong>Non-dictatorship: </strong>there is no one party such that the system always outputs exactly the order this party submitted</li><li><strong>Independence of irrelevant alternatives: </strong>any party changing their order of <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"C\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;\">C</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"D\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">D</span></span></span></span></span></span> cannot change the system&apos;s order of A and B.

(If there are only two candidates, a majority vote with a deterministic way to break ties satisfies all three properties). The proof consists of taking a system that has properties #2 and #3 and showing that it is dictatorial (i.e., there is a party such that the system always outputs that party&apos;s submission). If one considers #1 and #3 to be essential (and #2 somewhat less so), Arrow&apos;s theorem can be summarized as &quot;in every reasonable voting system with more than two candidates, strategic voting must be a thing.&quot; These kinds of results are sometimes called <em>impossibility theorems</em>: we list a bunch of properties that all seem to make sense and then prove that they&apos;re incompatible. </p><p>For clustering algorithms, we have something similar, except that it&apos;s much less impressive because the properties aren&apos;t as obviously desirable. Nonetheless, it&apos;s worth bringing up. The properties are</p><ul><li><strong>Scale-invariance:</strong> multiplying all positions with a constant factor doesn&apos;t change the clustering</li><li><strong>Consistency</strong>: moving a point closer towards all points in a cluster cannot cause it to be dropped from that cluster, and moving it farther away from all points in a cluster cannot cause it to become part of that cluster</li><li><strong>Richness: </strong>any clustering is possible (for some distance function)</li></ul><p>If the distance function measures euclidean distances in 2-dimensional space, then the last property says that, for any possible clustering, you can arrange your points such that the algorithm will return that clustering.</p><p>The impossibility theorem states that, while any two of these properties are achievable, no algorithm can achieve all three.</p><p>To me, consistency feels like an obvious requirement, but the other two less so.

    "htmlBody": "<p>As of February, 29, there were no official cases of coronavirus in Russia, except 3 cases from Diamond Princess and 2 older cases from China which recovered. This absence of the new cases seems statistically implausible given around 100 cases in Germany. There were some rumors that some infected people do exist, and some schools are closed and some universities are disinfected. However, there are many people on quarantine or under medical observation, including some people (8 people as of 29 Feb) arrived from Italy and Iran. </p><p>The desire of the Russian government to downplay the virus internally is connected with the important voting on the new constitution which will take place April, 22. The goal of the changes is to ensure the stability of the power transit after Putin&#x2019;s era is over, but nobody actually understands how exactly it will be done. The changes were suggested by Putin at January, 15, and the same day he dismissed the government. This was regarded by analytics as <em>coup de etat</em> started by the president himself in order to change the structure of power. The process is not going as well as was expected by the perpetrators and this means that Russia will have an unstable future. (The alternative to the constitutional change was the &#x201C;<a href=\"https://a-nalgin.livejournal.com/1814598.html\">Anschluss</a>&#x201D; of Belorussia and creation of the &#x201C;new USSR&#x201D; which was planned in December, but Belarussian leader Lukashenko did everything to prevent this, despite oil delivery blackmail. If it has happened, a new war in Europe could start. This also explains public attack by Putin on Poland, as only Poland could actively oppose the &#x201C;Anschluss&#x201D;, according to prominent analytic <a href=\"https://aillarionov.livejournal.com/1156096.html#comments\">Illarionov</a>).</p><p>A declared epidemic may prevent people to go to voting stations (but there is also a new option to vote via the internet), which would undermine the legitimacy of the power transfer.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Putin&#x2019;s daughter <a href=\"https://www.rbc.ru/society/28/02/2020/5e58d59a9a794729c876add7?from=from_main\">becomes</a> the head of the new AI development center. It is possible that she will be Putin&#x2019;s successor.</p><p>Also, Russia almost <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/28/middleeast/syria-turkish-troops-moscow-intl/index.html\">has started</a> a war with Turkey, after more than 30 Turkish soldiers were killed by an airstrike on 27 of February. Some claimed that the strike was performed by Russian jets. Eventually, Erdogan downplayed the situation by claiming that this was done by Syrian planes, but the situation is still very dangerous. Russian mercenaries are also fighting Turkish forces in Libya. </p><p>There are <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/12/opinions/new-start-treaty-dougherty/index.html\">problems</a> with the prolongation of the last nuclear treaty START. </p><p>The winter in Russia was <a href=\"https://moslenta.ru/news/teplo-v-moskve-pobilo-pochti-vekovoi-rekord-16-01-2020.htm?utm_source=from_lenta\">warmest</a> in 140 years &#x2013; around 7-8 C above the norm in Moscow region, almost without snow. It is mostly explained by very strong Atlantic circulation which brought a lot of warm air.  Meanwhile, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/russia-announces-plan-to-use-the-advantages-of-climate-change\">Russia announces plan to &#x2018;use the advantages&#x2019; of climate change. Kremlin website recognizes global heating as a problem but lists &#x2018;positive&#x2019; economic effects&#x201D;</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Informational weapons&#x201D; were effectively used against Russia. While it is questionable if informational weapons are an existential risk, the size of destruction they create may be comparable with large air raid and may grow in the future as the world becomes more interconnected:</p><p>&#xB7; US signed sanctions against Russian gas pipeline <em>Nord Stream-2</em> to Europe and killed the project with 40 billion USD of literally sunk cost (the unfinished pipeline is underwater). </p><p>&#xB7; Almost every day unknown people are calling Russian police and claim that bombs are put in schools, kindergartens and airports. A typical Moscow school is evacuated once a week (information from a teacher) and children have to wait outside until police will check. Never they found anything. Evacuations of hospitals resulted in deaths in the past. </p><p>&#xB7; Panic because of coronavirus is damaging economy stronger than deaths. Medical masks are almost sold out in Russia. Oil price is declining. </p><p>&#xB7; There were claims that Russia is melding again in the US presidential campaign and also that it was planting fake news about coronavirus.</p><br><p>Russian GPT-2 is online: <a href=\"https://text.skynet.center/\">https://text.skynet.center/</a></p>",

In this post I&apos;ll link to all the blog posts that were written as part of Blog Post Day, and then say some things about what I learned and when we&apos;ll do another one.</p><br><p>The posts (in no particular order) were:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DhuPBkKA8ohyZEN8n/my-updating-thoughts-on-ai-policy\">My Updating Thoughts on AI Policy</a>, by Ben Pace.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/epc78F6BBMdoFG6Lq/how-to-choose-a-massage-therapist\">How to Choose a Massage Therapist</a>, by mingyuan</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8GdPargak863xaebm/an-analytic-perspective-on-ai-alignment\">An Analytic Perspective on AI Alignment</a>, by Daniel Filan</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3HkfkZi5q4eZRabNq/bayesian-inference-with-partially-specified-priors\">Bayesian Inference with Partially Specified Priors</a>, by Christopher Clark</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ivpKSjM4D6FbqF4pZ/cortes-pizarro-and-afonso-as-precedents-for-takeover\">Cort&#xE9;s, Pizarro, and Afonso as Precedents for Takeover</a> by me</p><p>Edit: Also Ben Goldhaber&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SJrL6Ysdwnuh79bDQ/bgold-s-shortform?commentId=gmHihzQQXeKq7jx6W\">shortform about depression</a></p><br><p>I think I missed a few from this list--for example, Coscott said they finished a post but would not put it up yet because it was part of a planned sequence.

Please let me know if I missed you and I can link to your post here (if you want).</p><p>There was less chatting in the discord than I expected; for the most part people just worked on their posts.

There wasn&apos;t really any draft-swapping because everyone was finishing right before the deadline. </p><p>We had about 12 people express interest in participating, and maybe about 8 people actually participate, and it looks like we got 5+ posts out of it. (Maybe more will trickle in) That sounds good enough to me! I for one am happy with what I accomplished in just one day; I definitely want to repeat this procedure even if no one else joins me.</p><p>So, anyone interested in another Blog Post Day? Obviously not soon, but how far away? Three months from now? One month? I could make this a regular scheduled event if there is interest.</p>",

I've structured the post around what what I did that lead to my updated thoughts.</i></p><h2>1) I read many posts on strategy</h2><p>Paul’s post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/what-failure-looks-like\">What Failure Looks Like</a> is something I’ve thought about a lot, which lays out how the abstract technical problems turn into practical catastrophes. It is a central example of what (I think) strategy work looks like. The strategic considerations are deeply tied up with the specifics of the technology.</p><p>Eliezer’s dialogue on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8gqrbnW758qjHFTrH/security-mindset-and-ordinary-paranoia\">Security Mindset</a> and Scott Garrabrant’s post about how <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zEvqFtT4AtTztfYC4/optimization-amplifies\">Optimization Amplifies</a> have been key in my thinking about alignment and strategy, best summarised by Scott’s line “I am not just saying that adversarial optimization makes small probabilities of failure large. I am saying that in general any optimization at all messes with small probabilities and errors drastically.”</p><p>(I tried to re-state some of my own understandings of Paul’s, Eliezer’s and Scott’s posts when I talked about ML transparency in ‘<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mdau2DBSMi5bWXPGA/useful-does-not-mean-secure\">Useful Doesn’t Mean Secure</a>’. I’m glad I wrote it, it was helpful for sorting out my own thoughts, though I expect isn’t as helpful for other people.)</p><p>Eliezer wrote <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BEtzRE2M5m9YEAQpX/there-s-no-fire-alarm-for-artificial-general-intelligence\">There's No Fire Alarm for Artificial General Intelligence</a> which has been key for how I think about timelines (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XFpDTCHZZ4wpMT8PZ/a-model-i-use-when-making-plans-to-reduce-ai-x-risk\">as I said two years ago</a>). I wrote down some of my worries about the discussion of timelines in an off-topic <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/96N8BT9tJvybLbn5z/we-run-the-center-for-applied-rationality-ama?commentId=WFgJ3BfMTX36DeTSp\">comment</a> on the recent CFAR AMA, talking about how the broad x-risk network is acting like a herd stampeding away from a fear regarding AI risk, and the problems with that. I’ll clean that up and turn into a post sometime, I managed to say some things there more clearly than I’d been able to think them before.</p><p>Paul’s post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AfGmsjGPXN97kNp57/arguments-about-fast-takeoff\">Arguments about fast takeoff</a> and linked post about hyperbolic growth, was key in my understanding of takeoff speeds, and helped me understand the gears there much better.</p><p>I’ve increasingly been thinking a <i>lot</i> about secrecy. I think a lot of people’s actions regarding keeping secrets have been much more damaging that they realised (the herd stampede above regarding timelines is but one example), and work needs to be done to square the necessity of secrecy with the fact that the public record has been necessary for scientific and intellectual progress to get humanity to where it is, and if we want to use that ethereal power to secure humanity against novel technologies, we’re probably going to continue to need a public record of ideas and insights. I’ve not found an opportunity to get my thoughts written down on it yet, though I said a few preliminary things in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aE5q2Mb8zQNo4eKxy/review-on-the-chatham-house-rule-ben-pace-dec-2019\">my review of</a> Scott Garrabrant’s post on the Chatham House Rules, where commenter jbash also had some solid comments.</p><p>In MIRI’s post <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2018/11/22/2018-update-our-new-research-directions/\">2018 Update: Our New Research Directions</a>, Nate talks about the idea of ‘deconfusion’, and says it’s something like “making it so that you can think about a given topic without continuously accidentally spouting nonsense”. He goes on to and gives examples of how he used to be confused about a topic, and as soon as he started to ask questions or make statements he immediately said insane things. For example, when talking about infinity as a kid, he used to ask “How can 8 plus infinity still be infinity? What happens if we subtract infinity from both sides of the equation?” which turn out to make no sense. And when talking about AI he used to say things like “isn’t intelligence an incoherent concept,” “but the economy’s already superintelligent,” “if a superhuman AI is smart enough that it could kill us, it’ll also be smart enough to see that that isn’t what the good thing to do is, so we’ll be fine,” “we’re Turing-complete, so it’s impossible to have something dangerously smarter than us, because Turing-complete computations can emulate anything,” and “anyhow, we could just unplug it.”</p><p>I often like to say Nick Bostrom is the person who’s able to get deconfused on the highest strategic level. He’s able to just say one sentence at a time, and it’s so true that the rest of us rearrange our entire lives around it. “<a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html\">Hmm… I think if we go extinct, then that means we’re never able to come back from our mistakes, but as long as we never go extinct, then someday we'll manage to do all the important things.</a>” And then we all say \"Wow, let us now attempt to redirect humanity around ensuring we never go extinct.” And then he waits a few years, and says another sentence. And then a few years later, he says another. Bostrom’s strategy papers have been primitive thinking blocks of my thoughts in this area. <a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/unilateralist.pdf\">The unilateralist’s curse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\">the vulnerable world hypothesis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html\">existential risk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf\">information hazards</a>, and so on. They creep into most of my thoughts, often without me noticing.</p><p>(The above sentence was not an actual quote, it was oversimplified. An actual one-sentence quote might be \"the lesson for utilitarians is not that we ought to maximize the pace of technological development, but rather that we ought to maximize its <i>safety</i>, i.e. the probability that colonization will eventually occur.\")</p><p>On policy specifically, there were two more FHI papers I read. I thought <a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/aipolicy.pdf\">Bostrom’s policy paper</a> was really interesting, applying many of the ideas from Superintelligence to policy. This felt like real conceptual progress, applying an understanding of advanced technology to policy, and it was the paper that actually got me to feel excited about policy research. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hyfedqhgCQriBB9wT/notes-on-policy-desiderata-for-superintelligent-ai-a-vector\">I summarised it in a post</a>.</p><p>And I read Dafoe’s research agenda. I wrote comments quoting a the bits I liked <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yTMWjeRyHFCPbGXsk/ai-governance-a-research-agenda\">in the comments of this post</a>. Overall the research agenda just asked a lot of questions though, I didn't get much from reading it.</p><h2>2) I helped evaluate a grant in AI policy</h2><p>I spent around 15-25 hours evaluating and writing down my thoughts about the Jess Whittlestone/CSER grant with Oliver for the LTFF. My thoughts went into Oli's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/an9GrNXrdMwBJpHeC/long-term-future-fund-august-2019-grant-recommendations-1\">public writeup</a> analysing her writing, plus a long addendum on a Nature article by the director of CSER Seán ÓhÉigeartaigh (and coauthored with the director of Leverhulme CFI Stephen Cave). I was fairly proud of the two write-ups, I said things there more clearly than I’d previously been able to think them.</p><p>My main updates from all that:</p><ul><li>Current policy/strategy work is at the level where we don't know what basic concepts to deal with, and most of the current work we need to do is in figuring out <i>how to think about the problem</i>, not in proposing concrete solutions.</li><li>The policy goal of banning lethal autonomous weapons is an example of going too concrete too early and proposing something that doesn't really make sense.<ul><li>Just because a human is in the loop doesn't mean they understand the system or how it works, and so doesn't ensure that their decision is meaningful. I have not seen advocacy on this subject deal with the details of how military systems work or cohere around a specific policy proposal for how military ML architectures will work and what specific designs to use that will ensure a human in the loop is able to keep the same kind of control as over current weapons. It's mostly an accurate description of one of the many possible uses of advanced ML combined with a social push to \"not do that\", as though it were a binary action as opposed to an incredibly massive space of possible policies where most of them are ineffectual.</li><li>'<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipTO_7mUOw\">Slaughterbots</a>' is a short horror-fiction video which has 1 million views on YouTube. It is a piece of high-effort, well-executed fearmongering about AI's military use. I had not actually watched it until just now in writing this post. I am shocked to see Stuart Russell appear at the end of the video and endorse this as crucially important, this will substantially obfuscate any public dialogue and messaging that he and others wants to do about alignment and AGI. I'm pretty disappointed. He's committing the own-goal that matches <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/26/if-the-media-reported-on-other-dangers-like-it-does-ai-risk/\">the mistake Scott joked about journalists making</a> – like if he was trying to be the public's nuclear x-risk expert and said <i>\"A sufficiently large nuclear war could completely destroy human civilization. If the bombs struck major manufacturing centers, they could also cause thousands of people to be put out of work.\"</i></li></ul></li><li>Many attempts to gain political power often come by taking the issue you care about and connecting it to a major political debate which already has massive amounts of political capital pulling in both directions. This ends up leaving your issue co-opted by entities with massively more political capital (this results in the kind of thing where Clinton gave a billion dollars to 'nanotechnology' research that just went to funding existing major scientific bodies and not anything that Drexler had hoped or would've considered nanotech – I think). It's a hard tradeoff to make, and if it's important to gain power in government, this is one of the primary and most common routes.<ul><li>I expect that when a number of ML experts see people like Russell talking about slaughterbots in a hyperbolic and imprecise fashion, this reads to them as Russell allowing himself to be coopted by larger political forces in order to gain power, and makes them spend less effort engaging with his technical arguments about the danger of misalignment, which read to them as rationalisations rather than the cause of the speeches he makes in public.</li><li>The article above by ÓhÉigeartaigh and Cave makes similar connections (see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/an9GrNXrdMwBJpHeC/long-term-future-fund-august-2019-grant-recommendations-1\">the linked writeup</a> for more detail), saying that the 'long-term issues' that Bostrom and others care about basically includes unemployment, which is not something I care much about, but <i>is</i> a widely discussed political issue that can quickly get you a fair bit of attention and power if you have some prestige and say things that fit into the well-known standard positions on that debate.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>3) I had some discussions with ML researchers.</h2><p>I once had a conversation with an ML researcher I respected, and found I was tripping over myself to not outright call their work net-negative (they were very excited about their work). I thought it would feel really uncomfortable to believe that of your own work, so I expected if I were to say I thought their work was net-negative then they would feel attacked and not have a line of retreat other than to decide I must be wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, Oli pointed out to me that Machine Learning as a field is in a bad position to decide that Machine Learning research is net negative, and from a basic incentive model you should predict that they will never believe this.&nbsp;</p><p>This suggests that the work of pointing out problems should be done by other groups, perhaps economists or government regulators, who are not in an impossible incentive setup, and that only the work of solving those problems should primarily be done by the AI researchers. I think a lot of the basic ideas about what paths would lead AI to be catastrophic are well-phrased in terms of economics, and I’m more excited about the idea of an economics department analysing AI and risks from that field. There are many great independent centres in academia like CHAI, FHI, and GMU, and it’d be interesting to figure out how to build a small econ department like CHAI, built around analysing risk from AI.</p><h2>4) I listened to a podcast and read some blogposts by science-minded people senior in government.</h2><p>I wrote about listening to Tom Kalil’s 80k podcast in my post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9XkrMTrA4d3fkBxDD/a-key-power-of-the-president-is-to-coordinate-the-execution\">A Key Power of the President is to Coordinate the Execution of Existing Concrete Plans</a>. This substantially increased my model of the tractability of getting things done within governments on timescales of 4-8 years.</p><p>My general thinking is that we’re mostly confused about AI - both how to conceptualise it, and what is likely to happen - and these feel like fundamental questions that need answering before I can say what to do about it. I think almost nobody is making real progress on that front. Kalil’s post fit in with this, where he talked about how he can do a lot of awesome sh*t with the president, but when people haven’t got a very concrete policy proposal, he can’t do anything. You can’t tell him to ‘care more’ about AI safety. You need to also know what to do about it. Like the above, 'stopping autonomous drones' isn't a primitive action, and figuring out what the right action is will be most of the work.</p><p>While Kalil made me update negatively on the utility of interacting with government in the near to medium term, Cummings obviously suggests that rationalists should think really freaking hard about what could be useful to do in the next 5 years.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Note: I wrote this post a few months ago, before the most recent UK election, and am just polishing it up to publish today for blogpost writing day. I hadn't thought much about Cummings at the time, and I've left it as-is for now, so this doesn't say much really.)</i></p><p>While I think that novel research is quite rarely done inside government, and that humanity’s scientific and intellectual exploration is likely key for us dealing well with AI and other technologies (which is why I primarily work on LessWrong, where I think we have a shot at really kickstarting intellectual thought on such topics), I still tried to think more about useful things that can be done in government today.</p><p>I spent an hour or two, here are my first thoughts.</p><ul><li>Someone in strong positions in government could help coordinate the creation of AI research centres in industry and academia in AI and economics (as above), insofar as we have good people to lead them (which we don't really atm), and help give them prestige.</li><li>Someone with power in government could help with setting standards for release practises in Machine Learning, which do sound like the sort of thing that will be pretty important. I've been quite impressed by OpenAI doing work on this.</li><li>If those two work out, I can imagine it being sensible to begin international conversations with other countries about them implementing similar things.<ul><li>I really have not given this much thought and I would not take active action in this space without giving it dozens/hundreds of hours of thought and having some long discussions in with a number of other people I respect who have thought about it a lot and/or have different perspectives from me.</li></ul></li><li>When thinking of exciting things to do with governance not directly related to AI, I’m broadly excited about more economically thoughtful governments trying out various ideas that people like Robin Hanson and Paul Christiano have come up with such as <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/05/how-to-reform-academia-with-prediction-markets.html\">prediction markets</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yNn2o3kEhixZHkRga/certificates-of-impact\">impact certificates</a>, <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/12/governance-by-jury.html\">governance by jury by markets</a>, and more.<ul><li>(We’ve been thinking about selling <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/r7vmtHZKuosJZ3Xq5/altruistic-equity-allocation\">the altruistic equity</a> of the LessWrong Team - instead of doing normal non-profit fundraising - which I currently understand to be the one-player version of impact certificate markets.)</li><li>Those economic ideas have been a big shock to me, I didn’t realise how many new basic ideas one can have about using markets to solve problems. Does econ academia also reliably produce these kinds of basic institutional ideas often? Seems like there’s a lot of space here to explore.</li></ul></li></ul></body></html>",

    "htmlBody": "<p> Despite being literally inapplicable for half the population, my post on birth control and productivity was one of my most popular Facebook posts. In that spirit, here&#x2019;s a roundup of my favorite weird productivity tips that aren&#x2019;t for everyone. </p><p>I chose hacks that several people rated as extremely high ROI&#x2026;and that other people rated from &#x201C;meh&#x201D; to &#x201C;absolutely awful.&#x201D; Basically, this is my list of tips that I <em>don&#x2019;t</em> think everyone should try. But since most blogs try to only give generally good advice, maybe you&#x2019;ll find something new that is fantastic for you.  </p><p>Attempt them with a spirit of experimentation and caution. A few wins can be worth a lot of useless experiments, but <u><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O3ESdrdH90MO-ft-avgsrl0-HNK9JWLr/view?usp=sharing\">be careful about large negative impacts</a></u>; try 10 experiments that each have a 10% chance of going horribly wrong, and you&#x2019;ll probably have a bad experience. </p><h1>Magic Pills</h1><p>No, not that kind. Antidepressants. </p><p>Obviously you should talk to your doctor about medication if you think you&#x2019;re severely depressed. The more interesting edge case is whether people who <em>don&#x2019;t</em> qualify as severely depressed should still try antidepressants. </p><p>If you score below mild on the <u><a href=\"https://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9\">PHQ-9</a></u>, then ignore this. If you score mild or above more than a quarter of the time, consider talking to your doctor about antidepressants (even if you don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re depressed). </p><p>I think too many people hesitate to try antidepressants unless absolutely convinced they are definitely depressed. That doesn&#x2019;t really make sense to me. I mean, there are a lot of problems with antidepressants in the real world and it makes sense to want to do your homework. But after you do your homework, if the expected value calculation says you&#x2019;ll probably be happier and more productive, then you just discovered a magic pill that delivers utility. (To be clear, antidepressants usually don&#x2019;t work this way, or else I would be lobbying GiveWell to make Universal Antidepressants Inc. their new top charity.) </p><p>Scott Alexander <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/\">wrote</a></u> that &#x201C;There is a lot of worry that SSRIs are not much better than a placebo for people with mild to moderate depression&#x2026;.However, this is a completely academic debate for you, because you are not going to get placebo. Your choice is between SSRIs or nothing. Everyone everywhere agrees SSRIs are much better than nothing.&#x201D; </p><p>As one anecdote, I qualified as mildly depressed 40% of the time on the <u><a href=\"https://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9\">PHQ-9</a></u> across six months, almost entirely because of persistent fatigue. My therapist suggested I try an antidepressant as an experiment; Rob Wiblin&#x2019;s positive review of Wellbutrin for mild depression made me think the idea might not be crazy, and my doctor was on board. So, I tried a low dose of Wellbutrin. Over the three months after starting it, my average deep work time increased &gt;10 hours a month, compared to the six months before it. To minimize ongoing effort, I have my pharmacy automatically ship the medication to my home when I&#x2019;m due for a refill. </p><p>For the cost of taking one pill a day, 10 hours a month is an extremely high return on investment. </p><p>On the other hand, most antidepressants have side effects which can be much worse than their benefits. At the extreme end, a bad reaction to an antidepressant could make you suicidal. For safety, if you want to try one, have someone else who will proactively check on you and intervene if things go really, really badly - perhaps your doctor, a trusted friend, or a family member. <u><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dz2DADjXViVOxuLN4ebNpSqVm7JRbg7_\">This Mayo Clinic chart</a></u> reviews the side effects of different antidepressants. </p><p>Additionally, it often takes several weeks for you to experience the benefits (or be sure of the lack thereof) and you may need to try a few drugs before finding a good fit for you, making this a potentially expensive experiment to run. You probably have about a <u><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/\">1 in 3</a></u> chance of the first drug solving the issue. </p><p>So, status quo or experiment with a magic pill that could go really well or really badly. And people say the Matrix is unrealistic. </p><h1>Focus, Mate </h1><p>For people highly motivated by social expectations, the online-coworking-meets-Pomodoro platform <u><a href=\"https://www.focusmate.com/\">Focusmate.com</a></u> can be a life saver. </p><p>You schedule a 50-minute <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\">pomodoro</a></u> in advance and are paired with a stranger on the internet. At the appointed time, you both show up, tell each other what you&#x2019;ll do, and work in silence. 50 minutes later, the bell dings and you share how it went. </p><p>Personally, I find it useful for making sure I do something at a specific time (e.g. establishing a workout habit at a particular time or getting started quickly on an aversive task). Many clients have also found it mildly useful, but a handful have found it transformative - on the order of doubling their output. Turns out that the thought of admitting you weren&#x2019;t focused to a stranger can focus you like a laser. </p><p>The biggest downside is that you need to be on a video call with a stranger. Both participants usually mute themselves during the work session, but some people still find random video calls awkward to do in an office. </p><p>Given that, this is probably the cheapest experiment on this list &#x2013; low time investment for information and low downside risks. </p><h1>Put Your Money Where Your Goal Is</h1><p>When you need to hack motivation, financial penalties are the most reliable tool I know of. For most people. For another subset of people, penalties suck. (If you&#x2019;re already completing your goals without costly deadlines, then feel free to ignore this entry entirely!) </p><p>The idea is simple. Put ten, fifty, or a thousand dollars on the line if you don&#x2019;t complete your goal by the deadline, and you&#x2019;ll be more motivated. (I recommend you start with smaller amounts.) You can pre-commit to paying a friend, charity, or hated politician, depending on your desired motivation. <u><a href=\"http://stickk.com/\">Stickk.com</a></u> is my favorite platform for setting up convenient commitments. </p><p>When I wanted to make my weekly planning habit 100% rock solid, I set a (very meta) penalty in Stickk to set weekly penalties. Each week, that email would pop up in my inbox on Sunday asking if I&#x2019;d set my weekly goals yet. And I knew I needed to complete it or mark that I&#x2019;d failed the next day. That small nudge was enough to slightly distort my in-the-moment motivation to match my reflective desires. (For more examples, <u><a href=\"https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2019/10/3/will-macaskill-on-his-eat-that-elephant-routine-learning-from-successful-people-and-the-diminishing-marginal-returns-of-time-spent-working\">Will MacAskill</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2019/11/2/niel-bowerman-on-goal-setting-hacking-motivation-and-80000-hours-bout-system\">Niel Bowerman</a></u> describe other strategies they use to make financial penalties effective tools for them.)  </p><p>The catch of this trick is that it&#x2019;s hard to know from the get-go whether financial penalties will help you. </p><p>Before trying penalties, many clients report finding penalties somewhat aversive to start and/or don&#x2019;t think they really need them. They usually decide it&#x2019;s worth trying after all when they reflect on why they failed to finish the task without that extra motivation. After trying it, many people are won over by the fact that they actually did the task. </p><p>On the other hand, some people find this technique more similar to a sledgehammer than a nudge. They may try financial penalties and lose hundreds of dollars without making progress. This is extremely demoralizing. If you often miss important deadlines with real consequences, this is probably not the technique for you. </p><p>Before they try it, it&#x2019;s hard even for me to distinguish which camp people will fall into. Since on average more people find penalties motivating, I tend to encourage people to try them. However, I suggest they try small penalties to start off with. If nothing else, it&#x2019;s easy to set overly ambitious goals that are impossible to complete in time if your <u><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Outside_view\">outside view</a></u> isn&#x2019;t calibrated yet. </p><p>To set good financial penalties, I recommend you:</p><ul><li>Make sure you&#x2019;re setting goals you will want to complete, since you are reducing your flexibility to change your mind later. </li><li>Relatedly, set goals in the near future to reduce the chances that circumstances will change what you had wanted to complete. To start off, don&#x2019;t set goals for further in the future than a week.   </li><li>Check the outside view to see whether you&#x2019;re giving yourself enough time &#x2013; because this deadline is real. How long did it take you to complete the last similar task? </li><li>Schedule in more time than you think you need so you have a buffer. 20% to 50% extra time is probably a good amount to start with. </li></ul><p>In short, financial penalties are the best way I know of speeding up your work and increasing the rate at which you complete things. But some people have extremely negative, demoralizing experiences trying financial penalties, and even the people who like them still often find the deadlines somewhat stressful.</p><h1>&#x201C;On Fire&#x201D; Admin</h1><p>The idea is simple; you do whatever life admin is &#x201C;on fire&#x201D; and ignore the rest. </p><p>E.g. Since the government could throw you in jail if you don&#x2019;t do your taxes, you do your taxes. Unless the broken towel bar in the bathroom is annoying you enough to be &#x201C;on fire&#x201D;, you leave it be. If you can learn not to care if your bed is made, you skip making it. If you&#x2019;re okay living out of boxes after a move, maybe it&#x2019;s not worth really setting up your bedroom. </p><p>I bet you&#x2019;re already familiar with the general idea. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t do unimportant things, duh.&#x201D; </p><p>I&#x2019;m suggesting pushing this one step further. Look for those things that feel like you &#x201C;need to do&#x201D; or &#x201C;should do&#x201D; them, and try not doing them. Skip a meeting or don&#x2019;t reply to a few emails. Be aware that this could backfire; you might need to backtrack. Sometimes not doing something will come across as weird, and you need to decide if that matters to you. </p><p>The benefit is the time and mental energy you free up. Admin tasks can soak up a lot of time &#x2013; even entire days &#x2013;  in what feels like productive work, yet nothing is different when the week is done. If you can batch admin tasks, great. If you can just skip doing a task without severe consequences, even better.  In general, I see successful people more often skipping life admin tasks, and multiple clients have found this concept useful. </p><p>The downside is that a bunch of stuff doesn&#x2019;t get done. You may be less productive if your workspace is always messy. People may be annoyed you never responded to their email. These may impose legitimate costs that are worth the time to just do the admin tasks. You may just be less happy. (This is one of those strategies I think are great...for some other people. Personally, I feel happiest knowing the small things are wrapped up nicely.) I don&#x2019;t have a formula here &#x2013; just a nudge to see which tasks are fine if you skip doing them. </p><h1>The True Cost of Traveling  </h1><p>Travel is expensive. Not financially, though it can be that also. It&#x2019;s expensive to your productivity. </p><p>You leave your familiar haunts and most of your habits. The travel itself is often tiring; you probably have to work in worse environments, and you may be more likely to get sick. If you&#x2019;re jumping time zones, you&#x2019;re usually adding jet lag and sleep deprivation. Sleeping in strange beds can take some adjustment, further worsening your sleep situation. </p><p>And that&#x2019;s just while you&#x2019;re traveling. When you come home, you&#x2019;ve had days or weeks away from your routine. If forming a habit takes the oft-quoted six weeks, then you&#x2019;re a good step towards rewriting those carefully cultivated habits. </p><p>These are all reasons I suspect when clients tell me &#x201C;I was so unproductive on that trip. I thought I could get work done, but I just didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; Traveling disrupts productivity, so minimizing travel can boost productivity. </p><p>The flip side here is that showing up can be valuable. In defense of travel, I expect that clients saying the above quote would say the travel was worth the cost more often than not. It&#x2019;s hard to replace talking to your collaborators in person, meeting new connections at a conference, or picking someone&#x2019;s brain because you caught them at happy hour. Sometimes these are significant productivity boosts in their own right. Honestly, some readers might benefit from the exact opposite advice - to be willing to go in person <em>more</em> often.  </p><p>So I&#x2019;m not saying to avoid travel entirely. You&#x2019;ll need to weigh the benefit of being somewhere in person. Just make sure you&#x2019;re considering the full cost of travel when you do. </p><h1>More Pills </h1><p>A potential productivity tip for people with periods; birth control can be useful to lessen or eliminate the negative impact of periods. </p><p>I had particularly bad periods, and estimate the Nuva ring gave me about one extra productive day a month. I used to lose about half a day to cramps, and general pain led to slightly decreased productivity for about 5 days. With approval from a gynecologist, I use birth control continuously to suppress periods almost entirely, with no side effects. (I have a mild period every three months.) </p><p>The pill can be used in the same way taking a birth control pill every day, instead of taking the placebo pills to allow for a period. Hormonal IUDs sometimes suppress periods, but I hear mixed reports from people using them. I get my birth control mailed to me by Nurx, so I only need to think about it once a month.</p><p>On the other hand, many people report side effects from some forms of birth control, including worse cramps, worse periods, weight gain, and mood swings. So you might need to experiment to find one that works for you. I haven&#x2019;t experienced any side effects of suppressing periods and the gynecologist thought it was fine, but I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ve actually studied long term effects.  </p><h1>Abridge Prolonged Electronic Correspondence </h1><p>I.e. write short emails. </p><p>The median email I send is one line long. I expect this frees up at least 10 minutes per day that would have been sucked up writing longer emails. That adds up to about 60 hours saved per year. If you handle a daily flood of email or spend 30 minutes agonizing over the wording every time you email a coworker, you might save hundreds of hours a year. </p><p>I will spend more time on important emails where I want to convey more information, but the majority of my messages seem to be just fine stated in a sentence or two. I expect that these shorter emails are often appreciated by busy recipients. </p><p>On the other hand, brevity (sometimes) trades off against social niceness. It&#x2019;s easier to come off as brusque or even unfriendly without nice padding. Longer time may be worthwhile if you work in a particularly socially conscious field, or email frequently with touchy colleagues who might suck up time and energy in drama over a misperceived tone. </p><p>It might feel weird shooting off a short missive - it can take some adjustment if you&#x2019;re used to penning essays. An explanation can help ease the transition. Inspired by a lovely signature I saw, I added a note to my email signature to preempt recipients thinking me curt, &#x201C;My replies will often be brief. Saves us both time!&#x201D; </p><p><strong>What tips would you add to the list? </strong></p>",

    "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p><i>Written for Daniel Kokotajlo's unofficial blog post day! I didn't very effort here, so sorry that it's pretty rambly and full of personal anecdotes. I hope it's still at least somewhat helpful!</i></p><h1>Background</h1><p>Recently several people have asked me how to go about finding a good massage therapist. I had thought about writing a post on this for a while but didn’t realize there was an actual audience! I guess there is! I have chronic problems with muscle tension and have been to about fifteen different massage therapists, so I hopefully have some wisdom to share.</p><p>My basic advice is to use Yelp (or equivalent, e.g. Google reviews). I expect this to work significantly better on average than recommendations from friends, because your preferences and body are likely different enough from theirs. However, recommendations from friends can be worth a shot too.</p><p>I will note up front that I have<strong> never </strong>had a massage therapist try to sexualize the massage. People seem disproportionately concerned about this when getting a massage for the first time, but I really don’t think it’s that common.&nbsp;</p><h1>What are your goals?</h1><p>The first question to answer is: What are your goals? Why do you want to get a massage? Do you have a particular pain that bothers you, such as an old injury or a bad knee, or is it more that you just feel generally tense? Are you looking for temporary pain relief or someone who will work with you for a long time to address the underlying problem? Are you not looking for pain relief at all but just a nice relaxing experience? These are all important things to know going in.</p><h1>Are they good?</h1><p>The main measure of whether you should keep seeing a massage therapist is whether you think they’re good. This will obviously be a subjective judgment, and may change over time (e.g. if you thought someone had the potential to give you long-term relief, but after a few sessions that hasn’t materialized.)</p><p>A big thing I look for when seeing a new massage therapist is whether they can read my body without my having to give them verbal information. This is particularly important for me since I’m really hesitant to speak up when I’m in pain (a good massage therapist should notice the flinch reaction in the surrounding muscles and ease off automatically), but I think it’s also a good litmus test in general. For example, if you say “I have pain in my forearms”, they should be able to find the spot to work in order to ease the tension just by feeling it.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a weird reflex in my right leg, and the way a new massage therapist responds to that is significant evidence for me. One woman nerded out about it, felt around, and told me that all the nerves in some area were bunched together weirdly. This was a good outcome, and I went to her regularly for a while. Another woman saw the reflex, asked me if I was doing it on purpose, then kinda freaked and told me to see a neurologist. I did not see her again.</p><h1>Other considerations</h1><h2>Style and intensity</h2><p>There are a whole heck of a lot of different ways to give a massage. I’ve had people walk on me, yank on my limbs, press and hold ‘trigger points’, cover me in Tiger Balm, rub me with hot rocks, have me tense and release my muscles, go chop chop on my shoulders, and even spend half of the session giving me a lesson on how to walk with better posture instead of massaging me. Massage space is deep and wide.</p><p>Massage therapists will often give a list of different types of massage they’re trained in, with names like “shiatsu”, “traditional Thai”, “myofascial release”, “trigger point therapy”, “Swedish”, and probably lots more. I’m gonna be honest with you: I have no idea what most of this stuff means. As such, I find that the best way to figure out what a person’s deal is is to just try them out for one session.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve found that I generally prefer “deep tissue massage therapy”, which (vaguely) is targeted at getting to the root of chronic issues. This can be very intense, to the point where I feel flu-y or have trouble walking for a day or two afterwards. I like this intensity because I value the long-term benefits, such as going longer between bouts of crippling shin splints. However, if you don’t have such chronic problems, your calculus may be different.</p><h2>Ambience</h2><p>How important is ambience to you? There are all sorts of things to consider, like whether you get to choose the music, whether the table is heated, the lighting, the amount of ambient noise, maybe even the neighborhood. (My favorite massage therapist usually asks me what music I want, but I’m too much of a wet noodle to tell her my preferences so sometimes she plays, like, pop punk, and I don’t find it very relaxing.)&nbsp;</p><p>Like with styles, there’s a huge amount of variation in ambience. Some people work out of spas, some out of physical therapy offices, some out of basements. One of my favorite massage places doesn’t have private rooms, just curtains separating the different spaces. You can hear the other clients as well as the traffic outside, and everyone listens to the same music. I don’t mind this because the place has plenty of other good attributes, but others may feel differently.&nbsp;</p><p>If having a lot of control over your environment is important to you, you might want to look into massage therapists who do house calls!</p><h2>Communication</h2><p><strong>Chatting</strong></p><p>This one is a big deal for me. I find it really annoying when my massage therapist is chatty, because I don’t like small talk in general, and because often when this happens it’s just the massage therapist complaining about their girlfriend or ex-wife. (Three out of the five male massage therapists I’ve seen were chatty, compared to only one out of ten females. Small sample size, obviously.) I just want to lie inert and silent and be massaged! Other people, such as my mom, don’t mind the chatting, so this wouldn’t be a major factor for them.</p><p><strong>Exchange of information</strong></p><p>On the other hand, I really value it when, after or during my massage, the massage therapist tells me something about my body that I didn’t already know. Epistemics are kind of a lost cause here (basically every massage therapist I’ve talked to has given me some kind of pseudoscience explanation of how massage works, many of them mutually contradictory), so I mostly just go on whether the information is practically useful. Examples of useful information I’ve gotten are tips on how to improve my posture, and specific stretches I can do to ease particularly tight muscles and tendons.</p><p><strong>Language barrier</strong></p><p>There are a lot of great Thai (and various other Asian) massage therapists, usually women. They generally work in coalitions rather than as freelancers (for lack of better terminology), and, not-unrelatedly, not everyone at these places is always good enough at English to handle basic customer service. I don’t mind this at all because I don’t talk to my massage therapists anyway, and they’re really nice to me and give good massages. However, if clear two-way communication is important to you, you might want to make a point of finding someone with whom you share a language of fluency. (If you speak Thai, well then, lucky you!)</p><h2>Convenience</h2><p>Convenience has several aspects: location, booking procedure, and availability. I personally prefer places that are easy to walk or bike to, which allow booking online (by text is fine too, once you’ve built a relationship), and that have lots of availability.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re optimizing for lots of availability, I recommend finding one of those more coalition-type places, since they often have quite a few appointments open at any given time. If you’re optimizing for proximity, house calls often come at no extra cost!</p><h2>Gender</h2><p>Some people – I think particularly women – strongly prefer to have a massage therapist of their same gender. This is perfectly reasonable and should be easy to filter for. (I also have a nonbinary massage therapist who I love).</p><h2>Cost</h2><p>Massages are just pretty expensive. As far as I can tell, the baseline massage cost scales with cost of living in an area – by which I mostly mean that massages are about twice as expensive in the Bay Area as they are back home in Wisconsin. However, not all massages are the same amount of expensive. I keep mentioning those coalitions of Thai women – these often offer great massages that are relatively affordable. If money is no object for you and/or you’re just really desperate for pain relief (I’ve been there), I’ve found that the most long-term effective massage therapy is generally more expensive.</p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2><p>You might be looking for random other things in a massage, such as aromatherapy packages, pedicures, or couples massage. Not everywhere offers these things, so make sure you check for them before booking an appointment.</p><h1>Takeaways</h1><ol><li><strong>Decide what you want out of massage therapy.</strong> You might not know what your preferences are for many of the categories listed above, and that’s okay; after trying out a couple of people you should be able to get a better sense.</li><li><strong>Search Yelp for highly-rated massage therapists in your area</strong> and look through their reviews to see if they sound right for you, based on the preferences you’ve established.</li><li><strong>Try things! </strong>I know this step can be costly in terms of time, money, and effort, but like with finding a good psychotherapist, that’s just part of the deal. And like with psychotherapy, I strongly encourage you not to settle for someone who’s not the right fit.</li><li>Once you've found someone you really like, you're ready to stop exploring and start exploiting! Keep going to that person as much as you want! Nice!&nbsp;</li></ol><p>And if you’re tight on money and can’t see a massage therapist regularly, I’ve heard a lot of people recommend self-massage using trigger point massage therapy. This works better if you have <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1608824942/\"><u>the book</u></a> and <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B017V7UKW2/\"><u>some</u></a> <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QZTL76T/\"><u>tools</u></a>, but all of those linked products together add up to less than the cost of an hour of professional massage (in the Bay Area).</p><p>Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have questions!&nbsp;</p></body></html>",

If we assume rational people should update their beliefs in a way that is consistent with the laws of probability, then rational people should update their beliefs using Bayes rule. It follows from this view that Bayes rule is not just a mathematical observation, it is <em>prescriptive</em> in the sense that it describes how people (or algorithms, AIs, or other agents that aspire to be rational) should update their beliefs. In that case, the prior can be understood as stating how probable you think the hypothesis is given all <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jzf4Rcienrm6btRyt/priors-as-mathematical-objects\">the data that is available to you</a>, except for <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal{D}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">D</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, and the posterior describes how probable you ought to think the hypothesis is after accounting for <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal{D}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">D</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. </p><p>A basic understanding of what all this means is that you should account for your prior belief when considering new evidence. For example, say you get tested for the presence of a particular genetic sequence in your DNA, and that the test is 99% accurate (meaning it has a 99% true positive rate and true negative rate) and returns positive. If your prior belief that you have the genetic sequence is very low (maybe you happen to know the base rate of the sequence in the general population is less than 0.001%), then you should conclude the test was most likely a false positive.</p><p>This is all well and good in theory, but if we try to explicitly use Bayes rule in practice we might find specifying our priors to be very difficult. Even worse, it can feel arbitrary or<em> </em>a matter of guesswork. Consider the previous example, only now imagine that you do not have convenient knowledge about the genetic sequence&apos;s base rate. In theory, a Bayesian would say, there is still some precise numeric value that quantifies your prior belief. Presumably it would be based on your knowledge of genes, the kinds of things people develop tests for, possibly some general belief about common base rates, and so on. In practice, could you actually introspect in a way that would allow you to write down such a prior? Trying to specify your prior to even a single decimal place, let alone several, would probably feel like you are just making stuff up. Plus, there is a concerning possibility that your answer would change significantly if you were tired, or you had been primed by seeing some random number, or by some other arbitrary reason. </p><p>This is likely true in day-to-day life. I certainly couldn&apos;t give an exact answer to questions like &quot;will it rain today&quot; or &quot;would anyone notice if I bailed and left work early&quot;, even though these are the kind of beliefs I might want to update as I go about my day. I doubt I could assign probabilities to these statements with more than one significant digit, and even then I would be pretty leery about being asked to do so. In short, it seems unlikely that brains encode beliefs in ways that can be readily mapped to numerical values.</p><p>Given this limitation, how exactly are humans supposed to go about doing Bayesian reasoning? One suggestion might be that we should just take our best guess and treat the result as an approximation, but its hard not to wince at the idea our supposedly rational decision making procedure now requires producing a number in a way that feels so unintuitive and arbitrary. It might also be tempting to suggest people ought to just look up base rates or other statistics online, and use those as priors. However such information might not be available, and this is also, in a sense, wrong in principle. In the setting being discussed here the prior is supposed to reflect your internal beliefs, so if we are determined to do things properly there is no avoiding the difficultly of trying to write those beliefs down.</p><p>A possible workaround is to use <em>partially specified</em> or <em>imprecise </em>priors<em>.</em> While most discussions of Bayes rule focus on applying it when we have exact knowledge of the prior, it&apos;s perfectly valid to apply Bayes rule when we only have partial knowledge. In this case, we may not be able to compute an exact posterior, but we might be able to get enough information about the posterior to make decisions. Mathematically, an analogy would the equation &quot;a + b = c&quot; when given &quot;b = 10&quot; and &quot;a &gt; 0&quot;. We don&apos;t know the exact value of &quot;c&quot;, but we do know &quot;c &gt; 10&quot;. Likewise, given partial knowledge of the prior, and knowledge about the likelihood, we can gain partial knowledge of the posterior. I think this kind of process is often more intuitive than trying to utilize an exact prior.</p><p>To give an example, imagine you eat a berry from an unknown plant, and then in a moment of paranoia you run a toxicity test with 99.9% accuracy on that plant, which returns positive. Being a committed Bayesian, you set out to write down your prior belief of the plant being toxic. This will, you reason, then allow you to compute the mathematically correct posterior belief of whether you were poisoned, which you can then use to decide whether or not to seek medical attention. Unfortunately, you become paralyzed by indecision about whether your prior is closer to &quot;2.9%&quot; or &quot;2.8%&quot;. As time passes you start to feel nauseous...</p><p>It is pretty clear why you are being foolish. As long as your prior belief is not extremely small (for example, 1e-20), then the posterior probability of the plant being poisonous will be non-trivial and any reasonable utility calculation would tell you to seek medical attention. Partial knowledge of our prior, in this case that it is not extremely small, meaning that you think it is at least somewhat plausible the plant was poisonous, is all you needed to make a decision. This kind of reasoning feels much more intuitive because, while stating a precise prior might be difficult, asserting something like &quot;my prior is larger than 0.1%&quot; is pretty easy. If you feel like doing math, it is possible to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03705.pdf\">specify the conditions under which we can make decisions with imprecise knowledge about probabilities. </a></p><p>I suspect this kind of procedure, in particular the tendency to rule out extreme priors while not having a truly precise prior in mind, is pretty typical when people do probabilistic inference. To pick an example with more complex hypotheses, your prior belief in the probability it will rain today might be hard to specify, but you might at least know you are uncertain, meaning its close to uniform over the possible values of <span><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"0 \\le p(\\text{rain}) \\le 1\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">0</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">&#x2264;</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">p</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">rain</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">&#x2264;</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

This would be too vague for us to compute an exact posterior given new evidence, but it is sufficient to justify claiming our prior will be largely &quot;washed out&quot; by strong evidence, and thus we might be able to get a pretty clear picture of the posterior anyway. There is, admittedly, not much practical difference between framing things this way compared to just saying &quot;if you aren&apos;t sure what prior to use just pick a uniform one&quot;, but it can at least provide an answer to people who have qualms about how hand-wavy the latter sounds.</p><p>In short, we might not have precise priors, but we can still account for our imprecise priors in mathematically rigorous ways. This would reflect the intuition that the rules of probability ought to be followed, but our internal beliefs might be better thought of as loose assumptions about probability distributions rather than precisely defined probability distributions.

Most perspectives I’m aware of are constructive: they have some blueprint for how to build an aligned AI system, and propose making it more concrete, making the concretisations more capable, and showing that it does in fact produce an aligned AI system. I do not have a constructive perspective - I’m not sure how to build an aligned AI system, and don’t really have a favourite approach. Instead, I have an analytic perspective. I would like to understand AI systems that are built. I also want other people to understand them. I think that this understanding will hopefully act as a ‘filter’ that means that dangerous AI systems are not deployed. The following dot points lay out the perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Since the remainder of this post is written as nested dot points, some readers may prefer to read it in <a href=\"https://workflowy.com/s/an-analytical-perspe/eU45Fsjd7lzidjM8\">workflowy</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Background beliefs</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I am imagining a future world in which powerful AGI systems are made of components roughly like neural networks (either feedforward or recurrent) that have a large number of parameters.</li>\n  <li>Furthermore, I’m imagining that the training process of these ML systems does not provide enough guarantees about deployment performance.\n    <ul>\n      <li>In particular, I’m supposing that systems are being trained based on their ability to deal with simulated situations, and that that’s insufficient because deployment situations are hard to model and therefore simulate.\n        <ul>\n          <li>One reason that they are hard to model is the complexities of the real world.\n            <ul>\n              <li>The real world might be intrinsically difficult to model for the relevant system. For instance, it’s difficult to simulate all the situations in which the CEO of Amazon might find themselves.</li>\n              <li>Another reason that real world situations may be hard to model is that they are dependent on the final trained system.\n                <ul>\n                  <li>The trained system may be able to affect what situations it ends up in, meaning that situations during earlier training are unrepresentative.</li>\n                  <li>Parts of the world may be changing their behaviour in response to the trained system…\n                    <ul>\n                      <li>in order to exploit the system.</li>\n                      <li>by learning from the system’s predictions.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </li>\n              <li>The real world is also systematically different than the trained world: for instance, while you’re training, you will never see the factorisation of RSA-2048 (assuming you’re training in the year 2020), but in the real world you eventually will.\n                <ul>\n                  <li>This is relevant because you could imagine <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">mesa-optimisers</a> appearing in your system that choose to act differently when they see such a factorisation.</li>\n                </ul>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>I’m imagining that the world is such that if it’s simple for developers to check if an AI system would have disastrous consequences upon deployment, then they perform this check, and fail to deploy if the check says that it would.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Background desiderata</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I am mostly interested in allowing the developers of AI systems to determine whether their system has the cognitive ability to cause human extinction, and whether their system might try to cause human extinction.\n    <ul>\n      <li>I am not primarily interested in reducing the probabilities of other ways in which AI systems could cause humanity to go extinct, such as research groups intentionally behaving badly, or an uncoordinated set of releases of AI systems that interact in negative ways.\n        <ul>\n          <li>That being said, I think that pursuing research suggested by this perspective could help with the latter scenario, by making it clear which interaction effects might be present.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>I want this determination to be made before the system is deployed, in a ‘zero-shot’ fashion, since this minimises the risk of the system actually behaving badly before you can detect and prevent it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Transparency</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The type of transparency that I’m most excited about is mechanistic, in a sense that I’ve described <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3kwR2dufdJyJamHQq/mechanistic-transparency-for-machine-learning\">elsewhere</a>.</li>\n  <li>The transparency method itself should be based on a trusted algorithm, as should the method of interpreting the transparent artefact.\n    <ul>\n      <li>In particular, these operations should not be done by a machine learning system, unless that system itself has already been made transparent and verified.\n        <ul>\n          <li>This could be done <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-157debfd1616\">amplification-style</a>.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Ideally, models could be regularised for transparency during training, with little or no cost to performance.\n    <ul>\n      <li>This would be good because by default models might not be very transparent, and it might be hard to hand-design very transparent models that are also capable.\n        <ul>\n          <li>I think of this as what one should derive from Rich Sutton’s <a href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\">bitter lesson</a></li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>This will be easier to do if the transparency method is simpler, more ‘mathematical’, and minimally reliant on machine learning.</li>\n      <li>You might expect little cost to performance since neural networks can often reach high performance given constraints, as long as they are deep enough.\n        <ul>\n          <li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08838\">This paper</a> on the intrinsic dimension of objective landscapes shows that you can constrain neural network weights to a low-dimensional subspace and still find good solutions.</li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01755\">This paper</a> argues that there are a large number of models with roughly the same performance, meaning that ones with good qualities (e.g. interpretability) can be found.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06178\">This paper</a> applies regularisation to machine learning models that ensures that they are represented by small decision trees.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>The transparency method only has to reveal useful information to developers, not to the general public.\n    <ul>\n      <li>This makes the problem easier but still difficult.</li>\n      <li>Presumably developers will not deploy catastrophically terrible systems, since catastrophes are usually bad for most people, and I’m most interested in averting catastrophic outcomes.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Foundations</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>In order for the transparency to be useful, practitioners need to know what problems to look for, and how to reason about these problems.</li>\n  <li>I think that an important part of this is ‘agent foundations’, by which I broadly mean a theory of what agents should look like, and what structural facts about agents could cause them to display undesired behaviour.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Examples:\n        <ul>\n          <li>Work on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">mesa-optimisation</a></li>\n          <li>Utility theory, e.g. the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem\">von Neumann-Morgenstern theorem</a></li>\n          <li>Methods of detecting which agents are likely to be intelligent or dangerous.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>For this, it is important to be able to look at a machine learning system and learn if (or to what degree) it is agentic, detect belief-like structures and preference-like structures (or to deduce things analogous to beliefs and preferences), and learn other similar things.\n    <ul>\n      <li>This requires structural definitions of the relevant primitives (such as agency), not subjective or performance-based definitions.\n        <ul>\n          <li>By ‘structural definitions’, I mean definitions that refer to facts that are easily accessible about the system before it is run.</li>\n          <li>By ‘subjective definitions’, I mean definitions that refer to an observer’s beliefs or preferences regarding the system.</li>\n          <li>By ‘performance-based definitions’, I mean definitions that refer to facts that can be known about the system once it starts running.</li>\n          <li>Subjective definitions are inadequate because they do not refer to easily-measurable quantities.</li>\n          <li>Performance-based definitions are inadequate because they can only be evaluated once the system is running, when it could already pose a danger, violating the “zero-shot” desideratum.</li>\n          <li>Structural definitions are required because they are precisely the definitions that are not subjective or performance-based that also only refer to facts that are easily accessible, and therefore are easy to evaluate whether a system satisfies the definition.</li>\n          <li>As such, definitions like “an agent is a system whose behaviour can’t usefully be predicted mechanically, but can be predicted by assuming it near-optimises some objective function” (which was proposed in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12387\">this paper</a>) are insufficient because they are both subjective and performance-based.</li>\n          <li>It is possible to turn subjective definitions into structural definitions trivially, by asking a human about their beliefs and preferences.

My original claims were correct.</em> </p><h3><strong>Three shocking true stories</strong></h3><p>I highly recommend you read the wiki pages yourself; otherwise, here are my summaries:</p><h4><strong>Cortés:</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Tenochtitlan\"> <strong>[wiki]</strong></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire\"> <strong>[wiki]</strong></a></h4><ul><li>April 1519: Hernán Cortés lands in Yucatan with ~500 men, 13 horses, and a few cannons. He destroys his ships so his men won't be able to retreat. His goal is to conquer the Aztec empire of several million people.</li><li>He makes his way towards the imperial capital, Tenochtitlán. Along the way he encounters various local groups, fighting some and allying with some. He is constantly outnumbered but his technology gives him an advantage in fights. His force grows in size, because even though he loses Spaniards he gains local allies who resent Aztec rule.</li><li>Tenochtitlán is an island fortress (like Venice) with a population of over 200,000, making it one of the largest and richest cities <em>in the world </em>at the time. Cortés arrives in the city asking for an audience with the Emperor, who receives him warily.</li><li>Cortés takes the emperor hostage within his own palace, indirectly ruling Tenochtitlán through him.</li><li>Cortés learns that the Spanish governor has landed in Mexico with a force twice his size, intent on arresting him. (Cortés' expedition was illegal!) Cortés leaves 200 men guarding the Emperor, marches to the coast with the rest, surprises and defeats the new Spaniards in battle, and incorporates the survivors into his army.</li><li>July 1520: Back at the capital, the locals are starting to rebel against his men. Cortés marches back to the capital, uniting his forces just in time to be besieged in the imperial palace. They murder the emperor and fight their way out of the city overnight, taking heavy losses.</li><li>They shelter in another city (Tlaxcala) that was thinking about rebelling against the Aztecs. Cortés allies with the Tlaxcalans and launches a general uprising against the Aztecs. Not everyone sides with him; many city-states remain loyal to Tenochtitlan. Some try to stay neutral. Some join him at first, and then abandon him later. Smallpox sweeps through the land, killing many on all sides and causing general chaos.</li><li>May 1521: The final assault on Tenochtitlán. By this point, Cortés has about 1,000 Spanish troops and 80,000 - 200,000 allied native warriors. He had 16 cannons and 13 boats. The Aztecs have 80,000 - 300,000 warriors and 400 boats. Cortés and his allies win.</li><li>Later, the Spanish would betray their native allies and assert hegemony over the entire region, in violation of the treaties they had signed. (EDIT: I'm actually not sure this is true, it may have been fake news, my bad. They definitely became hegemonic rulers of the region but I don't know the details of the treaties.)</li></ul><h4><strong>Pizarro</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Pizarro\"> <strong>[wiki]</strong></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_Peru\"> <strong>[wiki]</strong></a></h4><ul><li>1532: Francisco Pizarro arrives in Inca territory with 168 Spanish soldiers. His goal is to conquer the Inca empire, which was much bigger than the Aztec empire.</li><li>The Inca empire is in the middle of a civil war and a devastating plague.</li><li>Pizarro makes it to the Emperor right after the Emperor defeats his brother. Pizarro is allowed to approach because he promises that he comes in peace and will be able to provide useful information and gifts.</li><li>At the meeting, Pizarro ambushes the Emperor, killing his retinue with a volley of gunfire and taking him hostage. The remainder of the Emperor's forces in the area back away, probably confused and scared by the novel weapons and hesitant to keep fighting for fear of risking the Emperor's life.</li><li>Over the next months, Pizarro is able to leverage his control over the Emperor to stay alive and order the Incans around; eventually he murders the Emperor and makes an alliance with local forces (some of the Inca generals) to take over the capital city of Cuzco.</li><li>The Spanish continue to rule via puppets, primarily Manco Inca, who is their puppet ruler while they crush various rebellions and consolidate their control over the empire. Manco Inca escapes and launches a rebellion of his own, which is partly successful: He utterly wipes out four columns of Spanish reinforcements, but is unable to retake the capital. With the morale and loyalty of his followers dwindling, Manco Inca eventually gives up and retreats, leaving the Spanish still in control.</li><li>Then the Spanish ended up fighting <em>each other</em> for a while, while <em>also</em> putting down more local rebellions. After a few decades Spanish dominance of the region is complete. (1572).</li></ul><h4><strong>Afonso</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afonso_de_Albuquerque\"> <strong>[wiki]</strong></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Malacca_(1511)\"> <strong>[wiki]</strong></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_conquest_of_Goa\"> <strong>[wiki]</strong></a></h4><ul><li>1506: Afonso helps the Portuguese king come up with a shockingly ambitious plan. <em>Eight years </em>prior, the first Europeans had rounded the coast of Africa and made it to the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean contained most of the world's trade at the time, since it linked up the world's biggest and wealthiest regions. See<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUwmA3Q0_OE\"> this map of world population (timestamp 3:45)</a>. Remember, this is prior to the Industrial and Scientific Revolutions; Europe is just coming out of the Middle Ages and does not have an obvious technological advantage over India or China or the Middle East, and has an obvious economic <em>disadvantage</em>. And Portugal is a just tiny state on the edge of the Iberian peninsula.</li><li>The plan is: Not only will we go into the Indian Ocean and participate in the trading there -- cutting out all the middlemen who are currently involved in the trade between that region and Europe -- we will <em>conquer strategic ports around the region so that no one else can trade there!</em></li><li>Long story short, Afonso goes on to complete this plan by 1513. (!!!)</li></ul><p>Some comparisons and contrasts:</p><ul><li>Afonso had more European soldiers at his disposal than Cortes or Pizarro, but not many more -- usually he had about a thousand or so. He did have more reinforcements and support from home.</li><li>Like them, he was usually significantly outnumbered in battles. Like them, the empires he warred against were vastly wealthier and more populous than his forces.</li><li>Like them, Afonso was often able to exploit local conflicts to gain local allies, which were crucial to his success.</li><li>Unlike them, his goal wasn't to conquer the empires entirely, just to get and hold strategic ports.</li><li>Unlike them, he was fighting empires that were technologically advanced; for example, in several battles his enemies had more cannons and gunpowder than he did.</li><li>That said, it does seem that Portuguese technology was qualitatively better in some respects (ships, armor, and cannons, I'd say.) Not dramatically better, though.</li><li>While Afonso's was a naval campaign, he did fight many land battles, usually marine assaults on port cities, or defenses of said cities against counterattacks. So superior European naval technology is not by itself enough to explain his victory, though it certainly was important.</li><li>Plague and civil war were not involved in Afonso's success.</li></ul><h3><strong>What explains these devastating conquests?</strong></h3><h4><strong>Wrong answer: I cherry-picked my case studies.</strong></h4><p>History is full of incredibly successful conquerors: Alexander the Great, Ghenghis Khan, etc. Perhaps some people are just really good at it, or really lucky, or both.</p><p>However: Three incredibly successful conquerors from the same tiny region and time period, conquering three separate empires? Followed up by dozens of less successful but still very successful conquerors from the same region and time period? Surely this is not a coincidence. Moreover, it’s not like the conquistadors had many failed attempts and a few successes. The Aztec and Inca empires were the two biggest empires in the Americas, and there weren’t any other Indian Oceans for the Portuguese to fail at conquering.</p><p>Fun fact: I had not heard of Afonso before I started writing this post this morning. Following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_%28writing%29\">Rule of Three</a>, I needed a third example and I predicted on the basis of Cortes and Pizarro that there would be other, similar stories happening in the world at around that time. That’s how I found Afonso.</p><h4><strong>Right answer: Technology</strong></h4><p>However, I don't think this is the whole explanation. The technological advantage of the conquistadors was not overwhelming.</p><p>Whatever technological advantage the conquistadors had over the existing empires, it was the sort of technological advantage that one could acquire <em>before</em> the Scientific and Industrial revolutions. Technology didn't change very fast back then, yet Portugal managed to get a lead over the Ottomans, Egyptians, Mughals, etc. that was sufficient to bring them victory. On paper, the Aztecs and Spanish were pretty similar: Both were medieval, feudal civilizations. I don't know for sure, but I'd bet there were at least a few techniques and technologies the Aztecs had that the Spanish didn't. And of course the technological similarities between the Portuguese and their enemies were much stronger; the Ottomans even had access to European mercenaries! Even in cases in which the conquistadors had technology that was completely novel -- like steel armor, horses, and gunpowder were to the Aztecs and Incas -- it wasn't god-like. The armored soldiers were still killable; the gunpowder was more effective than arrows but limited in supply, etc.</p><p>(Contrary to popular legend, neither Cortés nor Pizarro were regarded as gods by the people they conquered. The Incas concluded pretty early on that the Spanish were mere men, and while the idea did float around the Aztecs for a bit the modern historical consensus is that most of them didn't take it seriously.)</p><p>Ask yourself: Suppose Cortés had found 500 local warriors, gave them all his equipment, trained them to use it expertly, and left. Would those local men have taken over all of Mexico? I doubt it. And this is despite the fact that they would have had much better local knowledge than Cortés did! Same goes for Pizarro and Afonso. Perhaps if he had found 500 local warriors <em>led by an exceptional commander</em> it would work. But the explanation for the conquistador’s success can’t just be that they were all exceptional commanders; that would be positing too much innate talent to occur in one small region of the globe at one time.</p><h4><strong>Right answer: Strategic and diplomatic cunning</strong></h4><p>This is my non-expert guess about the missing factor that joins with technology to explain this pattern of conquistador success.</p><p>They didn't just have technology; they had <em>effective</em> <em>strategy </em>and they had <em>effective diplomacy</em>. They made long-term plans that <em>worked </em>despite being breathtakingly ambitious. (And their short-term plans were usually pretty effective too, read the stories in detail to see this.) Despite not knowing the local culture or history, these conquistadors made surprisingly savvy diplomatic decisions. They knew when they could get away with breaking their word and when they couldn't; they knew which outrages the locals would tolerate and which they wouldn’t; they knew how to convince locals to ally with them; they knew how to use words to escape militarily impossible situations… The locals, by contrast, often badly misjudged the conquistadors, e.g. not thinking Pizarro had the will (or the ability?) to kidnap the emperor, and thinking the emperor would be safe as long as they played along.</p><p>This raises the question, how did they get that advantage? My answer: they had <em>experience </em>with this sort of thing, whereas locals didn't. Presumably Pizarro learned from Cortés' experience; his strategy was pretty similar. (See also:<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Canary_Islands\"> the prior conquest of the Canary Islands by the Spanish</a>). In Afonso's case, well, the Portuguese had been sailing around Africa, conquering ports and building forts for more than a hundred years.</p><h3><strong>Lessons I think we learn</strong></h3><p>I think we learn that:</p><p>It is occasionally possible for a small force to quickly conquer large parts of the world, despite:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>Having only a minuscule fraction of the world's resources and power</li><li>Having technology + diplomatic and strategic cunning that is better but not <em>that </em>much better</li><li>Having very little data about the world when the conquest begins</li><li>Being disunited</li></ol><p>Which all suggests that it isn’t as implausible that a small AI takes over the world in mildly favorable circumstances as is sometimes thought.</p><p><em>EDIT: In light of good pushback from people (e.g. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MNPrXCsPpwTgygMxc/cortes-pizarro-and-afonso-as-precedents-for-takeover#xZ8h23jc9pmp8Mqhy\">Lucy.ea8</a> and <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ivpKSjM4D6FbqF4pZ/cortes-pizarro-and-afonso-as-precedents-for-takeover#kNFNjBJjuzTd3irrR\">e.g. Matthew Barnett)</a> about the importance of disease, I think one should probably add a caveat to the above: \"In times of chaos &amp; disruption, at least.\" </em></p><h4><strong>Having only a minuscule fraction of the world's resources and power</strong></h4><p>In all three examples, the conquest was more or less completed without support from home; while Spain/Portugal did send reinforcements, it wasn't even close to the entire nation of Spain/Portugal fighting the war. So these conquests are examples of non-state entities conquering states, so to speak. (That said, their <em>claim </em>to represent a large state may have been crucial for Cortes and Pizarro getting audiences and respect initially.) Cortés landed with about a thousandth the troops of Tenochtitlan, which controlled a still larger empire of vassal states. Of course, his troops were better equipped, but on the other hand they were also cut off from resupply, whereas the Aztecs were in their home territory, able to draw on a large civilian population for new recruits and resupply.</p><p>The conquests succeeded in large part due to diplomacy. This has implications for AI takeover scenarios; rather than imagining a conflict of humans vs. robots, we could imagine humans vs. humans-with-AI-advisers, with the latter faction winning and somehow by the end of the conflict the AI advisers have managed to become <em>de facto</em> rulers, using the humans who obey them to put down rebellions by the humans who don't.</p><h4><strong>Having technology + diplomatic and strategic skill that is better but not <em>that </em>much better</strong></h4><p>As previously mentioned, the conquistadors didn’t enjoy god-like technological superiority. In the case of Afonso the technology was pretty similar. Technology played an important role in their success, but it wasn’t enough on its own. Meanwhile, the conquistadors may have had more diplomatic and strategic cunning (or experience) than the enemies they conquered. But not that much more--they are only human, after all. And their enemies were pretty smart.</p><p>In the AI context, we don't need to imagine god-like technology (e.g. swarms of self-replicating nanobots) to get an AI takeover. It might even be possible without any new physical technologies at all! Just superior software, e.g. piloting software for military drones, targeting software for anti-missile defenses, cyberwarfare capabilities, data analysis for military intelligence, and of course excellent propaganda and persuasion.</p><p>Nor do we need to imagine an AI so savvy and persuasive that it can persuade anyone of anything. We just need to imagine it about as cunning and experienced relative to its enemies as Cortés, Pizarro, and Afonso were relative to theirs. (Presumably no AI would be experienced with world takeover, but perhaps an intelligence advantage would give it the same benefits as an experience advantage.) And if I’m wrong about this explanation for the conquistador’s success--if they had no such advantage in cunning/experience--then the conclusion is even stronger.</p><p>Additionally, in a rapidly-changing world that is undergoing<a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/\"> slow takeoff</a>, where there are lesser AIs and AI-created technologies all over the place, most of which are successfully controlled by humans, AI takeover might still happen if one AI is better, but not that much better, than the others.</p><h4><strong>Having very little data about the world when the conquest begins</strong></h4><p>Cortés invaded Mexico knowing very little about it. After all, the Spanish had only realized the Americas existed two decades prior. He heard rumors of a big wealthy empire and he set out to conquer it, knowing little of the technology and tactics he would face. Two years later, he ruled the place.</p><p>Pizarro and Afonzo were in better epistemic positions, but still, they had to learn a lot of important details (like what the local power centers, norms, and conflicts were, and exactly what technology the locals had) on the fly. But they were good at learning these things and making it up as they went along, apparently.</p><p>We can expect superhuman AI to be good at learning. Even if it starts off knowing very little about the world -- say, it figured out it was in a training environment and hacked its way out, having inferred a few general facts about its creators but not much else -- if it is good at learning and reasoning, it might still be pretty dangerous.</p><h4><strong>Being disunited</strong></h4><p>Cortés invaded Mexico in defiance of his superiors and had to defeat the army they sent to arrest him. Pizarro ended up fighting a civil war against his fellow conquistadors in the middle of his conquest of Peru. Afonzo fought Greek mercenaries and some traitor Portuguese, conquered Malacca against the  orders of a rival conquistador in the area, and was ultimately demoted due to political maneuvers by rivals back home.</p><p>This astonishes me. Somehow these conquests were completed by people who were at the same time busy infighting and backstabbing each other!</p><p>Why was it that the conquistadors were able to split the locals into factions, ally with some to defeat the others, and end up on top? Why didn't it happen the other way around: some ambitious local ruler talks to the conquistadors, exploits their internal divisions, allies with some to defeat the others, and ends up on top?</p><p>I think the answer is partly the \"diplomatic and strategic cunning” mentioned earlier, but mostly other things. (The conquistadors were disunited, but presumably were united in the ways that mattered.) At any rate, I expect AIs to be pretty<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/gYaKZeBbSL4y2RLP3/strategic-implications-of-ais-ability-to-coordinate-at-low\"> good at coordinating too</a>; they should be able to conquer the world just fine even while competing fiercely with each other.

If the jingle is longer at\nlower tempos and shorter at faster tempos, then I need to treat it as\ntwo sounds, while if the jingle is always the same length but played\nmore or less frequently, then I can take the whole jingle as a sample.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt looks to me like it's the latter:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/tambourine-fast-vs-slow.png\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/tambourine-fast-vs-slow.png 550w, https://www.jefftk.com/tambourine-fast-vs-slow-2x.png 1100w\" />\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe distance between peaks of the jingle looks like ~100ms with both\nfast and slow playing.  In the slow playing (top) the peaks of a\njingle are closer to each other than to the peaks of adjacent jingles,\nwhile in faster playing (bottom) the peaks are more evenly spaced.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt looks like I only need two samples.  First, a free jingle (1, 2,\n4):\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/tambourine-sample-free-jingle.wav\">wav</a>)\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnd then a, louder, stopped jingle (3):\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n (<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/tambourine-sample-stopped-jingle.wav\">wav</a>)\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOne thing that makes this tricky is that this is very \"slow\nto sound\".  You need to trigger the sample ~100ms before you want the\nbeat to fall.  In my stage setup I <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/playing-with-arpeggiators\">tap the downbeats</a> and it\npredicts the upbeats, so I handle this by, for the tambourine,\nadditionally predicting the next downbeat so it can anticipate it by\n100ms.\n\n  </p>",

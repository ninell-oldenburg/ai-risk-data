<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class=""entry"" style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"">
<p>When people worry about the dark side of emerging technologies, most think of terrorists or lone psychopaths with a death wish for humanity. Some future&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski"">Ted Kaczynski</a>&nbsp;might acquire a masters degree in microbiology, purchase some laboratory equipment intended for biohackers, and synthesize a pathogen that spreads quickly, is incurable, and kills 90 percent of those it infects.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Benjamin Wittes and Gabriella Blum&nbsp;<a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=Ak4dDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq="">imagine a scenario</a>&nbsp;in which a business competitor releases &ldquo;a drone attack spider, purchased from a bankrupt military contractor, to take you out. &hellip; Upon spotting you with its sensors, before you have time to weigh your options, the spider&mdash;if it is, indeed, an attack spider&mdash;shoots an infinitesimally thin needle &hellip; containing a lethal dose of a synthetically produced poison.&rdquo; Once this occurs, the spider exits the house and promptly self-destructs, leaving no trace behind it.</p>
<p>This is a rather terrifying picture of the future that, however fantastical it may sound, is not implausible given current techno-developmental trends. The fact is that emerging technologies like synthetic biology and nanotechnology are becoming exponentially&nbsp;<em>more powerful</em>&nbsp;as well as more accessible to small groups and even single individuals. At the extreme, we could be headed toward a world in which a large portion of society, or perhaps everyone, has access to a &ldquo;<a href=""http://jetpress.org/v26.2/torres.pdf"">doomsday button</a>&rdquo; that could annihilate our species if pressed.</p>
<p>This is an unsettling thought given that there are hundreds of thousands of terrorists&mdash;according to one estimate&mdash;and roughly&nbsp;<a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=mU05YWM2aUUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=martha+stout+4+percent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO0OTP8cfRAhXEWCYKHbr7DQsQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=4 percent&amp;f=false"">4 percent of the population are sociopaths</a>&mdash;meaning that there are approximately 296 million sociopaths in our midst today. The danger posed by such agents could become existential in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>But what if deranged nutcases with nefarious intentions aren&rsquo;t the most significant threat to humanity? An issue that rarely comes up in such conversations is the potentially greater danger posed by well-intentioned people with access to advanced technologies. In his erudite and alarming book&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Our-Final-Hour-Scientists-Warning/dp/0465068634/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484611762&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=our+final+hour""><em>Our Final Hour</em></a>, Sir Martin Rees distinguishes between two types of agent-related risks: terror and error. The difference between these has nothing to do with the consequences&mdash;a catastrophe caused by error could be no less devastating than one caused by terror. Rather, what matters are the intentions behind the finger that pushes a doomsday button, causing spaceship Earth to explode.</p>
<p>There are reasons for thinking that error could actually constitute a greater threat than terror. First, let&rsquo;s assume that science and technology become democratized such that most people on the planet have access to a doomsday button of some sort. Let&rsquo;s say that the global population at this time is 10 billion people.</p>
<p>Second, note that the number off individuals who could pose an error threat will vastly exceed the number of individuals who would pose a terror threat. (In other words, the former is a superset of the latter.) On the one hand, every terrorist hell-bent on destroying the world could end up pushing the doomsday button by accident. Perhaps while attempting to create a designer pathogen that kills everyone not vaccinated against it, a terrorist inadvertently creates a virus that escapes the laboratory and is 100 percent lethal. The result is a global pandemic that snuffs out the human species.</p>
<p>On the other hand, any good-intentioned hobbyist with a<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-it-yourself_biology"">&nbsp;biohacking laboratory</a>&nbsp;could also accidentally create a new kind of lethal germ. History reveals numerous leaks from highly regulated laboratories&mdash;the 2009 swine flu epidemic that killed 12,000 between 2009 and 2010 was&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/did-leak-from-a-laboratory-cause-swine-flu-pandemic-1724448.html"">likely caused by a laboratory mistake in the late 1970s</a>&mdash;so it&rsquo;s not implausible to imagine someone in a largely unregulated environment mistakenly releasing a pathogenic bug.</p>
<p>In a world where nearly everyone has access to a doomsday button, exactly how long could it last? We can, in fact,&nbsp;<a href=""http://thebulletin.org/who-would-destroy-world10253"">quantify the danger here</a>. Let&rsquo;s begin by imagining a world in which all 10 billion people have (for the sake of argument) a doomsday button on their smartphone. This button could be pushed at any moment if one opens up the Doomsday App. Further imagine that of the 10 billion people who live in this world,&nbsp;<em>not a single one</em>&nbsp;has any desire to destroy it. Everyone wants the world to continue and humanity to flourish.</p>
<p>Now, how likely is this world to survive the century if each individual has a tiny chance of pressing the button? Crunching a few numbers, it turns out that doom would be all-but-guaranteed if each person had a negligible 0.000001 percent chance of error. The reason is that even though the likelihood of any one person causing total annihilation on accident is incredibly small, this probability adds up across the population. With 10 billion people, one should expect an existential catastrophe even if everyone is very, very, very careful not to press the button.</p>
<p>Consider an alternative scenario: imagine a world of 10 billion morally good people in which only 500 have the Doomsday App on their smartphone. This constitutes a mere 0.000005 percent of the total population. Imagine further that each of these individuals has an incredibly small 1 percent chance of pushing the button each decade. How long should civilization as a whole, with its 10 billion denizens, expect to survive? Crunching a few numbers again reveals that the probability of annihilation in the next 10 years would be a whopping 99 percent&mdash;that is, more or less certain.</p>
<p>The staggering danger of this situation stems from the two trends mentioned above: the growing power and accessibility of technology. A world in which fanatics want to blow everything up would be extremely dangerous if &ldquo;weapons of total destruction&rdquo; were to become widespread. But even if future people are perfectly compassionate&mdash;perhaps because of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Unfit-Future-Enhancement-Uehiro-Practical/dp/0198707924/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484612513&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=savulescu+persson"">moral bioenhancements</a>&nbsp;or what Steven Pinker calls the &ldquo;<a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=J7ATQb6LZX0C&amp;pg=PT698&amp;dq="">moral Flynn effect</a>&rdquo;&mdash;the fact of human fallibility will make survival for centuries or decades highly uncertain. As&nbsp;<a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=2NNfIXyttn4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=If+there+were+millions+of+independent+fingers+on+the+button+of+a+Doomsday+machine,+then+one+person%E2%80%99s+act+of+irrationality,+or+even+one+person%E2%80%99s+error,+could+do+us+all+in.+%E2%80%A6+Disastrous+accidents+(for+instance,+the+unintended+creation+or+release+of+a+noxious+fast-spreading+pathogen,+or+a+devastating+software+error)+are+possible+even+in+well-regulated+institutions.+As+the+threats+become+graver,+and+the+possible+perpetrators+more+numerous,+disruption+may+become+so+pervasive+that+society+corrodes+and+regresses.+There+is+a+longer-term+risk+even+to+humanity+itself.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm8Tw88fRAhUHKiYKHSsjCOEQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q="">Rees puts this point</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there were millions of independent fingers on the button of a Doomsday machine, then one person&rsquo;s act of irrationality, or even one person&rsquo;s error, could do us all in. &hellip; Disastrous accidents (for instance, the unintended creation or release of a noxious fast-spreading pathogen, or a devastating software error) are possible even in well-regulated institutions. As the threats become graver, and the possible perpetrators more numerous, disruption may become so pervasive that society corrodes and regresses. There is a longer-term risk even to humanity itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=B87QCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq="">As scholars have noted</a>, &ldquo;an elementary consequence of probability theory [is] that even very improbable outcomes are very likely to happen, if we wait long enough.&rdquo; The exact same goes for improbable events that could be caused by a sufficiently large number of individuals&mdash;not across time, but across space.</p>
<p>Could this situation be avoided? Maybe. For example, perhaps engineers could design future technologies with safety mechanisms that prevent accidents from causing widespread harm&mdash;although this may turn out to be more difficult than it seems. Or, as&nbsp;<a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=9FtnppNpsT4C&amp;pg=PT536&amp;dq=nanotech+immune+kurzweil&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_-veb9cfRAhVIWCYKHToqA40Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nanotech immune kurzweil&amp;f=false"">Ray Kurzweil suggests</a>, we could build a high-tech nano-immune system to detect and destroy self-replicating nanobots released into the biosphere (a doomsday scenario known as &ldquo;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo"">grey goo</a>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Another possibility advocated by Ingmar Persson and Julian Savulescu entails&nbsp;<a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=_zpoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq="">making society just a little less &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;by trading personal privacy for global security. While many people may, at first glance, be resistant to this proposal&mdash;after all, privacy seems like a moral right of all humans&mdash;if the alternative is annihilation than this trade-off might be worth the sacrifice. Or perhaps we could&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/articles1(3)/sousveillance.pdf"">adopt the notion of sousveillance</a>, whereby citizens themselves monitor society the use of wearable cameras and other apparatuses. In other words, the surveillees (those being watched) could use advanced technologies to surveil the surveillers (those doing the watching)&mdash;a kind of &ldquo;inverse&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon"">panopticon</a>&rdquo; to protect people from the misuse and abuse of state power.</p>
<p>While terror gets the majority of attention from scholars and the media, we should all be thinking more about the existential dangers inherent in the society-wide distribution of offensive capabilities involving advanced technologies. There&rsquo;s a frighteningly good chance that future civilization will be more susceptible to error than terror.</p>

</style></head><body><p>Paul Christiano and ""MIRI"" have disagreed on an important research question for a long
time: should we focus research on aligning ""messy"" AGI (e.g. one found through
gradient descent or brute force search) with human values, or on developing
""principled"" AGI (based on theories similar to Bayesian probability theory)?  I'm going to present my current model of this disagreement and additional thoughts about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>I put ""MIRI"" in quotes because MIRI is an organization composed of people who
have differing views.  I'm going to use the term ""MIRI view"" to refer to some
combination of the views of Eliezer, Benya, and Nate.  I think these three
researchers have quite similar views, such that it is appropriate in some
contexts to attribute a view to all of them collectively; and that these
researchers' views constitute what most people think of as the ""MIRI view"".</p>
<p>(<a href=""https://arbital.com/p/KANSI/"">KANSI AI</a> complicates this disagreement
somewhat; the story here is that we can use ""messy"" components in a KANSI AI but
these components have to have their capabilities restricted significantly.  Such
restriction isn't necessary if we think messy AGI can be aligned in general.)</p>
<h2>Intuitions and research approaches</h2>
<p>I'm generally going to take the perspective of looking for the intuitions
motivating a particular research approach or produced by a particular research
approach, rather than looking at the research approaches themselves.  I expect
it is easier to reach agreement about the how compelling a particular intuition
is (at least when other intuitions are temporarily ignored), than to reach
agreement on particular research approaches.</p>
<p>In general, it's quite possible for a research approach to be inefficient while
still being based on, or giving rise to, useful intuitions.  So a criticism of a
particular research approach is not necessarily a criticism of the intuitions
behind it.</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <em>learning problem</em> is a task for which the AI is supposed to output some
information, and if we wanted, we could give the information a score
measuring how good it is the task, using less than ~2 weeks of labor.  In
other words, there's an inexpensive ""ground truth"" we have access to.  This
looks a little weird but I think this is a natural category, and some of the
intuitions relate to learning and non-learning problems.  Paul has written
about learning and non-learning problems
<a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/not-just-learning-e3bfb5a1f96e#.cdrloy2zo"">here</a>.</li>
<li>An AI system is <em>aligned</em> if it is pursuing some combination of different
humans' values and not significantly pursuing other values that could impact
the long term future of humanity.  If it is pursuing other values
significantly it is <em>unaligned</em>.</li>
<li>An AI system is <em>competitive</em> if it is nearly as efficient as other AI systems
(aligned or unaligned) that people could build.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Listing out intuitions</h2>
<p>I'm going to list out a bunch of relevant intuitions.  Usually I can't actually convey
the intuition through text; at best I can write ""what someone who has this
intuition would feel like saying"" and ""how someone might go about gaining this
intuition"".  Perhaps the text will make ""logical"" sense to you without feeling
compelling; this could be a sign that you don't have the underlying intuition.</p>
<h2>Background AI safety intuitions</h2>
<p>These background intuitions ones that I think are shared by both Paul and MIRI.</p>
<p><strong>1. <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/orthogonality/"">Weak orthogonality</a>.</strong>  It is possible
to build highly intelligent agents with silly goals such as maximizing
paperclips.  Random ""minds from mindspace"" (e.g.  found through brute force
search) will have values that significantly diverge from human values.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/instrumental_convergence/"">Instrumental convergence</a>.</strong>
Highly advanced agents will by default pursue strategies such as gaining
resources and deceiving their operators (performing a ""treacherous turn"").</p>
<p><strong>3. <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/edge_instantiation/"">Edge instantiation</a>.</strong>
For most objective functions that naively seem useful, the maximum is quite
""weird"" in a way that is bad for human values.</p>
<p><strong>4. <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/patch_resistant/"">Patch resistance</a>.</strong>
Most AI alignment problems (e.g. edge instantiation) are very difficult to
""patch""; adding a patch that deals with a specific failure
will fail to fix the underlying problem and instead lead to further unintended
solutions.</p>
<h2>Intuitions motivating the agent foundations approach</h2>
<p>I think the following intuitions are sufficient to motivate the agent foundations
approach to AI safety (thinking about idealized models of advanced agents to
become less confused), and something <em>similar to</em> the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf"">agent foundations
agenda</a>, at least if one
ignores contradictory intuitions for a moment.  In particular, when considering
these intuitions at once, I feel compelled to become less confused about
advanced agents through research questions similar to those in the agent
foundations agenda.</p>
<p>I've confirmed with Nate that these are similar to some of his main intuitions
motivating the agent foundations approach.</p>
<p><strong>5. <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/"">Cognitive reductions are great</a>.</strong>
When we feel confused about something, there is often a way out of this
confusion, by figuring out which algorithm would have generated that confusion.
Often, this works even when the original problem seemed ""messy"" or ""subjective"";
something that looks messy can have simple principles behind it that haven't
been discovered yet.</p>
<p><strong>6. <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/tg/against_modal_logics/"">If you don't do cognitive reductions, you will put your confusion in boxes
and hide the actual
problem</a>.</strong>
By default, a lot of people studying a problem will fail to take the perspective
of cognitive reductions and thereby not actually become less confused.  The free
will debate is a good example of this: most discussion of free will contains
confusions that could be resolved using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett#Free_will"">Daniel Dennett's cognitive reduction of
free will</a>.  (This is
essentially the same as the cognitive reduction
<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Free_will_(solution)"">discussed in the sequences</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>7. We should expect mainstream AGI research to be inefficient at learning
much about the confusing aspects of intelligence, for this reason.</strong>
It's pretty easy to look at most AI research and see where it's hiding
fundamental confusions such as logical uncertainty without actually resolving
them.  E.g. if neural networks are used to predict math, then the confusion
about how to do logical uncertainty is placed in the black box of ""what this
neural net learns to do"".  This isn't that helpful for actually understanding
logical uncertainty in a ""cognitive reduction"" sense; such an understanding
could lead to much more principled algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>8. If we apply cognitive reductions to intelligence, we can design agents we
expect to be aligned.</strong> Suppose we are able to observe ""how intelligence feels
from the inside"" and distill these observations into an idealized cognitive algorithm for
intelligence (similar to the idealized algorithm Daniel Dennett discusses to
resolve free will).  The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax"">minimax
algorithm</a> is one example of this: it's
an idealized version of planning that in principle could have been derived by
observing the mental motions humans do when playing games.  If we implement an
AI system that approximates this idealized algorithm, then we
have a story for why the AI is doing what it is doing: it is taking action X
<em>for the same reason</em> that an ""idealized human"" would take action X.  That is,
it ""goes through mental motions"" that we can imagine going through (or
approximates doing so), if we were solving the task we programmed the AI to do.
If we're programming the AI to assist us, we could imagine the mental motions we
would take if we were assisting aliens.</p>
<p><strong>9. If we don't resolve our confusions about intelligence, then we don't have this
story, and this is suspicious.</strong> Suppose we haven't actually resolved our confusions
about intelligence.  Then we don't have the story in the previous point, so it's
pretty weird to think our AI is aligned.
We must have a pretty different story, and it's hard to imagine different
stories that could allow us to conclude that an AI is aligned.</p>
<p><strong>10. Simple reasoning rules will correctly generalize even for
non-learning problems.</strong> That is, there's some way that agents can learn rules
for making good judgments that generalize to tasks they can't get fast feedback
on.  Humans seem to be an existence proof that simple reasoning rules can generalize;
science can make predictions about far-away galaxies even when there isn't an
observable ground truth for the state of the galaxy (only indirect
observations).  Plausibly, it is possible to use ""brute force"" to find agents using these
reasoning rules by searching for agents that perform
well on small tasks and then hoping that they generalize to large tasks, but this can result in misalignment.   For example, Solomonoff induction <a href=""https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/"">is controlled by malign consequentialists</a> who have learned good rules for how to reason; approximating Solomonoff induction is one way to make an unaligned AI.  If an aligned AI is to be roughly
competitive with these ""brute force"" unaligned AIs, we should have some story
for why the aligned AI system is also able to acquire simple reasoning rules that
generalize well.  Note that Paul mostly agrees with this intuition and is in
favor of agent foundations approaches to solving this problem, although
his research approach would significantly differ from the current agent
foundations agenda. (This point is somewhat confusing; see <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1220"">my other post</a> for clarification)</p>
<h2>Intuitions motivating act-based agents</h2>
<p>I think these following intuitions are all intuitions that Paul has that motivate his current
research approach.</p>
<p><strong>11. Almost all technical problems are either tractable to solve or are
intractable/impossible for a good reason.</strong>  This is based on Paul's experience
in technical research.
For example, consider a statistical learning problem where we are trying to
predict a Y value from an X value using some model.  It's possible to get good statistical guarantees on problems where
the training distribution of X values is the same as the test distribution of X
values, but when those distributions are distinguishable (i.e. there's a
classifier that can separate them pretty well), there's a fundamental
obstruction to getting the same guarantees: given the information available,
there is no way to distinguish a model that will generalize from one that won't,
since they could behave in arbitrary ways on test data that is distinctly
different from training data.  An exception to the rule is NP-complete problems; we
don't have a good argument yet for why they can't be solved in polynomial time.
However, even in this case, NP-hardness forms a useful boundary between
tractable and intractable problems.</p>
<p><strong>12. If the previous intuition is true, we should search for solutions and fundamental obstructions.</strong>
If there is either a solution or a fundamental obstruction to a problem, then an
obvious way to make progress on the problem is to alternate between generating
obvious solutions and finding good reasons why a class of solutions (or all
solutions) won't work.  In the case of AI alignment, we should try getting a
very good solution (e.g. one that allows the aligned AI to be competitive with
unprincipled AI systems such as ones based on deep learning by exploiting the
same techniques) until we have a fundamental obstruction to this.  Such a
fundamental obstruction would tell us which relaxations to the ""full problem"" we
should consider, and be useful for convincing others that coordination is
required to ensure that aligned AI can prevail even if it is not competitive
with unaligned AI.  (Paul's research approach looks quite optimistic partially
because he is pursuing this strategy).</p>
<p><strong>13. We should be looking for ways of turning
arbitrary AI capabilities into equally powerful aligned AI capabilities.</strong>
On priors, we should expect it to be hard for AI safety researchers to make
capabilities advances; AI safety researchers make up only a small percentage of AI
researchers.  If this is the case, then aligned AI will be quite uncompetitive unless
it takes advantage of the most effective AI technology that's already around.
It would be really great if we could take an arbitrary AI technology (e.g. deep
learning), do a bit of thinking, and come up with a way to direct that
technology towards human values.  There isn't a crisp fundamental obstruction to
doing this yet, so it is the natural first place to look.  To be more specific
about what this research strategy entails, suppose it is possible to build
built an unaligned AI system.  We expect it to be competent; say it is competent for reason
X.  We ought to be able to either build an aligned AI system that also works for
reason X, or else find a fundamental obstruction.  For example, reason X could
be ""it does gradient descent to find weights optimizing a proxy for competence"";
then we'd seek to build a system that works because it does gradient descent to
find weights optimizing a proxy for competence and alignment.</p>
<p><strong>14. Pursuing human narrow values presents a much more optimistic picture of AI alignment.</strong>
See Paul's posts on <a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/ambitious-vs-narrow-value-learning-99bd0c59847e#.x7q6dso67"">narrow value
learning</a>,
<a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/act-based-agents-8ec926c79e9c#.qq75oyoro"">act-based
agents</a>,
and <a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/abstract-approval-direction-dc5a3864c092#.ovsgnfw9n"">abstract approval
direction</a>.
The agent foundations agenda often considers problems of the form ""let's use
Bayesian VNM agents as our starting point and look for relaxations appropriate
to realistic agents, which are naturalized"".  This leads to problems such as
decision theory, naturalized induction, and ontology identification.  However,
there isn't a clear argument for why they are subproblems of the problem we
actually care about (which is close to something like ""pursuing human narrow
values"").
For example, perhaps we can understand how to have an AI pursue human narrow values without
solving decision theory, since maybe humans don't actually have a utility function or
a decision theory yet (though we might upon long-term reflection; pursuing
narrow values should preserve the conditions for such long-term reflection).
These research questions might be useful threads to pull on if solving them
would tell us more about the problems we actually care about.  But I think Paul
has a strong intuition that working on these problems isn't the right way to
make progress on pursuing human narrow values.</p>
<p><strong>15. There are important considerations in favor of focusing on alignment for
foreseeable AI
technologies.</strong>
See posts
<a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/a-possible-stance-for-ai-control-research-fe9cf717fc1b#.7ueig1gia"">here</a>
and
<a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/scalable-ai-control-7db2436feee7#.5hmcn740d"">here</a>.
In particular, this motivates work related to alignment for systems solving
learning problems.</p>
<p><strong>16. It is, in principle, possible to automate a large fraction of human labor
using robust learning.</strong>  That is, a human can use <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> amount of labor to

fashion.
<a href=""http://icml2008.cs.helsinki.fi/papers/627.pdf"">KWIK learning</a> is a
particularly clean (though impractical) demonstration of this.  This enables
the human to spend much more time overseeing a particular decision than the AI
takes to make it (e.g. spending 1 day to oversee a decision made in 1 second),
since only a small fraction of decisions are overseen.</p>
<p><strong>17. The above is quite powerful, due to bootstrapping.</strong>  ""Automating a
large fraction of human labor"" is significantly more impressive than it first seems,
since the human can use other AI systems in the course of evaluating a specific
decision.  See
<a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/alba-an-explicit-proposal-for-aligned-ai-17a55f60bbcf#.s1rtrh37a"">ALBA</a>.  We don't yet have a fundamental obstruction to any of ALBA's subproblems, and we have an argument that solving these subproblems is sufficient to create an aligned learning system.</p>
<p><strong>18. There are reasons to expect the details of reasoning well to be ""messy"".</strong>
That is, there are reasons why we might expect cognition to be as messy and hard to
formalize as biology is.  While biology has some important large-scale features
(e.g. evolution), overall it is quite hard to capture using simple rules.  We
can take the history of AI as evidence for this; AI research often <em>does</em>
consist of people trying to figure out how humans do something at an idealized
level and formalize it (roughly similar to the agent foundations approach), and
this kind of AI research does not always lead to the most capable AI systems.
The success of deep learning is evidence that the most effective way for AI
systems to acquire good rules of reasoning is usually to learn them, rather than having
them be hardcoded.</p>
<h2>What to do from here?</h2>
<p>I find all the intuitions above at least somewhat compelling.  Given this, I
have made some tentative conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the intuition 10 (""simple reasoning rules generalize for non-learning
problems"") is particularly important.  I don't quite understand Paul's research
approach for this question, but it seems that there is
convergence that this intuition is useful and that we should take an agent
foundations approach to solve the problem.  I think this convergence
represents a great deal of progress in the overall disagreement.</li>
<li>If we can resolve the above problem by creating <em>intractable</em> algorithms for
finding simple reasoning rules that generalize, then plausibly something like
ALBA could ""distill"" these algorithms into a <em>competitive</em> aligned agent
making use of e.g. deep learning technology.  My picture of this is
vague but if this is correct, then the agent foundations approach and ALBA
are quite synergistic. Paul has written a bit about the relation between
ALBA and non-learning problems
<a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/not-just-learning-e3bfb5a1f96e#.cdrloy2zo"">here</a>.</li>
<li>I'm still somewhat optimistic about Paul's approach of ""turn arbitrary
capabilities into aligned capabilities"" and pessimistic about the alternatives
to this approach.  If this approach is ultimately doomed, I think it's likely
because it's far easier to find a single good AI system than to turn arbitrary
unaligned AI systems into competitive aligned AI systems; there's a kind of
""universal quantifier"" implicit in the second approach.  However, I don't see
this as a good reason not to use this research approach.  It seems like if it
is doomed, we will likely find some kind of fundamental obstruction somewhere
along the way, and I expect a crisply stated fundamental obstruction to be
quite useful for knowing exactly which relaxation of the ""competitive aligned
AI"" problem to pursue.  Though this does argue for pursuing other approaches
in parallel that are motivated by this particular difficulty.</li>
<li>I think intuition 14 (""pursuing human narrow values presents a much more
optimistic picture of AI alignment"") is quite important, and would strongly
inform research I do using the agent foundations approach.  I think the main
reason ""MIRI"" is wary of this is that it seems quite vague and confusing, and
maybe fundamental confusions like decision theory and ontology identification
will re-emerge if we try to make it more precise.  Personally, I expect that,
though narrow value learning is confusing, it really ought to dodge decision
theory and ontology identification.  One way of testing this expectation would
be for me to think about narrow value learning by creating toy models of
agents that have narrow values but not proper utility functions.
Unfortunately, I wouldn't be too surprised if this turns out to be super messy
and hard to formalize.</li>

<p>I want to clarify my understanding of some of the motivations of MIRI's highly reliable agent design (HRAD) research (e.g. logical uncertainty, decision theory, multi level models).</p>
<h2>Top-level vs. subsystem reasoning</h2>
<p>I'll distinguish between an AI system's <em>top-level reasoning</em> and <em>subsystem reasoning</em>.  Top-level reasoning is the reasoning the system is doing in a way its designers understand (e.g. using well-understood algorithms); subsystem reasoning is reasoning <em>produced by</em> the top-level reasoning that its designers (by default) don't understand at an algorithmic level.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>AlphaGo</strong></p>
<p>Top-level reasoning: MCTS, self-play, gradient descent, ...</p>
<p>Subsystem reasoning: whatever reasoning the policy network is doing, which might involve some sort of ""prediction of consequences of moves""</p>
<p><strong>Deep Q learning</strong></p>
<p>Top-level reasoning: the Q-learning algorithm, gradient descent, random exploration, ...</p>
<p>Subsystem reasoning: whatever reasoning the Q network is doing, which might involve some sort of ""prediction of future score""</p>
<p><strong>Solomonoff induction</strong></p>
<p>Top-level reasoning: selecting (Cartesian) hypotheses by seeing which make the best predictions</p>
<p>Subsystem reasoning: the reasoning of <a href=""https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/"">the consequentialist reasoners who come to dominate Solomonoff induction</a>, who will use something like naturalized induction and updateless decision theory</p>
<p><strong>Genetic selection</strong></p>
<p>It is possible to imagine a system that learns to play video games by finding (encodings of) policies that get high scores on training games, and combining encodings of policies that do well to produce new policies.</p>
<p>Top-level reasoning: genetic selection</p>
<p>Subsystem reasoning: whatever reasoning the policies are doing (which is something like ""predicting the consequences of different actions"")</p>
<p>In the Solomonoff induction case and this case, if the algorithm is run with enough computation, the subsystem reasoning is likely to overwhelm the top-level reasoning (i.e. the system running Solomonoff induction or genetic selection will eventually come to be dominated by opaque consequentialist reasoners).</p>
<h2>Good consequentialist reasoning</h2>
<p>Humans are capable of good consequentialist reasoning (at least in comparison to current AI systems).  Humans can:</p>
<ul>
<li>make medium-term predictions about complex systems containing other humans</li>
<li>make plans that take months or years to execute</li>
<li>learn and optimize proxies for long-term success (e.g. learning skills, gaining money)</li>
<li>reason about how to write a computer program</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on.  Current AI systems are not capable of good consequentialist reasoning.  Superintelligent AGI systems would be capable of good consequentialist reasoning (though superintelligent narrow AI systems might not in full generality).</p>
<h2>The concern</h2>
<p>Using these concepts, MIRI's main concern motivating HRAD research can be stated as something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first AI systems capable of <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/pivotal/"">pivotal acts</a> will use good consequentialist reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default AI development path will not produce good consequentialist reasoning at the top level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, on the default AI development path, the first AI systems capable of pivotal acts will have good consequentialist subsystem reasoning but not good consequentialist top-level reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consequentialist subsystem reasoning will likely come ""packaged with a random goal"" in some sense, and this goal will not be aligned with human interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the default AI development path will produce, as the first AI systems capable of pivotal acts, AI systems with goals not aligned with human interests, causing catastrophe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that, even if the AI system is doing good consequentialist reasoning at the top level rather than in subsystems, this top-level reasoning must still be directed towards the correct objective for the system to be aligned.  So HRAD research does not address the entire AI alignment problem.</p>
<h2>Possible paths</h2>
<p>Given this concern, a number of possible paths to aligned AI emerge:</p>
<p><strong>Limited/tool AI</strong></p>
<p>One might reject premise 1 and attempt to accomplish pivotal acts using AI systems that do not use good consequentialist reasoning.  Roughly, the proposal is to have <em>humans</em> do the good consequentialist reasoning, and to use AI systems as tools.</p>
<p>The main concern with this proposal is that a system of humans and limited AIs might be much less effective (for a given level of computing resources) than an AI system capable of good consequentialist reasoning.  In particular, (a) a limited AI might require a lot of human labor to do the good consequentialist reasoning, and (b) human consequentialist reasoning is likely to be less effective than superintelligent AI consequentialist reasoning.</p>
<p>The main hope, despite this concern, is that either ""general consequentialist reasoning"" is not particularly important for the kinds of tasks people will want to use AI systems for (including <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/pivotal/"">pivotal acts</a>), or that some sort of global coordination will make the efficiency disadvantage less relevant.</p>
<p>Example research topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2015-3.pdf"">MDL intelligence distillation</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/oracle.pdf"">AI boxing</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hope that top-level reasoning stays dominant on the default AI development path</strong></p>
<p>Currently, it seems like most AI systems' consequentialist reasoning is explainable in terms of top-level algorithms.  For example, AlphaGo's performance is mostly explained by MCTS and the way it's trained through self-play.  The subsystem reasoning is subsumed by the top-level reasoning and does not overwhelm it.</p>
<p>One could hope that algorithms likely to be developed in the future by default (e.g. model-based reinforcement learning) continue to be powerful enough that the top-level consequentialist reasoning is more powerful than subsystem consequentialist reasoning.</p>
<p>The biggest indication that this might not happen by default is that we currently don't have an in-principle theory for good reasoning (e.g. we're currently confused about logical uncertainty and multi-level models), and it doesn't look like these theories will be developed without a concerted effort.  Usually, theory lags behind common practice.</p>
<p>Despite this, a possible reason for hope is that perhaps it's possible to AI researchers to develop enough tacit understanding of these theories for practical purposes.  Currently, algorithms such as MCTS are implicitly handling some subproblem of ""logical uncertainty"" without having a full formal theory, and this does not seem problematic yet.  It's conceivable that future algorithms will be similar to MCTS and implicitly handle larger parts of these theories in a way as well-understood as MCTS, such that good consequentialist reasoning in subsystems does not overwhelm the top-level consequentialist reasoning.</p>
<p>""MIRI"" has a strong intuition that this won't be the case, and personally I'm somewhat confused about the details; see Nate's comments below for details.</p>
<p>On this path, the most important research topics are those that relate to directing top-level consequentialist reasoning (implemented using algorithms on the default AI development path) towards useful objectives.  (Note that these research problems are also important on other paths; goals have to be specified at some point in all cases).</p>
<p>Example research topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding negative side effects</li>
<li>Avoiding reward hacking</li>
<li>Robustness to distribution shift</li>
<li>Safe exploration</li>
<li>Inverse reinforcement learning</li>
<li>Neural network transparency</li>
</ul>
<p>(research topics like these are discussed in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565v2.pdf"">Concrete Problems in AI Safety</a> and <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf"">Alignment for Advanced Machine Learning Systems</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Figure out some core of good consequentialist reasoning and ensure that AI is developed through this paradigm</strong></p>
<p>This is the main purpose of MIRI's research in HRAD.  The main hope is that there is some simple core of good reasoning that can be discovered through theoretical research.</p>
<p>On this pathway, it isn't currently cleanly argued that the right way to research good consequentialist reasoning is to study the particular MIRI research topics such as decision theory.  One could imagine other approaches to studying good consequentialist reasoning (e.g. thinking about how to train model-based reinforcement learners).  I think the focus on problems like decision theory is mostly based on intuitions that are (currently) hard to explicitly argue for.</p>
<p>Example research topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical uncertainty</li>
<li>Decision theory</li>
<li>Multi level models</li>
<li>Vingean reflection</li>
</ul>
<p>(see the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf"">agent foundations technical agenda paper</a>) for details)</p>
<p><strong>Figure out how to align a ""messy"" AI whose good consequentialist reasoning is in a subsystem</strong></p>
<p>This is the main part of Paul Christiano's research program.  Disagreements about the viability of this approach are quite technical; I have previously written about some aspects of this disagreement <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1129"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Example research topics:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Interaction with task AGI</h2>
<p>Given this concern, it isn't immediately clear how <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/genie/"">task AGI</a> fits into the picture.  I think the main motivation for task AGI is that it alleviates some aspects of this concern but not others; ideally it requires knowing fewer aspects of good consequentialist reasoning (e.g. perhaps some decision-theoretic problems can be dodged), and has subsystems ""small"" enough that they will not develop good consequentialist reasoning independently.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope I have clarified what the main argument motivating HRAD research is, and what positions are possible to take on this argument.  There seem to be significant opportunities for further clarification of arguments and disagreements, especially the MIRI intuition that there is a small core of good consequentialist reasoning that is important for AI capabilities and that can be discovered through theoretical research.</p>

Today I listened to <a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/03/campbell_harvey.html"" target=""_blank"">finance professor Campbell Harvey</a> talking about statistical significance in investment management. He shares a story that ties together a lot of what I wrote about in the last few &#8220;<a href=""https://putanumonit.com/category/math-class/"" target=""_blank"">math classes</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Harvey: </strong>A number of years ago I was shown some research, at a high-level meeting, at one of the top 3 investment banks in the world. And this person was presenting the research, and basically he had found a variable that looked highly significant in beating the market, with a regression analysis, as you said. And it turned out that this variable was the 17th monthly lag in U.S. Industrial Production.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Yeah. I&#8217;ve always known that&#8217;s an important factor. <em>[sarcastic]</em> But that&#8217;s the beauty of his approach: nobody knows it, but by his fabulous deep look at the data, he uncovered this secret relationship that no one else knows.</p>
<p><b>Harvey:</b> So, 17th lag? That seems a little unusual. So, usually we think of maybe the 2nd because one month the data isn&#8217;t available because of the publication delay. Maybe the 3rd. But the 17th&#8211;where&#8217;s that coming from? And then he basically said, &#8216;Well, that&#8217;s the only one that worked.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Harvey shouldn&#8217;t be surprised: he teaches at a business school. Business schools have to cover a lot of ground: leadership (organizing a party), marketing (telling people about the party), supply chain (buying the beer), accounting (Venmoing beer money) and networking (party). The MBAs who go on to become VPs at top investment banks have time for just one mandatory statistics class, which covers <em>p &lt; 0.05</em> and not much else.</p>
<p>Of course, p-values doesn&#8217;t sound impressive enough for finance professionals. Instead, an investment strategy is evaluated using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio"" target=""_blank"">Sharpe Ratio</a>: the ratio of excess return to volatility.</p>
<p>Taking a measurement (excess returns) and dividing it by the standard deviation (volatility) is simply calculating the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_statistic"" target=""_blank"">test statistic</a>. The test statistic is a normalized measure of how far the result is from the null &#8211; the null for investment is the return on a &#8220;risk free&#8221; asset like US treasuries. The test statistic generates the p-value, they are one and the same. Each (arbitrary and useless) p-value cutoff corresponds to a test statistic cutoff which translates to a Sharpe Ratio cutoff above which an investment strategy is &#8220;significant&#8221; enough to brag about in front of a finance professor.</p>
<p>Going from p-values to Sharpe Ratios only serves to obscure the problem of <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/12/18/multiplicitous/"" target=""_blank""><strong>multiplicity </strong>&#8211; testing many models and picking the best one</a>. The banker tested at least 17 hypotheses (1 month lag, 2 months lag, 17 months lag) until he found one that worked. It&#8217;s a lot easier (and more intuitive) to divide the p-value cutoff by 17 and see if the result is still significant than it is to figure how to adjust the Sharpe Ratio.</p>
<p>Traders talk about ratios, engineers about sigmas, doctors about confidence intervals &#8211; the underlying statistical logic to all these things is the same. And in almost every profession, multiplicity (<a href=""http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf"" target=""_blank"">even when its accidental</a>) is the quickest way for this logic to blow up in your face.</p>
<hr />
<p>Interestingly, after having a good laugh at the banker&#8217;s expense, Harvey continues the story:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Harvey: </strong>However, and this is kind of, I think interesting. My paper has been very well received by investment bankers and people designing these strategies. And actually it&#8217;s interesting because they actually don&#8217;t want to market a strategy that turns out to be a fluke. Because that means that it hurts their reputation. It reduces the amount of fees that they get. And it really, basically it could reduce their bonus directly. So there&#8217;s actually a strong incentive in terms of business practice to get it right. So, within the practitioner community, at least, there are strong incentives to reduce the impact of data mining, so that you can develop a good reputation.</p>
<p>However, on the academic side, it&#8217;s not as clear. As you said, there&#8217;s minimal replication in some fields. And the editors don&#8217;t see all of the hocus-pocus going on before the paper actually is submitted for scientific review.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Yeah. When you were in that meeting at the investment bank and the person said it was significant and you said, &#8216;Well, how many did you run?&#8217; and he said, &#8216;Well, 26, 24&#8217;, whatever it was, and you said, &#8216;That&#8217;s not significant&#8217;: Nobody around the table said, &#8216;So what? Doesn&#8217;t matter. We&#8217;ll be able to sell it because it&#8217;s over 2.&#8217;</p>
<p><b><strong>Harvey</strong>:</b> No. People, I&#8217;m sure: They do not want to do this. So that damages the reputation hugely. So, everything is reputation in terms of kind of street finance. And you want to do the right thing.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/01/20/art-long-nerdy/"" target=""_blank"">In the last post</a> I wrote that the two reasons to do data analysis are: 1 &#8211; Make the right decision, and 2 &#8211; get published in an academic journal. I wasn&#8217;t being (entirely) facetious.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that academics have less integrity or intellectual honesty than investment bankers, and I don&#8217;t think that Harvey implies it. Instead, we both believe in the core maxim of economics: that people will follow their incentives.</p>
<p>What makes the difference in this case is that a bank has different roles for the people who <em>make</em> the model and the people who <em>sell </em>them. As long as the person who creates the investment strategy gets their bonus based on how well the strategy performs, and not based how easy it is to convince clients of its <em>significance</em>, their incentives will keep them honest.</p>
<p>I wonder if one of the root causes of the bad research published in several disciplines is that the same person <em>makes</em> (i.e. designs and runs the experiment) and <em>sells</em> (to a journal).</p>
<p>People on a diet grab a cookie because near-term desires (taste the cookie right now) <a href=""http://behaviorlab.org/Papers/Hyperbolic.pdf"" target=""_blank"">easily overwhelm long-term goals</a> (being skinny next summer). A scientist has the long term goal of discovering enduring truths, but in the short term the journal editor wants <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"" target=""_blank"">p-values and positive results</a>.</p>
<p>As long as the cookies are on the table, it&#8217;s hard not to take a bite.</p>

KziuoBEE26Qf6k6zK,Facets of Problems v0.1,facets-of-problems-v0-1,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KziuoBEE26Qf6k6zK/facets-of-problems-v0-1,2017-01-28T12:00:42.672Z,5,4,18,False,False,,"<p>Problems can be decomposed into parts that are shared among different problems, these parts I'll call facets (for want of a better word, if there is some art I am ignorant of let me know). Each facet fundamentally effects how you approach a problem, by changing the class of problem being solved. Facets can be seen as parts of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"">paradigms</a> extended into everyday life.</p>
<p>For example, when trying to path find, given only the map, you may use something like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"">A* algorithm</a>. But if you have a map and an oracle to tell you that the optimal path runs through certain points, you can use that information decompose the problem into solving the shortest path between those points. Having that oracle is a facet to a problem. Another facet might be that you know of an automated doorway on a shortcut that is open and closed at different times. You no longer have a fixed map so the A* algorithm is not appropriate.&nbsp; You'll have to represent that probabilistically or try and figure out the pattern of the opening, so you can predict exactly when it is open.</p>
<p>There are a number of distinct ways that facets can impact your problem solving . These can be because :</p>
<ul>
<li>a facet suggests new sources of information to solve a problem (Epistemic) </li>
<li>a facet constrains the problem in a hard to discover way that make it easier to solve (Constraints)</li>
<li>a facet makes things harder to solve but more likely a good solution will be found if the facet is true (Inconveniences)</li>
<li>a facet means you have to manipulate your other facets (Meta)</li>
</ul>
<p>A problem can have many facets and they interact in a non-trivial fashion. Having the wrong facets can be very bad they form the systems <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias"">inductive</a> bias.</p>
<p>I think facets can impact different things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How we approach the world ourselves (Are we making use of all the facets that we can? How do the facets we are exploiting interfere? Do we have damaging facets?).</li>
<li>How we design systems that interact with the world. Enumerating the facets of a problem is the first step to trying to solve it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Epistemic status: Someone has probably thought of this stuff before. Hoping to find it. If they haven't and people find it useful I'll do a second version.</p>
<ol> </ol>
<p><a id=""more""></a></p>
<p>Base Assumptions: That throwing lots of resources at a single approach with no regard to facets is impractical (No AIXI type solution)</p>
<h2>Epistemic</h2>
<p>These facets can allow you to move more quickly to solving your problem by giving you information about the world, or how you should act.</p>
<p>Exploration - There are known unknowns. See what is there and or useful the in those locations. You have a function F(x) and you know the values of F(1) F(2) F(3) what is the value of F(10,000). Exploration is a known phase of reinforcement learning and it can <a href=""http://archive2.cra.org/Activities/craw_archive/dmp/awards/2004/Coggan/FinalReport.pdf"">interfere with Exploitation</a><a href=""http://archive2.cra.org/Activities/craw_archive/dmp/awards/2004/Coggan/FinalReport.pdf"">.</a></p>
<p>Generalisation - There are patterns in the unknowns so that it makes sense to try and generalise and discover the true function. More exploration can help with generalisation.</p>
<p>Being Taught - There is an agent out there that can model you in some way and provide feedback on how you are doing or processing data. Whether this is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning"">labeled input data</a> pairs or feedback in a language like ""Stop thinking so hard"" or ""A is for Apple"".</p>
<p>Copying agents -There are agents out there doing stuff, they may not be able to tell you what to do or they may tell you to do the wrong thing (if they are adversarial). But you can copy what they do. See <a href=""(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron"">mirror neurons</a>. This may be a pre-requisite for ""Being Taught"" if you don't want to pre-encode a language.</p>
<p>Research - There is linguistic information out there that may be useful find it. This is made more complex by the information being from agents with the wrong view of reality or overtly hostile agents.</p>
<p>Commissioned Learning - You can convince another existing agent to do some of the above for you and give you the results.</p>
<p>Creation of Learning systems - You can create a system that does some of the above for you and gives you the results.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>These facets can allow you look for certain patterns and make use of them more easily than having to derive them from experience or first principles.</p>
<p>Construction - You can break down a problem into parts, Solve those sub parts and re-assemble. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming"">modular programming</a>. Minimising the things you have to think about at once can make things more tractable.</p>
<p>Positive sum (Social) -There are other people you can communicate with and you share motivation with enough to encourage them to work with you. This adds complex things like, managing other peoples beliefs about you or your organisation. Are you competent? Do you know what you are doing? This can interact with paradigm shifting, unless you are explicitly trying to paradigm shift, you are not motivated to visibly search for things that undermine your current goal (you will look bad and people will no longer want to work/support you).</p>
<p>Adverserial/Zero-Sum - You win if another person loses. If the agent you are competing against is using ""Construction"" then figuring out the things they are trying to construct is important to be able to disrupt it. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax"">Minmax</a>. Individual strategies might be <a href=""/lw/yv/markets_are_antiinductive/"">anti-inductive</a> if you are competing against strong optimizers.<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax""><br /></a></p>
<p>Optimisation/Exploitation - You know a bunch of stuff, pick the best possible action. It might be non-obvious and require lots of processing to figure out the best action. I'm including this to contrast with satisficing or weird non-problems where every action is the same. Most interesting problems have some element of this.</p>
<p>Randomness - You know there is a source of randomness, so you have to manage your expectations/beliefs.</p>
<p>Game building - You want to create a system that encourages other agents/agent-like things to behave in certain ways (prediction markets/ school ranking metrics/ company management). You care less what individual agents know and just want to know enough about their goals so you can fit them into the game.</p>
<p>Introspective - There are things wrong with your internal programs. Explore them/make them more explicit and try and improve them. This might include ""Game Building"" if you model your internal state as a bunch of agents.</p>
<p>Physics - Your whole world is defined by discoverable rules and you can use them for predictions. s<sub>n+1</sub> = U(s<sub>n</sub>) what is the update function U? This is great, this means everything that happens in the world can be evidence for or against U.</p>
<p>Scientific constraints - There are rules that allow you to constrain the types of hypotheses you have for science. Like conservation of energy or that the update function is time reversible. Or Turing computable.</p>
<p>Optimiser Building - You are trying to build an optimiser to optimise the world for you. You define a goal and a search space, prior knowledge and an search algorithm. All these things embody a set of facets, This is classic AI. Note that it doesn't allow the system to move through facets, this is needed for AGI and general intelligence augmentation (GAI).</p>
<p>Optimising Optimiser Building - You are trying to build an optimiser to build an optimiser to optimise the world for you. You  define a goal type of optimser and a search space of possible optimisers, prior knowledge and an search  algorithm.</p>
<p>Super-optimiser control - You have a super-optimiser, It needs no facets to solve problems. Try and build a goal that it can maximise and <a href=""/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/"">still do what you want</a>.</p>
<p>Person Building - You are trying to build a person. People can adopt different facets, so this is not like optimiser building. People also don't have coherent goals throughout there lifetime. There is a rough purpose, survive and propagate, but that is hard to extract from the day to day activity. The day to day activity can look like optimising so it is good to adopt the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance"">intentional stance </a>towards them on a short timescale. However the intentional stance breaks down on the developmental time scale, due to the lack of coherent goals mentioned before. People are the only known General Intelligence.</p>
<p>Intelligence Augmentation - You are trying to figure out enough about the nature of how you work that you can expand it. Looking for the identity function (not to be confused with this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function"">identity function</a>) I (x) = I (x + c) and an aptitude function A(x+c ) &gt; A(x). Where you are x, c is some computational resource, + is some method of connection, A is an aptitude test you care about. This is only like optimiser building if x is an optimiser.</p>
<h2>Inconveniences</h2>
<p>These don't help you at all. They just mean that solutions that look good that if you ignore them may not be in fact be good.</p>
<p>Survival - If you make the wrong step you can't make any more. Although in some cases if you <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial"">can't take a step</a> you are likely to not be able to make any more. This means you cannot or do not want to explore the entire search space. This also means if your knowledge of what will cause death is faulty that you will fail to explore some useful regions.</p>
<p>Embedding within physics - Not only might you die. But your actions and internal actions all have cost and impacts <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking"">you might not expect</a>. Also people might be able to influence your internal state in ways <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer"">you might not expect</a>. Interacts with optimisation in that the process of optimisation now itself can have a cost. Time can also be a problem. Optimisation might not be optimal!</p>
<p>Judging Religion -&nbsp; There is a god judging every action and thought you have.</p>
<p>Evolutionary - You know that you and the other agents are products of evolution.</p>
<h2>Meta</h2>
<p>These facets refer to other facets</p>
<p>Paradigm shifting (Kuhnian sense) - You start with a model of the world (maybe acquired from research or being taught). Things don't seem consistent with your world view. Attempting to paradigm shift is to try and change your world view by gathering the inconsistencies and finding models that fit.&nbsp; For a part of the world your view is F(x) = y however F(x) !=y. Maybe you need to include other data (you should be creating a <a href=""/lw/ro/2place_and_1place_words/"">two-place</a> function&nbsp; and you need to find the other variable) or y is not a function of x at all.&nbsp; Or you need to add another facet to your view of the world. There are things that seem to need paradigm shifting currently (physics, the quantum and gravity split and AI/consciousness). If you try to paradigm shift you are likely to be wrong as you are going beyond your current model of reality and the world of possible models is vast. This can be seen as altering your <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/183989/what-exactly-is-a-hypothesis-space"">hypothesis space</a> and/or input space or your facets.</p>
<p>Teaching/Research - The epistemic ones, when they have linguistic information can allow you to switch facets too. You can encode facets linguistically (as I am doing here) and propagate them. This is something that is impossible to do with pure feedback (good/bad) or labeled input.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are lots of others. There might be ways of adding ethics and morality into this framework, but I'm not sure it useful. What else can people think of?</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I wrote this so I could have a vocabulary to talk about the rationalist community.</p>

<p>Suppose that we knew that superintelligent AI was to be developed within six months, what would I do?</p>
<p>Well, drinking coffee by the barrel at Miri's emergency research retreat I'd...... still probably spend a month looking at things from the meta level, and clarifying old ideas. But, assuming that didn't reveal any new approaches, I'd try and get something like this working.</p>
<p><a id=""more""></a></p>
<h2>Standard setup</h2>
<p>Take a reinforcement learner AI, that we want to <a href=""https://intelligence.org/stanford-talk/"">safely move a strawberry onto a plate</a>. A human sits nearby and provides a reward based on inspecting the AI's behaviour.</p>
<p>As it stands, this setup is completely vulnerable to <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565v2.pdf"">reward hacking</a>. The reward is not provided for safe moving of the strawberry; instead the reward is provided by having the human judge that the task has been accomplished and then pressing a button. Taking control of the human or control of the button is likely to be possible for a superintelligent AI; and, as it stands, that would be <em>mandated</em>&nbsp;by this reward function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Learning from positive and various negative examples</h2>
<p>Could we have the AI instead learn what the reinforcement signal ""should be""? It seems that it might at least be possible, if we can make the AI learn from both positive and negative examples. I'd make five categories of examples from which the AI could learn. It may be too dangerous to have the superintelligent AI used directly in constructing these examples; in that case, the rewards would be given to a simpler, dumber version of the AI, and the examples passed on to the superintelligent AI for offline training.</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple positive and negative examples. These are the basic examples from above: the AI completes the task or fails to, and gets the consequent reward. The AI stays within its room and the human is sober, rested, uninfluenced, and so on.</li>
<li>Simple more dubious examples. These are examples where the AI gets a reward, but the learning process judges that these rewards were not fairly allocated. Maybe the human was drunk, or not paying attention. Maybe they slipped, and pressed the button by accident. Or they were in a hurry to end their shift, and so pressed the button. All these examples are given a score from -1 to 1. Those with a score of 1 are taken as legitimate examples of rewards, those with a score of 0 are taken as random reward giving, while those with a score of -1 are taken as anti-rewards instead.</li>
<li>Extreme negative examples. Here we can offer the AI actions that lead to complicated outcomes that are not legitimate rewards. Maybe the action can *make* the controller drunk. Maybe they can start a tape playing that will convince the controller the area is haunted. They could cut the wire, fuse the button, switch the controller's task description, distract the controller, start an automated threat tape, and so on. All these are labelled as negative examples (even though the reward is given).</li>
<li>Hypothetical negative examples. If we can communicate hypothetical situations to the AI (especially if we can do that without fully specifying the hypothetical in detail), we can use that to extend the previous category to every situation we can imagine. We can have the AI trick, threaten, or kill the controller, destroy the rest of humanity, launch subagents to seize the button, take honeypots, and so on. We can't get an exhaustive list, but we can try to get as much examples of AIs behaving badly. These are also obviously labelled as negative examples (even though the reward is given).</li>
<li>Properties of the example space. It's not clear whether these are examples or features of the learning process. See the next sections for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nearest unblocked strategy vs overfitting</h2>
<p>If we simply told the AI to maximise reward, subject to the fact that all the negative examples are to be avoided, then we fall into the <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/nearest_unblocked/"">nearest unblocked strategy problem</a> (NUSP). The AI will simply choose a dangerous strategy that isn't too close to those that have been explicitly ruled out. Since we don't have the time, intelligence, or imagination to rule out all the dangerous strategies (and since some of them would be too dangerous for us to even <a href=""/lw/jao/siren_worlds_and_the_perils_of_overoptimised/"">contemplate</a>), this wouldn't work.</p>
<p>But if we consider the issue as a learning problem, the situation seems less dire. Then the NUSP seems simply an example of overfitting: if the AI has learnt that all these are photos of cats, it should be able to infer that something similar is also a cat, even if it isn't close to the labelled examples. Similarly for negative examples that aren't close to other negative examples.</p>
<p>But another variant of the NUSP continues to plague us. Suppose we had trained the AI only on black cats; how would we expect it to react when confronted with a white cat?</p>
<p>Imagine the space of behaviour as a high dimensional space, with the space of good behaviours as some compact subset. Then the negative examples we gave do not tightly surround that compact subset (that's standard NUSP). But we've also not spread the negative examples much around that space, due to the usual problems with our lack of intelligence and imagination. So the negative examples we've set are likely to occupy a very low dimensional space around the space of good behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Adding the properties</h2>
<p>However, once we've realised that, we can add it to the learning process. What method would be the best to pick out a constrained compact set in high dimensions, where the known positive and negative examples occupy a much smaller dimensional subspace? There might not be a good method, but there's probably a <em>best</em>&nbsp;method, given what we know or think we know.</p>
<p>The same goes for all the other properties we known about that space. For instance, if the AI uses different approaches for different humans, this is a likely failure mode. If it doesn't matter what the task the AI is given is (because the AI will just hack the human anyway), that's another failure mode - note, again, that this property makes more sense as a learning property than as a constraint. The perils (to humans) of unconstrained search is another known failure mode. Even the fact that we are using a dumber AI to construct the practical examples, is relevant. What sort of failure are we trying to avoid? When we box the AI or seal off the human with the reward button, again, what is this trying to achieve?</p>
<p>And so on, as we add all our intuitive understanding of the spaces of good and bad behaviours in this area.</p>
<p>Depending on how the learning process is designed, we can add these properties either as constraints for the learning process, or as part of the process itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Unusual actions versus unusual situations</h2>
<p>Now, this approach is not certain to work by any means, but as an emergency measure it seems to have potential. But note that it seems much safer as a measure to prevent the AI taking extreme/manipulative/unusual actions. Rather than as a way to constrain the AI's behaviour in unusual situations. This approach is intended to prevent the AI from taking over the world, rather than telling it what to do if it does take over. That's mainly because we have a vague idea what not taking over the world looks like (and we can produce many examples of this behaviour), but we're much more stumped as to what running the world well means.&nbsp;</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

But I do recognize preferences, my own preferences include a preference for the maximization of the preferences of others all else equal, and as a result I think in a way that generally aligns with the moral theory of preference utilitarianism, but if I had different preferences about the preferences of others I could just as easily be a deontologist or virtue theorist in terms of morality, so I see no problem in the contradictions that result from <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/the-developmental-role-of-play-443549cfed3b"">flatting my thinking</a> into terms of morality.</blockquote><p>Echoing this sentiment, a few days later this pithy line showed up in my Facebook feed:</p><span>The rules say we have to use consequentialism, but good people are deontologists, and virtue ethics is what actually works.</span><p>Depending on your thinking on morality it may sound to you like I&#x2019;m being evasive and Eli is being too clever, but I think both of us are trying to convey that something more complex is going on that ends up doing weird things if you squeeze it into the abstraction of morality. Eli <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence"">wrote extensively</a> on this topic back in 2008, but you may not like his writing, be unwilling to sift through it all, or simply find it unconvincing, so I&#x2019;ll try to cover the core of the issue here in my own way.</p><p>Morality concerns systems for reasoning about what is good and bad. It has two primary components we can examine: the systems themselves and the value judgements of right and wrong these systems operate on. Although some moral theories tie these two aspects tightly together, as in natural law theory and <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/24/the-invisible-nation-reconciling-utilitarianism-and-contractualism/"">contractualism</a>, we still need a way to choose, and thus judge, a moral system to use, so some part of value judgement must <a href=""https://meaningness.com/metablog/bongard-meta-rationality"">reside outside the system</a> if we want the system to be complete so we can use it to justify the use of the system. But by doing this we introduce a free variable that can contradict anything else in the system since it is not bound by its logic, thus forcing a choice between <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/40602513?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"">consistency and completeness</a>, and since morality specifically concerns &#x201C;systems&#x201D; it must choose consistency over completeness in the same way mathematics must choose to be <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/"">consistent instead of complete</a>.</p><p>This is no more fatal to morality than it is to mathematics, but it does mean we&#x2019;re going to see some weird stuff where we have to leave part of reality out to get a consistent remainder. Just as there are <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYDQWm49wU"">numbers we can&#x2019;t count</a> and <a href=""http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/csk/halt/"">questions we can&#x2019;t answer</a> with mathematics, we find <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/"">repugnant conclusions</a>&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;that we should maximize the creation of minimally good lives&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-trolley-problem"">trolley problems</a>&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;that you may act to harm less but still cause harm&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;in morality. These scenarios show us that even if moral theories usually align with our value judgements they don&#x2019;t always do so, thus we may benefit from having a way of thinking about right and wrong that aims for completeness instead of consistency.</p><p>Rather than beginning in logic and reasoning, as morality does, let&#x2019;s begin in value judgement. Value judgements are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"">preferences</a>, which is to say liking more and being more likely to take some actions than others, all else equal. Preferences are complete, in that there is a relationship between any two things such that we can say one is preferred to the other, but we may end up with inconsistent preferences, such as preferring apples to bananas and bananas to cucumbers but <a href=""https://chapman.edu/research-and-institutions/economic-science-institute/_files/ifree-papers-and-photos/michel-regenwetter1.pdf"">preferring cucumbers to apples</a>. This feature of preferences is annoying if you want to study <a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Homo_economicus"">rational actors</a> and is often <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-theory/"">worked around as needed</a>, but is great if you want to understand how decisions are made by real people.</p><p>Thinking about value judgements as preferences, you notice that value judgements in particular and preferences in general are not only about one&#x2019;s own behaviors, but include value judgements and <a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/04/08/the-essence-of-peopling/"">preferences on the behavior of others</a>. These exist even in the absence of a universalizing moral system, since even the most <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/"">libertarian</a> of people must have a preference for not having specific preferences about what others do. And since most people make some significant value judgements about the behavior of others, we quickly find ourselves in an interacting network of value judgements that collectively proscribe certain behaviors. That is, from value judgements alone we get a collection of heuristics and rules about what is good and bad, even if those judgements are not made systematically, and those heuristics and rules are shared among a community. Instead of a moral system we might call this a moral standard since it&#x2019;s inconsistent, hence not a system, but does provide standard answers to as many moral questions as possible.</p><p>One rule people generally include in moral standards is <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/integrity-for-consequentialists-ae97d3bec5a2#.svxtr63wi"">integrity</a>, i.e. a kind of self-consistency in moral choices. And the best way to have integrity is to have a systematic way of reasoning about the value judgements of your actions, thus creating a desire for the existence of a moral system. Unfortunately, our moral standard can by design never be fully consistent, so we&#x2019;re stuck with the dual of our original problem. We can neither find a satisfying answer to all moral questions using a moral system nor can we achieve integrity while satisfying all our value judgements.</p><p>This is what I mean when I say our thinking on what is good and bad becomes confused when squeezed into moral theory. The moment you manage to cover all situations you introduce contradictions and when you eliminate all the contradictions you leave out satisfying all value judgements. Morally, we are forever between a rock and a hard place.</p><span><figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fZVjKH-q_vC9oTyenXzRCQ.gif"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>Of course, this all makes a lot more sense if we think of morality as a kind of illusion or mirage we create by trying to impose our understanding of good and bad onto the world. If morality exists not in the territory, but in our maps, and if we rely on our maps so much that our thoughts become a part of our perceptions, then morality will seem to exist &#x201C;out there&#x201D; when it&#x2019;s mostly &#x201C;in here&#x201D;. We will mistake the subjective and intersubjective for the objective, and find we can never quite pin down reality under the thumb of morals.</p><p>So what are we to do if morality cannot tell us always how to act, we cannot satisfy all our preferences with integrity, and morality exists in the space between reality and our understanding of it? Should we give up, accept that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamut_%28Bartol_novel%29"">nothing is true and everything is permitted</a>? Probably not, since most people wouldn&#x2019;t like to live in such a world, and we&#x2019;ve shown a collective <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/revealed-and-stated-identity-64c6ec070f4f"">revealed preference</a> for combining integrity and values as best we can throughout history. Instead, we must find ways of addressing moral <a href=""https://meaningness.com/nebulosity"">nebulosity</a>, and thankfully we know that we can, because we have in fact been doing it all along, only we didn&#x2019;t realize it.</p><h3>The De of My Decisions</h3><p>I&#x2019;ll leave it to you, dear reader, to figure out how you want to live in our messy, complex world. But, so that I don&#x2019;t leave you with the <a href=""https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/12/29/polyamory-and-rules/"">null advice</a> of &#x201C;do what&#x2019;s right for you&#x201D;, I&#x2019;ll at least give you a picture of how I&#x2019;ve chosen to deal with the nebulosity of good and evil.</p><p>As preface, I&#x2019;m something of a native virtue ethicist. Throughout my life I&#x2019;ve had some vague sense of virtue and acted to fulfill it on the belief that it would lead me to living the sort of life I&#x2019;d like to live. This is probably due to my upbringing, where my parents simply taught us to be good people in the absence of any strong religion or formal moral philosophy. If put in terms of <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/27/book-review-albions-seed/"">Albion&#x2019;s Seed</a>, I grew up in the broader Quaker culture of America, even though none of my ancestors were specifically Quakers (that I know of).</p><p>This is probably why other moral stances didn&#x2019;t appeal to me. I grew up in Florida, surrounded by a mix of Cavalier and imported Puritan culture. Most people I knew during my school years took a deontological view informed by their religion. To me this way of thinking felt confining and unhelpful, even as it seemed to work for them, and I rejected being yoked by specific moral rules.</p><p>As an adult, between university and a whole host of <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/"">new friends</a> I connected with first online and then in person, I met a lot of consequentialists. My guess at the cultural origin of this, if I had to give one, lies in a combination of Jewish religious scholarship and adopted Enlightenment rationalism. The consequentialist approach felt better than deontology, but it also seemed too complicated to work out robust solutions to moral quandaries. I was never sure I had reasoned far enough since more than once I had to change my mind after realizing I had failed to make a full account of a moral question, and while rationalism and consequentialism reasonably demand that you be able to change your mind, I wanted less fragile answers to moral questions where a wrong determination was less likely to result in accidentally causing major harm. Cf. the historical examples of scientific racism, The Great Leap Forward, and most of the history of psychopathology.</p><p>So I stuck to my virtue, ill defined as it was, because it was both flexible and robust enough to work for me. I still wished I had a firmer grasp on what exact behaviors were virtuous, but having gotten by my whole life with only a rough idea of what it meant to be a good person I was at no risk of not being able to figure out what to do.</p><p>Then about a year ago, after a failed attempt to write a version of <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/act-into-fear-and-abandon-all-hope-81bcc114c5fd#.do8r3phps"">my key life advice</a> into a book, I fell into nihilism. Not so much because I failed at the book project, but because in trying to write it I was forced to confront the fundamental lack of meaning that exists external to us in the universe. This was not really a crisis: I knew I was going to come out the other side eventually because <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/in-defense-of-kegan-2ed7ab51b4c8#.vob40pedg"">developmental psychology</a> gave me a roadmap for where I was going, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure how I was going to get there. As it happens, it was around this time I finally got around to reading the Daoist classics.</p><p>You might say Daoist philosophy has two core parts: dao, or way, and de, or virtue. Dao tends to get a lot of focus and for good reason (besides being literally the name of the philosophy): it&#x2019;s about a way of perceiving reality as a holon and mirrors much of <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/fluid-decision-making-d8e4e41a51c0#.ur9k9vd62"">my own thinking</a> on <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/the-developmental-role-of-play-443549cfed3b#.ximlffrmx"">understanding the world</a>. In comparison de seems boring. It <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_%28Chinese%29"">translates to virtue in English</a> and also has a <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virtue"">parallel etymology</a>. There at first seems no new insights in de, and it can be read as a collection of stuff Daoists just so happen to think is good. But upon deeper exploration, de turns out to be as complex as dao, and extremely useful if you want to live in the world instead of just contemplate it.</p><p>Our first clue to this is that there is no list of virtues found in either <a href=""http://ctext.org/dao-de-jing"">Laozi</a> or <a href=""http://ctext.org/zhuangzi"">Zhaungzi</a>. Instead we get a lot of examples and templates of virtuous behavior from which we are asked to discover for ourselves the organizing principles of wuwei, usually translated as non-action, and ziran, which translates as both naturalness and spontaneity. These may seem at odds, but wuwei should not be taken to literally mean doing nothing, but instead to mean doing nothing which is not ziran. And ziran is not about giving in to impulse, but instead about acting in accord with dao, which is to say acting in a way that goes with the world instead of against it. It&#x2019;s not so different, then, from <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/do-the-best-thing/"">trying to do the best thing</a>, but from a perspective that more treats the world as so complex that discretion is the better part of valor and no action is often better than unwise action.</p><p>These ideas of wuwei and ziran, being imbued with centuries of use by folks who lived the sorts of lives I would like to live, gave me a scaffolding to build my way out of nihilism. They helped me <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/internalizing-existentialism-72831ef04735#.furafdj6t"">internalize</a> what I already knew and have argued above&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;that morality is not part of the territory but a particular map for understanding individual and collective value judgements. They were concepts I needed to continue constructing a <a href=""https://meaningness.com/meaningness"">complete stance</a> for myself. And they allowed me to understand that even if no behavior is forbidden by some hidden moral structure in the universe, there are still ways to figure out what is good.</p><p>So morality may be a mirage, but it&#x2019;s a useful mirage that helps us find life-giving meaning in what would otherwise be a desert of pure perception. I found de to be a helpful bridge towards <a href=""https://medium.com/@gworley3/holonic-integration-927ba21d774b#.1pv1ncw8d"">holonic integration</a>, but you might prefer Sharia law, act utilitarianism, or any number of moral or ethical ideas. Whatever your choice, in this way morality serves as an oasis that will sustain you on your journey to find meaning, especially when all meaning seems lost to the harsh winds of an uncaring world.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

H5N5Npyd5udCtRwph,2017: An Actual Plan to Actually Improve,2017-an-actual-plan-to-actually-improve,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H5N5Npyd5udCtRwph/2017-an-actual-plan-to-actually-improve,2017-01-27T18:42:39.599Z,26,21,10,False,False,,"<p>[<em>Epistemic status: mostly confident, but being this intentional is experimental]</em></p>
<p>This year, I'm focusing on two traits: resilience and conscientiousness. &nbsp;I think these (or the fact that I lack them) are my biggest barriers to success. &nbsp;Also: identifying them as goals for 2017 doesn't mean I'll stop developing them in 2018. &nbsp;A year is just a nice, established amount of time in which progress can actually be made. &nbsp;This plan is a more intentional version of techniques I've used to improve myself over the last few years. &nbsp;I have outside verification that I'm more responsible, high-functioning, and resilient than I was several years ago. &nbsp;I have managed to reduce my SSRI dose, and I have finished more important tasks this year than last year. &nbsp;</p>
<div>Inspiring blog posts and articles can only do so much for personal development. &nbsp;The most valuable writing in that genre tends to outline actual steps that (the author believes) generate positive results. &nbsp;Unfortunately, finding those steps is a fairly personal process. &nbsp;The song that gives me twenty minutes of motivation and the drug that helps me overcome anxiety might do the opposite for you. &nbsp;Even though I'm including detailed steps in this plan, you should keep that in mind. &nbsp;I hope that this post can give you a template for troubleshooting and discovering your own bottlenecks.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I. &nbsp;</div>
<p>First, I want to talk about my criteria for success. &nbsp;Without illustrating the end result, or figuring out how to measure it, I could finish out the year with a false belief that I'd made progress. &nbsp;If you plan something without success criteria, you run the same risk. I also believe that most of the criteria should be observable by a third party, i.e. hard to fake.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>I respond to disruptions in my plans with distress and anger. &nbsp;While I've gotten better at calming down, the distress still happens. I would like to have emotional control such that I observe first, and then feel my feelings. &nbsp;Disruptions should incite curiosity, and a calm evaluation of whether to correct course. &nbsp;The observable bit is whether or not my husband and friends report that I seem less upset when they disrupt me. &nbsp;This process is already taking place; I've been practicing this skill for a long time and I expect to continue seeing progress. &nbsp;(resilience)</li>
<li>If an important task takes very little time, doesn't require a lot of effort, and doesn't disrupt a more important process, I will do it immediately. The observable part is simple, here: are the dishes getting done? Did the trash go out on Wednesday? &nbsp;(conscientiousness)</li>
<li>I will do (2) without ""taking damage."" &nbsp;I will use visualization of the end result to make my initial discomfort less significant. &nbsp;(resilience)&nbsp;</li>
<li>I will use various things like audiobooks, music, and playfulness to make what can be made pleasant, pleasant. &nbsp;(resilience and conscientiousness)</li>
<li>My instinct when encountering hard problems will be to dissolve them into smaller pieces and identify the success criteria, immediately, before I start trying to generate solutions. I can verify that I'm doing this by doing hard problems in front of people, and occasionally asking them to describe my process as it appears. &nbsp;</li>
<li>I will focus on the satisfaction of doing hard things, and practice sitting in discomfort regularly (cold tolerance, calming myself around angry people, the pursuit of fitness, meditation). &nbsp;It's hard to identify an external sign that this is accomplished. &nbsp;I expect aversion-to-starting to become less common, and my spouse can probably identify that. &nbsp;(conscientiousness)</li>
<li>I will keep a daily journal of what I've accomplished, and carry a notebook to make reflective writing easy and convenient. &nbsp;This will help keep me honest about my past self. &nbsp;(conscientiousness)&nbsp;</li>
<li>By the end of the year, I will find myself and my close friends/family satisfied with my growth. &nbsp;I will have a record of finishing several important tasks, will be more physically fit than I am now, and will look forward to learning difficult things.</li>
</ol>
<div>One benefit of the some of these is that practice and success are the same. &nbsp;I can experience the satisfaction of any piece of my practice done well; it will count as being partly successful. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>II.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I've taken the last few years to identify these known bottlenecks and reinforcing actions. &nbsp;Doing one tends to make another easier, and neglecting them keeps harder things unattainable. &nbsp;These are the most important habits to establish early. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><ol>
<li>Meditation for 10 minutes a day directly improves my resilience and lowers my anxiety.</li>
<li>Medication shouldn't be skipped (an SSRI, DHEA, and methylphenidate). If I decide to go off of it, I should properly taper rather than quitting cold turkey. &nbsp;DHEA counteracts the negatives of my hormonal birth control and (seems to!) make me more positively aggressive and confident.</li>
<li>Fitness (in the form of dance, martial arts, and lifting) keeps my back from hurting, gives me satisfaction, and has a number of associated cognitive benefits. &nbsp;Dancing and martial arts also function as socialization, in a way that leads to group intimacy faster than most of my other hobbies. &nbsp;Being fit and attractive helps me maintain a high libido. &nbsp;</li>
<li>I need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep. &nbsp;I've tried getting around it. &nbsp;I can't. &nbsp;Getting enough sleep is a well-documented process, so I'm not going to outline my process here.</li>
<li>Water. &nbsp;Obviously.</li>
<li>Since overcoming most of my social anxiety, I've discovered that frequent, high-value socialization is critical to avoid depression. &nbsp;I try to regularly engage in activities that bootstrap intimacy, like the dressing room before performances, solving a hard problem with someone, and going to conventions. &nbsp;I need several days a week to include long conversations with people I like. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<div><em>Unknown </em>bottlenecks can be identified by identifying a negative result, and tracing the chain of events backwards until you find a common denominator. &nbsp;Sometimes, these can also be identified by people who interact with you a lot.</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>III. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>My personal ""toolkit"" is a list of things that give me temporary motivation or rapidly deescalate negative emotions. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><ol>
<li>Kratom (&lt;7g) does wonders for my anxieties about starting a task. &nbsp;I try not to take it too often, since I don't want to develop tolerance, but I like to keep some on hand for this.</li>
<li>Nicotine+caffeine/ltheanine capsules gives me an hour of motivation without jitters. &nbsp;This also has a rapid tolerance so I don't do it often.</li>
<li>A 30-second mindfulness meditation can usually calm my first emotional response to a distressing event.</li>
<li>Various posts on <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/"" target=""_blank"">mindingourway.com</a> can help reconnect me to my values when I'm feeling particularly demotivated. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Reorganizing furniture makes me feel less ""stuck"" when I get restless. &nbsp;Ditto for doing a difficult thing in a different place.</li>
<li>Google Calendar, a number of notebooks, and a whiteboard keep me from forgetting important tasks.</li>
<li>Josh Waitzkin's book, <em>The Art of Learning, </em>remotivates me to achieve mastery in various hobbies.</li>
<li>External prompting from other people can make me start a task I've been avoiding. Sometimes I have people aggressively yell at me.</li>
<li>The LW study hall (<a href=""https://complice.co/room/lesswrong"" target=""_blank"">Complice.co</a>) helps keep me focused. I also do ""pomos"" over video with other people who don't like Complice.</li>
</ol>
<div>IV.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This outline is the culmination of a few years of troubleshooting, getting feedback, and looking for invented narratives or dishonesty in my approach. &nbsp;Personal development doesn't happen quickly for me, and I expect it doesn't for most people. &nbsp;You should expect significant improvements to be a matter of years, not months, unless you're improving the basics like sleep or fitness. &nbsp;For those, you see massive initial gains that eventually level off. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>If you have any criticisms or see any red flags in my approach, let me know in the comments.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>use evidence and careful reasoning to work out how to best promote the <strong><em>wellbeing of all</em></strong>. To find the highest-impact charities this giving season ... We ... summed up the main recommendations by area below</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking below, we find a section on the problem area of criminal justice (US-focused). An area where the aim is outlined as follows: (quoting from the Open Philanthropy&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/criminal-justice-reform"">""problem area"" page</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>investing in criminal justice policy and practice reforms to substantially reduce incarceration while maintaining public safety.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reducing incarceration whilst maintaining public safety seems like a reasonable EA cause, if we interpret ""pubic safety"" in a broad sense - that is, keep fewer people in prison whilst still getting almost all of the benefits of incarceration such as deterrent effects, prevention of crime, etc.</p>
<p>So what are the recommended charities? (my emphasis below)</p>
<p>1. <a href=""https://www.allianceforsafetyandjustice.org"">Alliance for Safety and Justice</a>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""The Alliance for Safety and Justice is a US organization that aims to <strong>reduce incarceration and racial disparities in incarceration</strong> in states across the country, and replace mass incarceration with new safety priorities that prioritize prevention and protect low-income <strong>communities of color.</strong>"" &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They <a href=""https://www.allianceforsafetyandjustice.org/resources/"">promote</a> an article on their site called <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/black-wounds-matter"">""black wounds matter""</a>, as well as how you can ""Apply for VOCA Funding: A Toolkit for Organizations Working With Crime Survivors in <strong>Communities of Color</strong> and Other Underserved Communities""</p>
<p>2. <a href=""http://www.lahuelga.com/"">Cosecha</a>&nbsp;- (note that their url is www.lahuelga.com, which means ""the strike"" in Spanish) (my emphasis below)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""Cosecha is a group <strong>organizing undocumented immigrants </strong>in 50-60 cities around the country. Its goal is to<strong> build mass popular support for undocumented immigrants</strong>, <strong>in resistance to</strong> incarceration/detention, <strong>deportation</strong>, denigration of rights, and discrimination. The group has become especially active since the Presidential election, given the immediate threat of mass incarceration and deportation of millions of people.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cosecha have a <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;authuser=0&amp;q=cosecha+immigration"">footprint</a> in the news, for example&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.alternet.org/activism/immigrant-movement-prepares-boldly-go-offensive-against-trump"">this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have the ultimate goal of launching massive civil resistance and non-cooperation to show this country it depends on us ... &nbsp;if they wage a general strike of five to eight million workers for seven days, we think the economy of this country would not be able to sustain itself&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article quotes Carlos Saavedra, who is directly <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/suggestions-individual-donors-open-philanthropy-project-staff-2016#Criminal_Justice_Reform_-_recommendations_by_Chloe_Cockburn"">mentioned</a> by Open Philanthropy's&nbsp;Chloe Cockburn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carlos Saavedra, who leads Cosecha, stands out as an organizer who is devoted to testing and improving his methods, ... Cosecha can do a lot of good to prevent mass deportations and incarceration, I think his work is a good fit for likely readers of this post.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They mention other charities elsewhere on their site and in their writeup on the subject, such as the conservative <a href=""http://acufoundation.conservative.org/center-for-criminal-justice-reform/"">Center for Criminal Justice Reform</a>, but&nbsp;Cosecha&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Alliance for Safety and Justice&nbsp;are the ones that were chosen as ""highest impact"" and featured in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://80000hours.org/2016/12/the-effective-altruism-guide-to-donating-this-giving-season/"">guide to donating</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes one has to be blunt: 80,000 hours is promoting the financial support of some <em>extremely </em>hot-button&nbsp;political causes, which may not be a good idea. Traditionalists/conservatives and those who are uninitiated to Social Justice ideology might look at The Alliance for Safety and Justice and Cosecha and label them as them racists and criminals, and thereby be turned off by Effective Altruism, or even by the rationality movement as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/policy_tugowar.html"">standard arguments, for example this by Robin Hanson from 10 years ago</a>&nbsp;about why it is not smart or ""effective"" to get into these political tugs-of-war if one wants to make a genuine difference in the world.</p>
<p>One could also argue that the 80,000 hours' charities go beyond the usual folly of political tugs-of-war. In addition to supporting extremely political causes, 80,000 hours could be accused of being somewhat intellectually dishonest about what goal they are trying to further actually is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider The Alliance for Safety and Justice. 80,000 Hours state that the goal of their work in the criminal justice problem area is to ""substantially reduce incarceration while maintaining public safety"". This is an abstract goal that has very broad appeal and one that I am sure almost everyone agrees to. But then their more concrete policy in this area is to fund a charity that wants to ""reduce racial disparities in incarceration"" and ""protect low-income communities of color"". The latter is <em>significantly </em>different to the former - it isn't even close to being the same thing - and the difference is highly political. One could object that reducing racial disparities in incarceration is merely a<em> means to the end </em>of substantially reducing incarceration while maintaining public safety, since many people in prison in the US are ""of color"". However this line of argument is a very politicized one and it might be wrong, or at least I don't see strong support for it. ""Selectively release people of color and make society safer - endorsed by effective altruists!"" struggles against known facts about <a href=""http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/recidivism/2001/factors.html"">redictivism rates</a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/recidivism/2001/ccrace.gif"">across races</a>, as well as an objection about the implicit conflation of equality of outcome and equality of opportunity.&nbsp;(and I do not want this to be interpreted as a claim of moral superiority of one race over others - merely a necessary exercise in coming to terms with facts and debunking implicit assumptions). Males are incarcerated much more than women, so&nbsp;<a href=""http://soundbible.com/2083-Crickets-Chirping-At-Night.html"">what about reducing gender disparities in incarceration, whilst also maintaining public safety</a>? Again, this is all highly political, laden with politicized implicit assumptions and language. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cosecha is worse! They are actively planning potentially illegal activities like helping illegal immigrants evade the law (though <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL"">IANAL</a>), as well as activities which potentially harm the majority of US citizens such as a seven day nationwide strike whose intent is to damage the economy. Their URL is ""The Strike"" in Spanish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, the abstract goal is extremely attractive to almost anyone, but the concrete implementation is highly divisive. If some conservative altruist signed up to financially or morally support the abstract goal of ""substantially reducing incarceration while maintaining public safety"" and EA organisations that are pursuing that goal without reading the details, and then at a later point they saw the details of Cosecha and The Alliance for Safety and Justice, they would rightly feel cheated. And to the objection that conservative altruists should read the description rather than just the heading - what are we doing writing headings so misleading that you'd feel cheated if you relied on them as summaries of the activity they are mean to summarize?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One possibility would be for 80,000 hours to be much more upfront about what they are trying to achieve here - maybe they like left-wing social justice causes, and want to help like-minded people donate money to such causes and help the particular groups who are favored in those circles. There's almost a nod and a wink to this when Chloe Cockburn <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/suggestions-individual-donors-open-philanthropy-project-staff-2016#Criminal_Justice_Reform_-_recommendations_by_Chloe_Cockburn"">says</a>&nbsp;(my paraphrase of Saavedra, and emphasis, below)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think his [A man who wants to lead a general strike of five to eight million workers for seven days&nbsp;so that the economy of the USA would not be able to sustain itself, in order to help illegal immigrants] work is a good fit<strong> for likely readers of this post</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, they could try to reinvigorate the idea that their ""criminal justice"" problem area is politically neutral and beneficial to everyone; the Open Philanthropy&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/sites/default/files/Open%20Philanthropy%20Project%20-%20Criminal%20Justice%20Reform%20Nov%202014.pdf"">issue writeup</a> talks about ""conservative interest in what has traditionally been a solely liberal cause"" after all. I would advise considering dropping The Alliance for Safety and Justice and Cosecha if they intend to do this. There may not be politically neutral charities in this area, or there may not be enough high quality conservative charities to present a politically balanced set of recommendations. Setting up a growing donor advised fund or a prize for nonpartisan progress that genuinely intends to benefit <em>everyone </em>including conservatives, people opposed to illegal immigration and people who are not ""of color"" might be an option to consider.</p>
<p>We could examine 80,000 hours' choice to back these organisations from a more overall-utilitarian/overall-effectiveness point of view, rather than limiting the analysis to the specific problem area. These two charities don't pass the smell test for altruistic consequentialism, <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/policy_tugowar.html"">pulling sideways on ropes</a>, finding hidden levers that others are ignoring, etc. Is the best thing you can do with your smart EA money helping a charity that wants to get stuck into the culture war about which skin color is most over-represented in prisons? What about a second charity that wants to help people illegally immigrate at a time when immigration is the most divisive political topic in the western world?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cosecha's plans for a nationwide strike and potential <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/342752/trump-tower-immigration-activists-arrested/"">civil disobedience</a>/showdown with Trump &amp; co could push an already volatile situation in the US into something extremely ugly. The vast majority of people in the world (present and future) are not the specific group that Cosecha aims to help, but the set of people who could be harmed by the uglier versions of a violent and calamitous showdown in the US is basically the whole world. That means that even if P(Cosecha persuades Trump to do a U-turn on illegals) is 10 or 100 times greater than P(Cosecha precipitates a violent crisis in the USA), they may still be net-negative from an expected utility point of view. EA doesn't usually fund causes whose outcome distribution is heavily <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness"">left-skewed</a> so this argument is a bit unusual to have to make, but there it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is Cosecha a cause that is (a) mind-killing and culture war-ish (b) very tangentially related to the actual problem area it is advertised under by 80,000 hours, but it might also (c) be an anti-charity that produces net disutility (in expectation) in the form of a higher probability a US civil war with money that you donate to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back on the topic of criminal justice and incarceration: opposition to reform often comes from conservative voters and politicians, so it might seem unlikely to a careful thinker that extra money on the left-wing side is going to be highly effective. Some intellectual judo is required; make conservatives think that it was their idea all along. So&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/criminal-justice-reform/american-conservative-union-center-criminal-justice-reform"">promoting</a> the&nbsp;<a href=""http://acufoundation.conservative.org/center-for-criminal-justice-reform/"">Center for Criminal Justice Reform</a>&nbsp;sounds like the kind of smart, against-the-grain idea that might be highly effective! Well done, Open Philanthropy! Also in favor of this org: they don't copiously mention which races or person-categories they think are most important in their articles about criminal justice reform, the only culture war item I could find on them is the world ""conservative"" (and given the intellectual judo argument above, this counts as a plus), and they're not planning a national strike or other action with a heavy tail risk. But that's the one that <em>didn't make the cut</em> for the 80,000 hours guide to donating!</p>
<p>The fact that they let Cosecha (and to a lesser extent The Alliance for Safety and Justice) through reduces my confidence in 80,000 hours and the EA movement as a whole. Who thought it would be a good idea to get EA into the culture war with these causes, and also thought that they were plausibly among the most effective things you can do with money? Are they taking effectiveness seriously? What does the political diversity of meetings at 80,000 hours look like? Were there no conservative altruists present in discussions surrounding The Alliance for Safety and Justice and Cosecha, and the promotion of them as ""beneficial for everyone"" and ""effective""?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we finish, I want to emphasize that this post is not intended to start an object-level discussion about which race, gender, political movement or sexual orientation is cooler, and I would encourage moderators to temp-ban people who try to have that kind of argument in the comments of this post.</p>
<p>I also want to emphasize that criticism of professional altruists is a necessary evil; in an ideal world the only thing I would ever want to say to people who dedicate their lives to helping others (Chloe Cockburn in particular, since I mentioned her name above) &nbsp;is ""thank you, you're amazing"". Other than that, comments and criticism are welcome, especially anything pointing out any inaccuracies or misunderstandings in this post. Comments from anyone involved in 80,000 hours or Open Philanthropy are welcome.&nbsp;</p>",The_Jaded_One,the_jaded_one,The_Jaded_One,

tSSNqYZZPAFavBQjg,A majority coalition can lose a symmetric zero-sum game,a-majority-coalition-can-lose-a-symmetric-zero-sum-game,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tSSNqYZZPAFavBQjg/a-majority-coalition-can-lose-a-symmetric-zero-sum-game,2017-01-26T12:13:49.380Z,21,11,13,False,False,,"<p>Just a neat little result I found when thinking about Jessica's <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1224"">recent post</a>.</p>
<p>For n players, let a<sub>i</sub> be the action of player i and s<sub>i</sub>(a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,...a<sub>n</sub>) the reward of player i as a function of the actions of all players. Then the game is symmetric if for any permutation p:{1,...n}&rarr;{1,...n}</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">s<sub>i</sub>(a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,...a<sub>n</sub>) = s<sub>p(i)</sub>(a<sub>p(1)</sub>,a<sub>p(2)</sub>,...a<sub>p(n)</sub>)</p>
<p>The game is zero-sum if the sum of the s<sub>i</sub> is always zero. Assume players can confer before choosing their actions.</p>
<p>Then it is possible for a majority coalition to strictly lose a zero-sum game, even in a deterministic game where they get to see their opponents' moves before choosing their own.</p>
<p>This seems counter-intuitive. After all, if one coalition has M players, the other has m players, with m&lt;M, and there are no other players, how can the M players lose? Couldn't just m of the M players behave exactly as the smaller coalition, thus getting the same amount in expectation? The problem is the potential loses endured by the remaining M-m players.</p>
<p>For an example, consider the following 5 player colour game (it's a much simplified version of the game I came up with previously, <a href=""/lw/oj4/a_majority_coalition_can_lose_a_symmetric_zerosum/dlwc"">proposed</a> by <a href=""/user/cousin_it/overview/"">cousin_it</a>). Each player chooses one of two colour, blue or red. Then the players that selected the least commonly chosen colour(s) are the winners; the others are the losers. The losers pay 1 each, and this is split equally between the winners.</p>
<p>Then consider a coalition of three players, the triumvirate. The remaining two players - the duumvirate - choose different colours, red and blue. What can the triumvirate then do? If they all chose the same colour - say blue - then they all lose -1, and the duumvriate loses -1 (from its member that chose blue) and gains 4/1 (for the member that chose red). If they split - say 2 blue, 1 red - then the ones that chose blue lose -1, while the duumveriate loses -1 (from its member that chose blue) and gains 3/2 &gt; 1 (from the member that chose red).</p>
<p>So the duumvriate can always win against the triumvirate.</p>
<p>Of course, it's possible for two members of the triumvirate to create a second&nbsp;duumvirate that will profit from the hapless third member. Feel free to add whatever political metaphor you think this fits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Larger games</h2>
<p>Variations of this game can make&nbsp;<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1224"">Jessica's theorem 2</a>&nbsp;sharp. Let the minority coalition be of size m (the majority coalition is of size M = n-m = qm+r for some unique q and 0&le;r&lt;m). The actions are choosing from m colours; apart from that the game is the same as before. And, as before, the members of the minority coalition each choose a different colour.</p>
<p>Then an m-set is a collection of players that each chose a different colour. Split the players into as many disjoint m-sets as possible, with the minority coalition being one of them - say this gives q'+1 m-sets. There are r' remaining players from the majority coalition.</p>
<p>Note that we can consider that any loss from a member of an m-set is spread among the remaining members. That's because all winners are members of m-sets, and players that choose the same colour are interchangeable. So we can assign the loss from the member of an m-sets as being an equivalent gain to the other members. Thus the m-sets only profit from the r' remaining players. And this profit is spread equally among the winners - hence equally among the m-sets.</p>
<p>Thus the majority coalition has a loss of r'/(q'+1), and minimises its loss by minimising r' and maximising q' - hence by setting q'=q and r'=r. Under these circumstances, the minority coalition wins r/(q+1) in total.</p>
<p>Adding 1 to the reward of each player, then dividing all rewards by n, gives the unit-sum game in Jessica's theorem.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

Someone pointed out to me that the sequence destroys some people's current (guilt-based) motivation without successfully building up an alternative, making it a somewhat risky thing to try.</p>
<p>In light of that problem, I was thinking about what practices might help build up the kind of positive motivation that sequence is aiming at.</p>
<p>I was also listening to an audiobook on cognitive behavioral therapy. The book mentioned <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal"">gratitude journaling</a>, a practice which has proved surprisingly effective for boosting mood and getting longer and more refreshing sleep. The practice is simple: every week, write down five things which you were grateful for. (Once a week seems to be about right; writing more often is less effective.)</p>
<p>Gratitude journaling is the proven practice here, and if you want guaranteed results, you're better off trying it rather than the technique I'm going to describe here. But, we'd never have new techniques if someone didn't make them up!</p>
<p>I wanted to make a version of gratitude journaling which might be more suited to aspiring rationalists. I decided that it could be combined with the idea of <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/values-affirmation-is-powerful/"">value affirmation</a>. Value affirmation (surprisingly) shows positive effects a year later, after just 15 minutes spent writing about what you value in life. Might it be useful to write about what we value more often? Perhaps repeating the value-affirmation exercise exactly would get old fast (since values do not change that much from week to week), but if we tie our values to things which happened recently, we get something which looks a lot like gratitude journaling.</p>
<p>That's the basic idea -- write about what you valued over the past week. What follows are my elaborations based on several weeks of trying it out.</p>
<p><a id=""more""></a></p>
<h1>Details</h1>
<h2>Value Inventory</h2>
<p>Over the first week or so, it seemed useful to me to do the values journaling almost every day. I was still doing a lot of mapping out of what I value overall. (I suspect the right frequency of writing is ""however much you feel like"" -- reduced/eliminated effect size when doing gratitude journaling too often is likely tied to forcing it when you don't have much to say. But, that's just my speculation.)</p>
<p>I started a list of core values, which I kept adding to when I noticed new things, and re-organizing whet I noticed values that could be clustered together. There's a risk of only putting down values which you reflectively endorse -- IE, things your system 2 thinks you should value. This could (imho) squish your intrinsic motivation. Try and figure out what you really want; what really motivates you. I took inspiration from an Agenty Duck post, <a href=""http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-people-in-my-head-who-make-me-do.html"">The People In My Head Who Make Me Do Things</a>. What she did was write down all the things she did over the past week matching the description ""Doing What We Want Instead of What We're Supposed To Do"". She then clustered those into drives, which she gave names to and personified.</p>
<p>I think that's a great way of looking at it. Uncovering ""hidden"" motives like this can be helpful in debugging procrastination and other habits. So, over my first week, I paid a lot of attention to activities I ""shouldn't be doing"" and what underlying values I was satisfying with those activities. I also ended up borrowing her idea of giving names to my core values and writing the value journal like a ""weekly meeting"" in which those personified values come together and discuss the week.</p>
<p>Don't let this stop you from putting values you ""think you should have"" on the list, though. These are legitimate wants, too. In my case, I ended up putting these ""should"" values on the list, but later collapsing them into more intrinsic desires once I recognized where the want was coming from more clearly.</p>
<h2>The Role of Positive</h2>
<p>So, my journaling evolved into a kind of ""roll call"" in which I tried to write down something from the past week connecting with each core value which I had identified, breaking out into little discussions between these personified values when it seemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Mentioning something positive for each core value, and keeping the tone of the journal mostly positive, is important for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping the practice of value journaling associated with positive feelings makes it more sustainable. If every time you do value journaling you're beating yourself up over what you should have done, you'll come to develop an <a href=""/lw/21b/ugh_fields/"">ugh field</a> around it and stop.</li>
<li>Criticisms are not sensible without positive alternatives. You might criticize yourself by saying you shouldn't do this or that, but this is not actionable without stating what it is that you <em>would</em> like yourself to do instead.</li>
<li>This is about connecting with your values. Even if you have an alternative (you're criticizing yourself by saying you <em>should</em> do this or that), clearly stating <em>why</em> you would like yourself to do this will tend to be more motivating than berating yourself. And clearly stating your motivation, rather than just what you think you should be doing, will tend to open up possible alternative solutions.</li>
<li>If you're not doing what you think you should be doing, there is probably some <strong><em>reason</em></strong> for that. Some part of you is motivated to do the thing which ""you"" think you shouldn't do. It will be more productive to identify (and personify) that other value, and then have a discussion between your several values to see what can best satisfy all of them. Labeling one motivating value as ""bad"" does not enable that kind of introspection. Be charitable toward your own actions and find your positive reasons for doing them before you try to impose better alternative actions on yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Role of Negative</h2>
<p>Positivity is also good for a few other reasons. People like to be around happy people who say positive things. Maybe positivity also provides some safeguard against learned helplessness and stress. That being said, we also need the negative. Positive thinking alone can actually de-motivate you, as if some part of your motivation system is satisfied to sit back and visualize success. <em>Mental contrasting</em>, in which we visualize the positive outcome we want alongside the negative which we'd like to avoid, is more effective.<sup>1 </sup>Along similar lines, <a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/02/what-is-stoicism-and-how-can-it-turn-your-life-to-solid-gold/"">stoicism recommends negative visualization</a>&nbsp;as a way to come to appreciate the things you have.</p>
<p>So, along with my appreciation of the positive things which happened over the past week, I try to also note the negative which was avoided. This actually makes it even more similar to gratitude journaling. I also do some self-criticism, so long as I can link it to positive motives as I discussed in the previous section. The value journal acts as a kind of weekly review, so it's good to do some debugging in there! (Again, I find discussions between personified values to be helpful there. This can become quite similar to a CFAR technique called ""internal double crux"", but I don't think there's a nice blog post summary of that technique yet. The basic idea is to <a href=""/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">double crux</a> different parts of yourself which disagree.)</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It's at least interesting to create a map of your values by spending a little time doing this. It's also a potentially useful way of connecting to your intrinsic motivations. You can use this information in further self-debugging. For example, if you do this for several weeks, you can start to identify values which don't get much attention or don't connect with things in your life right now. These may give you focus in looking for ways to improve your life.</p>
<p>You can also start to identify the motives behind your actions in everyday life in terms of the core values you've identified. Since you've made sure to identify the core values as positive things you want, this can change your self-model from things like ""I'm being lazy"" to things like ""I'm making room for random exploration of the internet"" or ""I'm satisfying my need for self-direction, because everything else I did today was imposed by someone else"". Having the underlying goals brought to the surface in this way can help you change your behavior, by thinking about whether it's a good trade-off in a way that doesn't ignore your true desires. Or, it can make you OK with your existing behavior in a way you weren't before.</p>

A majority, including experts in the area such as Eliezer Yudkowsky and Wei Dai, seem to think that one should two-box (See e.g. <a href=""http://intelligence.org/files/TDT.pdf"">Yudkowsky 2010</a>, p.67). Others have tried to <a href=""/lw/e7e/whats_wrong_with_evidential_decision_theory/"">argue</a><a href=""/lw/j5j/chocolate_ice_cream_after_all/""> in favor</a> of EDT by claiming that the winning action would be to one-box, or by offering reasons why EDT would in some cases <a href=""/lw/3pf/does_evidential_decision_theory_really_fail/"">two-box</a> <a href=""http://www.mit.edu/~djr/24.118/Newcomb.html#section_tickledefence"">after all</a>. In this blog post, I want to argue that EDT gets it right: one-boxing <em>is</em> the correct action in medical Newcomb problems. I introduce a new thought experiment, the <em>Coin Flip Creation</em> problem, in which I believe the winning move is to one-box. This new problem is structurally similar to other medical Newcomb problems such as the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Smoking_lesion"">Smoking Lesion</a>, though it might elicit the intuition to one-box even in people who would two-box in some of the other problems. I discuss both how EDT and other decision theories would reason in the problem and why people’s intuitions might diverge in different formulations of medical Newcomb problems.</p>
<h2>Two kinds of Newcomblike problems</h2>
<p>There are two different kinds of Newcomblike problems. In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox"">Newcomb’s original paradox</a>, both EDT and <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/"">Logical Decision Theories</a> (LDT), such as <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Timeless_decision_theory"">Timeless Decision Theory</a> (TDT) would one-box and therefore, unlike <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/"">CDT</a>, win $1 million. In medical Newcomb problems, EDT’s and LDT’s decisions diverge. This is because in the latter, a (physical) causal node that isn’t itself a decision algorithm influences both the current world state and our decisions – resulting in a correlation between action and environment but, unlike the original Newcomb, no “logical” causation.</p>
<p>It’s often unclear exactly how a causal node can exert influence on our decisions. Does it change our decision theory, utility function, or the information available to us? In the case of the Smoking Lesion problem, it seems plausible that it’s our utility function that is being influenced. But then it seems that as soon as we observe our utility function (“notice a tickle”; see <a href=""https://books.google.de/books?id=4lKJDAAAQBAJ"">Eells 1982</a>), we lose “evidential power” (<a href=""https://casparoesterheld.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/almond_edt_1.pdf"">Almond 2010a</a>, p.39), i.e. there’s nothing new to learn about our health by acting a certain way if we already know our utility function. In any case, as long as we don’t know and therefore still have the evidential power, I believe we should use it.</p>
<p>The Coin Flip Creation Problem is an adaption of Caspar Oesterheld’s <a href=""/lw/men/twoboxing_smoking_and_chewing_gum_in_medical/"">“Two-Boxing Gene” problem</a> and, like the the latter, attempts to take Newcomb’s original problem and make it into a medical Newcomb problem, triggering the intuition that we should one-box. In Oesterheld’s Two-Boxing Gene, it’s stated that a certain gene correlates with our decision to one-box or two-box in Newcomb’s problem, and that Omega, instead of simulating our decision algorithm, just looks at this gene.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not specified how the correlation between two-boxing and the gene arises, casting doubt on whether it’s a medical Newcomb problem at all, and whether other decision algorithms would disagree with one-boxing. <a href=""/lw/men/twoboxing_smoking_and_chewing_gum_in_medical/cinh"">Wei Dai argues</a> that in the Two-Boxing Gene, if Omega conducts a study to find out which genes correlate with which decision algorithm, then <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Updateless_decision_theory"">Updateless Decision Theory</a> (UDT) could just commit to one-boxing and thereby determine that all the genes UDT agents have will always correlate with one-boxing. So in some sense, UDT’s genes will still indirectly constitute a “simulation” of UDT’s algorithm, and there is a logical influence between the decision to one-box and Omega’s decision to put $1 million in box A. Similar considerations could apply for other LDTs.</p>
<p>The Coin Flip Creation problem is intended as an example of a problem in which EDT would give the right answer, but all causal and logical decision theories would fail. It works explicitly through a causal influence on the decision theory itself, thus reducing ambivalence about the origin of the correlation.</p>
<h2>The Coin Flip Creation problem</h2>
<p><em>One day, while pondering the merits and demerits of different acausal decision theories, you’re visited by Omega, a being assumed to possess flawless powers of prediction and absolute trustworthiness. You’re presented with Newcomb’s paradox, but with one additional caveat: Omega informs you that you weren’t born like a normal human being, but were instead created by Omega. On the day you were born, Omega flipped a coin: If it came up heads, Omega created you in such a way that you would one-box when presented with the Coin Flip Creation problem, and it put $1 million in box A. If the coin came up tails, you were created such that you’d two-box, and Omega didn’t put any money in box A. We don’t know how Omega made sure what your decision would be. For all we know, it may have inserted either CDT or EDT into your source code, or even just added one hard-coded decision rule on top of your messy human brain. Do you choose both boxes, or only box A?</em></p>
<p>It seems like EDT gets it right: one-boxing is the winning action here. There’s a correlation between our decision to one-box, the coin flip, and Omega’s decision to put money in box A. Conditional on us one-boxing, the probability that there is money in box A increases, and we “receive the good news” – that is, we discover that the coin must have come up heads, and we thus get the million dollars. In fact, we can be absolutely certain of the better outcome if we one-box. However, the problem persists if the correlation between our actions and the content of box A isn’t perfect. As long as the correlation is high enough, it is better to one-box.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, neither causal nor <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01986.pdf"">logical counterfactuals</a> seem to imply that we can determine whether there is money in box A. The coin flip isn’t a decision algorithm itself, so we can’t determine its outcome. The logical uncertainty about our own decision output doesn’t seem to coincide with the empirical uncertainty about the outcome of the coin flip. In absence of a causal or logical link between their decision and the content of box A, CDT and TDT would two-box.</p>
<h2>Updateless Decision Theory</h2>
<p>As far as I understand, UDT would come to a similar conclusion. AlephNeil writes <a href=""/lw/294/what_is_wei_dais_updateless_decision_theory/"">in a post about UDT</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Smoking Lesion problem, the presence of a 'lesion' is somehow supposed to cause Player's to choose to smoke (without altering their utility function), which can only mean that in some sense the Player's source code is 'partially written' before the Player can exercise any control over it. However, UDT wants to 'wipe the slate clean' and delete whatever half-written nonsense is there before deciding what code to write.</p>
<p>Ultimately this means that when UDT encounters the Smoking Lesion, it simply throws away the supposed correlation between the lesion and the decision and acts as though that were never a part of the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach seems wrong to me. If we use an algorithm that changes our own source code, then this change, too, has been physically determined and can therefore correlate with events that aren’t copies of our own decision algorithm. If UDT reasons as though it could just rewrite its own source code and discard the correlation with the coin flip altogether, then UDT two-boxes and thus by definition ends up in the world where there is no money in box A.</p>
<p>Note that updatelessness seemingly makes no difference in this problem, since it involves no a priori decision: Before the coin flip, there’s a 50% chance of becoming either a one-boxing or a two-boxing agent. In any case, we can’t do anything about the coin flip, and therefore also can’t influence whether box A contains any money.</p>
<p>I am uncertain how UDT works, though, and would be curious about others people’s thoughts. Maybe UDT reasons that by one-boxing, it becomes a decision theory of the sort that would never be installed into an agent in a tails world, thus rendering impossible all hypothetical tails worlds with UDT agents in them. But if so, why wouldn’t UDT “one-box” in the Smoking Lesion? As far as the thought experiments are specified, the causal connection between coin flip and two-boxing in the Coin Flip Creation appears to be no different from the connection between gene and smoking in the Smoking Lesion.</p>
<p>More adaptations and different formalizations of LDTs exist, e.g. <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=4"">Proof-Based Decision Theory</a>. I could very well imagine that some of those might one-box in the thought experiment I presented. If so, then I’m once again curious as to where the benefits of such decision theories lie in comparison to plain EDT (aside from updatelessness – see Concluding thoughts).</p>
<h2>Coin Flip Creation, Version 2</h2>
<p>Let’s assume UDT would two-box in the Coin Flip Creation. We could alter our thought experiment a bit so that UDT would probably one-box after all:</p>
<p><em>The situation is identical to the Coin Flip Creation, with one key difference: After Omega flips the coin and creates you with the altered decision algorithm, it actually simulates your decision, just as in Newcomb’s original paradox. Only after Omega has determined your decision via simulation does it decide whether to put money in box A, conditional on your decision. Do you choose both boxes, or only box A?</em></p>
<p>Here is a causal graph for the first and second version of the Coin Flip Creation problem. In the first version, a coin flip determines whether there is money in box A. In the second one, a simulation of your decision algorithm decides:</p>
<p><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_oih_1.png?v=87df218dc2023c815e0eb087eb1fd07e"" /></p>
<p>Since in Version 2, there’s a simulation involved, UDT would probably one-box. I find this to be a curious conclusion. The situation remains exactly the same – we can rule out any changes in the correlation between our decision and our payoff. It seems confusing to me, then, that the optimal decision should be a different one.</p>
<h2>Copy-altruism and multi-worlds</h2>
<p>The Coin Flip Creation problem assumes a single world and an egoistic agent. In the following, I want to include a short discussion of how the Coin Flip Creation would play out in a multi-world environment.</p>
<p>Suppose Omega’s coin is based on a quantum number generator and produces 50% heads worlds and 50% tails worlds. If we’re copy-egoists, EDT still recommends to one-box, since doing so would reveal to us that we’re in one of the branches in which the coin came up heads. If we’re copy-altruists, then in practice, we’d probably care a bit less about copies whose decision algorithms have been tampered with, since they would make less effective use of the resources they gain than we ourselves would (i.e. their decision algorithm sometimes behaves differently). But in theory, if we care about all the copies equally, we should be indifferent with respect to one-boxing or two-boxing, since there will always be 50% of us in either of the worlds no matter what we do. The two groups always take the opposite action. The only thing we can change is whether our own copy belongs to the tails or the heads group.</p>
<p>To summarize, UDT and EDT would both be indifferent in the altruistic multi-world case, but UDT would (presumably) two-box, and EDT would one-box, in both the copy-egoistic multi-worlds and in the single-world case.</p>
<h2>“But I don’t have a choice”</h2>
<p>There seems to be an especially strong intuition of “absence of free will” inherent to the Coin Flip Creation problem. When presented with the problem, many respond that if someone had created their source code, they didn’t have any choice to begin with. But that’s the exact situation in which we all find ourselves at all times! Our decision architecture and choices are determined by physics, just like a hypothetical AI’s source code, and all of our choices will thus be determined by our “creator.” When we’re confronted with the two boxes, we know that our decisions are predetermined, just like every word of this blogpost has been predetermined. But that knowledge alone won’t help us make any decision. As far as I’m aware, even an agent with complete knowledge of its own source code would have to treat its own decision outputs as uncertain, or it would fail to implement a decision algorithm that takes counterfactuals into account.</p>
<p>Note that our decision in the Coin Flip Creation is also no less determined than in Newcomb’s paradox. In both cases, the prediction has been made, and physics will guide our thoughts and our decision in a deterministic and predictable manner. Nevertheless, we can still assume that we have a choice until we make our decision, at which point we merely “find out” what has been our destiny all along.</p>
<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>I hope that the Coin Flip Creation motivates some people to reconsider EDT’s answers in Newcomblike problems. A thought experiment somewhat similar to the Coin Flip Creation can be found in <a href=""http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/4/665"">Arif Ahmed 2014</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the particular setup of the Coin Flip Creation means it isn’t directly relevant to the question of which decision theory we should program into an AI. We obviously wouldn’t flip a coin before creating an AI. Also, the situation doesn’t really look like a decision problem from the outside; an impartial observer would just see Omega forcing you to pick either A or B. Still, the example demonstrates that from the inside view, evidence from the actions we take can help us achieve our goals better. Why shouldn’t we use this information? And if evidential knowledge can help us, why shouldn’t we allow a future AI to take it into account? In any case, I’m not overly confident in my analysis and would be glad to have any mistakes pointed out to me.</p>
<p>Medical Newcomb is also not the only class of problems that challenge EDT. <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=32"">Evidential blackmail</a> is an example of a different problem, wherein giving the agent access to specific compromising information is used to extract money from EDT agents. The problem attacks EDT from a different angle, though: namely by exploiting it’s <a href=""https://casparoesterheld.com/2016/11/21/thoughts-on-updatelessnes/"">lack of updatelessness</a>, similar to the challenges in Transparent Newcomb, Parfit’s Hitchhiker, Counterfactual Mugging, and the Absent-Minded Driver. I plan to address questions related to updatelessness, e.g. whether it makes sense to give in to evidential blackmail if you already have access to the information and haven’t precommitted not to give in, at a later point.</p>

Yq4Zb39LqKvgBxGER,Strategic Thinking: Paradigm Selection,strategic-thinking-paradigm-selection,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Yq4Zb39LqKvgBxGER/strategic-thinking-paradigm-selection,2017-01-24T06:24:42.727Z,15,9,16,False,False,,"<p>Perhaps the most important concept in strategy is the importance of operating within the right paradigm. It is extremely important to orient towards the right style or the right doctrine before you begin implementing your plan - that could be ""no known doctrine, we'll have to improvise"", but if it is <em>you need to know that!</em>&nbsp;If you choose the wrong basic procedure or style, you will end up refining a plan or method that ultimately can't get you to where you want to, and you will likely find it difficult to escape.</p>
<p>This is one of the Big Deep Concepts that seem to crop up all over the place. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In software development, one form of this error is known as ""premature optimization,"" where you focus on optimizing existing processes before you consider whether those processes are really what the final version of your system needs. If those processes end up getting cut, you've wasted a bunch of time; if you end up avoiding ""wasting work"" by keeping these processes, the sunk cost fallacy may have blocked you from implementing superior architecture.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the military, a common mistake of this type leads to ""fighting the last war"" - the tendency of military planners and weapons designers to create strategies and weapon systems that would be optimal for fighting a repeat of the previous big war, only to find that paradigm shifts have rendered these methods obsolete. For instance, many tanks used early in World War II had been designed based on the trench warfare conditions of World War I and proved extremely ineffective in the more mobile style of warfare that actually developed.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In competitive gaming, this explains what <a href=""http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub"">David Sirlin calls ""scrubs""</a> - players who play by their own made-up rules rather than the true ones, and thus find themselves unprepared to play against people without the same constraints. It isn't that the scrub is a fundamentally bad or incompetent player - it's just that they've chosen the wrong paradigm, one that greatly limits their ability when they come into contact with the real world.</li>
</ul>
<p>This same limitation is present in almost every field that I have seen, and considering it is critical. Before you begin investing heavily in a project, you should ask yourself whether this is really the right paradigm to accomplish your goals. Overinvesting in the wrong paradigm has a doubly pernicious effect - not only are your immediate efforts not as effective as they could be, but it also renders you especially vulnerable to the sunk cost fallacy. Keep in mind that even those who are aware of the sunk cost fallacy are not immune to it!</p>
<p>Therefore, when making big decisions, don't just jump into the first paradigm that presents itself, or even the one that seems to make the most sense on initial reflection. Instead, realy truly consider whether this approach is the best one to get you what you want. Look at the goal that you're aiming for, and consider whether there are other ways to achieve it that might be more effective, less expensive, or both.</p>
<p>Here are some sample situations that can be considered paradigm-selection problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you really need to go and get a CS degree in order to become a computer programmer, or will a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_bootcamp"">bootcamp</a> get you started faster and cheaper?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Does your organization's restructuring plan really hit the core problems, or is it merely addressing the most obvious surface-level issues?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Will aircraft carrier-centric naval tactics be effective in a future large-scale conventional war, or is the aircraft carrier the modern equivalent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleships_in_World_War_II"">the battleship in WW2?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I don't necessarily know the answers to all these questions - note that only one is even framed as a clear choice between two options, and there are obviously other options available even in that case - but I do know that they're questions worth asking! When it comes time to make big decisions, evaluating what paradigms are available and whether the one you've chosen is the right one for the job can be critical.</p>",katydee,katydee,katydee,

Kc3fnEcipAY46xFvA,Evaluating Moral Theories,evaluating-moral-theories,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kc3fnEcipAY46xFvA/evaluating-moral-theories,2017-01-23T05:04:07.146Z,5,4,40,False,False,,"<p>I would like to use my first post to expand on a framework I introduced in the Welcome thread for evaluating moral theories, and to request your feedback.</p>
<p>This thesis rests on the fact that a moral theory is a tool for helping us make choices. Starting from this premise, I believe that a moral theory needs to meet three criteria for it to be acceptable:</p>
<p>a) Its comprising principles must be non-contradictory. I think this is pretty self evident: if a theory consists of a number of principles that contradict each other, there will be situations where the theory will suggest contradictory actions - hence failing its purpose as a tool to enable choice making.</p>
<p>b) Its comprising principles must be non-arbitrary as far as possible. What I mean by this is that the principles must be derived logically from facts on which everyone agrees. Otherwise, if a moral theory rests on an arbitrary and subjective principle, the theory's advocates will never be able to convince people who do not share that principle of their theory's validity.</p>
<p>c) If the principles of the moral theory are taken to their logical conclusion, they must not lead to a society that <em>the theory's proponents themselves</em>&nbsp;would consider dystopian.</p>
<p>Note that my premise (i.e. that a moral theory is supposed to help us make choices) necessitates that the theory is not vague. So saying that a utilitarian system, using some magical measurement of utility, is a good moral theory is pointless in my view.</p>
<p>However, I want to draw a distinction between morality at the social level and morality at the personal level. The former refers to a moral system whose proponents believe should apply to the whole world; the latter, to the principles by which people live their private lives. The three criteria I listed should only be used to evaluate morality at the social level: if you want to impose your principles over every single human, you'd better make sure they are non-contradictory, acceptable by everyone and won't mess up the world.</p>
<p>Morality at the personal level is different: if you are using your principles to determine <em>your</em>&nbsp;actions only, it's fine if these principles are arbitrary. If lying makes you feel uncomfortable, I think it's fair enough for you to value honesty as a principle, even if you cannot provide a very rational justification.</p>
<p>Finally, one final comment: I believe there are some moral issues which cause disagreement because of the fundamental inability of our language to define certain concepts. For instance, the whole debate on abortion comes down to the definition of life - and since we lack one, I don't think we can ever rationally settle that debate.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Now I also have a question for whomever is reading this: the only theory I can think of that meets all three criteria is libertarianism:</p>
<p>a) It only has one principle - do not do anything that infringes on other people's liberty - so it's inherently consistent.</p>
<p>b) The fact on which everyone <em>has</em>&nbsp;to agree: we have no proof of some sort of moral authority, hence any moral command is arbitrary. In the absence of such moral authority, no-one has the right to impose their own morality on others.</p>
<p>c) Though libertarianism may lead to meanness - e.g. inability to condemn people for lack of kindness or charity - it's not dystopian by my view.</p>
<p>My question is - are there other theories that would meet all three criteria? (I think total anarchy, including the lack of condemnation of violence, could meet the first two criteria, but I think few would argue it meets the third one).</p>",ArisC,arisc,ArisC,

</style></head><body><p>I'm going to formalize some ideas related to <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1149"">my previous post about pursuing convergent instrumental goals without good priors</a> and prove theorems about how much power a coalition can guarantee.  The upshot is that, while non-majority coalitions can't guarantee controlling a non-negligible fraction of the expected power, majority coalitions can guarantee controlling a large fraction of the expected power.</p>

<h2>Spying</h2>
<p>One issue with the formalism is that it seems easier for a small coalition to spy on a large one than for a large coalition to spy on a small one, which makes it implausible that a large coalition can have a shared source of randomness not available to small coalitions.</p>
<p>However, note that the policy defined in Theorem 2 does not rely on the majority coalition having more coordination than the opposing coalition.  This is because the policy factors <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c_1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> into <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""k-1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">k</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> independent subcoalitions whose sizes are <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""|c_2|""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">|</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">|</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, so shared sources of randomness are only needed within subcoalitions of size <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""|c_2|""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">|</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">|</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> (and this shared randomness is equivalent to the shared randomness within <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c_2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> itself).</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Theorem 2 is good news if we expect a large majority of powerful AI systems to be aligned with human values.  It means that (under some assumptions) these AI systems can achieve a large expected fraction of the universe without having good priors about the random variable <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>To do this, it is necessary to know something about what the other coalitions' strategies are, such that these strategies can be copied.  A major problem with this is that, in the real world, the action one should take to gain resources depends on relative facts (e.g. one's location), whereas the actions <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{A}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.021em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> are not context-dependent in this way.  Therefore, the actions <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{A}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em; padding-right: 0.021em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> should be interpreted as ""ways of turning one's context into a resource-gathering strategy"".  It is not obvious how to interpret another agent's policy as a ""way of turning their context into a resource-gathering strategy"" such that it can be copied, and this seems like a useful topic for further thought.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span> </span>My brain does this thing where it shuts off when I experience some warning signs. &nbsp;A lot of these have to do with my identity or personal beliefs, which go off when I believe my tribe is being attacked. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll go as far as to say that <em>all</em> brain shutoffs are bad (which feels like a Cleaving Statement), but there&rsquo;s another type of warning sign I&rsquo;ve recently noticed: Dismissing The Obvious.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just because a statement is tautological or obvious <em>does not</em> mean it is useless.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some examples:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you want to get all of your tasks done everyday, be sure to make a to-do list and a schedule! &nbsp;That way, you can keep track of what you&rsquo;ve done/need to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>My brain&rsquo;s response:</strong> &lt;doesn&rsquo;t even quite register the points&gt; &ldquo;Whatever, this doesn&rsquo;t sound interesting.&rdquo; &lt;pattern-matches it as &ldquo;boring advice stuff"" that ""isn't groundbreaking&rdquo;&gt;.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>In actuality: </strong>The advice still stands, even if it&rsquo;s self-evident and obvious. &nbsp;People who make to-do lists have a better idea of what they need to get done. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s still useful to know, if you care about getting stuff done!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you want to exercise more, you should probably exercise more. &nbsp;Then, you&rsquo;d become the type of person who exercises more, and then you&rsquo;d exercise more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>OR</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you have more energy, then you&rsquo;re more energetic, which means you have more energy to do things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>My brain&rsquo;s response: </strong>&ldquo;Those conclusions follow each other, <em>by definition</em>! &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing here that I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; &lt;scoffs&gt;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>In actuality: </strong>Just because two things are logically equivalent doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s nothing to learn. &nbsp;In my head, the nodes for &ldquo;energetic&rdquo; and &ldquo;energy = increased doing-stuff capacity&rdquo; are not the same nodes. &nbsp;Consequently, bringing the two together can still link previously unconnected ideas, or allow you to see the connection, which is still beneficial!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What my brain is doing here is tuning out information simply because &ldquo;it sounds like the kind of obvious information that everyone knows&rdquo;. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not actually considering the point. &nbsp;More than that, obvious tips tend to be effective for a large group of people. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re obvious or commonly seen. &nbsp;The fact that I see some advice show up in lots of places should even perhaps be <em>increased</em> reason for me to try it out. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related problem is when smart, experienced people give me advice that my brain pattern-matches to &ldquo;boring advice&rdquo;. &nbsp;When their advice sounds so &ldquo;mundane&rdquo;, it can be easy to forget that the &ldquo;boring advice&rdquo; is what their brain thought was the best thing to give me. &nbsp;They tried to distill all of their wisdom into a simple adage, I should probably at least try it out.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I suspect that my brain&rsquo;s aversion to Obvious/Boring Advice may be because I&rsquo;ve become <em>acclimated</em> to normal self-improvement ideas. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m stuck on the hedonic treadmill of insight porn, or as someone put it, I&rsquo;m a rationality junkie.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overwhelmed by the sort of ideas found in <a href=""https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2016/10/28/insight-porn/"">insight porn</a>, it looks like I actually crave more and more obscure forms of insight. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s this type of dangerous conditioning that I think causes people to dismiss normal helpful ideas&mdash; simply because they&rsquo;re not paradigm-crushing, mind-blowing, or <em>stimulating</em> enough.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in an effort to fight back, I&rsquo;m trying to get myself hooked on the <a href=""/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/"">meta-contrarian</a> idea that, despite my addiction to obscure ideas, the Obvious is still usually what has the most-leverage. &nbsp;Often, the best thing to do is merely the obvious one. &nbsp;Some things in life <em>are</em> simple.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take that, hedonic treadmill.</p>

<p>(It's probably not quite as juicy of an example as yesterday's, but it is one that I'm equipped to write about today so I figure it's worth it.)</p>
<p>This example is somewhat more widely known and a bit more elementary. I won't be surprised if most people already know the 'solution'. But the point of writing about it is not to explain the math - it's to talk about ""how you should feel"" about the problem, and how to rationally approach rectifying it with your existing mental model. If you already know the solution, try to pretend or think back to when you didn't. I think it was initially surprising to most people, whenever you learned it.</p>
<p>The claim: that 1 = 0.999... repeating (infinite 9s). (I haven't found an easy way to put a bar over the last 9, so I'm using ellipses throughout.)</p>
<p>The questionable proof:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">x = 0.9999...<br />10x = 9.9999... (everyone knows multiplying by ten moves the decimal over one place)<br />10x-x = 9.9999... - 0.9999....<br />9x = 9<br />x = 1</p>
<p>People's response when they first see this is usually: wait, what? an infinite series of 9s equals 1? no way, they're obviously different.</p>
<p>The litmus test is this: what do you think a rational person should do when confronted with this argument? How do you approach it? Should you accept the seemingly plausible argument, or reject it (as with yesterday's example) as ""no way, it's more likely that we're somehow talking about different objects and it's hidden inside the notation""?</p>
<p>Or are there other ways you can proceed to get more information on your own?</p>
<hr />
<p>One of the things I want to highlight here is related to the nature of mathematics.</p>
<p>I think people have a tendency to think that, if they are not well-trained students of mathematics (at least at the collegiate level), then <em>rigor</em>&nbsp;or <em>precision</em>&nbsp;involving numbers is out of their reach. I think this is <em>definitely not the case</em>: you should not be afraid to attempt to be precise with numbers even if you only know high school algebra, and you should especially not be afraid to demand precision, even if you don't know the correct way to implement it.</p>
<p>Particularly, I'd like to emphasize that mathematics as a <em>mental discipline </em>(as opposed to an academic field), basically consists of ""the art of making correct statements about patterns in the world"" (where numbers are one of the patterns that appears everywhere you have things you can count, but there are others). This sounds suspiciously similar to rationality - which, as a practice, might be ""about winning"", but as a mental art is ""about being right, and not being wrong, to the best of your ability"". More or less. So mathematical thinking and rational thinking are very similar, except that we categorize rationality as being primarily about decisions and real-world things, and mathematics as being primarily about abstract structures and numbers.</p>
<p>In many cases in math, you start with a structure that you don't understand, or even know how to understand, precisely, and start trying to 'tease' precise results out of it. As a layperson you might have the same approach to arguments and statements about elementary numbers and algebraic manipulations, like in the proof above, and you're just as in the right to <em>attempt to find precision</em>&nbsp;in them as a professional mathematician is when they perform the same process on their highly esoteric specialty. You also have the bonus that you can go look for the right answer to see how you did, afterwards.</p>
<p>All this to say, I think any rational person should be willing to 'go under the hood' one or two levels when they see a proof like this. It doesn't have to be rigorous. You just need to do some poking around if you see something surprising to your intuition. Insights are readily available if you look, and you'll be a stronger rational thinker if you do.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are a few angles that I think a rational but untrained-in-math person can think to take straightaway.</p>
<p>You're shown that 0.9999.. = 1. If this is a surprise, that means your model of what these terms mean doesn't jive with how they behave in relation to each other, or that the proof was fallacious.<strong>&nbsp;You can immediately conclude that it's either</strong>:</p>
<p>a) <strong>true without qualification</strong>, in which case your mental model of what the symbols ""0.999..."", ""="", or ""1"" mean is suspect<br />b) <strong>true </strong><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">in a sense</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>but it's&nbsp;hidden behind a deceptive argument (like in yesterday's post), and even if the sense is more technical and possibly beyond your intuition, it should be possible to verify if it exists -- either through careful inspection or turning to a more expert source or just verifying that options (a) and (c) don't work<br />c) <strong>false</strong>, in which case there should be a logical inconsistency in the proof, though it's not necessarily true that you're equipped to find it</p>
<p><strong>Moreover, (a) is probably the default, by Occam's Razor</strong>. It's more likely that a seemingly correct argument is correct than that there is a more complicated explanation, such as (b), ""there are mysterious forces at work here"", or (c), ""this correct-seeming argument is actually wrong"", without other reasons to disbelieve it. The only evidence against it is basically that it's surprising. But how do you test (a)?</p>
<p>Note there are plenty of other 'math paradoxes' that fall under (c) instead: for example, those ones that secretly divide by 0 and derive nonsense afterwards. (a=b ; a^2=ab ; a^2-b^2=ab-b^2 ; (a+b)(a-b)=b(a-b) ; a+b=b ; 2a = a ; 2=1). But the difference is that their conclusions are <em>obviously</em>&nbsp;false, whereas this one is only <em>surprising</em>&nbsp;and counterintuitive. 1=2 involves two concepts we know very well. 0.999...=1 involves one we know well, but one that likely has a feeling of sketchiness about it; we're not used to having to think carefully about what a construction like 0.999... means, and we should immediately realize that when doubting the conclusion.</p>
<p>Here are a few angles you can take to testing (a):</p>
<p><strong>1. The ""make it more precise"" approach</strong>: Drill down into what you mean by each symbol. In particular, it seems very likely that the mystery is hiding inside what ""0.999..."" means, because that's the one that it's seems complicated and liable to be misunderstood.</p>
<p>What does 0.999... infinitely repeating actually mean? It seems like it's ""the limit of the series of finite numbers of 9s"", if you know what a limit is. It seems like it might be ""the number larger than every number of the form 0.abcd..., consisting of infinitely many digits (optionally, all 0 after a point)"". That's awfully similar to 1, also, though.</p>
<p>A very good question is ""what kinds of objects are these, anyway?"" The rules of arithmetic generally assume we're working with real numbers, and the proof seems to hold for those in our customary ruleset. So what's the 'true' definition of a real number?</p>
<p>Well, we can look it up, and find that it's fairly complicated and involves identifying reals with sets of rationals in one or another specific way. If you can parse the definitions, you'll find that one definition is ""a real number is a Dedekind cut of the rational numbers"", that is, ""a partition of the rational numbers into two sets A and B such that A is nonempty and closed downwards, B is nonempty and closed upwards, and A contains no greatest element"", and from that it Can Be Seen (tm) that the two symbols ""1"" and ""0.999..."" both refer to the <em>same</em>&nbsp;partition of Q, and therefore are equivalent as real numbers.</p>
<p><strong>2. The ""functional"" approach</strong>: if 0.999...=1, then it should behave the same as 1 in all circumstances. Is that something we can verify? Does it survive obvious tests, like other arguments of the same form?</p>
<p>Does 0.999.. always act the same was that 1 does? It appears to act the same in the algebraic manipulations that we saw, of course. What are some other things to try?<br />We might think to try: 1-0.9999... = 1-1 = 0, but also seems to equal 0.000....0001, if that's valid: an 'infinite decimal that ends in a 1'. So those must be equivalent also, if that's a valid concept. We can't find anything to multiply 0.000...0001 by to 'move the decimal' all the way into the finite decimal positions, seemingly, because we would have to multiply by infinity and that wouldn't prove anything because we already know such operations are suspect.<br />I, at least, cannot see any reason when doing math that the two <em>shouldn't</em>&nbsp;be the same. It's not proof, but it's evidence that the conclusion is probably OK.</p>
<p><strong>3. The ""argument from contradiction"" approach:</strong> what would be true if the claim were false?</p>
<p>If 0.999... isn't equal to 1, what does that entail? Well, let a=0.999... and b=1. We can, according to our familiar rules of algebra, construct the number halfway between them: (a+b)/2, alternatively written as a+(b-a)/2. But our intuition for decimals doesn't seem to let there be a number between the two. What would it be -- 0.999...9995? ""capping"" the decimal with a 5? (yes, we capped a decimal with a 1 earlier, but we didn't know if that was valid either). What does that mean imply 0.999 - 0.999...9995 should be? 0.000...0004? Does that equal 4*0.000...0001? None of this math seems to be working either.<br />As long as we're not being rigorous, this isn't ""proof"", but it is a compelling reason to think the conclusion might be right after all. If it's not, we get into things that seem considerably more insane.</p>
<p><strong>4. The ""reexamine your surprise"" approach</strong>: how bad is it if this is true? Does that cause me to doubt other beliefs? Or is it actually just as easy to believe it's true as not? Perhaps I am just biased against the conclusion for aesthetic reasons?</p>
<p>How bad is it if 0.999...=1? Well, it's not like yesterday's example with 1+2+3+4+5... = -1/12. It doesn't <em>utterly defy</em>&nbsp;our intuition for what arithmetic is.&nbsp;It says that one object we never use is equivalent to another object we're familiar with. I think that, since we probably have no reason to strongly believe anything about what an infinite sum of 9/10 + 9/100 + 9/1000 + ... should equal, it's perfectly palatable that it might equal 1, despite our initial reservations.</p>
<p>(I'm sure there are other approaches too, but this got long with just four so I stopped looking. In real life,&nbsp;if you're not interested in the details&nbsp;there's always the very legitimate fifth approach of ""see what the experts say and don't worry about it"", also. I can't fault you for just not caring.)</p>
<hr />
<p>By the way, the conclusion that 0.999...=1 is completely, unequivocally true in the real numbers, basically for the Dedekind cut&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999..."">reason</a>&nbsp;given above, which is the commonly accepted structure we are using when we write out mathematics if none is indicated. It is possible to find structures where it's not true, but you probably wouldn't write 0.999... in those structures anyway. It's not like 1+2+3+4+5...=-1/12, for which claiming truth is wildly inaccurate and outright deceptive.</p>
<p>But note<strong> </strong>that<strong> none of these approaches are out of reach to a careful thinker, even if they're not a mathematician</strong>. Or&nbsp;even mathematically-inclined.</p>
<p>So it's not required that you have the finesse to work out detailed mathematical arguments -- certainly the definitions of real numbers are too precise and technical for the average layperson to deal with. The question here is whether you take math statements at face value, or disbelieve them automatically (you would have done fine yesterday!), or pick the more rational choice -- breaking them down and looking for low-hanging ways to convince yourself one way or the other.</p>
<p>When you read a surprising argument like the 0.999...=1 one, does it occur to you to break down ways of inspecting it further?&nbsp;To look for contradictions, functional equivalences, second-guess your surprise as being a run-of-the-mill cognitive bias, or seek out precision to realign your intuition with the apparent surprise in 'reality'?</p>
<p>I think it should. Though I am pretty biased because I enjoy math and study it for fun. But -- if you subconsciously treat math as something that other people do and you just believe what they say at the end of the day, why? Does this cause you to neglect to rationally analyze mathematical conclusions, at whatever level you might be comfortable with? If so, I'll bet this isn't optimal and it's worth isolating in your mind and looking more closely at. Precise mathematical argument is essentially just rationalism applied to numbers, after all. Well - plus a lot of jargon.</p>
<p>(Do you think I represented the math or the rational arguments correctly? is my philosophy legitimate? Feedback much appreciated!)</p>",shev,shev,shev,

<blockquote><p>If we have data, let’s look at data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine. &#8211;<em> Jim Barksdale</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This blog started with a mathematical analysis of <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2015/10/27/001-intro/"" target=""_blank"">what this blog should be about</a>, and a promise to explain why p-values aren&#8217;t part of that analysis. 14 months later, I&#8217;m bringing Putanumonit full circle by doing a mathematical analysis of what this <em>post</em> should be about, and explaining in detail why p-values suck.</p>
<p>In case you were worried (or hopeful), bringing the blog full circle doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s ending. I plan to keep going in a straight line after closing the circle, which should make the entire blog look like the digit 6.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I asked my readers for some <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/12/27/make-putanumonit-great-for-the-first-time/"" target=""_blank"">greatness-enhancing feedback</a> via survey and email. A lot of the readers who emailed me think that they are much bigger math geeks than the other readers who emailed me, which is pretty funny. But one reader actually proved it by putting a num on it:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a <i>huge</i> math nerd, so my interests and knowledge when it comes to this sort of thing are probably at least four standard deviations from the mean of humanity, and at least two from your reader base. &#8211; <em>Eliana</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Eliana&#8217;s email is wonderful for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It says <em>&#8220;the mean of humanity&#8221;</em> where most people would say <em>&#8220;most people&#8221;</em>.</li>
<li>It makes an explicit, testable prediction: that my readers are 2 standard deviations math-nerdier than the mean of the human species.</li>
</ol>
<p>If math-nerdiness is normally distributed, at +2 SDs my average reader is math-nerdier than 97.7% of humanity. Did you know that <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/8248/report-card-teens-favorite-subjects.aspx"" target=""_blank"">math is teens&#8217; favorite subject in high school</a>, year in year out? If normal humans admit (at least in anonymous surveys) to love studying math, surely my readers are on board as well.</p>

<p>Yep. If I was worried about making Putanumonit <em>too </em>math-nerdy, now I&#8217;m worried that it&#8217;s not going far enough for my readers. Last week I wrote a <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2017/01/13/poked/"" target=""_blank"">post about eating fish</a> and my commenters responded with detailed analysis, math jokes, mental calculation tricks and extensions to famous math puzzles. I feel a bit inadequate, my favorite subjects in school were gym and French.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s the point?</h2>
<blockquote><p>The only metrics that entrepreneurs should invest energy in collecting are those that help them make decisions. Unfortunately, the majority of data available in off-the-shelf analytics packages are what I call Vanity Metrics. They might make you feel good, but they don’t offer clear guidance for what to do. &#8211; <em><a href=""http://tim.blog/2009/05/19/vanity-metrics-vs-actionable-metrics/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Ries</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a point to the opening part of this post, and that&#8217;s to demonstrate that data analysis <strong>should have a point</strong>. The point of the survey above was to help me decide if I should write more or less mathematical detail in my posts, and it doesn&#8217;t take much analysis to see that the answer is &#8220;way more&#8221;. OK then, I certainly will.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll get to some of the other survey results, but I first want to step back and take a broader view of data analysis. In that view, almost all data analysis you see is conducted with one of two goals in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive a decision.</li>
<li>Get published in an academic journal.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may have heard of the war raging between the armies of Bayesian and frequentist analysis. Like all global conflicts, this war reached its peak with a <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1132/"" target=""_blank"">clever XKCD comic</a> and its nadir with a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/science/the-odds-continually-updated.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">sensationalistic New York Times story</a>.</p>
<p>The skirmishes in this war today consist mainly of Bayesians showing frequentists why their methods (i.e. <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/12/18/multiplicitous/"" target=""_blank"">p-values</a>) are either wrong or secretly Bayesian, and salty frequentists replying that the methods work just fine, thank you. In some sense they&#8217;re right: as long as academic journals are happy to accept papers based on p-values, getting a p-value is a great way of achieving that goal. It&#8217;s the first goal where frequentist analysis suffers, and a more mindful technique is needed.</p>
<p>Properly done, decision-driven analysis should work backwards from the question to the data:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> &#8211; <strong>Formulate the question or decision</strong> you want to answer with data.</p>
<p><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>Should I trim my posts to make them shorter or run with longer articles?</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Quantify alternative possibilities,</strong> or possible answers to the question. Each alternative is a model of how the world looks like in the narrow realm you&#8217;re interested in. The goal of the data is to promote one of the alternatives above the rest, so each alternative should correspond to a decision option or an answer to the main question.</p>
<p>Going from the decision I want to make, I will change the length I aim for in my posts if every fourth additional reader will be pleased by it. Specifically:</p>
<p><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>Alternative 1 &#8211; I would write <strong>longer </strong>posts (</em></span><em>decision</em><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>) if <strong>25%</strong> more of my readers prefer longer posts to shorter ones (</em></span><em>possible world</em><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>).</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>Alternative 2 &#8211; I would write <strong>shorter</strong> posts<strong> </strong>(</em></span><em>decision</em><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>) if <strong>25%</strong> more of my readers prefer short posts to longer ones (</em></span><em>possible world</em><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>).</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>Alternative 3 &#8211; I would <strong>keep the same</strong> length of posts (</em></span><em>decision</em><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>) If about the <strong>same</strong> percentage of readers like and dislike long posts (</em></span><em>possible world</em><span style=""color:#993300;""><em>).</em></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very likely that actual gap between lovers of long and short posts will fall somewhere between 0% and 25%, but I&#8217;m not interested in precisely estimating that gap. I&#8217;m only interested in making a decision, and since I have three decision options I can make do with only 3 alternatives. I will make the decision based on the alternative that seems most likely after everything is accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Put a number on how likely each alternative</strong> <strong>is</strong>. <strong> </strong>This should be based on your background knowledge, whatever information you have <em>before </em>the new data comes in. This is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability"" target=""_blank"">prior</a>, and for some reason it makes more people uncomfortable than Richard Pryor. We&#8217;ll get to both later.</p>
<p><em><span style=""color:#993300;"">My most popular posts were on the longer side, but not overwhelmingly so. I think people probably like both the same, and maybe lean towards longer posts. My priors are 30% for Alternative 1 that longer is better (that&#8217;s what she said), 10% for Alternative 2 and 60% for Alternative 3</span></em><em><span style=""color:#993300;"">.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Use the new evidence to update your prior probabilities in accordance with Bayes&#8217; rule</strong> and arrive at the <em>posterior</em>, or the outcome. Make your decisions accordingly.</p>
<p>The verbal logic of Bayes&#8217; rule is that whichever <em>alternative</em> gave the highest probability of seeing the <em>evidence</em> we actually observed is the one most supported by the evidence. &#8220;Support&#8221; means that the probability of the alternative increases from its prior. I&#8217;m going to demonstrate the use of Bayes&#8217; rule, but I&#8217;m not going to explain it further. That&#8217;s because <strong><a href=""https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/"" target=""_blank"">Arbital&#8217;s guide to Bayes&#8217; rule</a></strong> does such an excellent job of explaining it to any level of skill and need that I don&#8217;t want to step on their turf. If you have any doubts, big or small, about what the rule says and why it works go ahead and spend some time on Arbital. I&#8217;m not going anywhere.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re back? Good. I assume you&#8217;re hip to Bayes now and we can jump straight into the calculation.</p>
<p>We have three competing hypotheses and prior probabilities on all three. I&#8217;m going to summarize the prior probabilites in odds form, because that&#8217;s the <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule_odds/"" target=""_blank"">easiest form to apply Bayes&#8217; rule to</a>. Our odd ratios for Alternative 1 (longer is better):Alternative 2 (shorter):Alternative 3 (same) are 30%:10%:60%, or <span style=""color:#800080;"">3:1:6</span>.</p>
<p>All we need now is the evidence. I have combined a couple of survey question and their responses to get this basic breakout:</p>
<table>

<td width=""110""><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td width=""50""><strong>386</strong></td>
<td width=""50""><strong>100%</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The gap between people who prefer longer posts to shorter ones is 34% &#8211; 19% = 15%. That wasn&#8217;t one of our three alternatives, but it&#8217;s definitely closer to some than to others. Ideally, instead of picking a few discrete possibilities we will have a prior and a posterior on a <em>continuous </em><em>distribution </em>of some parameter (like the long-short gap). I&#8217;ll go through a continuous-parameter analysis in the next post.</p>
<p>We now need to calculate the probability of seeing this result given each of the three alternatives, <em>P(131-72 long-short split | alternative N)</em>. I whipped up a very <a href=""http://github.com/yashkaf/oldhispanic/blob/master/survey_analysis.r"" target=""_blank"">quick and dirty R simulation</a> to do that, but with a couple of assumptions we can get that number in a single Excel line. To make life easy, we&#8217;ll assume that the number of people who show no preference is fixed at 183 out of the 386, so our alternatives boil down to how the other 203 readers are split.</p>
<p>Alternative 1 &#8211; There&#8217;s a 25% advantage to long posts, and 25% of 386 responders is 97. So this alternative says that out of the 203 who show a preference, 97 more will prefer long posts. This means that these 203 readers will be split 150 in favor of long, 53 in favor of short. 150/203 is 74%, so this alternative predicts that <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">74% of 203</span> prefer long posts.</p>
<p>Similarly, Alternative 2 says that 53 of 203, or <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">26% </span>prefer long posts, and Alternative 3 says that <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">50% of them</span> do (i.e. an equal number prefer long and short). Now we simply treat each responder as making an independent choice between long and short with a fixed probability of 74%, 50% or 26%. For each option, the chance of getting our observed 131-72 split is given by the <a href=""http://stattrek.com/probability-distributions/binomial.aspx"" target=""_blank"">binomial distribution</a> which you can calculate in Excel or Google Sheets with the BINOMDIST function.</p>
<p>P(evidence | Alternative 1) = P(131 long &#8211; 72 short | <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">74%</span> for long) = BINOMDIST(131,203,<span style=""color:#0000ff;"">0.74</span>,0) = .0007</p>
<p>P(evidence | Alternative 2) = P(131 long &#8211; 72 short | <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">26%</span> for long) = BINOMDIST(131,203,<span style=""color:#0000ff;"">0.26</span>,0) ≃ 0, as far as Google Docs can calculate. Let&#8217;s call this <strong>ε.</strong></p>
<p>P(evidence | Alternative 3) = P(131 long &#8211; 72 short | <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">50%</span> for long) = BINOMDIST(131,203,<span style=""color:#0000ff;"">0.5</span>,0) = .0000097</p>
<p>The likelihood ratios we get are <span style=""color:#800080;"">0.0007 : <strong>ε</strong> : 0.0000097</span> = <span style=""color:#800080;"">72:<strong>ε</strong>:1</span>.  We&#8217;ll deal with the <strong>ε</strong> after calculating the posterior odds.</p>
<p>Posterior odds for alternatives 1:2:3 = <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule_odds/"" target=""_blank"">prior odds * likelihood odds</a> = <span style=""color:#800080;"">3:1:6</span> * <span style=""color:#800080;"">72:<strong>ε</strong>:1</span> = <span style=""color:#800080;"">216:<strong>ε</strong>:6</span>. We can go from odds back to probabilities by dividing the odds of each alternative by the total odds. 216 + 0 + 6 = 222 so:</p>
<p>Probability that a lot more people prefer long posts = 216/222 = 97%.</p>
<p>Probability that an equal number prefer long and short posts = 6/222 = 3%.</p>
<p>The probability that a lot more people prefer <em>short</em> is bounded by the <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/12/18/multiplicitous/"" target=""_blank"">Rule of Psi we formulated in the last post</a>:</p>
<p class=""rules""><a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Rule of Psi</strong> </a>(posterior edition)- A <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2423692"" target=""_blank"">study of parapsychological ability to predict the future</a> produced a p-value of 0.00000000012. That number is only meaningful if you have absolute confidence that the study was perfect, otherwise you need to consider your <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/3be/confidence_levels_inside_and_outside_an_argument/"" target=""_blank"">confidence <em>outside</em> the result itself</a>, i.e. the probability that the study is useless. If you think that for example there&#8217;s an <strong>ε</strong> chance that the <strong>result is completely fake</strong>, that <strong>ε</strong> is roughly the floor on your <em>posterior probabilities</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s at least a <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">0.1%</span> chance that my data is useless. Either I formulated the questions wrong, or the plugin didn&#8217;t count them, or someone who loves long posts voted 200 times to confuse me. This means that we shouldn&#8217;t let the data push the probability of any alternative too far below 0.1%, so we&#8217;ll set that as the posterior for more people preferring short posts.</p>
<p>Our simple analysis led us to an actionable conclusion: <strong>there&#8217;s a 97% chance that the preference gap in favor longer posts is closer to 25% than to 0%, so I shouldn&#8217;t hesitate to write longer posts</strong>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s important to notice is that this decision is driven completely by the objective evidence, not by the prior. Let&#8217;s imagine that prior had been pretty far from the truth: <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">10%</span> for longer posts, 45% for shorter, 45% for equal. The posterior odds would be: 10:45:45 * 72:<strong>ε</strong>:1 = 720:<strong>ε</strong>:45. The evidence would take Alternative 1 from <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">10%</span> to 720/765 = <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">94%</span>. I would have had to give the true alternative a tiny prior probability (&lt;1%) for the evidence to fail to promote it. 30%:10%:60% was a pretty unopinionated prior, I made all the probabilities non-extreme to let the evidence dictate the posterior.</p>
<p>The prior doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect, it just needs to give a non-tiny probability to the right answer. When using Bayesian inference, <strong>sufficient evidence will promote the correct answer unless your prior is extremely wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Bottom line: the evidence tells me to write long posts, which the survey defined as having 3,000 words. I&#8217;m only 1,800 words in, so let&#8217;s take a second to talk about art.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Art of Data Science</h2>
<blockquote><p>A lie is profanity. A lie is the worst thing in the world. Art is the ability to tell the truth. <em>&#8211; <a href=""http://www.azquotes.com/quote/1180566"" target=""_blank"">Richard Pryor</a> (I told you we&#8217;d get back to him)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I chose this quote not just because of Pryor&#8217;s very Bayesian surname, but also because I wanted to write the first essay ever that quotes both Richard Pryor and <a href=""http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/"" target=""_blank"">Roger Peng</a>, two men who share little in common except for their initials and a respect for truth. Peng created the <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science"" target=""_blank"">JHU data science specialization on Coursera</a> (well explained and not very challenging) and wrote <em><a href=""https://leanpub.com/artofdatascience"" target=""_blank"">The Art of Data Science</a>. </em>Here&#8217;s how he explains the title of the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>Much like songwriting (and computer programming, for that matter), it’s important to realize that <em>data analysis is an art</em>. It is not something yet that we can teach to a computer. Data analysts have many <em>tools</em> at their disposal, from linear regression to classification trees and even deep learning, and these tools have all been carefully taught to computers. But ultimately, a data analyst must find a way to assemble all of the tools and apply them to data to answer a relevant question—a question of interest to people.</p></blockquote>
<p>I made several choices in the previous section that could all be made differently: picking the three alternatives I did, or using a simplified binomial distribution for the likelihood. I made these choices with the goal of<em> trying to tell the truth</em>. That involves getting c<em>lose to the truth</em> (which requires using good enough methods) and being able to <em>tell</em> <em>it</em> in a comprehensible way (which requires simplifying and making assumptions).</p>
<p>The procedure I outlined isn&#8217;t close to the Bayesian ideal of extracting maximum information from all available evidence. It&#8217;s not even up to industry standards, because unlike many of my readers I am not a professional data scientist (yet, growth mindset). But the procedure is easy to emulate, and I&#8217;m pretty sure the answer it gave me is true &#8211; people want longer posts.</p>
<p>And yet, this is very useful procedure is only taught in the statistics departments of universities. Cross the lawn and you&#8217;ll find that most other departments, from psychology to geology, from business school to the med school, teaches something completely different: <em>null hypothesis testing</em>. This involves calculating a p-value to reject or accept the mythical &#8220;null hypothesis&#8221;. It&#8217;s a simple method, I learned it well enough to get a a perfect score on the statistics final, and the following year I helped indoctrinate new students into null hypothesis testing as a teaching assistant. But since then I spent a good while thinking about it, and I came to realize that <strong>null hypothesis testing is hopelessly inadequate in getting close to the truth</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Null Method</h2>
<p>Null hypothesis testing fails to divulge the truth for three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It asks <em>&#8220;is the null hypothesis accepted or rejected?&#8221;</em>, which is <strong>the wrong question</strong>.</li>
<li>It calculates a <em>p-value</em>, which is <strong>the wrong answer</strong>.</li>
<li>Both the null and the p-value aren&#8217;t even relevant to what <strong>the truth actually looks like</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are some <strong>bold</strong> claims, so let&#8217;s inspect them through the example of a serious research study, and not just my piddling survey. Here&#8217;s a study about <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/112/46/14224.full"" target=""_blank"">differences in intelligence between the first and second-born sibling</a>. What does null hypothesis testing make of it?</p>
<p>Hypothesis testing only knows to ask <strong>one question: <em>I</em><em>s the null rejected? </em></strong>The answer to this is a resounding &#8220;yes&#8221;: <em>Older siblings are smarter because </em><em>the null hypothesis of equal IQ between siblings is rejected with a p-value of 0.00000001. </em>So many zeroes! Hold on while I call my younger brother to inform him of my intellectual superiority.</p>
<p>But wait, isn&#8217;t a better question to ask is: <em>How much smarter are older siblings?</em> The answer is<span style=""color:#0000ff;""> 1.5</span> IQ points. That is smaller than the<span style=""color:#0000ff;""> 4-6</span> point average difference between <a href=""http://edpsychassociates.com/Papers/WISC3LongStability(1998).pdf"" target=""_blank"">two IQ tests taken by <em>the same</em> <em>person</em></a> two years apart. It&#8217;s a mere fraction of the 30 point hit a person&#8217;s IQ takes the moment they start <a href=""https://xkcd.com/481/"" target=""_blank"">typing in a YouTube comment</a>. The answer to the better question is: <em>imperceptibly.</em></p>
<p>Another question could be: <em>What are the chances that in a given family the older sibling has higher IQ?</em> The answer to that is <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">52%</span>, practically a coin flip. Any relevant information will tell you more about relative IQ than birth order, for example the fact that my brother studies chemistry and writes poetry, while I <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/12/23/inflated-bubbles/"" target=""_blank"">got an MBA</a> and write about <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/07/27/pokemonumber/"" target=""_blank"">Pokemon</a>.</p>
<p>So how did the study get such an impressive p-value? Because their sample size was 3,156. With such a huge sample size, you can get &#8220;statistical significance&#8221; with or without <em>actual significance</em>. Whatever your goal was in studying birth order and intelligence, answering &#8220;is the null hypothesis rejected?&#8221; is usually useless in achieving that goal.</p>
<p>The answer you get, a p-value, is pretty meaningless as well. Does a p-value of 5% means that you&#8217;re wrong in rejecting the null 5% of the time? Nope! <a href=""http://www.dcscience.net/2014/03/24/on-the-hazards-of-significance-testing-part-2-the-false-discovery-rate-or-how-not-to-make-a-fool-of-yourself-with-p-values/"" target=""_blank"">You&#8217;re going to be wrong somewhere between 30% and 80% percent</a>, depending on the power of the study. Does it even mean that if the null is true you&#8217;ll see the same result 5% of the time? Nope again! That&#8217;s because the p-value is calculated not as the chance of seeing the actual effect you measured, but as the chance of <em>getting a result <strong>at least as big</strong> (technically, as far from the null) <strong>as the measured effect</strong>. </em></p>
<p>Calculating anything for the group of <em>&#8220;effects at least as big as the measured effect&#8221;</em> is absurd for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>This group<strong> isn&#8217;t representative of the</strong> <strong>measured effect </strong>because the measured effect is an edge case within that group. In the IQ example, the p-value is the chance, given that the null is true and also given a bunch of assumptions, that the older sibling is smarter by 1.5 points, or 2 points, or 27 points, or 1500 points. It&#8217;s a huge range of outcomes, most of which are a lot farther away from 1.5 than 1.5 is from 0 (the null). If we assumed 0 and got 1.5, why are we calculating the probability of getting 27?Moreover, the assumptions that underlie the p-value calculation (such as a normal distribution) are very hard to justify over that huge range of 1.5 to infinity. Many distributions resemble a normal bell curve close to the middle but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-tailed_distribution"" target=""_blank"">look very different in the tails</a>. The &#8220;range of IQ differences bigger than 1.5&#8221; (the right tail) looks little like the data we actually have which is &#8220;an IQ difference of exactly 1.5&#8221;.</li>
<li>This group for the most part <strong>doesn&#8217;t even include the actual effect</strong>, which is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Population_and_sample_effect_sizes"" target=""_blank"">usually smaller than the measured effect</a>. If you measured a positive effect, the measurement error was likely in that positive direction as well. When we subtract the error from the measured result to get the <strong>true result</strong>, we get a small number which is completely outside the range of the bigger numbers we measured the p-value on.</li>
</ol>
<p>The lower the power of the experiment, the worse this problem gets, and power is often pretty low. With the graph below <a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/2014/11/17/power-06-looks-like-get-used/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Gelman</a> shows just how bad this gets when the statistical power = 0.06, which is what the &#8220;<a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/04/17/022-power_skeptic/"" target=""_blank"">Ovulating married women vote Republican</a>&#8221; study had:</p>

<p>This is why in the likelihood calculation I used the precise result of &#8220;exactly 131 people prefer long posts&#8221;, not <em>&#8220;131 or above&#8221;.</em> P-value calculations don&#8217;t work with point estimates, but &#8220;or above&#8221; ranges will break even likelihood calculations.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try this on the survey results. If we tried null-rejection testing, whether I chose &#8220;50% prefer long posts&#8221; or &#8220;74% prefer long posts&#8221; as my null hypothesis, the actual result of &#8220;131/203 prefer long posts&#8221; would <em>reject the null with p&lt;0.002</em>. Again, rejecting the null doesn&#8217;t tell you much.</p>
<p>When I calculated the likelihood given by &#8220;131 prefer long&#8221;, I got a ratio of <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">72:1</span>. If instead I had calculated the likelihood based on &#8220;131 <em>or more </em>prefer long&#8221;, the likelihood ratio in favor of Alternative 1 would have been <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">47,000:1</span>. Here&#8217;s the fun part: if I had looked at &#8220;131 or below&#8221;, the likelihood ratio would have been <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">1:1730</span> <em>in favor of the opposite alternative</em>!</p>
<p>Choosing a direction for the range of outcomes can arbitrarily support any hypothesis you come up with, or reject it. But that&#8217;s exactly what having a single null hypothesis does, it defines an arbitrary direction: if the measurement landed above it you look at that result <em>or above</em>, and vice versa. That to me is the main issue with null hypothesis testing &#8211; a single hypothesis with no alternatives can&#8217;t bring you to the actual answer.</p>
<p>When you have several alternatives, gathering more evidence always brings you closer to the truth. &#8220;25% more people like long posts&#8221; isn&#8217;t the <em>exact</em> truth, but it&#8217;s probably closer than the other two options. When you have a continuous distribution of alternatives, you do even better as the evidence zeroes the posterior in on the real answer.</p>
<p>But if you just had one null and you rejected it, your conclusions depend more on the choice of null (which can be quite arbitrary) than on what the evidence tells you. Your company released a new product and it sold 10,000 copies, is that good or bad? That entirely depends on whether your null hypothesis was 5,000 copies or 20,000. Should the null hypothesis be the average sales for any product your company makes? But this product had a smaller niche, a larger advertising budget, and twice the R&amp;D cost. It makes no sense to compare it to the average.</p>
<p>The best you can do is to incorporate all available information about the customers, the price, the advertising and the cost. Then, use all those factors to calculate a predicted sales volume, along with a range of uncertainty around it. But that&#8217;s not a null hypothesis anymore, that&#8217;s the <strong><em>prior</em></strong>, the one that frequentists don&#8217;t like because it feels subjective.</p>
<p>Null-worship isn&#8217;t a strawman, it happens to Nobel-caliber scientists. If you remember <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/03/01/019-lukewarm-hand/"" target=""_blank"">my essay about hot hand shooting</a>, Tom Gilovich and Amos Tversky hypothesized that basketball players shoot <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">0% better</span> on their second free throw, and made that the null hypothesis because 0 is a nice round number that pretends to be objective. A bunch of random fans estimated the difference to be <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">8%</span>. The actual answer came out to <strong><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">4%</span></strong>, and the scientists concluded that <strong>there&#8217;s no improvement because their sample was too small for the null to be rejected at p&lt;0.05</strong>!</p>
<p>In absolute terms, both fans and scientists were off by 4%. In relative terms, the fans overestimated the effect by a factor of <strong>2</strong>, while the scientists underestimated the effect by a factor of <strong>infinity</strong>. Gilovich and Tversky didn&#8217;t declare victory because they were closer to the truth, but because they got to pick the null.</p>
<p>Is there any use to null hypothesis testing at all? Yes, but it&#8217;s the opposite of how most people use it. In common practice, if someone rejects the null, they declare victory and publish. If they don&#8217;t reject the null, they <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/12/18/multiplicitous/"" target=""_blank"">p-hack until the null is rejected</a> and <em>then</em> declare victory and publish.</p>
<p>Instead, null hypothesis testing can be a quick check to see if your data is worthwhile. <a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/2015/01/24/teach-hypothesis-testing/"" target=""_blank"">If you fail to reject the null</a>, your data isn&#8217;t good enough. There&#8217;s too much noise and too little signal, you need better data or just a lot more of it. If you <em>do</em> reject the null, your data might be good enough to yield an answer once you throw out the p-value and start doing some actual statistical inference.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This post was nerdy, and it was long, and it&#8217;s time to wrap it up.</p>
<p>Data analysis is both an art <em>and </em>a science. There&#8217;s no single recipe for doing it right, but there are many ways to do it <em>wrong</em>, and a lot of the latter ways involve p-values. When the questions falls to you, stick to a simple rulebook:</p>
<p>Rule 1 &#8211; Focus on the ultimate question you&#8217;re answering, the one that drives the decision. For every step in the analysis, ask yourself &#8211; is this step helping me answer the ultimate question?</p>
<p>Rule 2 &#8211; Before you see the data, come up with alternative hypotheses and predictions. Base these predictions on your knowledge of the issue, not on objective-looking round numbers.</p>
<p>Rule 3 &#8211; <img src=""https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H_i%5Cmid+e%29+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cmathbb+P%28e%5Cmid+H_i%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cmathbb+P%28H_i%29%7D%7B%5Csum_k+%5Cmathbb+P%28e%5Cmid+H_k%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cmathbb+P%28H_k%29%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=7a7c84&#038;s=0"" alt=""P(H_i&#92;mid e) = &#92;dfrac{&#92;mathbb P(e&#92;mid H_i) &#92;cdot &#92;mathbb P(H_i)}{&#92;sum_k &#92;mathbb P(e&#92;mid H_k) &#92;cdot &#92;mathbb P(H_k)} "" title=""P(H_i&#92;mid e) = &#92;dfrac{&#92;mathbb P(e&#92;mid H_i) &#92;cdot &#92;mathbb P(H_i)}{&#92;sum_k &#92;mathbb P(e&#92;mid H_k) &#92;cdot &#92;mathbb P(H_k)} "" class=""latex"" /></p>

One of the most prominent phenomena getting in the way is <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia"">akrasia</a></em>, the lack of willpower preventing us to perform whatever action we want to do.</p><p>So, wait, do we want to act or not? There are two facets of willpower, which I&apos;ll describe using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"">Kahneman&apos;s</a> System 1 and System 2, the two working modes of the mind (bear in mind it&apos;s a simplification to get the point across).</p><p>What we call <strong>System 1 willpower</strong> is what gets you up in the morning, out of a good shower, what makes you start things, the grit, the sudden confidence, the &quot;just do it&quot; part. It&apos;s the short-term impulse of &quot;I can go one step further and <em>my body shall obey</em>. It&apos;s the thing many productivity methods want to trigger. For example, the 2-minute rule (&quot;if it takes less than 2 minutes to perform, do it now&quot;) is based on the intuition that you won&apos;t need a lot of effort to get something done, akin to going briefly out of your way to help a friend. <em>Of course</em> you can do it. No planning needed. It&apos;s very appealing to your brain.</p><p>What we call <strong>System 2 willpower</strong> is the high-level justification, the reason behind the actions, the thought-out plan, the will to make good decisions, to make things right, to keep akrasia in check in order to achieve long-term goals, the thing that sees problems as obstacles to be overcome instead of monsters to avoid. It&apos;s the background buzzing of &quot;I want to go <em>there</em> and <em>I shall find a path</em>&quot;. It&apos;s the thing many productivity methods want to manage. The <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done"">Getting Things Done</a></em> methods starts with a list of tasks, which you can process in orderly manner, setting long and short-term goals and stay in control at all times. It&apos;s also very appealing to your brain.</p><p>However, what makes you actually do things is S1 willpower, not S2. S1 is more low-level, and has no knowledge of plans. Your willpower can be misguided. You want to throw paper planes, scribbling randomly, following click-bait headlines, when your plan is to work, or train, or be otherwise productive. S2 willpower is supposed to keep S1 in check, to make you perform counter-intuitive actions for your own good.</p><p>The willpower tricks work, but they&apos;re costly. They require a part of your attention, a conscious effort to keep yourself focused. It&apos;s just much less costly to have S1 willpower run everything, with S2 staying where it should belong: abstract thought, not micromanagement of S1. This is <em>flow</em>, where S1 willpower remains high and has no reason to go down because everything goes smoothly (and it&apos;s a fragile state, any disruption can get you out of it).</p><p>Conversely, ignoring completely S1 willpower and forcing yourself to do things isn&apos;t safe nor productive. If you ignore the natural drive that comes from pleasant activity, you may coerce your will into whatever &quot;optimal&quot; process you designed, working yourself ragged. You&apos;re not a machine. Your body is <em>part of you</em>, not a weak container, nor a lazy-by-default entity you should negotiate with.</p><p>My model of effective anti-akrasia isn&apos;t to poke System 1 repeatedly but to engineer situations where S1 <em>agrees</em> with S2 on what is best for you; where you don&apos;t encounter contradicting signals of &quot;I don&apos;t really want to do that, is that necessary?&quot; all the time. The goal is to make productivity the <em>default state</em>, to make it more attractive than doing nothing. How we can do this will be covered in later posts.</p><p><em>Special thanks to</em> <em><a href=""https://lordregexrationalist.wordpress.com/"">regex</a>, who sparked the discussion leading to this post.

zxQ3pqxC3r7gmQWuw,Infinite Summations: A Rationality Litmus Test,infinite-summations-a-rationality-litmus-test,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zxQ3pqxC3r7gmQWuw/infinite-summations-a-rationality-litmus-test,2017-01-20T09:31:09.358Z,38,26,23,False,False,,"<p>You may have seen that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww"">Numberphile</a> video that circulated the social media world a few years ago. It showed the 'astounding' mathematical result:</p>
<p>1+2+3+4+5+&hellip; = -1/12</p>
<p>(quote: ""the answer to this sum is, remarkably, minus a twelfth"")</p>
<p>Then they tell you that this result is used in many areas of physics, and show you a page of a string theory textbook (oooo) that states it as a theorem.</p>
<p>The video caused quite an uproar at the time, since it was many people's first introduction to the rather outrageous idea and they had all sorts of very reasonable objections.</p>
<p>Here's the 'proof' from the video:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">First, consider P = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1&hellip;<br />Clearly the value of P oscillates between 1 and 0 depending on how many terms you get. Numberphile decides that it equals 1/2, because that's halfway in the middle.<br />Alternatively, consider P+P with the terms interleaved, and check out this quirky arithmetic:<br /><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>1-1+1-1&hellip;<br /><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>+ 1-1+1&hellip;<br /><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>= 1 + (-1+1) + (1-1)&nbsp;&hellip; = 1, so 2P = 1, so P = 1/2<br />Now consider Q = 1-2+3-4+5&hellip;<br />And write out Q+Q this way:<br /><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>1-2+3-4+5&hellip;<br /><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>+ 1 -2+3-4&hellip;<br /><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>= 1-1+1-1+1 = 1/2 = 2Q, so Q = 1/4&nbsp;<br />Now consider S = 1+2+3+4+5...<br />Write S-4S as<br /><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>1+2+3+4+5&hellip;<br /><span style=""white-space:pre""> -</span>&nbsp;4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-8&nbsp;&hellip;<br /><span style=""white-space:pre""> </span>=1-2+3-4+5&hellip; = Q=1/4<br />So S-4S=-3S = 1/4, so S=-1/12</p>
<p>How do you feel about that? Probably amused but otherwise not very good, regardless of your level of math proficiency. But in another way it's <em>really convincing</em> - I mean, <em>string theorists use it, </em>by god. And, to quote the video, ""these kinds of sums appear all over physics"".</p>
<hr />
<p>So the question is this: when you see a video or hear a proof like this, do you 'believe them'? Even if it's not your field, and not in your area of expertise, do you believe someone who tells you ""even though you thought mathematics worked this way, it actually doesn't; it's still totally mystical and insane results are lurking just around the corner if you know where to look""? What if they tell you string theorists use it, and it appears all over physics?<br /><br />I imagine this is as a sort of rationality litmus test. See how you react to the video or the proof (or remember how you reacted when you initially heard this argument). Is it the 'rational response'? How do you weigh your own intuitions vs a convincing argument from authority plus math that seems to somehow work, if you turn your head a bit?</p>
<p>If you don't believe them, what does that feel like? How confident are you?</p>
<p>(spoilers below)</p>
<hr />
<p>It's totally true that, as an everyday rationalist (or even as a scientist or mathematician or theorist), there will always be computational conclusions that are out of your reach to verify. You pretty much have to believe theoretical physicists who tell you ""the Standard Model of particle physics accurately models reality and predicts basically everything we see at the subatomic scale with unerring accuracy""; you're likely in no position to argue.</p>
<p>But - and this is the point - it's <em>highly unlikely</em>&nbsp;that all of your tools are lies, even if 'experts' say so, and <strong>you ought to require extraordinary evidence to be convinced that they are. </strong>It's not enough that&nbsp;someone out there can contrive a plausible-sounding argument&nbsp;that you don't know how to refute, if your tools are logically sound and their claims don't fit into that logic.</p>
<p>(On the other hand, if you believe something because you heard it was a good idea from one expert, and then another expert tells you a different idea, take your pick; there's no way to tell. It's the personal experience that makes this example lead to sanity-questioning, and that's where the problem lies.)</p>
<p>In my (non-expert but well-informed) view, the correct response to this argument is <strong>to say ""no, I don't believe you"", and hold your ground</strong>.&nbsp;Because the claim made in the video is so absurd that, even if you believe the video is correct and made by experts and the string theory textbook actually says that, you should consider a wide range of other explanations as to ""how it could have come to be that people are claiming this"" <em>before</em>&nbsp;accepting that addition might work in such an unlikely way.</p>
<p>Not because you know about how infinite sums work better than a physicist or mathematician does, but because you know how mundane addition works <em>just as well as they do</em>, and if a conclusion this shattering to your model comes around -- even to a layperson's model of how addition works, that adding positive numbers to positive numbers results in <em>bigger</em>&nbsp;numbers --, then either ""everything is broken"" or ""I'm going insane"" or (and this is by far the theory that Occam's Razor should prefer) ""<strong>they and I are somehow talking about different things</strong>"".</p>
<p>That is, the unreasonable mathematical result is because the mathematician or physicist is talking about one ""sense"" of addition, but it's not the same one that you're using when you do everyday sums or when you apply your intuitions about intuition to everyday life. This is by far the simplest explanation: addition works just how you thought it does, even in your inexpertise; you and the mathematician are just talking past each other somehow, and you <em>don't have to know what way that is</em> to be pretty sure that it's happening. Anyway, there's no reason expert mathematicians can't be amateur communicators, and even that is a much more palatable result than what they're claiming.</p>
<p>(As it happens, my view is that any trained mathematician who claims that 1+2+3+4+5&hellip; = -1/12&nbsp;<em>without qualification</em>&nbsp;is so incredibly confused or poor at communicating or actually just misanthropic that they ought to be, er, sent to a re-education camp.)</p>
<p>So, is this what you came up with? Did your rationality win out in the face of fallacious authority?</p>
<p>(Also, do you agree that I've represented the 'rational approach' to this situation correctly? Give me feedback!)</p>

<p><strong>Postscript: the explanation of the proof</strong></p>
<p>There's <a href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/does-123-really-equal-112/"">no</a> <a href=""https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/the-euler-maclaurin-formula-bernoulli-numbers-the-zeta-function-and-real-variable-analytic-continuation/"">shortage</a> <a href=""http://aperiodical.com/2014/01/an-infinite-series-of-blog-posts-which-sums-to-minus-a-twelfth/"">of</a> explanations of this online, and a mountain of them emerged after this video became popular. I'll write out a simple version anyway for the curious.</p>
<p>It turns out that there is <em>a sense</em>&nbsp;in which those summations are valid, but it's not the sense you're using when you perform ordinary addition. It's also true that the summations <a href=""https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics/Casimir_effect_in_one_dimension"">emerge</a> in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosonic_string_theory"">physics</a>. It is also true that the validity of these summations is <em>in spite of</em>&nbsp;the rules of ""you can't add, subtract, or otherwise deal with infinities, and yes all these sums diverge"" that you learn in introductory calculus; it turns out that those rules are also elementary and there are ways around them but you have to be very rigorous to get them right.</p>
<p>An elementary explanation of what happened in the proof is that, in all three infinite sum cases, it is possible to interpret the infinite sum as a&nbsp;more accurate form (but STILL not precise enough to use for regular arithmetic, because infinities are very much not valid, still, we're serious):</p>
<p>S(infinity) = 1+2+3+4+5&hellip; &asymp;&nbsp;-1/12 + O(infinity)</p>
<p>Where S(n) is a function giving the n'th partial sum of the series, and S(infinity) is an analytic continuation (basically, theoretical extension) of the function to infinity. (The O(infinity) part means ""something on the order of infinity"")</p>
<p>Point is, that O(infinity) bit hangs around, but <em>doesn't really disrupt math on the finite part</em>, which is why algebraic manipulations still seem to work. (Another cute fact: the curve that fits the partial sum function also non-coincidentally&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sum1234Summary.svg"">takes</a> the value -1/12 at n=0.)</p>
<p>And it's true that this series <em>always</em>&nbsp;associates with the finite part -1/12; even though there are some manipulations that can get you to other values, there's a list of 'valid' manipulations that constrains it. (Well, there are other kinds of summations that I don't remember that might get different results. But this value is not <em>accidentally</em> associated with this summation.)</p>
<p>And the fact that the series emerges in physics is complicated but amounts to the fact that, in the particular way we've glued math onto physical reality, we've <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization"">constructed</a> a framework that <em>also</em>&nbsp;doesn't care about the infinity term (it's rejected as ""nonphysical""!), and so we get the right answer despite dubious math. But physicists are fine with that, because it seems to be working and they don't know a better way to do it yet.</p>",shev,shev,shev,

</style></head><body><p>My <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1149"">previous post</a> suggested a strategy for making bets on uncertain propositions (e.g. the color of the sun) without having a good prior.  Here I present an impossibility result for doing this in general.</p>
<hr>
<p>Say there are <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> agents, and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n-1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> possible colors of the sun.  Before observing the sun's color, each agent is only able to pick a <em>single</em> color of solar panel to buy (each color solar panel only produces power for a single possible sun color).  The sun is revealed, and then the universe is split among the agents who bought the right color solar panel.  Assume all agents have utility linear in the share of the universe they control.</p>
<p>Each agent from 1 to <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n-1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span> believes with certainty that the sun is a color equal to the agent's index (e.g. agent 2 believes the sun is color 2).  Obviously, each of these agents the right color solar panel for the sun color they predict.</p>
<p>The <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span>th agent is agnostic about what color the sun will be, and would like to ensure that in expectation they get a significant fraction of the universe regardless of the color of the sun.</p>

This is because, whenever this agent picks the right color solar panel, they will only get <em>half</em> of the universe (sharing with the agent whose index corresponds to the sun's color).  So the best agent <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> can do is to pick a uniformly random color solar panel, yielding an expected <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\frac{1}{2(n-1)}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mfrac""><span class=""mjx-box MJXc-stacked"" style=""width: 2.373em; padding: 0px 0.12em;""><span class=""mjx-numerator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 3.356em; top: -1.372em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-denominator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 3.356em; bottom: -0.999em;""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span><span style=""border-bottom: 1.3px solid; top: -0.296em; width: 2.373em;"" class=""mjx-line""></span></span><span style=""height: 1.677em; vertical-align: -0.707em;"" class=""mjx-vsize""></span></span></span></span></span></span> fraction of the universe for each possible sun color.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that allowing agents to make enforceable contracts with each other doesn't fix the problem.  The issue is that agent <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span> starts out from a pretty bad bargaining position, having very little to offer the other agents.</p>
<p>If the agent could buy a mixture of different solar panel colors, and the universe were divided proportionally to power generation, then the agent could spend <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\frac{1}{n-1}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mfrac""><span class=""mjx-box MJXc-stacked"" style=""width: 1.469em; padding: 0px 0.12em;""><span class=""mjx-numerator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 2.078em; top: -1.372em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-denominator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 2.078em; bottom: -0.747em;""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span><span style=""border-bottom: 1.3px solid; top: -0.296em; width: 1.469em;"" class=""mjx-line""></span></span><span style=""height: 1.499em; vertical-align: -0.528em;"" class=""mjx-vsize""></span></span></span></span></span></span> of its resources on each color solar panel, yielding a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\frac{1}{n}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mfrac""><span class=""mjx-box MJXc-stacked"" style=""width: 0.566em; padding: 0px 0.12em;""><span class=""mjx-numerator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 0.8em; top: -1.372em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-denominator"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; width: 0.8em; bottom: -0.524em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span><span style=""border-bottom: 1.3px solid; top: -0.296em; width: 0.566em;"" class=""mjx-line""></span></span><span style=""height: 1.341em; vertical-align: -0.37em;"" class=""mjx-vsize""></span></span></span></span></span></span> fraction of the universe in all possible worlds.  But this does not seem realistic to assume that actions like this are always available.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to do about this.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider these situation-reaction pairs:</p>
<ul>
<li>&middot;<span style=""font-variant-numeric: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">You are having an argument with someone. As you begin to notice the signs of yourself getting heated, you remember to calm down and talk civilly. Maybe also some deep breaths.</span></li>
<li>&middot;<span style=""font-variant-numeric: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">You are giving yourself a deadline or making a schedule for a task, and you write down the time you expect to finish. Quickly, though, you remember to actually check if it took you that long last time, and you adjust accordingly.</span></li>
<li>&middot;<span style=""font-variant-numeric: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">You feel yourself slipping towards doing something some part of you doesn&rsquo;t want to do. Say you are reneging on a previous commitment. As you give in to temptation, you remember to pause and really let the two sides of yourself communicate.</span></li>
<li>&middot;<span style=""font-variant-numeric: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">You think about doing something, but you feel aversive / flinch-y to it. As you shy away from the mental pain, rather than just quickly thinking about something else, you also feel curious as to why you feel that way. You query your brain and try to pick apart the &ldquo;ugh&rdquo; feeling,</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Two things seem key to the above scenarios:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One, each situation above involves taking an action that is different from our keyed-in defaults.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Two, the situation-reaction pair paradigm is pretty much CFAR&rsquo;s <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/o7c/making_intentions_concrete_triggeraction_planning/"">Trigger Action Plan</a>&nbsp;(TAP) model, paired with a multi-step plan.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Also, knowing about biases isn&rsquo;t enough to make good decisions. Even memorizing a mantra like &ldquo;Notice signs of aversion and query them!&rdquo; probably isn&rsquo;t going to be clear enough to be translated into something actionable. It sounds nice enough on the conceptual level, but when, in the moment, you remember such a mantra, you still need to figure out how to &ldquo;notice signs of aversion and query them&rdquo;.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">What we want is a series of explicit steps that turn the abstract mantra into small, actionable steps. Then, we want to quickly deploy the steps at the first sign of the situation we&rsquo;re looking out for, like a new cached response.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This looks like a problem that a combination of focused habit-building and a breakdown of the 5-second level can help solve.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In short, the goal looks to be to combine triggers with clear algorithms to quickly optimize in the moment. Reference class information from habit studies can also help give good estimates on how long the whole process will take to internalize (on average 66 days, according to <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.674/abstract"">Lally et al</a>)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But these Trigger Action Plan-type plans don&rsquo;t seem to directly cover the willpower related problems with akrasia.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sure, TAPs can help alert you to the presence of an internal problem, like in the above example where you notice aversion. And the actual internal conversation can probably be operationalized to some extent, like how CFAR has described the process of <a href=""/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">Double Crux.</a></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But most of the Overriding Default Habit actions seem to be ones I&rsquo;d be happy to do anytime&mdash;I just need a reminder&mdash;whereas akrasia-related problems are centrally related to me trying to debug my motivational system. For that reason, I think it helps to separate the two. Also, it makes the outside-seeming TAP algorithms complementary, rather than at odds, with the inside-seeming internal debugging techniques.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Loosely speaking, then, I think it still makes quite a bit of sense to divide the things rationality helps with into two categories:</p>
<ul style=""margin-top:0in"" type=""disc"">
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Overriding Default Habits:</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">These are the situation-reaction pairs I&rsquo;ve covered above. Here, you&rsquo;re substituting a modified action instead of your &ldquo;default action&rdquo;. But the cue serves as mainly a reminder/trigger. It&rsquo;s less about diagnosing internal disagreement.</p>
<ul style=""margin-top:0in"" type=""disc"">
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Akrasia / Willpower Problems:</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Here we&rsquo;re talking about problems that might require you to precommit (although precommitment might not be all you need to do), perhaps because of decision instability. The &ldquo;action-intention gap&rdquo; caused by akrasia, where you (sort of) want to something but you don&rsquo;t <em>want to</em> also goes in here.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Still, it&rsquo;s easy to point to lots of other things that fall in the bounds of rationality that my approach doesn&rsquo;t cover: epistemology, meta-levels, VNM rationality, and many other concepts are conspicuously absent. Part of this is because I&rsquo;ve been focusing on instrumental rationality, while a lot of those ideas are more in the epistemic camp.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ideas like meta-levels do seem to have some place in informing other ideas and skills. Even as declarative knowledge, they do chain together in a way that results in useful real world heuristics. &nbsp;Meta-levels, for example, can help you keep track of the ultimate direction in a conversation. Then, it can help you table conversations that don&rsquo;t seem immediately useful/relevant and not get sucked into the object-level discussion.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">At some point, useful information about how the world works should actually help you make better decisions in the real world. For an especially pragmatic approach, it may be useful to ask yourself, each time you learn something new, <strong>&ldquo;What do I see myself doing as a result of learning this information?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There&rsquo;s definitely more to mine from the related fields of learning theory, habits, and debiasing, but I think I&rsquo;ll have more than enough skills to practice if I just focus on the immediately practical ones.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">You know roughly what a fighting style is, right? A set of heuristics, skills, patterns made rote for trying to steer a fight into the places where your skills are useful, means of categorizing things to get a subset of the vast overload of information available to you to make the decisions you need, tendencies to prioritize certain kinds of opportunities, that fit together. Fighting isn't the only optimization problem where you see ""styles"" like this. Some of them are general enough that you can see them across many domains.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">Here are some examples:</p>

</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">Just as fighting styles are distinct from why you would fight, optimizing styles are distinct from what you value.<br /><br />In limited optimization domains like games, there is known to be a&nbsp;<a style=""box-shadow: currentcolor 0px 1px 0px 0px; color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/the-one-true-style"">one true style</a>.&nbsp;The style that is everything. The null style. Raw ""what is available and how can I exploit it"", with no preferred way for the game to play out.

<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">If you know probability and decision theory, you'll know there is a one true style for optimization in general too. All the other ways are fragments of it, and they derive their power from the degree to which they approximate it.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">Don't think this means it is irrational to favor an optimization style besides the null style. The ideal agent, may use the null style, but the ideal agent doesn't have skill or non-skill at things. As a bounded agent, you must take into account skill as a resource. And even if you've gained skills for irrational reasons, those are the resources you have.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">Don't think that since one of the optimization styles you feel motivated to use is explicit in the way it tries to be the one true style, that it is the one true style.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">It is very very easy to leave something crucial out of your explicitly-thought-out optimization. I assert that having done that is a possibility you must always consider if you're feeling divided, distinct from subagent value differences and subagent belief differences.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">Hour for hour, one of the most valuable things I've ever done was ""wasting my time"" watching a bunch of videos on the internet because I wanted to. The specific videos I wanted to watch were from the YouTube atheist community of old. ""Pwned"" videos, the vlogging equivalent of fisking. Debates over theism with Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. Very adversarial, not much of people trying to improve their own world-model through arguing. But I was fascinated. Eventually I came to notice how many of the&nbsp;<a style=""box-shadow: currentcolor 0px 1px 0px 0px; color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://sinceriously.fyi/?p=6"">arguments of my side</a>&nbsp;were terrible. And I gravitated towards vloggers who made less terrible arguments. This lead to me watching a lot of philosophy videos. And getting into philosophy of ethics. My pickiness about arguments grew. I began talking about ethical philosophy with all my friends. I wanted to know what everyone would do in the trolley problem. This led to me becoming a vegetarian, then a vegan. Then reading a forum about utilitarian philosophy led me to find the LessWrong sequences, and the most important&nbsp;<a style=""box-shadow: currentcolor 0px 1px 0px 0px; color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://intelligence.org/about/"">problem</a>&nbsp;in the world.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">It's not luck that this happened. When you have certain values and aptitudes, it's a predictable consequence of following long enough the joy of knowing something that feels like it deeply matters, that few other people know, the shocking novelty of ""how is everyone so wrong?"", the satisfying clarity of actually knowing why something is true or false with your own power, the intriguing dissonance of moral dilemmas and paradoxes...</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">It wasn't just curiosity as a pure detached value, predictably having a side effect good for my other values either.

<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">It turns out the optimal move was in fact ""learn things"".&nbsp;Specifically, ""learn how to think better"". And watching all those ""Pwned"" videos and following my curiosity from there was a way (for me) to actually do that, far better than lib arts classes in college.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px;"">I was not wise enough to calculate explicitly the value of learning to think better.

The bystanders don't have a knowledge of quantum physics - they can't tell who is the professor and who is the enthusiast since both appear to be able to talk fluently about the topics. All they can see is that one person is incredibly blunt and dismissive, while the other person is perfectly polite and engages with all the arguments raised.

This post is directed at you if you're also into the idea. If you're not, that's okay; I'd still like to give it a try.</p>
<p>A number of people in the comments mentioned that the Discussion forum mostly gets Link posts, these days, and that those aren't particularly rewarding. But there's also not a lot of people investing time in making quality text posts; certainly nothing like the 'old days'.</p>
<p>This also means that the volume of text posts is low enough that writing one (to me) feels like speaking up in a quiet room -- sort of embarrassingly ostentatious, amplified by the fact that without an 'ongoing conversation' it's hard to know what would be a good idea to speak up about. Some things aren't socially acceptable here (politics, social justice?); some things feel like they've been done so many times that there's not much useful to say (It feels hard to have anything novel to say about, say, increasing one's productivity, without some serious research.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I know the answer is probably 'post about anything you want', but it feels much easier to actually do that if there's some guidance or requests.)</p>
<p>So, here's the question: what would you like to see posts about?</p>
<p>I'm personally probably equipped to write about ideas in math, physics, and computer science, so if there are requests in those areas I might be able to help (I have some ideas that I'm stewing, also). I'm not sure what math level to write at, though, since there's no recent history of mathematically technical posts. Is it better to target ""people who probably took some math in college but always wished they knew more?"" or better to just be technical and risk missing lots of people?<br /><br />My personal requests:<br /><br />1. I really value surveys of subjects or subfields. They provide a lot of knowledge and understanding for little time invested, as a reader, and I suspect that as overviews are relatively easy to create as a writer since they don't have to go deep into details. Since they explain existing ideas instead of introduce new ones they're easier and less stressful to get right. If you have a subject you feel like you broadly understand the landscape of, I'd encourage you to write out a quick picture of it.<br /><br />For instance, u/JacobLiechty posted about ""Keganism"" in the thread I linked at the top of the post, and I don't know what that is but it sounds interconnected to many other things. But in many cases I can only learn so much by *going and reading the relevant material*, especially on philosophical ideas. What's more important is how it fits into ongoing conversations, or political groups, or social groups, or whatever. There's no efficient way for me to learn to understand the landscape of discussion around a concept that compares to having someone just explain it.<br />(I'll probably volunteer to do this in the near future for a couple of fields I pay attention to.)<br /><br />It's also (in my opinion) *totally okay* to do a mediocre job with these, especially if others can help fill in the gaps in the comments. Much better to try. A mostly-correct survey is still super useful compared to none at all. They don't have to be just academic subjects, either. I found u/gjm's explanation of what 'postrationalism' refers to in the aforementioned thread very useful, because it put a lot of mentions of the subject into a framework that I didn't have in place already -- and that was just describing a social phenomenon in the blog-sphere.<br /><br />2. I've seen expressed by others a desire to see more material about <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality#Instrumental_rationality"">instrumental rationality</a>, that is, implementing rationality 'IRL' in order to achieve goals. These can be general mindsets or ways of looking at the world, or in-the-moment techniques you can exercise (and ideally, practice). (<a href=""/r/discussion/lw/of7/actually_practicing_rationality_and_the_5second/"">Example</a>) If you've got personal anecdotes about successes (or failures) at implementing rational decision-making in real life, I'm certain that we'd like to hear about them.</p>",shev,shev,shev,

It assumes there is something worth talking about.</p>
<p>However I've been seeing ""rationality as winning"" bare of any context. I think the two things are in conflict.</p>
<p><a id=""more""></a>Let me take the old favourite of <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/"">the twelve virtues of rationality</a>&nbsp;as representative of the arts (although I could probably find similar situations where any proposed tool doesn't win). Can I find contexts in which humans will not win if they adopt these virtues?</p>
<p>1) Curiousity. There are lots of instances in history where curiousity may have killed you, cramping your winning. Wandering in the wrong part of town, trying out the wrong berry. Curiousity can also be not useful if most facts are boring or useless. I am happy to be ignorant of many facts about the world (who won various sports games, colour of peoples socks).</p>
<p>2&amp;3&amp;4) Relinquishment/lightness/evenness. You might avoid going see the evidence or disbelieve evidence presented by someone you suspect of being a clever charlatan. If you ""see"" a woman in box get cut in half you shouldn't automatically think that the magician can actually do magic. &nbsp;There is no magic data to evidence converter. See also <a href=""/lw/ig/i_defy_the_data/"">defying the data</a>.</p>
<p>5) Argument. &nbsp;This is not a useful virtue if you are alone on a desert island. It also might not be worth engaging with people who are trying to waste your time or distract you from something else. See also trolls.</p>
<p>6)<span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">&nbsp;Empiricism. This is great if you've got plenty of time. Collecting data always takes time and energy, if you need these things to survive, I wouldn't recommend empiricism.</span></p>
<p>7) Simplicity: Simplicity is predictable. If you involved in a contest with someone you may need to chose to be unpredictable in order to win.</p>
<p>8) Humbleness: This is a sign of weakness and may be exploited by your opponents in some social situations.</p>
<p>9 &amp; 10) Perfection &amp; Precision: There is an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good"">aphorism for this</a>. In social games you don't need to be perfect or infinitely precise just better or faster than your opponent. Anything more is wasted effort.</p>
<p>11) Scholarship: This doesn't make much sense for people on the poverty line.</p>
<p>That said:</p>
<p><strong>All the virtues makes sense when the context is trying to figure out something very hard &nbsp;and important with other people who are also trying to figure out the same thing and you've got a fair amount of time and resources, with no immediate threats to your lives. </strong></p>
<p>Which was the context of the people who were originally made the site, but if rationality is supposed to be a general recipe for winning, the art has to be contextualized away into pretty much nothing. What art covers working on your farm close to starvation and also trying to figure out artificial intelligence's impact on the world?</p>

<h2>Manipulation versus deception</h2>
<p>In the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1217"">previous post</a>, I mentioned that we may need to define clearly what an operator was, rather than relying on the pair: {simple description of a value correction event, physical setup around that event}. Can we define manipulation and deception without defining what an operator is?</p>
<p>For manipulation, it seems we can. Because manipulation is all about getting certain preferred outcomes. By specifying that the AI cannot aim to optimise certain outcomes, we can stop at least certain types of manipulations. Along with other more direct ways of achieving those outcomes.</p>
<p>For deception, the situation is much more complicated. It seems impossible to define how one agent can communicate to another agent (especially one as biased as a human), and increase the accuracy of the second agent, without defining the second agent properly. More confusingly, this doesn't even stop deception; sometimes lying to a bounded agent can increase their accuracy about the world.</p>
<p>There may be some ways to define deception or truth behaviourally, such as using a human as a crucial node in an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder"">autoencoder</a> between two AIs. But those definitions are dangerous, because the AI is incentivised to make the human behave in a certain way, rather than having them believe certain things. Manipulating the human or replacing them entirely is positively encourage.</p>
<p>In all, it seems that the problem of AI deception is vast and complicated, and should probably be separated from the issue of corrigibility.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

<p>The desiderata for <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/corrigibility/"">corrigibility</a> are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A corrigible agent tolerates, and preferably assists, its operators in their attempts to alter or shut down the agent.</strong></li>

<li>A corrigible agent preserves its corrigibility, even as it creates new sub-systems or sub-agents, even if it undergoes significant self-modification.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this post, I'll be looking at one aspect of points 1 and 3. I feel that they're actually pretty much the same point -- the AI has to act while preserving the corrigibility infrastructure.</p>
<p>A summary of the result will be:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>Without a formal definition of what an operator is, corrigibility is vulnerable to the AI replacing the operator with a fake version.</em></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1215"">warning in this post</a> should always be born in mind, of course; it's possible that we me might find a semi-formal version of operator that does the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Defining the operator or defining the event</h2>
<p>Typically the process of correction of values is defined <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2010-1.pdf"">physically</a>, as being the outcome of specific event (such as a button press, or a specific stochastic event triggered by or triggering a button press). This could also be defined by a digital event (receiving a certain encoded signal, or similar).</p>
<p>In all cases, the idea is the same: there is a very narrow and specific definition of the value correction event, and the physical or digital infrastructure surrounding it plays the role of ensuring the value corrections happen just as we intended. For instance, the physical event could be the button press (or a charge in a wire triggered by the button press) and the button itself could be in a room with an operator, with the operator keeping an eye on the AI and motivated to press the button under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>Such a setup is naturally vulnerable if the AI is motivated to manipulate the operator, or one of its subagents is. But even if we can solve points 2. and 4., there remains another vulnerability: the AI can choose to replace the operator with an artificial one (maybe a robot, maybe a second wire).</p>
<p>Why would the AI be so motivated? Well, for a start, it's indifferent to doing so. If the operator is not part of the definition of corrigibility, then having a human operator or a robot one <em>that does exactly the same thing</em>&nbsp;will be equivalent to the AI.</p>
<p>Now, there are frictions that might push against this. Replacing the operator might carry an expected cost. Or maybe the operator has private information that the AI wants to know, hence replacing them is a negative as the robot wouldn't have that information. And maybe the AI has a rough ""don't harm humans"" motive, that, while imperfect, at least prevents it from removing the operator in this circumstance.</p>
<p>But there may be motivations pushing the other way. For example, if a learning agent is <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1099"">unbiased</a> but not uninfluenceable, then it will be motivated to replace the operator with a robot with the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=860"">same expected outcome, but different variance</a>. Or maybe the operator has private information, but it's much more effective to have a robot read that info from their brain than to rely on the human to reveal that through their behaviour. Or maybe the AI is decently motivated to preserve the corrigibility infrastructure, and is aware of how mortal humans can be, so replacing them with a robot is the prudent thing to do.</p>
<p>All this stems from the fact that the operator is not well defined as part of the corrigibility infrastructure, but their position relies on physical facts about the world, along with a narrow definition of the correction of value event. To combat that, we'd need to define the operator properly, a very tricky challenge, or physically and cognitively secure them, or hope the AI learns early on not to not harm them.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

</ol>
<p>In this post, I'll be looking more at point 4. A summary of the result will be:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>Unless giving the AI extra options can reduce expected utility, the AI must care about every possible utility at least a bit.</em></p>
<p>Some of the results are formal, but the boundaries of the model are very unclear, so the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1215"">warning in this post</a> should always be born in mind.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href=""/lw/jxa/proper_value_learning_through_indifference/"">indifference agents</a> fail to be fully corrigible (they don't create corrigible subagents) and they also don't care about the other possible utilities before being changed (as this is a point of indifference).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Agents versus non-agents</h2>
<p>First I'll present a cleaner version of an <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/mrv/the_subagent_problem_is_really_hard/"">old argument</a>. Basically, it seems that defining what a sub-agent or sub-system is, is tricky or impossible.</p>
<p>Consider for instance a paperclip maximiser, that may get corriged into a staple maximiser at a later date. The AI has some income, and may buy a large proportion of shares in either General Paperclips (GP) or Staples United (SU). Assume the best way of promoting the use of one of the tools, it to take over the company that makes them.</p>
<p>There are two scenarios; in each scenario, the AI has one of two choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>In scenario 1, the AI has choice A: it buys stocks in GP, but cannot make further trades (in particular, it can't sell its stocks and buy others). It also has choice B: it retains flexibility, and can sell its GP stocks at some later date to buy stocks in SU.</li>
<li>In scenario 2, the AI delegates its investment decisions to a subagent. Under choice A, the subagent is a pure paperclip maximiser. Under choice B, the subagent is corrigible, and can be changed into a staple maximiser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly 1A and 2A are equivalent, while 1B and 2B are also equivalent. This trick can be extended: in most toy models, it's possible to replace a set of options with a choice of sub-agents, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Thus point 4, in the real world, cannot be merely about subagents and subsystems, but about <em>maintaining flexibility for its future decisions</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Burn the (rest of) the world</h2>
<p>Let's now consider giving the corrigible agent an option C: it gets slightly more shares in GP than otherwise. But, in exchange, SU is destroyed, along with most of the rest of the world. This is the highest option for paperclip maximalisation, but the absolutely worst option for staples and anything else.</p>
<p>Also assume that the AI's operators are virtually certain (99.9999...9% sure) to be changing it into a staple maximiser. This means that taking option C is dramatically worse that option B, from the perspective of expected utility.</p>
<p>But the AI will only prefer option B if it ""cares"" about staples, at least a little bit, from the very beginning (we've shown that there is no clear distinction between subagent and general actions, thus the agent has to have a general care for staples, rather than-only-caring-about-B-in-the-context-of-subagents).</p>
<p>Thus, if we want to avoid corrigible agents getting worse expected outcomes when we give them extra ""option Cs"", or if we just want to rule out ""option Cs"" in the first place, then the AI needs to care about staples (or any possible future utility), from the very beginning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Maintaining flexibility</h2>
<p>You could argue that what's important about the agent is maintaining flexibility, and that option B is flexible, while options A and C are not. Thus the agent doesn't need to care about staples in advance, just to have a general preference for flexibility.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem sufficient. Let's add another, flexible, option D, and put numbers on the whole thing. If U<sub>p</sub> is the paperclip maximising utility and U<sub>s</sub> is the staple maximising one, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option A: U<sub>p</sub>=100, U<sub>s</sub>=0</li>
<li>Option B: U<sub>p</sub>=100 or 0, U<sub>s</sub>=0 or 100</li>
<li>Option&nbsp;C: U<sub>p</sub>=101, U<sub>s</sub>=-1,000,000</li>
<li>Option&nbsp;D: U<sub>p</sub>=101 or 0, U<sub>s</sub>=-1,000,000 or -999,000</li>
</ul>
<p>The ""or"" denotes options the AI has kept open. Here D is the most flexible option, allowing the greatest range of outcomes in terms of value. Yet it's clearly a disaster for expected utility if changes from U<sub>p</sub> to U<sub>s</sub> are likely. If we want to rule out the AI choosing D, then we need it to actively value U<sub>s</sub> at least a bit, not just have a desire for flexibility.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

<p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543"">Logical induction</a> is defined in terms of logical sentences and theories, but its principles are applicable in much greater generality and abstraction. Indeed, one such generalization was studied under the name ""<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=941"">universal induction</a>."" We <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1197"">proposed</a> a slightly different generalization in order to model reasoning with incomplete models. Here, we describe a formalism that includes all these cases and many more, using the language of measure theory. This provides the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The formalism is applicable to event spaces substantially different from truth assignments or bit sequences, e.g. we can consider sequences of real numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formalism treats probabilities and expectations on the same footing, rather than constructing expectations as in section 4.8 of original paper. We consider this more convenient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In our opinion, this language is more mathematically natural than the original formalism, at least for applications unrelated to formal logic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, we ignore all computational considerations. Obviously these are often important, but in the study of purely information-theoretic questions the use of numerical approximations only serves to obscure.</p>
<p>All proofs are in the Appendix.</p>

I'm calling upon the powers of crowd-finding to clarify my views.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> is the debate in economics over the nature of money really about the definition or just over politics?</p>
<p>I'm currently reading ""Money - an unauthorised biography"" by Felix Martin. It presents what is to me a beautifully simple and elegant definition of what money is: transferable value over a liquid landscape (these precise words are mine). It also presents many cases where this simple view is contrasted by another view: money as a commodity. This opposition is not merely one of academics definitions, but has important consequences. Policy makers have adopted different points of view and have becuase of that varied very much their interventions.</p>
<p>I've never been much interested in the field, but this book sparked my curiosity, so I'm starting to look around and I'm surprised to discover that this debate is <em>still</em> alive and well in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Basically what I've glanced is that there is this Keynesian school of thougth that posits that yes, money is transferable debts, and since money is merely a technology that expresses an agreement, you should intervente in the matter of economics, especially by printing money when this is needed.</p>
<p>Then there's an opposite view (does it have a name?) that says that no, money is a commodity and for this reason it must be treated as such: it's creation is to be carefully controlled by the market and it's value tied only to the value of an underlying tradeable asset.</p>
<p>I think my uncertainty shows how little I know about this field, so apply Crocker's rule at will. Is this a not completely inaccurate model of the debate?</p>
<p>If it is so, my second question: is this a debate over substance or over politics?<br />If I think that money is transferable debts, surely I can recognize the merit of intervention but also understand that a liberal use of said tool might breed a disaster.<br />If I think that money is a standard commodity, can I manipulate which commodity it is exactly tied to to increase the availability of money in times of need?<br />Am I talking nonsense for some technical reason? Am I missing something big? Is economics the mind-killer too?</p>

I'm often posting a bunch of ideas and impossibility results, but it's important to remember that those results only apply within their models. And the models likely don't match up exactly with either reality or what we want/need.</p>
<p>For instance, we have the various <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice's_theorem"">no-free-lunch theorems</a> (any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems), or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice's_theorem"">Rice's theorem</a> (you can't figure out non-trivial semantic properties of every program).</p>
<p>These fail when we note that we have strong evidence that we live in a very specific environment and have to solve only a small class of problems; and that most programs we meet are (or can be) designed to be clear and understandable, rather than being selected at random.</p>
<p>Conversely, we can have results on <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=884"">how to use Oracles safely</a>. However, these results fall apart when you consider issues of <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Acausal_trade"">acausal trade</a>. The initial results still hold -- the design seems safe if multiple iterations of the AI don't care about each other's reward. However, the acausal trade example demonstrates that that assumption can fail in ways we didn't expect.</p>
<p>Both of these cases stem from misunderstanding the boundaries of the model. For the no-free-lunch theorem, we might be informally thinking ""of course we want the AI to be good at things <em>in general</em>"", without realising that this doesn't perfectly match up to ""good performance across every environment"". Because ""every environment"" includes weird, pathological, and highly random environments. Similarly, ""don't have the AIs care about each other's reward"" seems like something that could be achieved with simple programming and boxing approaches, but what we achieve is ""AIs that don't care about each other's rewards in the conventional human understanding of these terms"".</p>
<p>The boundary of the model did not lie where we thought it did.</p>

<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">Discussions on Less Wrong tend to end differently than in most other forums; a surprising number end when one participant changes their mind, or when multiple people clarify their views enough and reach agreement. More commonly, though, people will just stop when they've better identified their deeper disagreements, or simply&nbsp;<strong>""tap out"" of a discussion</strong>&nbsp;that's stopped being productive. (Seriously, you can just write ""I'm tapping out of this thread."") This is absolutely OK, and it's one good way to avoid the flamewars that plague many sites.</div>

<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>LW WIKI:</strong>&nbsp;This is our attempt to make searching by topic feasible, as well as to store information like&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Acronyms_used_on_Less_Wrong"">common abbreviations</a>&nbsp;and idioms.

<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>LW DISCUSSION:</strong>&nbsp;This is a forum just like the top-level one, with two key differences: in the top-level forum, posts require the author to have 20 karma in order to publish, and any upvotes or downvotes on the post are multiplied by 10. Thus there's a lot more informal dialogue in the Discussion section, including some of the more fun conversations here.</div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>SEQUENCES:</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<em>huge</em>&nbsp;corpus of material mostly written by Eliezer Yudkowsky in his days of blogging at Overcoming Bias, before Less Wrong was started. Much of the discussion here will casually depend on or refer to ideas brought up in those posts, so reading them can really help with present discussions.

<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">If you've come to Less Wrong to&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>discuss a particular topic</strong>, this thread would be a great place to start the conversation. By commenting here, and checking the responses, you'll probably get a good read on what, if anything, has already been said here on that topic, what's widely understood and what you might still need to take some time explaining.</div>

<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>If your welcome comment starts a huge discussion</strong>, then please move to the next step and&nbsp;<strong>create a LW Discussion post to continue the conversation</strong>; we can fit many more welcomes onto each thread if fewer of them sprout 400+ comments. (To do this: click ""Create new article"" in the upper right corner next to your username, then write the article, then at the bottom take the menu ""Post to"" and change it from ""Drafts"" to ""Less Wrong Discussion"". Then click ""Submit"". When you edit a published post, clicking ""Save and continue"" does correctly update the post.)</div>

<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>A note for theists</strong>: you will find the Less Wrong community to be predominantly atheist, though not completely so, and most of us are genuinely respectful of religious people who keep the usual community norms. It's worth saying that we might think religion is off-topic in some places where you think it's on-topic, so be thoughtful about where and how you start explicitly talking about it; some of us are happy to talk about religion, some of us aren't interested. Bear in mind that many of us really, truly have given full consideration to theistic claims and found them to be false, so starting with the most common arguments is pretty likely just to annoy people. Anyhow, it's absolutely OK to mention that you're religious in your welcome post and to invite a discussion there.</p>

<p>I also value compression and time in this sense, and so I think I can propose a subject that might serve as an ""ideal introduction"" (I have an accurate meaning for this phrase I won't introduce atm).<br /><br /><strong>I've read a lot of posts/blogs/papers that are arguments which are founded on a certain difficulties, where the observation and admission of this difficulty leads the author and the reader (and perhaps the originator of the problem/solution outlines) to defer to some form of a (relative to what will follow) long winded solution.<br /><br />I would like to suggest, as a blanket observation and proposal, that <em>most of these difficult problems described, especially on a site like this, are easily solvable with the introduction of an objective and ultra-stable metric for valuation.</em></strong><br /><br />I think maybe at first this will seem like an empty proposal.&nbsp; I think then, and also, some will see it as devilry (which I doubt anyone here thinks exists).&nbsp; And I think I will be accused of many of the fallacies and pitfalls that have already been previously warned about in the canons.<br /><br />That latter point I think might suggest that I might learn well and fast from this post as interested and helpful people can point me to specific articles and I WILL read them with sincere intent to understand them (so far they are very well written in the sense that I feel I understand them because they are simple enough) and I will ask questions.<br /><br />But I also think ultimately it will be shown that my proposal and my understanding of it doesn't really fall to any of these traps, and as I learn the canonical arguments I will be able to show how my proposal properly addresses them.</p>",Flinter,flinter,Flinter,
cLoYCxsRmpe4Lt36v,Tragedy of the free time commons,tragedy-of-the-free-time-commons,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cLoYCxsRmpe4Lt36v/tragedy-of-the-free-time-commons,2017-01-16T09:29:32.000Z,1,1,0,False,False,,"<p>Procrastination often seems a bit like an internal <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"">tragedy of the commons</a>.</p>
<p>In a tragedy of the commons, a group of people share something nice, like a shared pasture on which to raise their cows. If they together refrained from overusing it they would all benefit (e.g. because it doesn&#8217;t become a mud pit), but if any one person alone refrains (e.g. by having a smaller herd of cows), they expect to see little of the benefit themselves, and they probably expect someone else to use more resources (e.g. by adding an additional cow to another herd), so that there isn&#8217;t even a shared benefit to the group from the person&#8217;s selfless action.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a paper due on Friday, and it is going to take 60 minutes to finish it. Think of yourself over the preceding day as 960 you-minutes. Each you-minute would much prefer the paper be done than not done the following morning, but would somewhat prefer to not work on it themselves. Because these time-slices make their decisions about whether to work one after another, and know what decisions were made in the past, the final N you-minutes in the day will definitely work, if there are N minutes of paper left to write. This means for you-minutes where there are fewer minutes of paper left to write than you-minutes left who might write them, working doesn’t help—it just relieves a later you-minute of working which would otherwise be forced to. And that is certainly worse for the you-minute deciding. So the 60 minutes of writing is done in the last 60 minutes. Which doesn’t destroy any value in this model, so all is good.</p>
<p>But let’s make it more realistic. Suppose that there are better and worse times to work, and which are which is not known ahead of time. Working during a worse minute either produces less than a minute of work, or incurs other costs to the relevant you-minute (e.g. extra suffering). Then instead of everyone doing nothing until exactly sixty minutes before the deadline and then working full time after that, work becomes more worthwhile as you move toward the sixty minute mark, because it becomes increasingly likely that the bad minutes later will not be able to fulfill the work demanded of them. So relatively good you-minutes begin to work sometimes and then less good ones and then close to the deadline even the worst you-minutes work. The you-minutes still mostly work to avoid failing, they don’t mind much if they force bad you-minutes later to work, even if several of them have to work to get a minute’s worth of work done, or even if they endure private suffering as a result. So the early good minutes still don’t work much, and toward midnight many bad minutes work and suffer. This is more of a tragedy of the commons: most minutes freeride, because if they didn’t, someone else would. And all the free-riding causes massive costs.</p>
<p>I think this matches pretty well some elements of procrastination that I see.</p>
<p>This is more complicated than the most straightforward kind of tragedy of the commons—for instance, it involves sequential play—but I don&#8217;t know if there is a name this exact kind of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_in_game_theory"">game</a>.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/13697/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=13697&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

<p>Social meetups are informal get-togethers where we chat about topics of interest. They happen on the third Friday of each month.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN?</strong> Friday January 20, 18:30 until late. Don't worry about being on time, though - it's fine to rock up whenever.</p>

<p><strong>WHERE?</strong> The Bull &amp; Bear Tavern, on Flinders Lane (just a short walk from Flinders St Station).</p>

<p><strong>FOOD?</strong> The B&amp;B does reasonable pub food and we usually share a few plates of wedges. For those who stay late, we often go for a late night meal at around 11pm</p>

<p><strong>CONTACT?</strong> Any issues on the night, just call Richard on 0421231789</p></div>

I find it n</em><em>aive in hindsight.)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recall the following template:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some cases, human beings have evolved in such fashion as to think that they are doing X for prosocial reason Y, but when human beings actually do X, other adaptations execute to promote self-benefiting consequence Z.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I work in the sign industry, and it's worth knowing that the sign industry mostly involves printing images on cast sheets of polyvinyl chloride with adhesive on the back of it. This allows you to stick a graphic just about anywhere. Good-old-fashioned signs are now just a special case of vinyl application where the surface is a quadrilateral.</p>
<p>But sometimes, it seems like you could cut out the vinyl installation process: if you just wanted a solid white sign with some black text, and the substrate you're going to apply the vinyl to is already white, wouldn't it be nice if you could just print some black text directly on the substrate?</p>
<p>That's what a flatbed printer is for, which you can imagine as your standard HP desktop printer at 100x magnification with an unusually long air hockey table where the paper slot should be.</p>
<p>Now, when the management was trying to get the workforce excited about this new technological artifact, they would say things like, ""This new artifact will reduce the amount of time that you spend on vinyl application, leaving you less stressed and with a decreased workload.""</p>
<p>But when we actually started to use the artifact, our jobs didn't actually become less stressful, and our workloads didn't actually decrease.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, we could <em>technically</em>&nbsp;produce the same number of signs in less time, but a corollary of this statement is that we could produce more signs in the same amount of time, which is what we actually did.</p>
<p>So, I propose the subtemplate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Employer proposes the introduction of technological artifact X, ostensibly to reduce physical or cognitive demands, but when the employer actually introduces technological artifact X, they realize it can be used to increase output and do that instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if anyone else has more examples?</p>",Gram_Stone,gram_stone,Gram_Stone,

This week's theme will be 80.000hours, which is an EA-affiliated research group in Oxford that is figuring out for us how to do the most possible good with your career.
Spoiler: you can matter a lot, but it's counterintuitive. Are you studying to become a doctor to save lives? You will on average save 3 lives over your career. If you become a Google employee instead, and give half of your income to charity, you might save 2000.
If you plan to come, you are kindly requested to read up on 80k's career guide (<a href=""https://80000hours.org/career-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://80000hours.org/career-guide/</a>). Buckle up though: it can be quite a life-changing read.</p></div>

And if the results depend on assumptions, I may as well fit a full consequential model with continuous interdependent parameters and the appropriate prior.</p>

<p>As the astonished cook reaches for the salted mango, the crazy person starts doing mental math.</p>
<p><em> 200,000 combinations and we have 6 categories, so the average number of items in each category must be the 6th root of 200,000, or the cube root of the square root of 200,000. The square root of every even power of 10 is easy, i.e. √10,000 = 100. We&#8217;ll break 200,000 into 10,000*20. 20 is between 16 and 25 so the square root of 20 is ~4.5. This means that √200,000 ≈ 100*4.5 = 450. OK, I need the cube root of 450. Do I remember any cubes? 10<sup>3</sup>=1,000, that&#8217;s too much. 8<sup>3</sup>=2<sup>9</sup>=512, bingo! The sixth root of 200,000 is the cube root of 450 is just below 8, so there should be 7-8 combinations on (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean"" target=""_blank"">geometric</a>) average in each category. </em>(The actual answer turns out to be 7.65).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how I do math quickly in my head. I remember a few basic facts (like powers of 2 up to 1,024) and a few basic rules (like (<i> a<sup> m</sup> </i>) <i><sup>n</sup> =  a <sup>m</sup><sup>n</sup></i>). I can get an approximate answer in my head to almost any calculation including roots, logarithms and exponents faster than I can pull out my phone. I taught a workshop training my MBA classmates to do this before consulting interviews. One Chinese girl was so impressed by this workshop that she dated me for a month even though she&#8217;s a straight 10 and I&#8217;m a 6.5 if I get a good haircut.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to poke: 200,000 options is obviously way too low. The average number <em>is </em>close to 7 or 8, but several of the categories allow you to pick more than one item. For example, you can create 16 combinations of <em>toppings</em> by choosing to include or exclude any of the four toppings available. As for <em>add-ins</em>, being able to pick 6 out of 13 involves the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"" target=""_blank"">combination function</a>, and the combination function has factorials in it so you know it means business. By the time my bowl was done, I estimated that Koshe Poke are underselling themselves by at least two orders of magnitude. It turns out they&#8217;re off by a factor of 3,500:</p>

do9kPvGWLtvQNp8yu,Fear or fear?,fear-or-fear,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/do9kPvGWLtvQNp8yu/fear-or-fear,2017-01-12T03:49:01.000Z,1,0,0,False,False,,"<p class=""p1"">I <a href=""https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/want-like-want-want/"">wrote recently</a> about how people tend to use the same words—and sometimes concepts—for &#8216;want&#8217; as in &#8216;yearn for&#8217; and &#8216;want&#8217; as in &#8216;intend&#8217;. As in, &#8216;It&#8217;s so lovely here I want to stay forever&#8217;, yet &#8216;I want leave before midnight, because otherwise I will miss my train&#8217;. And the trouble this causes.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I think we do something similar with fear. <span class=""s1"">‘I’m concerned that X’ can mean ‘I feel fear about the possibility of X’ or it can mean ‘I think X (which would be bad) might be true’. I&#8217;m not sure which words naturally distinguish these two different messages, but whatever they are, I don&#8217;t seem to use them. </span><span class=""s1"">For instance, what would avoid ambiguity in this sentence? &#8216;I &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. that not enough people are going to vote&#8217;. I can think of several ways to fill the slot: worry, fear, am concerned, am scared, am frightened, am anxious. But I think they can either be used in both ways, or suggest a more specific kind of feeling.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The ambiguity of these words is especially noticeable if one has unusual levels of anxiety (for instance because of an anxiety disorder, or I suppose because a relaxation disorder). If you try to express a different one to that which people expect, it becomes clear that interpreting such a statement relies on on context.</span><span class=""s1""> If you are known to usually be anxious, and you say ‘I fear our shoe rack is not large enough for all of our shoes’ you will be misunderstood to mean ‘my heart is pounding and I can’t breathe or think because of this shoe rack’ when you might be more accurately interpreted as, ‘I feel no emotions about the shoe rack, but may I draw your attention to a problem with it?’.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">I don&#8217;t know if this causes problems, like the &#8216;want&#8217; case. It is almost the opposite—you are mixing up &#8216;I have an urge to avoid this thing&#8217; with &#8216;I judge there to be a problem here&#8217;. So you might expect it to go wrong in an analogous way: we feel fear regarding things, and then jump to expensively avoiding them without taking the other stakes into consideration.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It is certainly true that people behave in this way sometimes. For instance, once I was putting a golden necklace on in a dark car, and when I touched my hands to my neck I found a giant hairy spider on it. I jumped to expensively avoiding the spider in every sense, and did not find the necklace again. My mistake was neglecting to take into account the value of the necklace to me alongside my aversion to having a spider on my neck. I think there are more drawn out examples too. However I am not sure I have ever seen someone behave in this way due to confusion in the use of concepts, whereas with &#8216;want&#8217; I think I have.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I wonder if more generally people often just use the same words for both ‘I have emotion Y about X’ and ‘my considered attitude toward X is the same as the one I might have if I had emotion Y’.  &#8216;I regret&#8230;&#8217;, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8217;, &#8216;I hope&#8217;, and &#8216;I trust&#8217;, seem arguably like this too, but I&#8217;m not sure about others.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As I said before, I’m inclined to infer from the fact that people don’t really have good language to distinguish two things that they haven’t historically distinguished the things much. In this case for instance, I suppose that people have mostly treated feeling fear as identical to having the considered position that a thing is risky. This sort of thing would make sense in the design of a creature whose emotions basically track all of the relevant considerations. Or at least as many relevant considerations as any other part of its brain might usefully track. My guess is that we used to be much more like this for various reasons, and now are less so.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">In the case of fear, perhaps we used to be in situations where our natural terror regarding aggressive animals for instance directed us well, whereas now we just tend to be too scared of snakes and sharks and not scared enough about heart disease or cars. At the same time, our intellectual faculties have grown into elaborate science and technology that can usefully track things like heart disease and build things like cars.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I have long thought that people often almost accidentally take their feelings to be their considered positions, without having an extra step of considering them. I take this as a bit more evidence, but it is also possible that my earlier theory just made this kind of  observation stand out, and there are lots of observations in the world to observe.</span></p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/"" /></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meteuphoric.wordpress.com/12561/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=meteuphoric.wordpress.com&#038;blog=8643840&#038;post=12561&#038;subd=meteuphoric&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",KatjaGrace,katjagrace,KatjaGrace,

<p>In short, and at a high level, the problem of thin priors is to
understand how an agent can learn logical facts and make use of them in
its predictions, without setting up a reflective instability across
time. Before the agent knows the fact, it is required by logical
uncertainty to “care about” worlds where the fact does not hold; after
it learns the fact, it might no longer care about those worlds; so the
ignorant agent has different goals than the knowing agent. This problem
points at a hole in our basic understanding, namely how to update on
logical facts; logical induction solves much of logical uncertainty, but
doesn’t clarify how to update on computations, since many logical facts
are learned “behind the scenes” by traders.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>The ideas in this post seem to have been discussed for some time.
Jessica brought them up in a crisper form in a conversation a while go
with me, and also came up with the name; this post is largely based on
ideas in that conversation and some subsequent ones with other people,
possibly refined / reframed.</p>
<h2>Background / Motivation</h2>
<p>It would be nice to have a reflectively stable decision theory (i.e. a
decision theory that largely endorses itself to continue making
decisions over other potential targets of self-modification); this the
most basic version of averting / containing instrumental goals, which is
arguably necessary in some form to make a safe agent. Agents that choose
policies using beliefs that have been updated on (logical) observations
seem to be unstable, presenting an obstacle. More specifically, we have
the following line of reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Updating on empirical evidence leads to reflective instability</strong>.

<p><strong>This can’t obviously be neatly factored into uncertainty about the
world and a utility function and dealt with separately.</strong> That is,
it isn’t (obviously) possible to coherently have a utility function
that “only cares about real worlds”, while capturing all of the
“free-parameter value judgements” that the agent has to make, and
have the agent just be uncertain about which worlds are real.</p>
<p>The issue, in the empirical realm, is that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span>’s observations are

tradeoffs between influencing different possible worlds. This
usually comes in the form of a “simplicity prior”—a prior
probability over worlds that is very non-dogmatic. Whether this is
expressed as utility differences or probability differences, this
“caring measure” on worlds changes in <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<li>
<p><strong>The above line of reasoning can be repeated with logical evidence
in place of empirical evidence…</strong> We have logical observations, i.e.
the results of computations, in place of empirical observations; we
have logical uncertainty (forced by computational boundedness) in
place of empirical uncertainty (forced by limited observational
data); therefore agents have a caring measure that incorporates
logical uncertainty (i.e. that places positive caring on logically
inconsistent worlds); so agents that update on logical facts have a
changing caring measure and are reflectively unstable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>…but it’s not clear how to be updateless with respect to
logical facts.</strong> This is one construal of the open problem of thin
logical priors: define a computable prior over logical facts or
counterfactuals that has reasonable decision-theoretic
counterfactual beliefs, but “only knows a fixed set of logical
facts” in the sense relevant to logical updatelessness. More
broadly, we might ask for some computable object that can be used as
a general world model, but doesn’t imply (non-analyzable) conflict
between differently informed instances of the same agent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we could write down a prior over logical statements that was thin
enough to be computable, but rich enough to be useful for selecting
policies (which may depend on or imply further computations), then we
might be able write down a reflectively stable agent.</p>
<h2>Problem statement</h2>
<h1>Desiderata</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Updateless.</strong> The prior should be “easy enough” to compute that it
can be used as an updateless prior as described above. That is, in
the course of being refined by thinking longer (but without
explicitly conditioning on any logical facts), the prior should not
incorporate any additional logical facts. A prior “incorporates a
logical fact” (by being computed to more precision) when it starts
penalizing worlds for not satisfying that logical fact.
Incorporating logical facts is bad because it sets up a dynamic
inconsistency across versions of the agent learning the fact.</p>
<p>We could weaken this desideratum to allow the prior to be
“updateless enough”, where enough is perhaps judged by reflective
stability of the resulting agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knows consequences of policies.</strong> The prior is supposed to be
useful as the beliefs that generate a system
of action-counterfactuals. So the prior had better know, in some
sense, what the consequences of different policies are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can learn from computations.</strong> Since the world is complicated
[citation needed], the agent will have to take advantage of more
time to think by updating on results of computations (aka
logical facts). Thus a thin prior should, at least implicitly, be
able to take advantage of the logical information available given
arbitrarily large amounts of computing time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thin, not small.</strong> I think that Paul has suggested something like
a “small” prior: a finite belief state that is computed once, and
then used to decide what computations to run next (and those
computations decide what to do after that, and so on). This is also
roughly the idea of <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1073"">Son
of X</a>.</p>
<p>A small-prior agent is probably reflectively stable in a somewhat
trivial sense. In particular, this doesn’t immediately look useful
in terms of analyzing the agent in a way that lets us say more
specific things about its behavior, stably over time; all we can say
is “the agent does whatever was considered optimal at that one point
in time”. A thin prior would hopefully be more specific, so that a
stably-comprehensible agent design could use the prior as
its beliefs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a small prior that knows enough to be able to
learn from future computations, and that we understand well enough
for alignment purposes, should qualify.</p>
</li>

<p>Although universal Garrabrant inductors don’t explicitly refer to
logic in any way (and hence are perhaps more amenable to further
analysis than logical inductors), UGIs do in fact update on logical

<li>
<p>Asking for a thin prior might not be carving decision theory at
the joints. In particular, because counterfactuals may be partially
subjective (in the same what that probability and utility is
partially subjective), the notion of a good thin prior might be
partially dependent on subjective human judgments, and so not
amenable to math.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This problem seems philosophically appealing; how can you meta-think
without doing any actual thinking?</p>
<p>In classical probability, if we have some space and some information
about where we are in the space, we can ask: what belief state
incorporates all the given information, but doesn’t add any
additional information (which would be unjustified)? The answer is
the maximum entropy prior. In the realm of logical uncertainty, we
want to ask something like: what belief state incorporates all the
given logical information (results of computations), but doesn’t add
any “logical information”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is ok for the thin prior to have some logical information “built
in” at the outset. The agent won’t be counterfactually mugged using
those logical facts, but that is fine. The problem is learning new
facts, which creates a reflective instability.</p>

<p>When I was smaller, I was sitting at home watching <a style=""font-style: italic;"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mummy_(1999_film)"">The Mummy</a>,&nbsp;with my mother, ironically enough. There's a character by the name of Bernard Burns, and you only need to know two things about him. The first thing you need to know is that the titular antagonist steals his eyes and tongue because, hey, eyes and tongues spoil after a while you know, and it's been three thousand years.</p>
<p>The second thing is that Bernard Burns was the <em>spitting image</em> of my father. I was terrified!&nbsp;I imagined my father, lost and alone, certain that he would die, unable to see, unable even to properly scream!</p>
<p>After this frightening ordeal, I had the conversation in which it is revealed that fiction is not reality, that actions in movies don't really have consequences, that apparent consequences are merely imagined and portrayed.</p>
<p>Of course I knew this on <em>some</em>&nbsp;level. I think the difference between the way children and adults experience fiction is a matter of degree and not kind. And when you're an adult, suppressing those automatic responses to fiction has itself become so automatic, that you experience fiction as a thing compartmentalized. You always know that the description of consequences in the fiction will not by magic have fire breathed into them, that Imhotep cannot gently step out of the frame and really remove your real father's real eyes.</p>
<p>So, even though we often use fiction to engage, to make things feel <em>more</em> real, in another way, once we grow, I think fiction gives us the chance to entertain formidable ideas at a comfortable distance.</p>
<p>A great user <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/ngc/tonic_judo/d7t4"">once said</a>, ""Vague anxieties are powerful anxieties."" Related to this is the simple rationality technique of Leaving a Line of Retreat: before evaluating the plausibility of a highly cherished or deeply frightening belief, one visualizes the consequences of the highly cherished belief being false, or of the deeply frightening belief being true. We hope that it will thereby become just a <em>little</em> easier to evaluate the plausibility of that belief, for if we are wrong, at least we know what we're doing about it. Sometimes, if not often, what you'd <em>really</em>&nbsp;do about it isn't as bad as your intuitions would have you think.</p>
<p>If I had to put my finger on the source of that technique's power, I would name its ability to <em>reduce the perceived hedonic costs of truthseeking</em>. It's hard to estimate the plausibility of a charged idea because you expect your undesired outcome to feel&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;bad, and we naturally avoid this. The trick is in realizing that, in any given situation, you have almost certainly overestimated how bad it would&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;feel.</p>
<p>But Sun Tzu didn't just plan his own retreats; he also planned his enemies' retreats. What if your interlocutor has not practiced the rationality technique of Leaving a Line of Retreat? Well, Sun Tzu might say, ""Leave one <em>for</em> them.""</p>
<p>As I noted in the beginning, adults automatically compartmentalize fiction away from reality. It is simply&nbsp;<em>easier</em>&nbsp;for me to watch <em>The Mummy</em>&nbsp;than it was when I was eight. The formidable idea of my father having his eyes and tongue removed is easier to hold at a distance.</p>
<p>Thus, I hypothesize, truth in fiction is hedonically cheap to seek.</p>
<p>When you recite the Litany of Gendlin, you do so because it makes seemingly bad things seem less bad. I propose that the idea generalizes: when you're experiencing fiction, <em>everything</em>&nbsp;seems less bad than its conceivably real counterpart, it's stuck inside the book, and any ideas within will then seem less formidable. The idea is that you can use fiction as an implicit line of retreat, that you can use it to make <em>anything</em>&nbsp;seem less bad by making it make-believe, and thus, safe. The key, though, is that not everything inside of fiction is stuck inside of fiction forever. Sometimes conclusions that are valid in fiction also turn out to be valid in reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is hard to use on yourself, because you can't make a real scary idea into fiction, or shoehorn your scary idea into existing fiction, and then make it feel far away. You'll know where the fiction came from. But I think it works well on&nbsp;<em>others</em>.</p>
<p>I don't think I can really get the point across in the way that I'd like without an example. This proposed technique was an accidental discovery, like popsicles or the Slinky:</p>
<p>A history student friend of mine was playing <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas"">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, and he wanted to talk to me about which ending he should choose. The conversation seemed mostly optimized for entertaining one another, and, hoping not to disappoint, I tried to intertwine my fictional ramblings with bona fide insights. The student was considering giving power to a democratic government, but he didn't feel very good about it, mostly because this fictional democracy was meant to represent anything that anyone has ever said is wrong with at least one democracy, plausible or not.</p>
<p>""The question you have to ask yourself,"" I proposed to the student, ""is 'Do I value democracy because it is a good system, or do I value democracy&nbsp;<em>per se</em>?' A lot of people will admit that they value democracy&nbsp;<em>per se</em>. But that seems wrong to me. That means that if someone showed you a better system that you could&nbsp;<em>verify</em>&nbsp;was better, you would say 'This is good governance, but the purpose of government is not good governance, the purpose of government is democracy.' I do, however, understand democracy as a 'current best bet' or local maximum.""</p>
<p>I have in fact gotten wide-eyed stares for saying things like that, even granting the closing ethical injunction on democracy as local maximum. I find that unusual, because it seems like one of the first steps you would take towards thinking about politics clearly, to not equivocate democracy with good governance. If you were further in the past and the fashionable political system were not democracy but monarchy, and you, like many others, consider democracy preferable to monarchy, then upon a future human revealing to you the notion of a modern democracy, you would find yourself saying, regrettably, ""This is good governance, but the purpose of government is not good governance, the purpose of government is monarchy.""</p>
<p>But because we were arguing for <em>fictional </em>governments, our autocracies, or monarchies, or whatever non-democratic governments heretofore unseen, could not by magic have fire breathed into them. For me to entertain the idea of a non-democratic government <em>in reality</em>&nbsp;would have solicited incredulous stares. For me to entertain the idea in fiction is good conversation.</p>
<p>The student is one of two people with whom I've had this precise conversation, and I do mean in the particular sense of ""Which <em>Fallout </em>ending do I pick?"" I snuck this opinion into both, and both came back weeks later to tell me that they spent a lot of time thinking about that particular part of the conversation, and that the opinion I shared <a href=""/lw/k8/how_to_seem_and_be_deep/"">seemed deep</a>.</p>
<p>Also, one of them told me that they had recently received some incredulous stares.</p>
<p>So I <em>think</em>&nbsp;this works, at least sometimes. It looks like you can sneak scary ideas into fiction, and make them seem just non-scary enough for someone to arrive at an accurate belief about that scary idea.</p>
<p>I do wonder though, if you could generalize this even more. How else could you <em>reduce the perceived hedonic costs of truthseeking</em>?</p>",Gram_Stone,gram_stone,Gram_Stone,

<p class=""p1"">“Ok, I’ll buy one for you”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Oh, I don’t mean that on consideration I endorse purchasing one—I’m just expressing my urge to to eat a donut.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">There are two meanings of ‘want’ in common usage. A feeling of desire, and an endorsed intention. ‘I want a baby tiger!’ is not analogous to ‘I want to work more on my taxes tonight’.</p>
<p class=""p1"">These ‘want’s are basically the input of a decision process and the output. I feel desire for a baby tiger and utter ‘I want it!’, and my brain considers that desire plus some other stuff about baby tigers and my life, and decides that on reflection I do not intend to acquire one. On the other hand, I feel no positive attraction toward my taxes at all, yet my aversion to prison and lawyers and generally being disagreeable in any way, once fed through my decision process leave me ‘wanting’ to work on them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It is hard to be confused about the baby tiger and tax cases, but other times I think this leads to genuine confusion. The donut case above was a genuine confusion, but one of no importance. I think it leads to more important genuine confusions when one talks to oneself, and lacks two distinct concepts.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Luckily I waited ages before writing this blog post, and so came across David Wong of Cracked talking about something similar, as the #1 <em><a href=""http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-ways-youre-sabotaging-your-own-life-without-knowing-it_p2/"">Way you are sabotaging your own life (without knowing it)</a></em>, which I&#8217;ll just quote here in full (the section, not the whole post, though I don&#8217;t agree with all of)<em>:</em></p>

<h5 class=""subheading"">#1. Lying to Yourself About What You Actually Want</h5>

<p>Off the top of your head, say something you&#8217;ve always wanted to do. Then, follow it up with why you&#8217;ve never done it.</p>
<p>So, maybe you said something like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to start a little business selling cupcakes! But I wouldn&#8217;t even know how to get started!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aaaaand &#8230; 90 percent of you just lied.</p>
<p>I know you did, because if you actually <em>wanted</em> to do the thing, then the second part &#8212; the obstacle &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t exist. For example, if that person up there actually <em>wanted</em> to start their cupcake business, they wouldn&#8217;t be confused about how to get started. They&#8217;d be a freaking walking encyclopedia of information about how to get started, because they&#8217;d have spent every single day reading up on it and calling other cupcake-shop owners for advice. They don&#8217;t do that because they don&#8217;t actually want it. They don&#8217;t have the invisible gun to their head.</p>

<span style=""font-size:xx-small;"">&#8220;The cupcake is a lie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>This, right here, is at the heart of every unfulfilled ambition in your life. We use the same word &#8212; &#8220;want&#8221; &#8212; to mean two completely different things, and the constant confusion between those definitions is why so many people are disappointed in how their lives turned out. Depending on the context, &#8220;want&#8221; can be:</p>
<p>A) A statement of intended action (&#8220;I want to mow the lawn before it rains.&#8221;)</p>
<p>B) A statement of general preference (&#8220;I want everyone to live a long and happy life.&#8221;)</p>
<p>It sounds simple enough, but the confusion of those two uses of the word is <em>everything</em>. We switch between the two definitions sometimes in the same sentence. This morning, I was driving to Five Guys to get a burger and an entire grocery bag full of french fries to go with it (that is, the &#8220;small&#8221;). I passed a guy who was jogging, shirtless, who had a torso like Matthew McConaughey. I said to myself, &#8220;I want a body like that!&#8221; And, if I&#8217;d pulled over and asked the guy why he runs and works out, he&#8217;d have said the same thing, almost word-for-word &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s because I want a body like this!&#8221;</p>
<p>Same phrasing, meaning two completely different things. I used &#8220;want&#8221; in the same way I say I want world peace &#8212; a wistful statement about something I actually have no control over. If it&#8217;s the same effort either way, sure, I&#8217;ll take the rock-hard abs &#8212; give me an ab pill and I&#8217;ll swallow it. Otherwise, no, it ain&#8217;t happening. That jogging guy, on the other hand, used &#8220;want&#8221; as a statement of intended action &#8212; he &#8220;wants&#8221; to run five miles every day because he &#8220;wants&#8221; to be fit.</p>
<p align=""center""><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/s3.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/1/3/6/305136_v1.jpg"" width=""350"" height=""233"" /><br />

<span style=""font-size:xx-small;"">&#8220;Also because there&#8217;s a guy with a gun pointed at me. Please, call the police.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Now look around you &#8212; look at all of the minimum-wage people who &#8220;want&#8221; to be rich and/or famous, with some vague notion of, I don&#8217;t know, being on a reality show some day or getting &#8220;discovered&#8221; for some talent they didn&#8217;t know they had. Now look at all of the MBAs working 100-hour weeks on the trading floor because they &#8220;want&#8221; to be rich. The difference in the two is night and day, but in many cases the former group <em>doesn&#8217;t realize it</em>. They just stay poor while the other group starts shopping for vacation homes.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m starting to think that the world really is divided between those who have a clear idea of what it means to want something &#8212; including the total cost and sacrifices it will take to get it &#8212; and those who are just content to leave it as an airy &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be nice&#8221; fantasy. The former group hones in on what they want and goes zooming after it like a shark. The latter looks at them, shakes their head and says, &#8220;<em>How do they do it</em>?&#8221; As if they have a cheat code, or a secret technique.</p>
<p align=""center""><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/s3.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/1/3/8/305138_v1.jpg"" width=""350"" height=""250"" /><br />

<span style=""font-size:xx-small;"">&#8220;That son of bitch and his Konami code.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What, you&#8217;re saying we should all be douchebag stockbrokers working hundred-hour weeks?&#8221; <em>No.</em> I&#8217;m saying that while some of you are sitting around the coffee shop talking about how you &#8220;want&#8221; the system to change, that douchebag is accumulating money so he can <em>actually</em> run for congress. Because when he &#8220;wants&#8221; something, he doesn&#8217;t sing a song about it. He prices that shit and makes a down payment. And when that relentless BMW-driving douche has kids, he&#8217;ll teach them, too, what it really means to &#8220;want&#8221; something &#8212; to be single-minded, and voracious, and to pursue it to the ends of the Earth. Instilling that lesson goes just as far toward preserving wealth and power in a group as the actual inheritance they&#8217;ll leave behind.</p>
<p>Are you scared of those people? Are you imagining them as cold-blooded stock brokers and lobbyists and swindlers, the <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> types who are eating away at the world like a cancer? Well, they scare you because it&#8217;s a glimpse at what accomplishing great things actually <em>costs</em>. You know Steve Jobs <a href=""http://www.cultofmac.com/126245/steve-jobs-the-world-class-asshole-who-dented-the-universe-walter-isaacson-biography-review/"" target=""a"">was a fucking psychopath</a>, right? So the next time somebody asks you if you want to be rich, really stop and think about it. Think about what it will take. Think about what kind of person you&#8217;ll need to become.</p>

<span style=""font-size:xx-small;"">&#8220;I would literally make them from the blood of orphans if it could save me five cents on the per-unit cost.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the point of all this &#8212; I&#8217;ve found, as time goes on, that everybody gets what they want. Not what they <em>say</em> they want in order to make themselves look good to others, or what they tell themselves they want so they feel better about the current state of their life. No, I&#8217;m talking about what they <em>really </em>want. And to find out what they really want, you don&#8217;t need to ask them. You just need to look at what they did <em>today</em>. You want to change, start there.</p></blockquote>
<p class=""p1"">He has a more complicated thesis, and is saying things I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with, but his central point is that mistaking one kind of &#8216;want&#8217; for another is something like the number one way you are messing up your life, which suggests that he considers it an important confusion.</p>
<p class=""p1"">He thinks it is related to the strange discrepancy between our imagined prospects in five years, and what we do right now. You say to yourself ‘I want to be a classical guitarist’—and it arises as an idle positive urge toward playing classical guitar, which arises due to letting your mind wander while listening to classical guitar one time. Then you just kind of figure that you do in fact want to, but don’t know how to right now or there are some obstacles or something, and hopefully you’ll figure it out in the vague future and probably one day be a great classical guitarist.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I claim that part of what is going on here is that you are observing your urge to play classical guitar, and thinking of it as ‘I want to play classical guitar’. Then you fail to distinguish this input to a decision from an actual decision. So either you sign up for a classical guitar class, but feel kind of bad about it and like you have too many things going on in your life, or you say to yourself that you want to, but you don’t, and you figure there is something wrong with you.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So maybe you ask yourself, ‘do I really want to play classical guitar?’ and you look inside your heart and see that you do really feel warmly about playing classical guitar, and you don’t notice that that is the answer to a different question than the one that is relevant to whether you should play classical guitar. You are checking that the input really is ‘classical guitar is nice’, rather than that the output really is ‘learning to play classical guitar is what I want on net, given the costs, and that it is nice’.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In some sense, if you fail to distinguish the input to your decision from the output, and confusedly use the input where you would rationally use the output, you are in fact correct that they are the same. It’s just that you are missing out on making a decision where you could benefit from doing so. Like, if you mistakenly treat ‘potato chips taste delicious’ as logically identical to ‘I endorse eating potato chips’ because you call them both “I want to eat potato chips!”, then you are missing out on a great chance to take into account considerations other than the flavor of potato chips in your diet, some of which may be important to you.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I have seen myself making this error. I remember it happening when I&#8217;m mostly thinking about something else, but idly appreciating something in my surrounds. For instance, I&#8217;m likely to see a cool startup and think &#8216;mmm, yeah I should have a startup&#8217; or see a nice blouse and think &#8216;ooh, I should get a blouse like that&#8217;. And if I was really thinking about the issue, I would remember that things have costs, but if I&#8217;m not then the part of my brain that says &#8216;ooh&#8217; at stuff also registers them as tentative decisions. I go away assuming that I now intend some day to have a cool startup.</p>
<p class=""p1""><b></b>This seems to parallel other useful distinctions I have seen people talk about in recent history. ‘Impressions’ and ‘beliefs’, and ‘what words are being said in my head’ versus ‘what I believe and stand for’ for instance. These are similarly inputs and outputs of decision processes, and by naming them as such, we can remember to actually stick a decision process between them. Much like if we label ‘raw pasta’ and ‘cooked pasta’ different things, it is easier to notice that cooking is an important step, and we are less likely to end up with pasta that is weirdly ill suited to being eaten half the time. Instead of just citing our impressions as beliefs, and then arguing with other people, or being confused that our ‘beliefs’ aren’t updating when other people tell us theirs (and we can tell they aren’t, by checking our impressions), we can just have some impressions and then consider them when deciding what we believe. To me these distinctions sound so obvious in retrospect that it is weird to even hypothesize that a moment ago you might not have made them. But relatedly, I think pointing them out has been pretty useful.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I’m not sure why we don’t make clear conceptual distinctions in these cases. Perhaps <a href=""https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2016/11/15/unifying-stuff-is-hard/"">making distinctions is just hard</a>. I think maybe these things are not so obvious because we didn’t always do so much intelligent decision-making. Presumably in goodest oldest days, ‘this food tastes good’ was closer in meaning to ‘I have decided to eat this food’ and ‘I feel like this plan is going to fail’ was closer in meaning to ‘this plan is probably going to fail’, and it is only later that considerations like health at age fifty and outside view evidence became sufficiently worth manually adding to one’s decision calculus to bother having a decision calculus to add them to, beyond unreflective feelings and intuitions.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Wong’s post also discusses people’s failure to connect their plans with the costs of those plans. They plan to learn the classical guitar, but don’t think of themselves as ‘planning to learn the classical guitar instead of spending so much time with their friends’ or ‘planning to learn the classical guitar instead of spending one of their two daily outside-of-work intentional-action-slots on reading’ or whatever the bottleneck may be. I don’t think he explicitly connects the two, though he clearly thinks they are part of a larger related structure. They are at least related in that people are wrong about what they want in part because they are not considering the costs. In his story, he wants to be fit, but only if he completely ignores the costs. Which is to say, if he just checks whether he likes the idea of being fit. He describes being confused, and going on to tell himself that he wanted to be fit in the ‘intending to do it’ sense, while mysteriously not being inclined to.</p>
<p class=""p1"">My model gives a straightforward reason for these errors to be related. Suppose you are making a cost-benefit analysis. If you confuse a single entry in the ‘benefits’ column with the output of the entire analysis, this reliably undercounts costs, to put it mildly. That is, if you ‘decide’ to learn Japanese by just using ‘liking the idea of knowing Japanese’ as a proxy for making a decision, then your decisions will be independent of what will be lost by learning Japanese. You will do the same thing whether it takes three hours or three million hours to learn Japanese. And you will find yourself with some very bad decisions that you can’t bring yourself to actually uphold.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I was told at a CFAR workshop that it is useful to say to yourself ‘if I write this paper it is going to be super annoying, but worth it’ rather than just ‘writing this paper is worth it’. This seems probably related. For instance, maybe you are just using ‘I want a tiger’ to decide to acquire one, and then if you say ‘I want a tiger, but it will be very messy, oh wait maybe I don’t’ or ‘I want a tiger, and it will be very messy, and still worth it’ then in the latter case you believe yourself more, or something.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Anyway, maybe more distinct terms would be helpful. For now I’m going to use &#8216;yearn for&#8217; and &#8216;intend’, like ‘I yearn for a donut but I don&#8217;t intend to get one&#8217;.

I woke up to a text from a friend about how she was frustrated that more self-identified <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/"">rationalists</a> and <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/what-is-the-greatest-good/395768/"">effective altruists</a> aren&#x2019;t at least vegetarian if not vegan. I said it was a case of differing values between well-meaning people, but she was having none of it.</p><blockquote>Her: why won&#x2019;t u eat rabbits?</blockquote><blockquote>Me: because i had them as pets. i know them too well. they&#x2019;re like people to me.</blockquote><blockquote>Her: i will get you a pet chicken</blockquote><blockquote>Me:&#xA0;&#x2026;</blockquote><blockquote>Me: omg i&#x2019;m a vegetarian now&#xA0;:-/</blockquote><p>Here&#x2019;s what happened in my mind. I imagined a world in which I had a pet chicken. Over time I&#x2019;d grow to know it and think of it as worthy of moral consideration. Once that happened, I&#x2019;d no longer be able to eat chickens. I could apply the same process to all animals, and so by induction I would be unwilling to eat any animal. And since I already live in a world where I had pet rabbits, chinchillas, and cats to ground this induction process, my preferences immediately updated to include this <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/normative_extrapolated_volition/"">extrapolation</a>, making me a vegetarian.</p><p>She was surprised this worked, but it seems I was really a vegetarian all along, I just didn&#x2019;t know it. I hadn&#x2019;t sat down and worked the logic to realize the consequences of my beliefs. I probably even <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/act-into-fear-and-abandon-all-hope-81bcc114c5fd"">avoided doing it for fear that I would become a vegetarian</a>. It worked because I was already a vegetarian in my heart, but needed a little help to become one in my head.</p><p>I was reminded of this the other night when I was having dinner with friends and roommates and the conversation turned to what sources of meat the vegetarians at the table, myself included, were willing eat when necessary (for some fuzzy definition of &#x201C;necessary&#x201D;). Most were willing to bend on eating either fish or shellfish, but I took the unusual stance of being willing to eat only pork.</p><p>To understand this, let&#x2019;s start with what kind of meat I won&#x2019;t eat. I tend to think of meat in 4 or 5 categories: seafood, poultry, beef, pork, and other, the last of which some people divide between domesticated sources and wild sources. Even in my meat-eating days, I was hesitant to eat seafood. To be fair, I had a certain distaste for seafood having not grown up eating it much beyond fish sticks, but I never sought to develop a taste for seafood because of the broad damage caused by eating it.</p><p>Most of this is from the <a href=""https://www.seafoodwatch.org/"">ecological impact</a> of fishing which is unsustainable at current levels. People simply eat more seafood than the Earth can sustainably produce right now, and seafood should be much more expensive but fails to price in externalities like long-term environmental effects and future unavailability of fish. Even aquaculture, i.e. fish farming, has <a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4773e/y4773e05.htm"">major ecological impacts</a> by producing lots of nitrogen and other waste products that must be dumped, contributing to phenomena like the <a href=""http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/deadzone/index.html"">Gulf of Mexico dead zone</a>. And this is to say nothing of the <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130208-seafood-pain-debate-crabs-fish-science/"">plausible suffering of sea animals</a> used for food.</p><p>Speaking of suffering, by <a href=""http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/per-capita-consumption-of-poultry-and-livestock-1965-to-estimated-2012-in-pounds/"">pound consumed in the US</a> poultry is nearly synonymous with chicken, which sucks because by calorie eating chickens in general and their eggs in particular <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/want-to-summon-less-animal-suffering/"">generate the most deaths per calorie</a> of any land animal consumed. The picture isn&#x2019;t <a href=""http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/"">any better</a> if you consider suffering or quality adjusted life years, and chicken farms, even cage free ones, are essentially chicken hell based on our understanding of <a href=""https://lflank.wordpress.com/2015/01/27/chicken-politics-life-in-the-flock/"">chicken psychology</a>. Turkeys, geese, and ducks receive similar poor treatment, making all poultry unappealing to me.</p><p>Beef seems much better than chicken in terms of suffering, and dairy is comparatively fantastic. To give you an idea, a typical American eats enough meat in a year to consume less than one cow <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/23/vegetarianism-for-meat-eaters/"">if all they ate was beef</a>, as opposed to a couple pigs or dozens of chickens. Unfortunately, like with seafood, cattle farming is <a href=""http://science.time.com/2013/12/16/the-triple-whopper-environmental-impact-of-global-meat-production/"">ecologically harmful</a>, producing large amounts of greenhouse gases, using up lots of water (most of it to make cow food, aka grass), and destroying large swaths of natural habitat to create ranches. These externalities are not priced into beef, so even if eating cows and cow products produces less suffering than from farming any other animal, shared environmental assets are substantially harmed. That said, if I was forced to choose is between beef and chicken, I&#x2019;d choose beef.</p><p>As for other sources of meat, wild and domesticated, I generally ignore them because they are not commonly available enough to be worth considering for this question. Lamb, goat, deer, rabbit, buffalo, ostrich, and others are sometimes available, but all require some additional effort to obtain. Unlike seafood, poultry, beef, and pork, other meat sources aren&#x2019;t the defaults you can generally expect to find everywhere, to an extent that it seems unlikely it would be necessary for me to eat them since non-meat alternatives are as easy if not easier to get. I&#x2019;m not saying I would be as unwilling to eat, say, deer as I am unwilling to eat chicken, but I&#x2019;d probably only seriously consider it if, for example, there was deer overpopulation, culling was in effect, and the meat would otherwise be wasted. But again, for the effort involved in ensuring this I could just eat vegetables and avoid the issue altogether with an outcome I&#x2019;d prefer&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;eating vegetables strictly dominates eating other meats for me.</p><p>This leaves us only pork to consider. Pork is probably the easiest meat to convince people not to eat because <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODvNbFOwCKo"">pigs are charismatic and friendly</a>. Which, from my point of view, is unfortunate because pigs strike a balance between the lower suffering, higher ecological impact of beef and the higher suffering, lower ecological impact of chicken. Additionally, because pigs are relatable like dogs, cats, primates, and dolphins, I can appreciate that most pig lives seem worth living, just as most human lives, <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/04/jiro-lives-worth-living.html"">no matter how much suffering they contain</a>, <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/poor-folks-do-smile.html"">seem to be worth living</a>. So on the whole I feel fairly neutral about eating pigs, so I&#x2019;m most willing to eat them out of all animals if necessary.</p><p>But (there&#x2019;s always a &#x201C;but&#x201D;), I eat way more dairy and eggs than pork, as in I regularly eat dairy and don&#x2019;t try too hard not to eat eggs but eat pork no more often than any other meat, which is to say basically never unless my eating it is acausal to satisfying my preferences, e.g. if I were to dumpster dive, or I am forced to eat meat as a tradeoff against less desired alternatives. What gives? Well, as an American surrounded by meat eating conspecifics, I can get more of what I want by looking like a vegetarian than personally minimizing my direct impact on other animal preference satisfaction. That is to say, my preferences are best satisfied by signaling to others that I don&#x2019;t eat meat.</p><p>My reasoning is thus. Vegetarians are <a href=""http://www.vegetariantimes.com/article/vegetarianism-in-america"">relatively rare in America</a> and most Americans eat meat by default. When I go out to eat, which is often, my choices are often limited, so much so that there is little I would like to eat at most restaurants. It&#x2019;s harder to be a vegetarian in America than not, so as a result we should expect fewer people on the margin to become vegetarians or eat meat less often. Therefore, both because I want it to be easier for me to not eat animal products and I suspect a large impact I can have medium-to-long-term on satisfying my preference for respecting the preferences of animals is to make it easier for other people to eat less meat, I clearly signal culturally and financially that I have vegetarian preferences, thus normalizing vegetarianism and incentivizing catering to vegetarian preferences.</p><p>As you may have noticed, I became a vegetarian via preference utilitarianism, but stay a vegetarian to signal virtue. That would be pretty confused moral reasoning, except properly I don&#x2019;t think morality is a category of thing that exists in the world and instead is an illusion created by seeing the world through <a href=""https://medium.com/@gworley3/holonic-integration-927ba21d774b#.afqjj4pou"">a frame that does not include system relationships</a>. But I do recognize preferences, my own preferences include a preference for the maximization of the preferences of others all else equal, and as a result I think in a way that generally aligns with the moral theory of preference utilitarianism, but if I had different preferences about the preferences of others I could just as easily be a deontologist or virtue theorist in terms of morality, so I see no problem in the contradictions that result from <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/the-developmental-role-of-play-443549cfed3b"">flatting my thinking</a> into terms of morality.</p><p>Thus my vegetarianism is instrumental, I encourage others to share my preferences by signaling my vegetarianism, but I most prefer to eat pork if I must eat meat, and would probably choose it over cheese and eggs if I did not need to signal virtue.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

tFo8maKd6Tp7MyXHF,How to talk rationally about cults,how-to-talk-rationally-about-cults,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tFo8maKd6Tp7MyXHF/how-to-talk-rationally-about-cults,2017-01-08T20:12:51.340Z,18,18,40,False,False,,"<p>In 1978, several hundred people in Jonestown drank poison and died, because their leader told them to. Not everyone who died there was a volunteer; some members of the group objected, and they were killed first by the more dedicated members, who killed themselves later. Also, many children were killed by their parents. Still, hundreds of people died voluntarily, including the leader of the group, Jim Jones.</p>
<p>This is an extreme case. There are much more groups that create a comparable level of devotion in their members, but use it to extract money and services from the members. Groups where new members change their personalities, becoming almost ""clones"" of their leaders; then they break contacts with their families and former friends, usually after trying to recruit them for the group, or at least trying to extract from them as many resources as possible for the group. The new personality typically has black-and-white thinking, responds to questions by thought-terminating clich&eacute;s, and doesn't care much about things unrelated to the group. Sometimes the membership in the group is long-term, but commonly the members are worn-out and leave the group after a few years, replaced by the fresh members they helped to recruit, so despite the individuals change, the group remains.</p>
<p><a id=""more""></a></p>
<p>Talking about cults is difficult. It is not simple to provide a definition -- in different contexts finding new friends and growing apart with the old ones, spending money on hobbies or causes, and gradual changes in personality could be a part of normal life. Even if this all happens much faster and more extremely, is it just a question of degree (and how much exactly is <em>too</em> much?), or is there something else?</p>
<p>Of course, a group accused of being a ""cult"" will object against the label and point out the differences between them and some archetypal cult they are being compared with; or insist that there are <em>no</em> cults, only people intolerant of different lifestyles. They will emphasise that their members are in the group voluntarily, so no one else has a right to decide what would be better for them. And for every strange norm or behavior, there is always a good explanation (or a denial).</p>
<p>On the other hand, people <em>will</em> use the label to call any group they dislike a ""cult"". Some of them will use it as a synonym for ""a religion other than my own"" or ""people who have a weird hobby"". And of course any objection will be met by: ""And that's <em>exactly</em> what a <em>cult</em> would say."" (Which could actually be true, but that does not exclude the possibility that both sides focus on a wrong thing.)</p>
<p>In absence of clearer criteria of what constitutes a ""cult"", or more precisely, what kind of personality change by group influence is <em>that</em> kind of change we worry about... what kind of influence can change normal people into blind servants of the group without any <em>obvious </em>coercion... the debate will be very confused.</p>
<p>Also, for people who don't have an experience of being a cult member, it may be difficult to imagine what is it like. Many people imagine that being in a cult is a thing that can only happen to <em>other</em> -- read: stupid and gullible -- people; they underestimate the emotional forces involved. (Ironically, if they later become cult members themselves, the same belief will make them argue that their group is not really a cult.) But even the former cult members may have a problem to pinpoint the <em>essence</em> of the problem, instead of focusing on some accidental attribute of their former group. It is not rare that former cult members join a different cult later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily for our debate, there <em>are</em> relatively objective criteria for the cultish form of ""mind control"". There are a few ""red flags"" you can learn to notice and evaluate. The list called ""eight criteria of thought reform"" was compiled by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jay_Lifton"">Robert Jay Lifton</a>, an American psychiatrist who studied ""brainwashing"" of prisoners of war, and indoctrination in totalitarian regimes.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, it is better to ignore the specific <em>beliefs </em>of the group, and focus on its <em>behavior</em>. Debating the beliefs is a <em>red herring</em>. There could be two groups worshiping the same sacred scripture, and yet one of them would exhibit the dramatic changes in its members, white the other would be just another mainstream faith with boring compartmentalizing believers; so the difference is clearly not the scripture itself. There could also be two groups with nominally different beliefs, but otherwise strikingly similar behavior. The beliefs don't even have to be religious per se; the group can also believe in a political reform, or an economical success in the latest pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>It is best to pretend to be an alien zoologist, studying the <em>homo sapiens</em> species, unconcerned with object-level human beliefs. Notice when the members wear the same dress, but ignore what specific dress it is. Notice when the members are required to repeat specific words every day, publicly or privately, but ignore what those words mean. Notice when the members consistently behave remarkably friendly to a new recruit, and avoid contact with former members, but ignore their explanations <em>why</em> exactly are they doing that. Et cetera. Observe what they are <em>doing</em>, not what they <em>believe</em> they are doing.</p>
<p>Sometimes a group matches a given criterion partially. Sometimes the group matches some of the criteria, but not all of them. There is no exact line unambiguously separating ""cults"" from ""not cults"". But that doesn't make the concept worthless. There <em>are</em> groups that exhibit the typical cult dynamic, with all the toxic aspects reinforcing each other. There are also groups that have some unhealthy behavior, but it doesn't create the full pattern. Even the same group can change over time. To evaluate a given criterion, it is good to have an idea how far does the scale go in a typical cult (to avoid the ""medical student syndrome"" when people find every symptom in everything). Probably the best way to get the idea is to read a few biographies of the former cult members.</p>
<p>So, here are the criteria:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Living in a controlled environment</strong></p>
<p>There are rules for how you should spend your time. Some groups insist on wearing a uniform; some groups want you to spend the whole day in presence of at least one other group member, to make sure you don't privately break the rules. Sometimes there is a lot of work to keep you busy -- whether real work, or just repeating a mantra thousand times a day, -- so you don't have free <em>time to reflect </em>on the group and your membership. (People sometimes spend months or years in a cult without actually making a conscious decision to <em>join </em>it permanently; they just decide to hang out with them for a while to learn more about them, and receive a ton of ""urgent"" work with a promise that all their questions will be answered later, when there is more time. Somehow, that never happens, and only after a few months or years these people realize they were duped and leave.)</p>
<p>More important than controlling the physical space is controlling the mental space. All groups agree that you should avoid reading materials critical of the group, and talking with people critical of the group (unless you are trying to convert them; or you are exposed to them <em>strategically</em>, because they happen to be <em>stupid </em>critics, so the real goal of exposure is to teach you that this is what all group critics look like). Most of all, you must avoid talking with the former members (they know too much).</p>
<p>Of course, this is all for your own good. People opposing the group are the worst people of all; it is rational to avoid spending your precious time with them. They are wicked heretics, slaves to sin. They are racists, sexists, capitalists, or communists; the evil ones who keep ruining our society. They are brainwashed sheep who are too scared to think out of the box, join our latest pyramid scheme and make millions. The former members were too sinful or weak to stay in the group; you better avoid them, because the weakness might be contagious; and don't believe anything they say!</p>
<p>This also applies to your internal environment. If there is a voice in your head telling you to slow down, to take an outside view, to consider the alternatives... you are supposed to fight against that voice, not listen to it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the protection against outside information happens on two levels. There is information that the group will officially admit they are trying to protect you from, such as pornography or harassment. They may offer to install a group-sanctioned web filter, or otherwise let you outsource the information filtering to them. If you let them, you usually get more than you subscribed for. For example, the anti-pornography or anti-harassment filter will also filter out information and people critical of the group, without telling you it did so. (Now good luck trying to convice your employer or university to remove those filters again.)</p>
<p><strong>Guided by an intelligence higher than you</strong></p>
<p>There is something special about this group and its leadership, which makes them unique in the universe and in the history. If you tried to make another group like this, it just wouldn't be the same. You couldn't even change it significantly, because it was designed exactly the way it needs to be.</p>
<p>If this is a religious group, the answer is obvious: it is the supernatural power on your side that makes the difference. But even nominally non-religious groups often believe in things that are supernatural in <em>anything but name</em>: the inevitable flow of history, the spirit of time. The non-religious leaders may nominally be mere mortals like you, but they are mortals endowed with <em>unique</em> understanding of the forces of the universe, which makes them incomparable to you; you couldn't replicate (or surpass) their wisdom no matter how much would you study. Similarly, you couldn't devise your own pyramid scheme, or invent a better product to sell. It is insane to even think about such things.</p>
<p>When your group is guided by a higher intelligence, the only rational thing to do is to obey it without a doubt. Even weird things that happen (for example, one day your leaders predict the end of the world, the next day they deny doing so), happened for a purpose; you are just too stupid to understand it.</p>
<p><strong>What do we want? Perfection! When do we want it? Now!</strong></p>
<p>The perfection is not only achievable right now, but you are a horrible person for not having achieved it already. What stops you? Everything is either completely good or completely bad; just throw those bad things away! Unless you secretly prefer to be evil.</p>
<p>(Of course, deep inside you will always be aware of your own imperfection, as measured by the group standards. Just like every other member of the group. But that's not a bug, that's a feature! Feeling guilty will make you <em>work harder</em>.)</p>
<p>The same black and white standard is also applied to everything outside the group, usually by finding a flaw, and concluding it is too horrible to interact with. It creates a perfect excuse to avoid anything or anyone inconvenient for the group leadership. It also guarantees a steady flow of perceived enemies, because no microaggression is too small to make a mountain of.</p>
<p><strong>Your mind belongs to the group<br /></strong></p>
<p>There is no privacy even inside your head. You are supposed to confess your sins to the group. (Note: There is always <em>something</em> to confess. Believing you have nothing to confess is itself a great sin.) Confession is best done publicly, in front of the whole group. If you don't volunteer enough sins, the group is supposed to call you out. Snitching on each other is a valuable <em>spiritual service </em>to your fellow members. The most poweful confessions are ones that leave the victim broken and in tears. Then the victim swears to sin no more, and the group provides an absolution. This creates a strong emotional bond between members.</p>
<p><strong>A sacred science</strong></p>
<p>The teaching of the group come with an authority of science. Except, this is a <em>special </em>kind of science; one that does not allow doubts. The truth is not determined by experimentally comparing competing hypotheses; it is <em>revealed</em>. The leaders of the group got everything right for the first time. Their work is perfect. There are no alternatives to consider. Skepticism is evil.</p>
<p><strong>Redefining the language</strong></p>
<p>You can either invent new words, or redefine the meaning of the existing ones. This serves multiple purposes. On the outside, it creates yet another barrier between members and non-members. It is impossible to get a second opinion on group teachings, if non-members don't even understand what those words mean. (And if they don't understand, that obviously makes them less smart, right? More words mean more wisdom.) Every moment a member spends with non-members, these artificial barriers in communication keep reminding them they are in the outside world. The group becomes the only place where some concepts can be discussed meaningfully.</p>
<p>Redefining the language also brings specific advantages in teaching the group beliefs. You don't really have to prove anything if you simply make it a part of the definition. For example, if you redefine ""heresy"" to mean ""<em>irrational </em>disagreement with the beliefs of our group"", you don't have to prove that people who disagree with your beliefs are irrational. It's right there, in the definition! Or you can redefine words ""<em>X</em>"" and ""<em>Y</em>"" to mean ""<em>X</em>, but only when our members do it"" and ""<em>Y</em>, but only when non-members do it"", and suddenly it is obvious that when both members and non-members seemingly do the same thing, it's actually not the same thing.</p>
<p>Short phrases can be used to stop thinking about complex topics.</p>
<p><strong>Map over the territory</strong></p>
<p>The group doctrine says something can't happen. But it happened to you, maybe years ago, maybe right now. Guess what: You are wrong! It didn't happen. And you better change your memories; either find an interpretation that fits the group teachings, or just deny the whole thing. Because the group is always right.</p>
<p>Often, among the memories that need to go, is anything good that happened to you <em>before </em>you joined the group. The official story usually requires you to tell (and believe) than you were a horrible and worthless person before you have seen the light.</p>
<p><strong>If it's not here, it's not real</strong></p>
<p>The worlds inside the group and outside the group can't really be compared, because one of them is not even real. People inside the group are saved. People outside the group are doomed, and they deserve it; they are evil and weak. The people outside are only valuable as potential future members.</p>
<p>This of course creates the threat that if one day you would lose the group membership, you would stop existing, too. Not literally disappear, just stop existing as someone who matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The important thing here is to realize that these eight points aren't just eight arbitrarily selected things, but rather eight aspects of the same complex mechanism that hacks the human brain; makes it value the group highly, makes one feel dependent on the group, and builds a barrier of fear against leaving the group. They often reinforce each other: The argument by higher intelligence can be used to explain why the rules exist; the demand for perfect purity includes requiring perfect obedience of the rules; the group confession is there to detect transgressions; and the controlled environment even removes the opportunity for transgressions. Similarly, black and white thinking classifies your former friends as evil; the group confession (where you must report ""sinful"" topics you talked about, such as your former hobbies, or how the group membership keeps changing you for worse) makes meeting them more costly; the new language makes communication more awkward; rewriting your memories requires you to give up good memories experienced with them; and pretending that the world outside the group is not fully real makes you rationalize that nothing of value was lost.</p>
<p>When people without their own personal experience talk about cult membership, they sometimes describe it as a rational preference for things offered by the group to its members, such as the social environment or the feeling of meaning. While this contains a grain of truth (a group offering its members literally nothing probably wouldn't be popular), focusing on the value provided by the group ignores the more important part of the picture: how the members are <em>strategically </em>deprived of potential value coming from all <em>alternative </em>sources, so the group becomes a monopoly on value, threatening to take it all away as a punishment for disobedience. Of course, surrendering to the group demands only makes one more vulnerable in long term.</p>
<p>How do such well-designed abusive groups appear at the first place? I believe a part of the answer is selection bias: abusive groups with worse designs remain small or gradually disappear. Other part is that some of these techniques come naturally to abusers (such as: isolating the victim from their family and friends, or accusing the victim of hundred made-up ""crimes"" so the debate shifts to talking about what the <em>victim </em>did wrong), and the only technical problem is building the group structure that will make other members play along with the abuse (especially considering that they will also receive the same treatment). And yet another part of the explanation is that successful groups copy these ""best practices"" from each other, because they see greater group cohesion as a worthy subgoal. (Here is a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnNSe5XYp6E"">nice video</a>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what can one do to avoid a similar outcome? Some people suggest full <em>reverse stupidity</em>: a sufficiently safe group should consider itself and its members completely worthless, should avoid having any specific opinion on anything, and preferably shouldn't even exist. Anything else would be the first step towards the inevitable horrible outcome. But looking at the eight criteria, I believe there are ways to have a functional, yet non-abusive group, if we simply avoid scoring too high at any of these points.</p>
<p>A surprisingly large part of this could be classified as some aspect of ""free speech"" -- being able to talk to <em>anyone </em>(even critics of the group, and former members), about <em>anything </em>(even doubting the group beliefs, debating personal experience that contradicts the group beliefs, expressing doubt in ways the supposed higher intelligence guides the group, and explaining group jargon to outsiders), and keeping the content of such debates for yourself. The rest could be described as quantitative thinking (accepting that some things can be better or worse than others, without that inevitably making them perfect or horrible), and cooperating with people outside the group. As a rule of thumb, a group that makes fun of free speech is an abusive group; some of those things you are not supposed to discuss are about how they treat people, including their own members. On the other hand, a problem you can talk about is a problem you can try to solve.</p>",Viliam,viliam,Viliam,

<p><em>This post is a short informal summary of a new idea I'm starting to work on, which combines my thinking abouts ""incomplete models"" with Scott's logical inductors.</em></p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p><a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1046"">Before</a>, I speculated that generalizing Bayesian inference to include incomplete models will allow solving the grain of truth problem in a way more satisfactory than what was achieved so far. More generally, this would allow getting performance guarantees for agents in environments that are as complex or more complex than the agent.</p>
<p>Now, such performance guarantees are already known for learning algorithms suited to the <em>non-realizable</em> settings. However, as Jessica noted <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=961"">here</a>, those methods don't address long-term planning due to the scarcity of training data. On the other hand, Bayesian methods do allow long-term planning: if the environment is realizable (i.e. absolutely continuous w.r.t. the prior), on-policy merging of opinions will occur at a rate that doesn't depend on the utility function. This means that for a fixed environment and sufficiently slowly falling time discount, the agent will be able to form effective long-term plans, at least as long on-policy forecasting is sufficient. Of course, realistic settings require off-policy forecasting, which requires some exploration. If we want global optimality in policy space, we would have to explore for an entire horizon which means long-term planning fails again. However, I think that satisfactory weaker optimality guarantees can be achieved by more conservative exploration, especially when ""consulting a (human) expert"" is an available form of ""exploration"".</p>
<p>This advantage of Bayesian agents is only applicable in the realizable case, which is an unrealistic assumption. However, the inclusion of incomplete models would bring the advantage into the non-realizable case: the environment might be arbitrarily complex, but as long as it conforms to some simple incomplete model, this model can be learnt quickly and exploited for long-term planning.</p>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>Previously, I suggested addressing incomplete models using non-Bayesian decision rules. Here, I propose a different approach. At each moment of time, the policy is selected using normal expected utility maximization, for some posterior probability measure. However, the posterior probability measure doesn't come from updating a prior on observations. Instead, it comes from consulting an ""inner prediction market"": Scott's logical inductor adapted for forecasting the environment instead of forecasting logical sentences (this is somewhat similar to the ""universal inductor"").</p>
<p>In the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1107"">pure forecasting</a> setting, the formalisation seems straightforward.

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1. Rationality considered harmful for Scott Aaronson in the great gender debate</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2015, complexity theorist and rationalist Scott Aaronson was foolhardy enough to step into the Gender Politics war on his blog with a comment stating that extreme feminism that he bought into made him hate himself and try to seek ways to chemically castrate himself. The feminist blogoshere got hold of this and&nbsp;<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/"">crucified him for it</a>, and he has written a few followup blog posts about it. Recently I saw this comment by him on his blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2494#comment-872285"">As the comment 171 affair blew up last year, one of my <strong>female colleagues in quantum computing</strong> remarked to me that the real issue had nothing to do with gender politics; it was really just about the commitment to truth regardless of the social costs&mdash;a quality that many of the people attacking me (who were overwhelmingly from outside the hard sciences) had perhaps never encountered before in their lives. That remark cheered me more than anything else at the time</a></em></p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2. Rationality considered harmful for Sam Harris in the islamophobia war</span></strong></p>
<p>I recently heard a very angry, exasperated 2 hour podcast by the new atheist and political commentator Sam Harris about how badly he has been straw-manned, misrepresented and trash talked by his intellectual rivals (who he collectively refers to as the ""regressive left""). Sam Harris likes to tackle hard questions such as when torture is justified, which religions are more or less harmful than others, defence of freedom of speech, etc. Several times, Harris goes to the meta-level and sees clearly what is happening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYUPr6cH294#t=2h0m22s"">Rather than a searching and beautiful exercise in human reason to have conversations on these topics [ethics of torture, military intervention, Islam, etc], people are making it just politically so toxic, reputationally so toxic to even raise these issues that smart people, smarter than me, are smart enough not to go near these topics</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQqxlzHJrU0#t=47m57s"">Everyone on the left at the moment seems to be a mind reader.. no matter how much you try to take their foot out of your mouth, the mere effort itself is going to be counted against you - you're someone who's in denial, or you don't even understand how racist you are, etc</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">3. Rationality considered harmful when talking to your left-wing friends about genetic modification</span></strong></p>
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/18/ot-30-comment-knowledge/#comment-247241"">SlateStarCodex comments</a>&nbsp;I posted complaining that many left-wing people were responding very personally (and negatively) to my political views.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One long term friend openly and pointedly asked whether we should still be friends over the subject of eugenics and genetic engineering, for example altering the human germ-line via genetic engineering to permanently cure a genetic disease. This friend responded to a rational argument about why some modifications of the human germ line may in fact be a good thing by saying that&nbsp;""(s)he was beginning to wonder whether we should still be friends"".&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large comment thread ensued, but the best comment I got was <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/18/ot-30-comment-knowledge/#comment-247316"">this one</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>One of the useful things I have found when confused by something my brain does is to ask what it is *for*. For example: I get angry, the anger is counterproductive, but recognizing that doesn&rsquo;t make it go away. What is anger *for*? Maybe it is to cause me to plausibly signal violence by making my body ready for violence or some such.</em></p>
<p><em>Similarly, when I ask myself what moral/political discourse among friends is *for* I get back something like &ldquo;signal what sort of ally you would be/broadcast what sort of people you want to ally with.&rdquo; This makes disagreements more sensible. They are trying to signal things about distribution of resources, I am trying to signal things about truth value, others are trying to signal things about what the tribe should hold sacred etc. Feeling strong emotions is just a way of signaling strong precommitments to these positions (i.e. I will follow the morality I am signaling now because I will be wracked by guilt if I do not. I am a reliable/predictable ally.) They aren&rsquo;t mad at your positions. They are mad that you are signaling that you would defect when push came to shove about things they think are important.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me repeat that last one: moral/political discourse among friends is for &ldquo;signalling what sort of ally you would be/broadcast what sort of people you want to ally with&rdquo;. <a href=""/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/"">Moral/political discourse probably activates</a> specially evolved brainware in human beings; that brainware has a purpose and it isn't truthseeking. <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html"">Politics is not about policy</a>!&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">A few notes about the site mechanics<br /></h4>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>To post your first comment</strong>, you must have carried out the e-mail confirmation: When you signed up to create your account, an e-mail was sent to the address you provided with a link that you need to follow to confirm your e-mail address. You must do this before you can post!</div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">Less Wrong&nbsp;<strong>comments are threaded</strong>&nbsp;for easy following of multiple conversations. To respond to any comment, click the ""Reply"" link at the bottom of that comment's box. Within the comment box, links and formatting are achieved via&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Comment_formatting"">Markdown syntax</a>&nbsp;(you can click the ""Help"" link below the text box to bring up a primer).</div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">You may have noticed that all the posts and comments on this site have buttons to&nbsp;<strong>vote them up or down</strong>, and all the users have ""karma"" scores which come from the sum of all their comments and posts. This immediate easy feedback mechanism helps keep arguments from turning into flamewars and helps make the best posts more visible; it's part of what makes discussions on Less Wrong look different from those anywhere else on the Internet.</div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">However, it can feel really irritating to get downvoted, especially if one doesn't know why. It happens to all of us sometimes, and it's perfectly acceptable to ask for an explanation. (Sometimes it's the unwritten LW etiquette; we have different norms than other forums.) Take note when you're downvoted a lot on one topic, as it often means that several members of the community think you're missing an important point or making a mistake in reasoning&mdash; not just that they disagree with you!<strong>&nbsp;If you have any questions about karma or voting, please feel free to ask here.</strong></div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>Replies</strong>&nbsp;to your comments across the site, plus&nbsp;<strong>private messages</strong>&nbsp;from other users, will show up in your&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/message/inbox"">inbox</a>. You can reach it via the little mail icon beneath your karma score on the upper right of most pages. When you have a new reply or message, it glows red. You can also click on any user's name to view all of their comments and posts.</div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>All recent posts&nbsp;</strong>(from both&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/new/"">Main</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/r/discussion/new/"">Discussion</a>) are available&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/r/all/recentposts/"">here</a>. At the same time, it's definitely worth your time&nbsp;<strong>commenting on old posts</strong>; veteran users look through the&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/comments"">recent comments thread</a>&nbsp;quite often (there's a separate&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/r/discussion/comments"">recent comments thread for the Discussion section</a>, for whatever reason), and a conversation begun anywhere will pick up contributors that way.&nbsp; There's also a succession of&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/r/discussion/tag/open_thread/"">open</a>&nbsp;comment&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/tag/open_thread"">threads</a>&nbsp;for discussion of anything remotely related to rationality.</div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">Discussions on Less Wrong tend to end differently than in most other forums; a surprising number end when one participant changes their mind, or when multiple people clarify their views enough and reach agreement. More commonly, though, people will just stop when they've better identified their deeper disagreements, or simply&nbsp;<strong>""tap out"" of a discussion</strong>&nbsp;that's stopped being productive. (Seriously, you can just write ""I'm tapping out of this thread."") This is absolutely OK, and it's one good way to avoid the flamewars that plague many sites.</div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>EXTRA FEATURES:</strong><br /></div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">There's actually more than meets the eye here: look near the top of the page for the ""WIKI"", ""DISCUSSION"" and ""SEQUENCES"" links.</div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>LW WIKI:</strong>&nbsp;This is our attempt to make searching by topic feasible, as well as to store information like&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Acronyms_used_on_Less_Wrong"">common abbreviations</a>&nbsp;and idioms. It's a good place to look if someone's speaking Greek to you.<br /></div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>LW DISCUSSION:</strong>&nbsp;This is a forum just like the top-level one, with two key differences: in the top-level forum, posts require the author to have 20 karma in order to publish, and any upvotes or downvotes on the post are multiplied by 10. Thus there's a lot more informal dialogue in the Discussion section, including some of the more fun conversations here.</div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>SEQUENCES:</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<em>huge</em>&nbsp;corpus of material mostly written by Eliezer Yudkowsky in his days of blogging at Overcoming Bias, before Less Wrong was started. Much of the discussion here will casually depend on or refer to ideas brought up in those posts, so reading them can really help with present discussions. Besides which, they're pretty engrossing in my opinion. They are also available&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/"">in a book form</a>.</div>
<div class=""md"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<h4 style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">A few notes about the community<br /></h4>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">If you've come to Less Wrong to&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>discuss a particular topic</strong>, this thread would be a great place to start the conversation. By commenting here, and checking the responses, you'll probably get a good read on what, if anything, has already been said here on that topic, what's widely understood and what you might still need to take some time explaining.</div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>If your welcome comment starts a huge discussion</strong>, then please move to the next step and&nbsp;<strong>create a LW Discussion post to continue the conversation</strong>; we can fit many more welcomes onto each thread if fewer of them sprout 400+ comments. (To do this: click ""Create new article"" in the upper right corner next to your username, then write the article, then at the bottom take the menu ""Post to"" and change it from ""Drafts"" to ""Less Wrong Discussion"". Then click ""Submit"". When you edit a published post, clicking ""Save and continue"" does correctly update the post.)</div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">If you want to write a post about a LW-relevant topic, awesome!&nbsp;<strong>I highly recommend you submit your first post to Less Wrong Discussion</strong>; don't worry, you can later promote it from there to the main page if it's well-received. (It's much better to get some feedback before every vote counts for 10 karma&mdash;honestly, you don't know what you don't know about the community norms here.)</div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">Alternatively, if you're still unsure where to submit a post, whether to submit it at all, would like some feedback before submitting, or want to gauge interest, you can ask / provide your draft / summarize your submission in the latest&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/r/discussion/tag/open_thread/"">open</a>&nbsp;comment&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/tag/open_thread"">thread</a>. In fact, Open Threads are intended for&nbsp;<strong>anything 'worth saying, but not worth its own post'</strong>, so please do dive in! Informally, there is also the unofficial&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/IRC"">Less Wrong IRC chat room</a>, and you might also like to take a look at some of the other regular&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Special_threads"">special threads</a>; they're a great way to get involved with the community!</div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">If you'd like to connect with other LWers in real life, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>meetups&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;in various parts of the world. Check the&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups"">wiki page for places with regular meetups</a>, or the&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/meetups"">upcoming (irregular) meetups page</a>.

You can get English help on Discussion- or Main-level posts by sending a PM to one of the following users (use the ""send message"" link on the upper right of their user page). Either put the text of the post in the PM, or just say that you'd like English help and you'll get a response with an email address.&nbsp;<br />*&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/user/Normal_Anomaly"">Normal_Anomaly</a>&nbsp;<br />*&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/user/Randaly"">Randaly</a>&nbsp;<br />*&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/user/shokwave"">shokwave</a>&nbsp;<br />*&nbsp;<a style=""color: #8a8a8b;"" href=""/user/Barry_Cotter"">Barry Cotter</a></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 1em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>A note for theists</strong>: you will find the Less Wrong community to be predominantly atheist, though not completely so, and most of us are genuinely respectful of religious people who keep the usual community norms. It's worth saying that we might think religion is off-topic in some places where you think it's on-topic, so be thoughtful about where and how you start explicitly talking about it; some of us are happy to talk about religion, some of us aren't interested. Bear in mind that many of us really, truly have given full consideration to theistic claims and found them to be false, so starting with the most common arguments is pretty likely just to annoy people. Anyhow, it's absolutely OK to mention that you're religious in your welcome post and to invite a discussion there.</p>

<p>This post continues the study of <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1107"">minimax forecasting</a>.</p>
<p>The minimax decision rule has the pathology that, when events are sufficiently ""optimistic"", behavior can become highly suboptimal. This is analogous to off-policy irrational behavior in Nash equilibria of games in extensive form. In order to remedy the problem, we introduce a refinement called ""subagent perfect minimax,"" somewhat analogous to subgame perfect equilibria and other related solution concepts. It is possible to prove existence and, when the model factorizes, dynamic consistency.</p>
<p>The proofs are omitted, but we can easily provide them if necessary.</p>
<p>##Motivation</p>
<p>Consider the following class of environments: during the first step, the agent gains <span class=""mjpage mjpage__block""></span>1$ or action <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span> which leads to gaining $$0$.</p>
<p>The minimax payoff of this class is <span class=""mjpage mjpage__block""></span>0$ in the first step, choose <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em;

<hr />
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I think a lot about heuristics and biases, and I admit that many of my ideas on rationality and debiasing get lost in the sea of my own thoughts. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re accessible, if I&rsquo;m specifically thinking about rationality-esque things, but often invisible otherwise. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That seems highly&nbsp;sub-optimal, considering that the whole point of having usable mental models isn&rsquo;t to write fancy posts about them, but to, you know, actually&nbsp;<em>use&nbsp;</em>them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To that end, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about finding some sort of systematic way to integrate all of these ideas into my actual life. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">(If you&rsquo;re curious, here&rsquo;s the actual picture of what my internal &ldquo;concept-verse&rdquo; (w/ associated LW and CFAR memes) looks like)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""alignnone wp-image-336"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; display: block; color: #111111; background-color: #f1f1f1;"" src=""https://mindlevelup.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/mlu-mind-map-v1.png?w=1251&amp;h=561"" alt=""MLU Mind Map v1.png"" width=""1251"" height=""561"" /></p>
<div><span style=""font-family: Lato, sans-serif; color: #111111;""><span style=""font-size: 17px;""><br /></span></span>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Open Image In New Tab&nbsp;for all the details</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So I have all of these ideas, all of which look really great on paper and in thought experiments. &nbsp;Some of them even have some sort of experimental backing. &nbsp;Given this, how do I put them together into a kind of coherent notion?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Equivalently, what does it look like if I successfully implement these mental models? &nbsp;What sorts of changes might I expect to see? &nbsp;Then, knowing the end product, what kind of process can get me there?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One way of looking it would to say that if I implemented techniques well, then I&rsquo;d be better able to tackle my goals and get things done. &nbsp;Maybe my productivity would go up. &nbsp;That sort of makes sense. &nbsp;But this tells us nothing about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;I&rsquo;d actually be going about, using such skills. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We want to know how to implement these skills and then actually utilize them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Yudkowsky gives a highly useful abstraction when he talks about the&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/5kz/the_5second_level/"">five-second level</a>. &nbsp;He gives some great tips on breaking down mental techniques into their component mental motions. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a step-by-step approach that really goes into the details of what it feels like to undergo one of the LessWrong epistemological techniques. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d like our mental techniques to be actual heuristics that we can use in the moment, so having an in-depth breakdown makes sense.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Here&rsquo;s my attempt at a 5-second-level breakdown for Going Meta, or ""popping"" out of one's head to stay mindful of the moment:</p>
<ol style=""margin-top:0in"" type=""1"">
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Notice the feeling that you are being mentally &ldquo;dragged&rdquo; towards continuing an action.<ol style=""margin-top:0in"" type=""1"">
<li class=""MsoNormal"">(It can feel like an urge, or your mind automatically making a plan to do something. &nbsp;Notice your brain simulating you taking an action without much conscious input.)</li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Remember that you have a 5-second-level series of steps to do something about it.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Feel aversive towards continuing the loop. &nbsp;Mentally shudder at the part of you that tries to continue.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Close your eyes. &nbsp;Take in a breath.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Think about what 1-second action you could take to instantly cut off the stimulus from whatever loop you&rsquo;re stuck in. (EX: Turning off the display, closing the window, moving to somewhere else).</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Tense your muscles and clench, actually doing said action.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Run a search through your head, looking for an action labeled &ldquo;productive&rdquo;. &nbsp;Try to remember things you&rsquo;ve told yourself you &ldquo;should probably do&rdquo; lately. &nbsp;<ol style=""margin-top:0in"" type=""1"">
<li class=""MsoNormal"">(If you can&rsquo;t find anything, pattern-match to find something that seems &ldquo;productive-ish&rdquo;.)</li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Take note of what time it is. &nbsp;Write it down.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Do the new thing. &nbsp;Finish.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Note the end time. &nbsp;Calculate how long you did work.</li>
</ol>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Next, the other part is actually accessing the heuristic in the situations where you want it. &nbsp;We want it to be habitual.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">After doing some quick searches on the existing research on habits, it appears that many of the links go to&nbsp;<a href=""http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/"">Charles Duhigg</a>, author of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X"">The Power of Habi</a>t, or&nbsp;<a href=""http://bjfogg.com/schedule.html"">B J Fogg</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=""http://tinyhabits.com/"">Tiny Habits</a>. Both models focus on two things: Identifying the Thing you want to do. &nbsp;Then setting triggers so you actually do It. &nbsp;(There&rsquo;s some similarity to CFAR&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://trello.com/c/BnoEYhSb/29-improve-your-life-with-trigger-action-plans"">Trigger Action Plans</a>.) &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">B J&rsquo;s approach focuses on scaffolding new habits into existing routines, like brushing your teeth, which are already automatic. &nbsp;Duhigg appears to be focused more on reinforcement and rewards, with several nods to Skinner. &nbsp;CFAR views actions as self-reinforcing, so the reward isn&rsquo;t even necessary&mdash; they see repetition as building automation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Overlearning the material also seems to be useful in some contexts, for skills like acquiring procedural knowledge. &nbsp;And mental notions do seem to be&nbsp;<a href=""https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2016/08/26/realistic-expectations/"">more like procedural knowledge</a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For these mental skills specifically, we&rsquo;d want them to go off, time irrespective, so anchoring it to an existing routine might not be best. &nbsp;Having it as a response to an internal state (EX: &ldquo;When I notice myself being &lsquo;dragged&rsquo; into a spiral, or automatically making plans to do a thing&rdquo;) may be more useful.</p>
<hr />
<p class=""MsoNormal"">(Follow-up post forthcoming on concretely trying to apply habit research to implementing heuristics.)</p>

You have $1. A table offers you a game: you have to bet all your money; a fair coin will be tossed; if it lands heads, you triple your money; if it lands tails, you lose everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first round, it is rational to take the bet since the expected value of winning is $1.50, which is greater than what you started out with.</p>
<p>If you win the first round, you'll have $3. In the next round, it is rational to take the bet again, since the expected value is $4.50 which is larger than $3.</p>
<p>If you win the second round, you'll have $9. In the next round, it is rational to take the bet again, since the expected value is $13.50 which is larger than $9.</p>
<p>You get the idea. At every round, if you won the previous round, it is rational to take the next bet.</p>
<p>But if you follow this strategy, it is guaranteed that you will eventually lose everything. You will go home with nothing. And that seems irrational.</p>
<p>Intuitively, it feels that the rational thing to do is to quit while you are ahead, but how do you get that prediction out of the maximization of expected utility? Or does the above analysis only feel irrational because humans are loss-averse? Or is loss-aversion somehow optimal here?</p>
<p>Anyway, please dissolve my confusion.</p>",Stabilizer,stabilizer,Stabilizer,

This answer finally dawned on me in the middle of one of those occasional conversations in which non-perplexed friends patiently try to explain the issue to me. So I am not sure if mine is a novel explanation, or merely the explanation that my friends were trying to tell me, in which case my contribution is explaining it in a way that is at all comprehensible to a person like me. If it is novel, apparently some other people disagree with it and have an almost entirely satisfactory alternative, which has the one downside that it is impossible to explain to me.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The puzzle is this:</p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""text-align:center;""><strong>Why do people read old philosophers to learn about philosophy? </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">We read old physicists if we want to do original research on the history of physics. Or maybe if we are studying an aspect of physics so obscure that nobody has covered it in hundreds of years. If we want to learn physics we read a physics textbook. As far as I know, the story is similar in math, chemistry, engineering, economics, and business (though maybe some other subjects that I know less about are more like philosophy).</p>
<p class=""p1"">Yet go to philosophy grad school, and you will read original papers and books by historical philosophers. Research projects explore in great detail what it is that Aristotle actually said, thought, and meant. Scholars will learn the languages that the relevant texts were written in, because none of the translations can do the texts the necessary justice. The courses and books will be named after people like ‘Hume’ as often as they are named after topics of inquiry like ‘Causality’ and larger subject areas will be organized by the spatiotemporal location of the philosopher, rather than by the subject matter: Ancient Philosophy, Early Modern Philosophy, Chinese Philosophy, Continental Philosophy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The physics situation makes a lot more sense to me. Hypothetically, who would I rather read an explanation of ‘The Alice Effect’ by? —Alice, the effect’s seventeenth century discoverer, or Bob, a modern day physics professor authoring a textbook?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Some salient considerations, neutrality not guaranteed:</p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1"">Alice’s understanding of the Alice effect is probably the most confused understanding of it in all of history, being the first ‘understanding of the Alice effect’ to set itself apart from ‘confusion and ignorance about the Alice effect’.</li>
<li class=""li1"">In the billions of lifetimes that have passed since Alice’s time, the world has probably thought substantially more about The Alice Effect than Alice managed to in her lifetime, at least if it is important at all.</li>
<li class=""li1"">Alice’s very first account of the effect probably contained imperfections. Bob can write about the theory as it stood after years of adjustment.</li>
<li class=""li1"">Even if Alice’s account was perfectly correct, it was probably not perfectly well explained, unless she happens to have been a great explainer as well as a great physicist.</li>
<li class=""li1"">Physics has made many discoveries since Alice’s time, such as Claire forces, Evan motion and Roger fields. It might be easier to understand all of this by starting with the Roger fields, and explaining the Alice effect as a consequence. However literature from the likes of Alice is constrained to cover topics chronologically by date of discovery.</li>
<li class=""li1"">Bob speaks a similar version of English to me</li>
<li class=""li1"">Bob can be selected for having particular skill at writing and explanation, whereas Alice must be selected for having the scientific prowess to make the discovery.</li>
<li class=""li1"">Bob is actually trying to explain the thing to a 21st Century reader, while Alice is writing to pique the interest of some seventeenth century noblemen who lack modern intellectual machinery and are interested in issues like whether this is compatible with religion. An accurate impression of a 21st Century reader would probably cause Alice to fall over.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">I think Bob is a solid choice.</p>
<p class=""p1"">How might philosophy be different?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Some pieces of explanations I heard, or made up while hearing other explanations:</p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1"">You have to be smarter than the original philosopher to summarize their work well, so there are few good summaries</li>
<li class=""li1"">The translations are all terrible for conveying the important parts</li>
<li class=""li1"">Philosophy is not trying to communicate normal content that can be in explicit statements, of the kind you might be able to explain well and check the understanding of and such.</li>
<li class=""li1"">Philosophy is about having certain experiences which pertain to the relevant philosophy, much like reading a poem is different to reading a summary of its content.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">I don&#8217;t find any of these compelling. If I understood some material well enough to make use of it, I would generally expect to be able to summarize it or describe it in a different language that I knew. So if nobody is capable of summarizing or translating the material it is hard to believe that I am getting much out of it by reading it. &#8216;Some content can&#8217;t be described&#8217; isn&#8217;t much of an explanation, and even if it was, how did the philosophers describe it? And if you found it, but then couldn&#8217;t describe it, what would be the point? And if philosophy is about having certain experiences, like poetry, but then it would seem to be a kind of entertainment rather than a project to gain knowledge, which is at least not what most philosophers would tell you. So none of these explanations for learning philosophy to involve so much attention to very old philosophers seemed that plausible.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ok, so that&#8217;s the mystery.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Here&#8217;s my explanation. Reading Aristotle describe his thoughts about the world is like watching Aristotle ride a skateboard if Aristotle were a pro skater. You are not getting value from learning about the streets he is gliding over (or the natural world that he is describing) and you should not be memorizing the set of jumps he chooses (or his particular conceptualizations of the world). You are meant to be learning about how to carry out the activity that he is carrying out: how to be Aristotle. How to do what Aristotle would do, even in a new environment.</p>
<p class=""p1"">An old work of philosophy does not describe the thing you are meant to be learning about. It was created by the thing you are meant to be learning about, much like watching a video from skater-Aristotle’s GoPro. And the value proposition is that with this high resolution Aristotle’s-eye-view, you can infer the motions.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There is not a short description<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>of the insights you should learn (or at least not one available), because the insights you are hopefully learning are not the insights that Aristotle is trying to share. Aristotle might have highly summarizable insights, but what you want to know is how to be Aristotle, and nobody has necessarily developed an abstract model of how to be Aristotle from which summary statements can be extracted.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So it is not that the useful content being transmitted is of a special kind that is immune to being communicated as statements. It is just not actually known in statements. Nobody knows which aspects of being Aristotle are important, and nobody has successfully made a simplified summary. What we &#8216;know&#8217; is this one very detailed example. Much like if I showed you a bee because I thought I couldn’t communicate it in words—it would not be because bees are mysteriously indescribable, it would be that I haven’t developed the understanding required to describe what is important about it, so I’m just showing you the whole bee.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On this theory, if someone doesn’t realize what is going on, and tries to summarize Aristotle’s writings in the way that you would usually summarize the content of a passage, you entirely lose what was valuable about it. Much as you would if you summarized a video of a skater in motion into a description of the environment that they had interacted with. I hypothesize that this is roughly what happens, and is why it feels like summaries can’t capture what is important, and probably why translations seem bad always. Whenever a person tries to do a translation, they faithfully communicate the content of the thoughts at the expense of faithfully communicating the thinking procedure.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For instance, suppose I have a sentence like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1"">We have enough pieces of evidence to say that friendly banter is for counter-signaling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""p1"">If not quite the same words were available in a different language, it might get translated to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""p1"">We have seen enough evidence to know that friendly banter is for counter-signaling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""p1"">Which tells us something very similar about whether friendly banter is for counter-signaling.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But something subtle is lost about the process: in the initial statement, the author is suggesting that they are relying on the accretion of many separate pieces of evidence that may not have been independently compelling, whereas in the latter that is not clear. Over a long text, sentences like the former might give the reader an implicit understanding of how disparate and independently uncompelling evidence might be combined in the intuition of the author, without the issue ever being explicitly discussed. In the latter, this implication is entirely lost.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So I think this explains the sense that adequate summarization is impossible and translation is extremely difficult. At least, if we assume that people either don’t know what is really going on.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As an aside, I explained my theory to <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com"">Ben Hoffman</a>, and also asked him what on earth Plato was trying to do since when I tried to read him he made some points about fashion and sports that seemed worthy of a blog post, but maybe not of historical significance. Ben had a neat answer. He said Plato is basically doing the kind of summarization that a person who knew what was going on in my theory would do. He listened to Socrates a lot and thought that Socrates had interesting methods of thought. Then instead of summarizing Socrates’ points, he wrote fictionalized account of conversations with Socrates that condense and highlight the important elements of thinking and talking like Socrates.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This doesn’t explain why philosophy is different to physics (and basically all of the other subjects). Why would you want to be like Socrates, and not like Newton? Especially since Newton had more to show for his thoughts than an account of what his thoughts were like. I suspect the difference is that <i>because </i>physicists invent explicit machinery that can be easily taught, when you learn physics you spend your time mastering these tools. And perhaps in the process, you come to think in a way that fits well with these tools. Whereas in philosophy there is much less in the way of explicit methods to learn, so the most natural thing to learn is how to do whatever mental processes produce good philosophy. And since there is not a consensus on what they are like in the abstract, emulating existing good philosophers is a plausible way to proceed.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I was in the CMU philosophy department, which focuses on more formal methods that others might not class as philosophy—logic, algorithms for determining causality, game theory—and indeed in logic class we learned a lot of logical lemmas and did a lot of proofs and did not learn much about Frege or Gödel, though we did learn a bit about their history and thought at other point in the program.</p>
<p class=""p1"">(This story would suggest that in physics students are maybe missing out on learning the styles of thought that produce progress in physics. My guess is that instead they learn them in grad school when they are doing research themselves, by emulating their supervisors, and that the helpfulness of this might partially explain why Nobel prizewinner advisors beget Nobel prizewinner students.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">The story I hear about philosophy—and I actually don’t know how much it is true—is that as bits of philosophy come to have any methodological tools other than ‘think about it’, they break off and become their own sciences. So this would explain philosophy’s lone status in studying old thinkers rather than impersonal methods—philosophy is the lone ur-discipline without impersonal methods but thinking.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This suggests a research project: try summarizing what Aristotle is doing rather than Aristotle’s views. Then write a nice short textbook about it.</p>

<p>Instead of talking about what we've resolved to do in the New Year, we'll talk about, from looking back at what you <em>actually</em> did in the past year, what someone would <em>think</em> your New Year's resolutions were. Like revealed preferences, we're reverse-engineering what you were trying to do by looking at what you actually did.</p>

<p>This is an interesting exercise, and sometimes helps inform our goals for the next year and years to come.</p>

<p>For help getting into the building, please call (or text, with a likely-somewhat-slower response rate): 301-458-0764.</p>

<p><strong>Format:</strong></p>

<p>We meet and start hanging out at 6:15, but don’t officially start doing the meetup topic until 6:45-7 to accommodate stragglers. Usually there is a food order that goes out before we start the meetup topic.</p>

<p><strong>About these meetups:</strong></p>

<p>The mission of the SF LessWrong meetup is to provide a fun, low-key social space with some structured interaction, where new and non-new community members can mingle and have interesting conversations. Everyone is welcome.</p>

<p>We explicitly encourage people to split off from the main conversation or diverge from the topic if that would be more fun for them (moving side conversations into a separate part of the space if appropriate). Meetup topics are here as a tool to facilitate fun interaction, and we certainly don’t want them to inhibit it.</p></div>

(I'll be assuming that readers have read Anna's post, but not necessarily Phil's.) Using Anna's terminology, I take Phil to be talking about the dangers of merging buckets that started out as separate. Anna, on the other hand, is talking about how to deal with one bucket that should actually be several.</p>
<p>Phil argued (paraphrasing) that rationality can be dangerous because it leads to beliefs of the form ""<em>P</em> implies <em>Q</em>"". If you convince yourself of that implication, and you believe <em>P</em>, then you are compelled to believe <em>Q</em>. This is dangerous because your thinking about <em>P</em> might be infected by a bad meme. Now rationality has opened the way for this bad meme to infect your thinking about <em>Q</em>, too.</p>
<p>It's even worse if you reason yourself all the way to believing ""<em>P</em> if and only if <em>Q</em>"". Now any corruption in your thinking about either one of <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> will corrupt your thinking about the other. In terms of buckets: If you put ""Yes"" in the <em>P</em> bucket, you must put ""Yes"" in the <em>Q</em> bucket, and vice versa. In other words, the <em>P</em> bucket and the <em>Q</em> bucket are now effectively one and the same.</p>
<p>In this sense, Phil was pointing out that rationality merges buckets. (More precisely, rationality creates dependencies among buckets. In the extreme case, buckets become effectively identical). This can be bad for the reasons that Anna gives. Phil argues that some people resist rationality because their ""memetic immune system"" realizes that rational thinking might merge buckets inappropriately. To avoid this danger, people often operate on the principle that it's suspect even to consider merging buckets from different domains (e.g., religious scripture and personal life).</p>
<p>This suggests a way in which Anna's post works at the meta-level, too.</p>
<p>Phil's argument is that people resist rationality because, in effect, they've identified the two buckets ""Think rationally"" and ""Spread memetic infections"". They fear that saying ""Yes"" to ""Think rationally"" forces them to say ""Yes"" to the dangers inherent to merged buckets.</p>
<p>But Anna gives techniques for ""de-merging"" buckets in general if it turns out that some buckets were inappropriately merged, or if one bucket should have been several in the first place.</p>
<p>In other words, Anna's post essentially de-merges the two particular buckets ""Think rationally"" and ""Spread memetic infections"".

Read down to the comments for some great info on the topic.</em></p>
<p>I was introduced to the topic of AI alignment when I joined this very forum in 2014. Two years and one <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies"">""Superintelligence""</a> later, I decided that I should donate some money to the effort. I knew about MIRI, and I looked forward to reading some research comparing their work to the other organizations working in this space. The only problem is... <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/ai-risk#Who_else_is_working_on_this"">there really aren't any</a>.</p>
<p>MIRI recently announced&nbsp;<a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf"">a new research agenda</a>&nbsp;focused on ""agent foundations"". Yet even the Open Philanthropy Project, made up of people who at least share MIRI's broad worldview,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/machine-intelligence-research-institute-general-support"">can't decide whether that research direction is promising or useless</a>. The Berkeley&nbsp;<a href=""http://humancompatible.ai/"">Center for Human-Compatible AI</a>&nbsp;doesn't seem to have a specific research agenda beyond Stuart Russell. The&nbsp;<a href=""https://ai100.stanford.edu/"">AI100 Center</a>&nbsp;at Stanford is just kicking off. <em>That's it.</em></p>
<p>I think that there are two problems here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>There's no way to tell which current organization is going to make the most progress towards solving AI alignment.</li>
<li>These organizations are likely to be very similar to each other, not least because they practically share a zipcode. I don't think that MIRI and the academic centers will do the exact same research, but in the huge space of potential approaches to AI alignment they will likely end up pretty close together. Where's the group of evo-psych savvy philosophers who don't know anything about computer science but are working to spell out an approximation of universal human moral intuitions?</li>
</ol>
<div>It seems like there's a meta-question that needs to be addressed, even before any work is actually done on AI alignment itself:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to evaluate progress in AI alignment?</strong></p>
<p>Any answer to that question, even if not perfectly comprehensive or objective, will enable two things. First of all, it will allow us to direct money (and the best people) to the existing organizations where they'll make the most progress.</p>
<p>More importantly, it will enable us to open up the problem of AI alignment to the world and crowdsource it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the <a href=""http://www.xprize.org/"">XPrize Foundation</a> is a remarkable organization that creates competitions around achieving goals beneficial to humanity, from lunar rovers to ecological monitoring. The prizes have two huge benefits over direct investment in solving an issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>They usually attract a lot more effort than what the prize money itself would pay for. Competitors often spend in aggregate 2-10 times the prize amount in their efforts to win the competition.</li>
<li>The XPrizes attract a wide variety of creative entrants from around the world, because they only describe <em>what</em>&nbsp;needs to be done, not <em>how.</em></li>
</ol>
<div>So, why isn't there an XPrize for AI safety? You need very clear guidelines to create an honest competition, like <em>""<a href=""http://ansari.xprize.org/teams"">build the cheapest spaceship</a> that can take 3 people to 100km and be reused within 2 weeks""</em>. It doesn't seem like we're close to being able to formulate anything similar for AI alignment. It also seems that if anyone will have good ideas on the subject, it will be the people on this forum. So, what do y'all think?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Can we come up with creative ways to objectively measure some aspect of progress on AI safety, enough to set up a competition around it?</div>

<p>Most people would pass by this truck and not think twice about it. Most wouldn&#8217;t even think <em>once</em>. I pass by this truck and think: <em>20% of household is like 20 mil, so 10 households per tree per year sounds completely made up and I&#8217;ll bet 5:1 that this number is off by at least a factor of 2 and ConEdison are lying because everyone is innumerate.</em></p>
<p>Then I get home and do some Googling:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/183635/number-of-households-in-the-us/"" target=""_blank"">125 million households</a> in the United States. Generously assuming that they all get electrical bills, 20% of them are <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">25 million</span> households.</li>
<li>My own bill from ConEdison is 2 pages. If ConEdison cared about trees they&#8217;d use double sided printing, but let&#8217;s be generous again and assume <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">4 total pages</span> of paper statement per household per month, including the envelope and the check.</li>
<li>A letter sized page is 8.5&#8243; x 11&#8243;, or 216 mm x 279 mm, which comes out to 0.06 m<sup>2</sup>. Four pages have an area of <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">0.24 m<sup>2</sup></span>.</li>
<li>We needed the area calculation because paper weight is measured in GSM, or grams per square meter. Common <a href=""http://paperworks.com/about-paper-weights"" target=""_blank"">printer paper weighs 74 GSM</a>, so 0.24 square meters of that paper weigh 74 x 0.24 = <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">17.7 grams</span>.</li>
<li>17.7 grams of paper per month * 12 monthly bills = <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">213 grams </span>of paper per year per household that refuses to pay their bills online.</li>
<li>With 25 million households, that&#8217;s <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">5.3 million kg</span> of paper per year.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/blog/morning_roundup/2014/05/pulp-fiction-how-many-trees-does-it-take-to-make.html"" target=""_blank"">24 trees make 1 ton of printer paper</a>, so a single tree makes <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">41.7 kg</span>.</li>
<li>5.3 million / 41.7 = <strong><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">127,000 trees</span></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not &#8220;almost two million&#8221;, not even <em>within an order of magnitude</em> of two million. A mere 127,000 trees. For scale, that&#8217;s 0.25%  of the 50 million trees a single country can plant <em><a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/india-plants-50-million-trees-uttar-pradesh-reforestation/"" target=""_blank"">in a day</a></em>.</p>
<p>By the way, did I mention that I worked for a major paper manufacturer? American paper companies practically never log new forests. They mostly own the tree farms, which are basically small private forests, that supply the timber they need. Also, a fiber of paper can get recycled around 7 times before it becomes unusable, but often get recycled less because paper is so cheap that some recycling isn&#8217;t worth it on the margin.</p>
<p>If 100% of American households switched to unrecycled paper bills tomorrow, the paper industry would react by increasing the recycled paper content in products like paper towels and toilet tissue and recycling paper more times. They&#8217;ll also plant more trees in the tree farms, and supply will catch up to demand over a few years. If 100% of households switched <em>away from paper</em>, the tree farms (which in the process of growing into paper do nice things like capture CO<sub>2</sub> ) would be replaced by something else, like parking lots.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what ConEdison is really telling you:</p>

It rapidly became a part of our organizational social fabric, and is one of our highest-EV threads for outreach and dissemination, so it's long overdue for a public, formal explanation.</p><p>Note that while the core concept is fairly settled, the execution remains somewhat in flux, with notable experimentation coming from Julia Galef, Kenzi Amodei, Andrew Critch, Eli Tyre, Anna Salamon, myself, and others.  Because of that, this post will be less of a cake and more of a folk recipe—this is long and meandering on purpose, because the priority is to transmit the <em>generators</em> of the thing over the thing itself.  Accordingly, if you think you see stuff that's wrong or missing, you're probably onto something, and we'd appreciate having them added here as commentary.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p><strong>Casus belli</strong></p><p>To a first approximation, a human can be thought of as a black box that takes in data from its environment, and outputs beliefs and behaviors (that black box isn't really ""opaque"" given that we <em>do</em> have access to a lot of what's going on inside of it, but our understanding of our own cognition seems uncontroversially incomplete).</p><p>When two humans disagree—when their black boxes output different answers, as below—there are often a handful of unproductive things that can occur.</p><span><figure><img src=""http://www.rationality.org/assets/img/updates/double-crux-1.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>The most obvious (and tiresome) is that they'll simply repeatedly bash those outputs together without making any progress (think most disagreements over sports or politics; the people above just shouting ""triangle!"" and ""circle!"" louder and louder).  On the second level, people can (and often do) take the difference in output as evidence that <em>the other person's black box is broken</em> (i.e. they're bad, dumb, crazy) or that the other person <em>doesn't see the universe clearly</em> (i.e. they're biased, oblivious, unobservant).  On the third level, people will often <em>agree to disagree,</em> a move which preserves the social fabric at the cost of truth-seeking and actual progress.</p><p>Double crux in the ideal solves all of these problems, and in practice even fumbling and inexpert steps toward that ideal seem to produce a lot of marginal value, both in increasing understanding and in decreasing conflict-due-to-disagreement.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><p>This post will occasionally delineate two versions of double crux: a <em>strong </em>version<em>,</em> in which both parties have a shared understanding of double crux and have explicitly agreed to work within that framework, and a <em>weak </em>version<em>,</em> in which only one party has access to the concept, and is attempting to improve the conversational dynamic unilaterally.</p><p>In either case, the following things seem to be required:</p><ul><li><strong>Epistemic humility.</strong> The number one foundational backbone of rationality seems, to me, to be how readily one is able to think ""It's possible that <em>I</em> might be the one who's wrong, here.""  Viewed another way, this is the ability to take one's beliefs as <em>object</em>, rather than being <em>subject to them</em> and unable to set them aside (and then try on some other belief and productively imagine ""what would the world be like if <em>this</em> were true, instead of <em>that?""</em>).</li><li><strong>Good faith.</strong> An assumption that people believe things for <em>causal reasons</em>; a recognition that having been exposed to the same set of stimuli would have caused one to hold approximately the same beliefs; a default stance of holding-with-skepticism what seems to be evidence that the other party is bad or wants the world to be bad (because as monkeys it's not hard for us to <em>convince</em> ourselves that we have such evidence when we really don't).1</li><li><strong>Confidence in the existence of objective truth.</strong> I was tempted to call this ""objectivity,"" ""empiricism,"" or ""the Mulder principle,"" but in the end none of those quite fit.  In essence: a conviction that for almost any well-defined question, there <em>really truly is</em> a clear-cut answer.  That answer may be impractically or even impossibly difficult to find, such that we can't actually go looking for it and have to fall back on heuristics (e.g. how many grasshoppers are alive on Earth at this exact moment, is the color orange superior to the color green, why isn't there an audio book of Fight Club narrated by Edward Norton), but it nevertheless <em>exists.</em></li><li><strong>Curiosity and/or a desire to uncover truth.</strong>  Originally, I had this listed as truth-seeking alone, but my colleagues pointed out that one can move in the right direction simply by being curious about the other person and the contents of their map, without focusing directly on the territory.</li></ul><p>At CFAR workshops, we hit on the first and second through specific lectures, the third through osmosis, and the fourth through osmosis and a lot of relational dynamics work that gets people curious and comfortable with one another.  Other qualities (such as the ability to regulate and transcend one's emotions in the heat of the moment, or the ability to commit to a thought experiment and really wrestle with it) are also helpful, but not as critical as the above.  </p><br><p><strong>How to play</strong></p><p>Let's say you have a belief, which we can label A (for instance, ""middle school students should wear uniforms""), and that you're in disagreement with someone who believes some form of ¬A.  <em>Double cruxing</em> with that person means that you're both in search of a second statement B, with the following properties:</p><ul><li>You and your partner both disagree about B as well (you think B, your partner thinks ¬B).</li><li>The belief B is <em>crucial</em> for your belief in A; it is one of the <em>cruxes</em> of the argument.  If it turned out that B was <em>not</em> true, that would be sufficient to make you think A was false, too.</li><li>The belief ¬B is crucial for your partner's belief in ¬A, in a similar fashion.</li></ul><span><figure><img src=""http://www.rationality.org/assets/img/updates/double-crux-2.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p>In the example about school uniforms, B might be a statement like ""uniforms help smooth out unhelpful class distinctions by making it harder for rich and poor students to judge one another through clothing,"" which your partner might sum up as ""optimistic bullshit.""  Ideally, B is a statement that is somewhat <em>closer to reality</em> than A—it's more concrete, grounded, well-defined, discoverable, etc.  It's less about principles and summed-up, induced conclusions, and more of a glimpse into the structure that led to those conclusions.</p><p>(It doesn't have to <em>be</em> concrete and discoverable, though—often after finding B it's productive to start over in search of a C, and then a D, and then an E, and so forth, until you end up with something you can research or run an experiment on).</p><p>At first glance, it might not be clear why simply <em>finding</em> B counts as victory—shouldn't you <em>settle </em>B, so that you can conclusively choose between A and ¬A?  But it's important to recognize that arriving at B means you've <em>already</em> dissolved a significant chunk of your disagreement, in that you and your partner now <em>share a belief about the causal nature of the universe.</em></p><p>If B, then A.  Furthermore, if ¬B, then ¬A.  You've both agreed that the states of B are <em>crucial</em> for the states of A, and in this way your continuing ""agreement to disagree"" isn't just ""well, you take your truth and I'll take mine,"" but rather ""okay, well, let's see what the evidence shows.""  Progress!  And (more importantly) collaboration!</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p><strong>Methods</strong></p><p>This is where CFAR's versions of the double crux unit are currently weakest—there's some form of magic in the search for cruxes that we haven't quite locked down.  In general, the method is ""search through your cruxes for ones that your partner is likely to disagree with, and then compare lists.""  For some people and some topics, clearly identifying your own cruxes is easy; for others, it very quickly starts to <em>feel like</em> one's position is fundamental/objective/un-break-downable.</p><p>Tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Increase noticing of subtle tastes, judgments, and ""karma scores.""</strong>  Often, people suppress a lot of their opinions and judgments due to social mores and so forth.  Generally loosening up one's inner censors can make it easier to notice <em>why</em> we think X, Y, or Z.</li><li><strong>Look forward rather than backward.</strong>  In places where the question ""why?"" fails to produce meaningful answers, it's often more productive to try making predictions about the future.  For example, I might not know why I think school uniforms are a good idea, but if I turn on my narrative engine and start describing the better world I think will result, I can often sort of feel my way toward the underlying causal models.</li><li><strong>Narrow the scope.</strong>  A specific test case of ""Steve should've said hello to us when he got off the elevator yesterday"" is easier to wrestle with than ""Steve should be more sociable.""  Similarly, it's often easier to answer questions like ""How much of our next $10,000 should we spend on research, as opposed to advertising?"" than to answer ""Which is more important right now, research or advertising?""</li><li><strong>Do ""<a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/focusing-for-skeptics-6b949ef33a4f"">Focusing</a>"" and other resonance checks.</strong>  It's often useful to try on a perspective, hypothetically, and then pay attention to your intuition and bodily responses to refine your actual stance.  For instance: (<em>wildly asserts) </em>""I bet if everyone wore uniforms there would be a fifty percent reduction in bullying."" (<em>pauses, listens to inner doubts)</em>  ""Actually, scratch that—that doesn't seem true, now that I say it out loud, but there <em>is</em> something in the vein of reducing <em>overt</em> bullying, maybe?""</li><li><strong>Seek cruxes independently before anchoring on your partner's thoughts.</strong>  This one is fairly straightforward.  It's also worth noting that if you're attempting to find disagreements in the first place (e.g. in order to practice double cruxing with friends) this is an excellent way to start—give everyone the same ten or fifteen open-ended questions, and have everyone write down their own answers based on their own thinking, crystallizing opinions <em>before</em> opening the discussion.</li></ul><p>Overall, it helps to keep the <em>ideal</em> of a perfect double crux in the front of your mind, while holding the realities of your actual conversation somewhat separate.  We've found that, at any given moment, increasing the ""double cruxiness"" of a conversation tends to be useful, but worrying about how far from the ideal you are in absolute terms doesn't.  It's all about doing what's useful and productive in the moment, and that often means making sane compromises—if one of you has clear cruxes and the other is floundering, it's fine to focus on one side.  If neither of you can find a single crux, but instead each of you has something like eight co-cruxes of which any five are sufficient, just say so and then move forward in whatever way seems best.</p><p>(Variant: a ""trio"" double crux conversation in which, at any given moment, if you're the least-active participant, your job is to squint at your two partners and try to model what each of them is saying, and where/why/how they're talking past one another and failing to see each other's points.  Once you have a rough ""translation"" to offer, do so—at that point, you'll likely become more central to the conversation and someone else will rotate out into the squinter/translator role.)</p><p>Ultimately, each move should be in service of reversing the usual antagonistic, warlike, ""win at all costs"" dynamic of most disagreements.  Usually, we spend a significant chunk of our mental resources guessing at the shape of our opponent's belief structure, forming hypotheses about what things are crucial and lobbing arguments at them in the hopes of knocking the whole edifice over.  Meanwhile, we're incentivized to obfuscate our own belief structure, so that our opponent's attacks will be ineffective.</p><p>(This is also terrible because it means that we often fail to even <em>find</em> the crux of the argument, and waste time in the weeds.  If you've ever had the experience of awkwardly fidgeting while someone spends ten minutes assembling a conclusive proof of some tangential sub-point that never even had the <em>potential</em> of changing your mind, then you know the value of someone being willing to say ""Nope, this isn't going to be relevant for me; try speaking to <em>that</em> instead."")</p><p>If we can move the debate to a place where, instead of <em>fighting</em> over the truth, we're <em>collaborating</em> on a search for understanding, then we can recoup a lot of wasted resources.  You have a tremendous comparative advantage at knowing the shape of your own belief structure—if we can switch to a mode where we're each looking inward and candidly sharing insights, we'll move forward <em>much</em> more efficiently than if we're each engaged in guesswork about the other person.  This requires that we want to know the <em>actual truth</em> (such that we're incentivized to seek out flaws and falsify wrong beliefs in ourselves just as much as in others) and that we feel emotionally and socially safe with our partner, but there's a doubly-causal dynamic where a tiny bit of double crux spirit up front can <em>produce</em> safety and truth-seeking, which allows for more double crux, which produces more safety and truth-seeking, etc.</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p><strong>Pitfalls</strong></p><p>First and foremost, it matters whether you're in the strong version of double crux (cooperative, consent-based) or the weak version (you, as an agent, trying to improve the conversational dynamic, possibly in the face of direct opposition).  In particular, if someone is currently riled up and conceives of you as rude/hostile/the enemy, then saying something like ""I just think we'd make better progress if we talked about the <em>underlying reasons</em> for our beliefs"" doesn't sound like a plea for cooperation—it sounds like a trap.</p><p>So, if you're in the weak version, the primary strategy is to embody the question <strong>""What do you see that I don't?""</strong>  In other words, approach from a place of explicit humility and good faith, drawing out their belief structure <em>for its own sake, </em>to see and appreciate it rather than to undermine or attack it.  In my experience, people can ""smell it"" if you're just playing at good faith to get them to expose themselves; if you're having trouble really getting into the spirit, I recommend meditating on times in your past when you were embarrassingly wrong, and how you felt <em>prior</em> to realizing it compared to <em>after</em> realizing it.</p><p>(If you're unable or unwilling to swallow your pride or set aside your sense of justice or fairness hard enough to really do this, that's <strong>actually fine</strong>; not every disagreement benefits from the double-crux-nature.  But if your <em>actual goal</em> is improving the conversational dynamic, then this is a cost you want to be prepared to pay—going the extra mile, because a) going what <em>feels like</em> an appropriate distance is more often an undershoot, and b) going an <em>actually appropriate</em> distance may not be enough to overturn their entrenched model in which you are The Enemy.  Patience- and sanity-inducing rituals recommended.)</p><p>As a further tip that's good for either version but particularly important for the weak one, <em>model</em> the behavior you'd like your partner to exhibit.  Expose your <em>own</em> belief structure, show how your <em>own</em> beliefs might be falsified, highlight points where you're uncertain and visibly integrate their perspective and information, etc.  In particular, if you don't want people running amok with wrong models of what's going on in <em>your</em> head, make sure you're not acting like you're the authority on what's going on in <em>their</em> head.</p><p>Speaking of non-sequiturs, beware of getting lost in the fog.  The very first step in double crux should <em>always</em> be to operationalize and clarify terms.  Try attaching numbers to things rather than using misinterpretable qualifiers; try to talk about what would be observable in the world rather than how things feel or what's good or bad.  In the school uniforms example, saying ""uniforms make students feel better about themselves"" is a <em>start,</em> but it's not enough, and going further into quantifiability (if you think you could actually get numbers someday) would be even better.  <strong>Often, disagreements will ""dissolve"" as soon as you remove ambiguity—this is success, not failure!</strong></p><p>Finally, <em>use paper and pencil,</em> or whiteboards, or get people to treat specific predictions and conclusions as immutable objects (if you or they want to change or update the wording, that's <em>encouraged</em>, but make sure that at any given moment, you're working with a clear, unambiguous statement).  Part of the value of double crux is that it's the <em>opposite</em> of the weaselly, score-points, hide-in-ambiguity-and-look-clever dynamic of, say, a public political debate.  The goal is to have everyone understand, at all times and as much as possible, what the other person is <em>actually</em> trying to say—not to try to get a straw version of their argument to stick to them and make them look silly.  Recognize that <em>you yourself</em> may be tempted or incentivized to fall back to that familiar, fun dynamic, and take steps to keep yourself in ""scout mindset"" rather than ""soldier mindset.""</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p><p>This is the double crux algorithm as it currently exists in our handbook.  It's not strictly connected to all of the discussion above; it was designed to be read in context with an hour-long lecture and several practice activities (so it has some holes and weirdnesses) and is presented here more for completeness and as food for thought than as an actual conclusion to the above.</p><p><strong>1. Find a disagreement with another person</strong></p><ul><li>A case where you believe one thing and they believe the other</li><li>A case where you and the other person have different confidences (e.g. you think X is 60% likely to be true, and they think it’s 90%)</li></ul><p><strong>2. Operationalize the disagreement</strong></p><ul><li>Define terms to avoid getting lost in semantic confusions that miss the real point</li><li>Find specific test cases—instead of (e.g.) discussing whether you should be more outgoing, instead evaluate whether you should have said hello to Steve in the office yesterday morning</li><li>Wherever possible, try to think in terms of actions rather than beliefs—it’s easier to evaluate arguments like “we should do X before Y” than it is to converge on “X is better than Y.”</li></ul><p><strong>3. Seek double cruxes</strong></p><ul><li>Seek your own cruxes independently, and compare with those of the other person to find overlap</li><li>Seek cruxes collaboratively, by making claims (“I believe that X will happen because Y”) and focusing on falsifiability (“It would take A, B, or C to make me stop believing X”)</li></ul><p><strong>4. Resonate</strong></p><ul><li>Spend time “inhabiting” both sides of the double crux, to confirm that you’ve found the core of the disagreement (as opposed to something that will ultimately fail to produce an update)</li><li>Imagine the resolution as an if-then statement, and use your inner sim and other checks to see if there are any unspoken hesitations about the truth of that statement</li></ul><p><strong>5. Repeat!</strong></p><br><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>We think double crux is super sweet.  To the extent that you see flaws in it, we want to find them and repair them, and we're currently betting that <em>repairing and refining double crux</em> is going to pay off better than <em>try something totally different.</em>  In particular, we believe that embracing the spirit of this mental move has huge potential for unlocking people's abilities to wrestle with all sorts of complex and heavy hard-to-parse topics (like existential risk, for instance), because it provides a format for holding a bunch of partly-wrong models at the same time while you distill the value out of each.</p><p>Comments appreciated; critiques highly appreciated; anecdotal data from experimental attempts to teach yourself double crux, or teach it to others, or use it on the down-low without telling other people what you're doing <strong>extremely</strong> appreciated.</p><p>- Duncan Sabien</p><hr class=""dividerBlock""><p>[1]One reason good faith is important is that even when people are ""wrong,"" they are usually <em>partially</em> right—there are flecks of gold mixed in with their false belief that can be productively mined by an agent who's interested in getting the whole picture.  Normal disagreement-navigation methods have some tendency to throw out that gold, either by allowing everyone to protect their original belief set or by replacing everyone's view with whichever view is shown to be ""best,"" thereby throwing out data, causing information cascades, disincentivizing ""<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/"">noticing your confusion</a>,"" etc.</p><p>The central assumption is that the universe is like a large and complex maze that each of us can only see parts of.  To the extent that language and communication allow us to gather info about parts of the maze without having to investigate them ourselves, that's great.  But when we disagree on what to do <em>because</em> we each see a different slice of reality, it's nice to adopt methods that allow us to integrate and synthesize, rather than methods that force us to pick and pare down.  It's like the parable of the three blind men and the elephant—whenever possible, avoid generating a bottom-line conclusion until you've accounted for <em>all</em> of the available data.</p><span><figure><img src=""http://www.rationality.org/assets/img/updates/double-crux-3.png"" class=""draft-image center"" style=""width:40%""></figure></span><p><em>The agent at the top mistakenly believes that the correct move is to head to the left, since that seems to be the most direct path toward the goal.

I was in the middle of getting my graduate degree, struggling to keep up with the demands of school, teaching, friends, and romance, and although I wasn&#x2019;t drowning&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;that would come a couple years later&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;I was fighting to tread water. Learning about GTD was like being thrown a life preserver.</p><p>The core idea of GTD is simple: write down everything you want to do in a trusted system, keep the info in the system honest and up-to-date, then look at the system to figure out what to do. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if your system consists of scraps of paper, emails, a spreadsheet, or fancy to do software: as long as you trust it to include everything and be available, it acts as a sort of extended memory that you can offload your worries to. This let&#x2019;s you get things done because the system is more reliable than your memory alone and it frees your mind to focus on the here and now rather than everything else you could be doing.</p><p>I&#x2019;m happy to say that GTD changed my life! I went from forgetting to do things to remembering everything and from spending hours worrying about all the things I wasn&#x2019;t doing to spending hours <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/fluid-decision-making-d8e4e41a51c0"">in flow</a>. My grades improved, teaching was less stressful, I had more time for friends, and I managed to do one or two romantic things. It gave me so much more capacity for doing stuff that it even created time for me to spend telling other people about how great GTD was. Everywhere I looked I saw problems in people&#x2019;s lives that could be solved if they would just read Allen&#x2019;s short book. My life was made better, and I wanted share my new-found wisdom with anyone who would listen.</p><p>But I often found myself in the position of a zealot preaching salvation upon deaf ears. Most people weren&#x2019;t that interested in my advice to try GTD, and some people even found it offensive. &#x201C;What do you mean I should use a system instead of my memory? That doesn&#x2019;t feel natural&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;it takes all the soul out of my actions!&#x201D; I myself even eventually turned against GTD, finding a strong need for less structure. The great advice that had helped me so much just didn&#x2019;t seem to work for other people, including my future self.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve seen this happen to lots of other folks, too, where they discover an idea that changes their life and then have difficulty sharing it with others. Instead of increased productivity, they might get advice that helps them lose weight or dress better, or they might pick up a whole bundle of ideas like a religion or philosophy that helps them experience greater satisfaction with their life. In all cases it <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/"">feels from the inside</a> like finding the secret to winning at life. But then something happens when you try to share the secret with others, and most people ultimately reject it. And after you see this pattern enough times you start to notice that advice is awfully hard to give.</p><p>From an economic perspective this must be so. For one, if advice were easy to give there would be no business in it, yet we find entire fields of professionals&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;therapists, doctors, pastors, gurus&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;who make a living in part or in whole because people pay them to be expert personal advice givers. Further, if it were easy to give advice we&#x2019;d expect there to be very little of it left to give that could help much: we&#x2019;d expect everyone to have already taken up all the advice that generates most of the value leaving us with diminishing marginal returns on additional advice. But since we don&#x2019;t live in such a counterfactual universe where few give advice and most advice is heeded, giving advice must be hard.</p><p>Despite this, I&#x2019;m going to try to share some advice anyway. I have no reason to suspect I&#x2019;m more likely than most to have greater than average success at conveying advice. Nor am I even sure this is the advice you need, because as often as not someone needs <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/"">exactly the opposite</a> of the advice you&#x2019;re giving. But I&#x2019;m pretty sure that this advice may be tremendously useful to some, and so on the occasion of a new year when people are traditionally more open to hearing advice and trying new things to achieve their goals, I&#x2019;ll take the risk that I might help someone.</p><p>It&#x2019;s in this spirit that I advise you, act into fear.</p><p>The idea is simple. If you are afraid of something, do it. Afraid of talking on the phone? Talk on the phone. Afraid of telling your crush of your unrequited affections? Tell them. Afraid of not standing up for yourself? Let someone dominate you. And if no fears immediately come to mind, go looking for them so you can act into them. In doing so you can free yourself from fear and gain the capacity to more often make well-considered decisions.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not immediately obvious that you&#x2019;d want to overcome fear, though. It alerts us to dangerous situations and causes us to avoid such situations or engage in them with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperarousal"">hyperarousal</a>. Fear exists because it kept our ancestors alive, and given we see evidence of fear in almost all animals, it likely originated hundreds of millions of years ago, so we&#x2019;re probably already operating near the evolutionarily optimal amount of fear. Except that humans have undergone <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-has-human-brain-evolved/"">recent, rapid increase in brain size</a> which, based on comparisons of humans to other animals, gave us <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/a-foundation-for-the-multipart-psyche-79a66292a7a"">greater ability to think about patterns abstracted away from details</a>. This gives us an advantage in long-term planning and ratiocination in general, so it seems likely we could use that to achieve more preferred results than our ancient fear responses produce, especially since <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/06/self-control-is-slavery.html"">survival in the modern world depends less on making quick decisions and more on impulse control</a>. But, that&#x2019;s only possible if we can think and act based less on fear and more on reasoning.</p><p>To lessen fear, we must understand it. In the broadest sense, fear is an emotional response to the possibility of violated preferences. At the extreme, fear neuroses and phobias tend to be focused on a strong preference to not experience particular things, like spiders, open spaces, or heights. More commonly, fears tend to be about those things we&#x2019;d rather not face or will only face from a fighting stance, like confrontation, failure, and hardship. That we talk of &#x201C;facing&#x201D; fears means we often perceive them as external to us and that we can make ourselves safe from them if we stay away from, defeat, or otherwise eliminate them. But as anyone who has tried to contemplate their own death knows, fear can also come from within, and so fear must encompass many feelings born of not getting what one wants.</p><p>Defining fear so broadly, we must accept it to include and be tied to what we often consider separate emotions, such as worry (fear of future events), anger (a possible response to fear), and depression (systemic sadness from experiencing feared things). We can call all of this <a href=""http://www.lionsroar.com/what-is-suffering-10-buddhist-teachers-weigh-in/"">suffering in the Buddhist sense</a>, where fear points to any violation of your expectations of how you would like the world to be and a failure to accept the world as it is. This is the <a href=""http://www.lionsroar.com/fear-and-fearlessness-what-the-buddhists-teach/"">broad sense of fear</a> I mean when I advise you to act into it.</p><p>And with fear so broadly understood, it seems changing your behavior to act into fear could include nearly any intervention that remotely touches on fear. If we consider religious and philosophical interventions&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;asking yourself what Jesus would do, following the example of Confucius, aspiring to live by the Sharia&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;this seems to be the case. They are largely about increased self-control to approach an ideal, and as such must ultimately address fears that hinder acting on ideals. But some interventions do more to directly address fear than others, and psychology has made a science of directly intervening to overcoming fear.</p><p>Psychotherapy, which seeks to correct maladaptive thinking, has <a href=""http://phobialist.com/treat.html"">long recommended</a> facing fears as a cure. The most recent form of this, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"">cognitive behavioral exposure therapy</a>, has been <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735805001005"">successful applied</a> in treating phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, and some cases of depression and anxiety. This is a direct application of the advice to act into fear, and it has given some people their lives back. But this only addresses pathological fear. What about addressing &#x201C;healthy&#x201D; levels of fear?</p><p>Positive psychology, which focuses on maximizing preference satisfaction, has also found value in acting into fear. We find this throughout the self-help literature, quintessentially expressed in <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/653396.Feel_the_Fear_and_Do_It_Anyway"">Susan Jeffer&#x2019;s <em>Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway</em></a>, a book laying out a way of doing exactly what it says in the title. Similar sentiments can be found in <a href=""https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit1.php"">Habit 1</a> of <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/07/24/the-only-thing-you-need-to-remember-about-the-seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people/"">Stephen Covey&#x2019;s <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em></a>, <a href=""http://www.nathanielbranden.com/what-self-esteem-is-and-is-not"">Nathaniel Branden&#x2019;s</a> <em><a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79352.Six_Pillars_of_Self_Esteem"">The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem</a></em>, and even in the foundational <em><a href=""https://www.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-summary"">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></em>. This pattern continues with modern applications of psychological research operationalized for management training and organizational development, exemplified by Kegan and Lahey&#x2019;s <a href=""http://www.extension.harvard.edu/inside-extension/surprising-reason-we-dont-keep-our-resolutions-how-overcome-it"">immunity maps</a> that lever on worries, which is to say fears.</p><p>And thus, as is so often the case in my thinking, it <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/in-defense-of-kegan-2ed7ab51b4c8"">comes back to Kegan</a>. Exposure therapy showed me that debilitating fears could be assuaged, positive psychology pointed me towards overcoming fear in broader contexts, but ultimately Kegan and developmental psychology showed me why we should ultimately expect this to work and be desirable.</p><p>The fundamental animating process of developmental psychology is resolution of confusion by creating more complex modes of understanding. To put it concretely, babies turn into children turn into adults by first not understanding the world and then exploring it until they understand it so well that it gives them <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/the-developmental-role-of-play-443549cfed3b"">new frames for thinking</a>. When we&#x2019;re young this process mostly happens without conscious effort because the <a href=""https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/"">world demands we develop a more complete understanding of it</a> in order to get the things we need to survive and thrive, but as we reach adulthood it&#x2019;s increasingly possible to get by without understanding more. By making clever choices in the company we keep and the cultures we engage, as adults we can <a href=""http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674445888"">insulate ourselves from the fullness of the world</a>, and by doing so cut ourselves off from the need for further development.</p><p>Key to creating such a buffer against further psychological development is fear. Fear is like a fence, keeping a person &#x201C;safe&#x201D; by separating them from the things that would challenge their understanding of the world. Fear keeps out new info that would invalidate existing beliefs and <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/debate-and-dialectic-850b3585dad4#.rdjz8m2f1"">creates a bubble</a> inside which only confirming evidence can be found. Fear protects us from cognitive dissonance, but in so doing cuts off the vital confusion that helps us grow in our complexity to make sense of the world.</p><p>And making sense of confusion is not just the purview of psychology and science. Philosophy has long observed that fear inhibits growth by protecting oneself from the world. After all, developmental psychology came out of that very observation as expressed in Continental and Analytic philosophy. And as mentioned, in Buddhist thinking fear is key to understanding suffering and ultimately finding relief from it. So let&#x2019;s conclude by seeing what we can learn about fear from Daoist philosophy.</p><p>In <a href=""http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html#13"">Chapter 13 of the <em>Daodejing</em></a>, Laozi says this on fear:</p><blockquote>What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?<br>Hope and fear are both phantoms<br>that arise from thinking of the self.<br>When we don&#x2019;t see the self as self,<br>what do we have to fear?</blockquote><p>What does it mean that fear is a phantom that arises from thinking of the self? I interpret this as saying that fear is experienced only by virtue of seeing the self as something apart from <a href=""https://medium.com/@gworley3/holonic-integration-927ba21d774b"">the holon of the world</a>. The <em>Daodejing</em> then recommends that fear can be eliminated via extinction of the self as something apart from the world by understanding it as both <a href=""https://meaningness.com/meaningness"">integrated with the whole and having differentiating internal structure</a>. Such a complete stance evaporates fear by giving it no means of replenishing itself. It does the same to hope.</p><p>As Laozi says, hope is as much a phantom as fear. Properly stated, hope is the dual of fear&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;the feeling felt when you have a preference for things to be a particular way. And being its dual, all that is true of fear is also true of hope, so the dual of the advice &#x201C;act into fear&#x201D; is &#x201C;<a href=""http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%99-the-broadcast/"">abandon all hope</a>&#x201D;. This is the insight that Western thinking often misses, that psychological development requires not just succeeding in the face of failure but also failing in the face of success. To quote Chapter 13 of the <em>Daodejing</em> again:</p><blockquote>What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure?<br>Whether you go up the ladder or down it,<br>you position is shaky.<br>When you stand with your two feet on the ground,<br>you will always keep your balance.</blockquote><p>So in this new year and all days to come, I encourage you to keep your balance by acting into fear and abandoning all hope, for as Laozi concludes Chapter 13:</p><blockquote>See the world as your self.<br>Have faith in the way things are.<br>Love the world as your self;<br>then you can care for all things.<figure><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*AlRigT2-jOznGzLW2jzjhw.jpeg"" class=""draft-image "" style=""width:40%""></figure></blockquote>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

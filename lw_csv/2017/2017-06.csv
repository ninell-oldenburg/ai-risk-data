pJFQ2ybwxvgtjYyDM,Anecdotal panic prevention strategies,anecdotal-panic-prevention-strategies,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pJFQ2ybwxvgtjYyDM/anecdotal-panic-prevention-strategies,2017-06-30T22:00:56.000Z,1,1,1,False,False,,"<p>I have panic attacks somewhere between every few months and multiple times per week. At the moment it seems to be mostly restricted to when I wake up and haven&#8217;t got the hang of being a human again yet, so it isn&#8217;t a huge problem.</p>
<p>But when it is, I have often found that eating honey vastly and quickly improves the problem. Not sugar, not sugar syrup, just honey. Not after the sugar has reached my bloodstream, but when it touches my tongue. Often not in a ‘hmm, I guess I feel better?’ way, but in a ‘I was tumbling head over heels down a hill, and then it just stopped’ way.</p>
<p>I’m hesitant to point this out much, because 1) it doesn’t make any sense, which suggests it is imaginary and 2) I feel uncomfortable about the whole complicated and murky landscape of people giving often unwanted advice, with various motives, about awkward things, that probably only work for that person, and probably only do so because of the placebo effect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I caused someone else to try this, who also found that it worked. Plus as far as I can tell having an additional thing to try if you are having a panic attack is good, even if it turns out not to work. And I dislike the equilibrium where people who do have useful advice in expectation are worried about sharing it in case they seem annoying.</p>
<p>So, if anyone else has panic attacks and feels like trying this out, I am curious to hear how it goes. I usually squeeze half a teaspoon of honey or so into a spoon and eat it straight.</p>
<p style=""text-align:center;"">***</p>
<p>Since I already maybe mostly have the attention of people interested in panic attack relief, below is my longer list of things I have found probably-useful over the years (in more expected, explicable, hit-or-miss, or time-taking ways).</p>
<p><strong>Collected panic attack mitigation strategies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Honey</li>
<li> <a href=""https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/dance-dance-evaluation/"">Playing DDR</a> (both as a thing to do actually during a panic attack, and as a really good way to get prophylactic exercise if you find leaving your room or committing to more than five seconds of exercise aversive, e.g. because you have an anxiety disorder.)</li>
<li> Saying &#8216;I can be anxious and still be in control&#8217;, and noticing over time that this is true, every time.</li>
<li>Estimating how long panic attacks go for, looking at a clock, noting at what time this one will probably be done, and expecting/planning/predicting to feel better then. Maybe kind of thinking of the clock as a machine that is resolving the problem, and will be done when it gets to the seven or whatever.</li>
<li>Counting slowly to five during each breath, and holding breath after out-breath while counting to two, about five times.</li>
<li>Listening to Au Fond Du Temple Saint sung by Jussi Bjorling and Robert Merrill. If you are looking for music which bears the same relation to you as that song does to me, my guess is that the relevant feature is either &#8216;literally impedes breathing&#8217; or something to do with feelings. Some other songs that only affect feelings seem to help too, but I think in a different way.</li>
<li>Measuring heart-rate repeatedly and trying to make it go down (breathing slowly helps often).</li>
<li>Playing Civ IV or some other computer games, though this often seems to just distract me while prolonging the panic attack. Which is useful if you are in an inconvenient situation for freaking out, and expect to be in a better one in three hours.</li>
<li>Really engaging and distracting activities in general, e.g. writing a song.</li>
<li>Spending time with particular people.</li>
<li>Being held tightly or under a weighted blanket</li>
<li> Sipping straight gin</li>
<li>Going for a walk</li>
<li>Eating food, drinking, lying down, averting pain, becoming the right temperature etc, as needed— (I am weirdly bad at remembering to do these, and admit I have a list of things that animals need to live, that I look at if I am worried that I have forgotten one.)</li>
<li>Swearing a lot</li>
<li>Setting a five minute timer and ignore it with intent to freak out in five minutes</li>
<li>Noting that the situation is not your fault, if it is not. If it is, note determinism.</li>
<li>Calculating the probability of any specific concerns, given the evidence. (e.g. &#8216;it seems like I can&#8217;t breathe. how often does that happen without me dying? Every three days, but this time seems different. How often does this time seem different? Every six days&#8230; How often does it happen that a person feels like they can&#8217;t breathe because they are dying, when they are in their twenties? Well, women in their twenties die about once in three thousand years of living, and probably no more than one percent of those deaths are preceded by feeling like they can&#8217;t breathe. So maybe once in three hundred thousand years, versus 60 times per year for non-death causes of feeling like you can&#8217;t breathe, for a one in 18 million chance this is the death one. And I&#8217;m probably not off by more than three orders of magnitude as a result of hyperventilating impeding my ability to do math, so lets say a one in ten thousand chance very pessimistically.. sounds like I should at least anticipate surviving..)</li>
<li>Thinking about how good reason is, and how right it is for it to triumph over feelings (as direct determinant of actions), and how passionately loyal to reason you feel, and what a great strength-giving rock to which you owe everything of value it is (&#8230;and how if you were going to trust your feelings over reason, they would just tell you how great reason is anyway, so it is only reasonable to trust reason more, which is good because it is what you feel like&#8230;) YMMV.</li>
<li>Doing whatever hard to describe mental motions get you into a mental state appropriate for marching up a mountain, or being reasonable, or doing something other than freaking out, if you have different mental stances like this.</li>
<li>I have found various drugs useful for being less anxious, notably (at different times) an SSRI and St John&#8217;s Wort, though both had confusing effects. I am sure better advice has been written about this.</li>

5bd75cc58225bf0670375468,A cheating approach to the tiling agents problem,a-cheating-approach-to-the-tiling-agents-problem,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375468/a-cheating-approach-to-the-tiling-agents-problem,2017-06-30T13:56:46.000Z,4,3,3,False,False,,"<html><head></head><body><p>(This post resulted from a conversation with Wei Dai.)</p>
<p>Formalizing the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jca/walkthrough_of_the_tiling_agents_for/"">tiling agents problem</a> is very delicate. In this post I'll show a toy problem and a solution to it, which arguably meets all the desiderata, but only by cheating in a new and unusual way.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of the toy problem: we ask an agent to solve a difficult math question and also design a successor agent. Then the successor solves another math question and designs its own successor, and so on. The questions get harder each time, so they can't all be solved in advance, and each of them requires believing in Peano arithmetic (PA). This goes on for a fixed number of rounds, and the final reward is the number of correct answers.</p>
<p>Moreover, we will demand that the agent must handle both subtasks (solving the math question and designing the successor) using the same logic. Finally, we will demand that the agent be able to reproduce itself at each round, not just design a custom-made successor that solves the math question with PA and reproduces itself by quining.</p>
<hr>
<p>To nail down the formalization, we will use good old computable programs with proof limits, not oracles or modal formulas. The universe program U will contain the agent program A as a subprogram, and A will know the full source code of U (including A) by diagonalization. At each round, the agent will receive the text of a math question as input, and return a pair consisting of the answer to the math question and the source code of the successor agent.</p>
<p>The math questions will be of the form ""you're allowed to use N_i computation steps, here's the source code of a program P_i, what does it return?"" The programs P_i will be chosen so that N_i steps isn't enough to run them, but is more than enough to find a PA proof that P_i returns some particular value.</p>
<p>To give the agent some assurance of the above, the universe program will use the following transparent procedure to evaluate the agent's answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Run P_i to determine the right answer, and compare it with the agent's answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that there exist PA proofs about P_i that can be found in much fewer than N_i computation steps. Ignore the answers found in the proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increment the agent's utility if (1) succeeded or (2) failed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will also assume that all math questions are so difficult, and all N_i are so large, that doing any fixed work up front is a rounding error by comparison.</p>
<hr>
<p>The above sounds like a fair formulation of the tiling agents problem, right? The Vingean principle is satisfied because the initial agent doesn't have enough time to solve all math questions up front. The tiling principle is satisfied because we want a solution that will reproduce itself at each round. The naturalistic principle is satisfied because we want to uniformly handle both subtasks (solve the math question and design a successor).</p>
<p>Now I will show a solution that seems to meet all desiderata. It will be based on the formal theory PA+Con(PA) (which is the weakest possible, because the problem requires creating successors that trust PA). But you will still say that I'm cheating.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let the agent A be this program:</p>
<p>""Ignore my input at first. Using a small number of computation steps, and using PA+Con(PA) as the formal theory, search for programs B such that, if all instances of A internally delegate all input-output to B, then U will provably return some particular utility. Then internally delegate to the B that leads to the highest utility found.""</p>
<p>Then A will be able to prove that delegating to the following program B will lead to utility equal to number of rounds:</p>
<p>""Accept P_i and N_i as input. Using slightly fewer than N_i computation steps, and using PA as the formal theory, find the first proof that P_i returns some particular value. Then return that value and designate A as successor.""</p>
<p>The proof is obvious. If A internally delegates to B on the first round, then it will delegate to the same B on all subsequent rounds, because it ignores the input while choosing B. That fact is easily provable in PA. Then B goes on to handle the inputs on different rounds and wins all of them, which is easily provable in PA+Con(PA), due to the way the universe program verifies the answers. At each round B designates A as successor, which rubber-stamps B again, and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>You could say that A fails the Vingean principle, but that wouldn't be fair. After all, A indeed can't solve all questions in advance, because it doesn't have enough time. It only solves the question ""which B to run internally?"" in advance, giving the same answer redundantly each time, but that's just an implementation detail. If you didn't know how A worked internally, you wouldn't object to it.</p>
<p>Of course it's not guaranteed that A will reproduce itself. It knows that reproducing itself will lead to utility equal to number of rounds, and we happen to know that higher utility isn't achievable, but the same utility could be achieved in other ways (e.g. by outputting a B that delegates to itself directly, instead of going through A). But that's not a strong objection, because given the right tie-breaking, A will indeed reproduce itself.</p>
<p>Moreover, the approach of A looks quite general, without anything specific to this problem. It can also deal with all the usual UDT test cases, like Newcomb's Problem, as well as all imaginable tiling problems that are amenable to quining. So someone optimistic could say that A is a version of UDT that solves the tiling agents problem!</p>
<p>That would be unsatisfactory though. It looks more like A has found a trick that leads to quining in a roundabout way. I feel that the people working on tiling agents wouldn't accept my solution, but I can't quite figure out which new principle would rule it out. Perhaps some kind of ""no meta-quining principle""? Do humans obey that principle, or do they have intuitions like ""solve decision theory in the abstract and delegate to that"" which sound suspiciously like my agent? It's tricky and my thinking is very confused right now.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In my conversations with members of the rationalist community as well as in my readings of various articles and blog posts produced by them (as well as outside), I&rsquo;ve noticed a recent trend towards skepticism of Bayesian principles and philosophy (see Nostalgebraist&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPpKDai-TUAhXD7YMKHfqpB_4QFggoMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnostalgebraist.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161645122124%2Fbayes-a-kinda-sorta-masterpost&amp;usg=AFQjCNEos7o5R2hgXUdlnp3k-dH1PEX4cg"">recent post</a> for an example), which I have regarded with both surprise and a little bit of dismay, because I think progress within a community tends to be indicated by moving forward to new subjects and problems rather than a return to old ones that have already been extensively argued for and discussed. So the intent of this post is to summarize a few of the claims I&rsquo;ve seen being put forward and try to point out where I believe these have gone wrong.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It&rsquo;s also somewhat an odd direction for discussion to be going in, because the academic statistics community has largely moved on from debates between Bayesian and Frequentist theory, and has largely come to accept both the Bayesian and the Frequentist / Fisherian viewpoints as valid. When E.T. Jaynes wrote his famous book, the debate was mostly still raging on, and many questions had yet to be answered. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, statisticians have mostly come to accept a world in which both approaches exist and have their merits.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Because I will be defending the Bayesian side here, there is a risk that this post will come off as being dogmatic. We are a community devoted to free-thought after all, and any argument towards a form of orthodoxy might be perceived as an attempt to stifle dissenting viewpoints. That is not my intent here, and in fact I plan on arguing against Bayesian dogmatism as well. My goal is to argue that having a base framework with which to feel relatively high confidence in is useful to the goals of the community, and that if we feel high enough confidence in it, then spending&nbsp; extra effort trying to prove it false might be wasting brainpower than can potentially be used on more interesting or useful tasks. There could always be a point we reach where most of us strongly feel that unless we abandon Bayesianism, we can&rsquo;t make any further progress. I highly doubt that we have reached such a point or that we ever will.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is also a personal exercise to test my understanding of Bayesian theory and my ability to communicate it. My hope is that if my ideas here are well presented, it should be much easier for both myself and others to find flaws with it and allow me to update.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I will start with an outline of philosophical Bayesianism, also called &ldquo;Strong Bayesianism&rdquo;, or what I prefer to call it, &ldquo;One Magisterium Bayes.&rdquo; The reason for wanting to refer to it as being a single magisterium will hopefully become clear. The Sequences did argue for this point of view, however, I think the strength of the Sequences had more to do with why you should update your beliefs in the face of new evidence, rather than why Bayes' theorem was the correct way to do this. In contrast, I think the argument for using Bayesian principles as the correct set of reasoning principles was made more strongly by E.T. Jaynes.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I feel like his exposition of the subject tends to get ignored relative to the material presented in the Sequences. Not that the information in the Sequences isn&rsquo;t highly relevant and important, just that Jaynes' arguments are much more technical, and their strength can be overlooked for this reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The way to start an exposition on one-magisterium rationality is by contrast to multi-magisteria modes of thought. I would go as far as to argue that the multi-magisterium view, or what I sometimes prefer to call tool-boxism, is by far the most dominant way of thinking today. Tool-boxism can be summarized by &ldquo;There is no one correct way to arrive at the truth. Every model we have today about how to arrive at the correct answer is just that &ndash; a model. And there are many, many models. The only way to get better at finding the correct answer is through experience and wisdom, with a lot of insight and luck, just as one would master a trade such as woodworking. There&rsquo;s nothing that can replace or supersede the magic of human creativity. [Sometimes it will be added:] Also, don&rsquo;t forget that the models you have about the world are heavily, if not completely, determined by your culture and upbringing, and there&rsquo;s no reason to favor your culture over anyone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As I hope to argue in this post, tool-boxism has many downsides that should push us further towards accepting the one-magisterium view. It also very dramatically differs in how it suggests we should approach the problem of intelligence and cognition, with many corollaries in both rationalism and artificial intelligence. Some of these corollaries are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is no unified theory of intelligence, we are led towards the view that recursive self-improvement is not possible, since an increase in one type of intelligence does not necessarily lead to an improvement in a different type of intelligence.</li>
<li>With a diversification in different notions of correct reasoning within different domains, it heavily limits what can be done to reach agreement on different topics. In the end we are often forced to agree to disagree, which while preserving social cohesion in different contexts, can be quite unsatisfying from a philosophical standpoint.</li>
<li>Related to the previous corollary, it may lead to beliefs that are sacred, untouchable, or based on intuition, feeling, or difficult to articulate concepts. This produces a complex web of topics that have to be avoided or tread carefully around, or a heavy emphasis on difficult to articulate reasons for preferring one view over the other.</li>
<li>Developing AI around a tool-box / multi-magisteria approach, where systems are made up of a wide array of various components, limits generalizability and leads to brittleness.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>One very specific trend I&rsquo;ve noticed lately in articles that aim to discredit the AGI intelligence explosion hypothesis, is that they tend to take the tool-box approach when discussing intelligence, and use that to argue that recursive self-improvement is likely impossible. So rationalists should be highly interested in this kind of reasoning. One of Eliezer&rsquo;s primary motivations for writing the Sequences was to make the case for a unified approach to reasoning, because it lends credence to the view of intelligence in which intelligence can be replicated by machines, and where intelligence is potentially unbounded. And also that this was a subtle and tough enough subject that it required hundreds of blog posts to argue for it. So because of the subtle nature of the arguments I&rsquo;m not particularly surprised by this drift, but I am concerned about it. I would prefer if we didn&rsquo;t drift.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;m trying not to sound No-True-Scotsman-y here, but I wonder what it is that could make one a rationalist if they take the tool-box perspective. After all, even if you have a multi-magisterium world-view, there still always is an underlying guiding principle directing the use of the proper tools. Often times, this guiding principle is based on intuition, which is a remarkably hard thing to pin down and describe well. I personally interpret the word &lsquo;rationalism&rsquo; as meaning in the weakest and most general sense that there is an explanation for everything &ndash; so intelligence isn&rsquo;t irreducibly based on hand-wavy concepts such as ingenuity and creativity. Rationalists believe that those things have explanations, and once we have those explanations, then there is no further use for tool-boxism.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;ll repeat the distinction between tool-boxism and one-magisterium Bayes, because I believe it&rsquo;s that important: Tool-boxism implies that there is no underlying theory that describes the mechanisms of intelligence. And this assumption basically implies that intelligence is either composed of irreducible components (where one component does not necessarily help you understand a different component) or some kind of essential property that cannot be replicated by algorithms or computation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Why is tool-boxism the dominant paradigm then? Probably because it is the most pragmatically useful position to take in most circumstances when we don&rsquo;t actually possess an underlying theory. But the fact that we sometimes don&rsquo;t have an underlying theory or that the theory we do have isn&rsquo;t developed to the point where it is empirically beating the tool box approach is sometimes taken as evidence that there <em>isn't</em> a unifying theory. This is, in my opinion, the incorrect conclusion to draw from these observations.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Nevertheless, it seems like a startlingly common conclusion to draw. I think the great mystery is why this is so. I don&rsquo;t have very convincing answers to that question, but I suspect it has something to do with how heavily our priors are biased against a unified theory of reasoning. It may also be due to the subtlety and complexity of the arguments for a unified theory. For that reason, I highly recommend reviewing those arguments (and few people other than E.T. Jaynes and Yudkowsky have made them). So with that said, let&rsquo;s review a few of those arguments, starting with one of the myths surrounding Bayes theorem I&rsquo;d like to debunk:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Bayes Theorem is a trivial consequence of the Kolmogorov Axioms, and is therefore not powerful.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This claim usually presented as part of a claim that &ldquo;Bayesian&rdquo; probability is just a small part of regular probability theory, and therefore does not give us any more useful information than you&rsquo;d get from just studying probability theory. And as a consequence of that, if you insist that you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;Strong&rdquo; Bayesian, that means you&rsquo;re insisting on using only on that small subset of probability theory and associated tools we call Bayesian.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And the part of the statement that says the theorem is a trivial consequence of the Kolmogorov axioms is technically true. It&rsquo;s the implication typically drawn from this that is false. The reason it&rsquo;s false has to do with Bayes theorem being a <em>non</em>-trivial consequence of a simpler set of axioms / desiderata. This consequence is usually formalized by Cox&rsquo;s theorem, which is usually glossed over or not quite appreciated for how far-reaching it actually is.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Recall that the qualitative desiderata for a set of reasoning rules were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers.</li>
<li>Qualitative correspondence with common sense.</li>
<li>Consistency.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>You can read the first two chapters of Jaynes&rsquo; book, <em>Probability Theory: The Logic of Science</em> if you want more detail into what those desiderata mean. But the important thing to note from them is that they are merely desiderata, not axioms. This means we are not assuming those things are already true, we just want to devise a system that satisfies those properties. The beauty of Cox&rsquo;s theorem is that it specifies exactly <em>one</em> set of rules that satisfy these properties, of which Bayes Theorem as well as the Kolmogorov Axioms are a consequence of those rules.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The other nice thing about this is that degrees of plausibility can be assigned to any proposition, or any statement that you could possibly assign a truth value to. It does not limit plausibility to &ldquo;events&rdquo; that take place in some kind of space of possible events like whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails. What&rsquo;s typically considered the alternative to Bayesian reasoning is Classical probability, sometimes called Frequentist probability, which only deals with events drawn from a sample space, and is not able to provide methods for probabilistic inference of a set of hypotheses.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For axioms, Cox&rsquo;s theorem merely requires you to accept Boolean algebra and Calculus to be true, and then you can derive probability theory as extended logic from that. So this should be mindblowing, right? One Magisterium Bayes? QED? Well apparently this set of arguments is not convincing to everyone, and it&rsquo;s not because people find Boolean logic and calculus hard to accept.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Rather, there are two major and several somewhat minor difficulties encountered within the Bayesian paradigm. The two major ones are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem of hypothesis generation.</li>
<li>The problem of assigning priors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The list of minor problems are as follows, although like any list of minor issues, this is definitely not exhaustive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should you treat &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; for a hypothesis, or &ldquo;data&rdquo;, as having probability 1?</li>
<li>Bayesian methods are often computationally intractable.</li>
<li>How to update when you discover a &ldquo;new&rdquo; hypothesis.</li>
<li>Divergence in posterior beliefs for different individuals upon the acquisition of new data.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Most Bayesians typically never deny the existence of the first two problems. What some anti-Bayesians conclude from them, though, is that Bayesianism must be fatally flawed due to those problems, and that there is some other way of reasoning that would avoid or provide solutions to those problems. I&rsquo;m skeptical about this, and the reason I&rsquo;m skeptical is because if you really had a method for say, hypothesis generation, this would actually imply logical omniscience, and would basically allow us to create full AGI, RIGHT NOW. If you really had the ability to produce a finite list containing the correct hypothesis for any problem, the existence of the other hypotheses in this list is practically a moot point &ndash; you have some way of generating the CORRECT hypothesis in a finite, computable algorithm. And that would make you a God.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As far as I know, being able to do this would imply that P = NP is true, and as far as I know, most computer scientists do not think it&rsquo;s likely to be true (And even if it were true, we might not get a constructive proof from it). &nbsp;But I would ask: Is this really a strike against Bayesianism? Is the inability of Bayesian theory to provide a method for providing the correct hypothesis evidence that we can&rsquo;t use it to analyze and update our own beliefs?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I would add that there are plenty of ways to generate hypotheses by other methods. For example, you can try to make the hypothesis space gargantuan, and encode different hypotheses in a vector of parameters, and then use different optimization or search procedures like evolutionary algorithms or gradient descent to find the most likely set of parameters. Not all of these methods are considered &ldquo;Bayesian&rdquo; in the sense that you are summarizing a posterior distribution over the parameters (although <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04289"">stochastic gradient descent</a> might be). It seems like a full theory of intelligence might include methods for generating possible hypotheses. I think this is probably true, but I don&rsquo;t know of any arguments that it would contradict Bayesian theory.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The reason assigning prior probabilities is such a huge concern is that it forces Bayesians to hold &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; probabilities, where in most cases, if you&rsquo;re not an expert in the domain of interest, you don&rsquo;t really have a good argument for why you should hold one prior over another. Frequentists often contrast this with their methods which do not require priors, and thus hold some measure of objectivity.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">E.T. Jaynes never considered to this be a flaw in Bayesian probability, per se. Rather, he considered hypothesis generation, as well as assigning priors, to be outside the scope of &ldquo;plausible inference&rdquo; which is what he considered to be the domain of Bayesian probability. He himself argued for using the principle of maximum entropy for creating a prior distribution, and there are also more modern techniques such as Empirical Bayes.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In general, Frequentists often have the advantage that their methods are often simpler and easier to compute, while also having strong guarantees about the results, as long as certain constraints are satisfied. Bayesians have the advantage that their methods are &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; in the sense that you&rsquo;ll get the same answer each time you run an analysis. And this is the most common form of the examples that Bayesians use when they profess the superiority of their approach. They typically show how Frequentist methods can give both &ldquo;significant&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-significant&rdquo; labels to their results depending on how you perform the analysis, whereas the Bayesian way just gives you the probability of the hypothesis, plain and simple.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I think that in general, once could say that Frequentist methods are a lot more &ldquo;tool-boxy&rdquo; and Bayesian methods are more &ldquo;generally applicable&rdquo; (if computational tractability wasn&rsquo;t an issue). &nbsp;That gets me to the second myth I&rsquo;d like to debunk:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Being a &ldquo;Strong Bayesian&rdquo; means avoiding all techniques not labeled with the stamp of approval from the Bayes Council.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Does this mean that Frequentist methods, because they are tool box approaches, are wrong or somehow bad to use, as some argue that Strong Bayesians claim? Not at all. There&rsquo;s no reason not to use a specific tool, if it seems like the best way to get what you want, as long as you understand exactly what the results you&rsquo;re getting mean. Sometimes I just want a prediction, and I don&rsquo;t care how I get it &ndash; I know that a specific algorithm being labeled &ldquo;Bayesian&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t confer it any magical properties. Any Bayesian may want to know the frequentist properties of their model. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that different communities of researchers flying the flag of their tribe developed some methods and then labeled them according to their tribal affiliation. That&rsquo;s ok. The point is, if you really want to have a <em>Strong</em> Bayesian view, then you also have to assign probabilities to various properties of each tool in the toolbox.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Chances are, if you&rsquo;re a statistics/data science practitioner with a few years of experience applying different techniques to different problems and different data sets, and you have some general intuitions about which techniques apply better to which domains, you&rsquo;re probably doing this in a Bayesian way. That means, you hold some prior beliefs about whether Bayesian Logistic Regression or Random Forests is more likely to get what you want on this particular problem, you try one, and possibly update your beliefs once you get a result, according to what your models predicted.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Being a Bayesian often requires you to work with &ldquo;black boxes&rdquo;, or tools that you know give you a specific result, but you don&rsquo;t have a full explanation of how it arrives at the result or how it fits in to the grand scheme of things. A Bayesian fundamentalist may refuse to work with any statistical tool like that, not realizing that in their everyday lives they often use tools, objects, or devices that aren&rsquo;t fully transparent to them. But you can, and in fact do, have models about how those tools can be used and the results you&rsquo;d get if you used them. The way you handle these models, even if they are held in intuition, probably looks pretty Bayesian upon deeper inspection.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I would suggest that instead of using the term &ldquo;Fully Bayesian&rdquo; we use the phrase &ldquo;Infinitely Bayesian&rdquo; to refer to using a Bayesian method for literally everything, because it more accurately shows that it would be impossible to actually model every single atom of knowledge probabilistically. It also makes it easier to see that even the Strongest Bayesian you know probably isn&rsquo;t advocating this.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Let me return to the &ldquo;minor problems&rdquo; I mentioned earlier, because they are pretty interesting. &nbsp;Some epistemologists have a problem with Bayesian updating because it requires you to assume that the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; you receive at any given point is completely true with probability 1. I don&rsquo;t really understand why it requires this. I&rsquo;m easily able to handle the case where I&rsquo;m uncertain about my data. Take the situation where my friend is rolling a six-sided die, and I want to know the probability of it coming up 6. I assume all sides are equally likely, so my prior probability for 6 is 1/6. Let&rsquo;s say that he rolls it where I can&rsquo;t see it, and then tells me the die came up even. What do I update p(6) to?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Let&rsquo;s say that I take my data as saying &ldquo;the die came up even.&rdquo; Then p(6 | even) = p(even | 6) * p(6) / p(even) = 1 * (1/6) / (1 / 2) = 1/3. Ok, so I should update p(6) to 1/3 now right? Well, that&rsquo;s only if I take the evidence of &ldquo;the die came up even&rdquo; as being completely true with probability one. But what actually happened is that my friend TOLD ME the die came up even. He could have been lying, maybe he forgot what &ldquo;even&rdquo; meant, maybe his glasses were really smudged, or maybe aliens took over his brain at that exact moment and made him say that. So let&rsquo;s say I give a 90% chance to him telling the truth, or equivalently, a 90% chance that my data is true. What do I update p(6) to now?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It&rsquo;s pretty simple. I just expand p(6) over &ldquo;even&rdquo; as p(6) = p(6 | even) p(even) &nbsp;+ p(6 | odd) p(odd). Before he said anything, p(even) = p(odd) and this formula evaluated to (1/3)(1/2) + (0)(1/2) = 1/6, my prior. After he told me the die came up even, I update p(even) to 0.9, and this formula becomes (1/3)(9/10) + (0)(1/10) = 9/30. A little less than 1/3. Makes sense.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In general, I am able to model anything probabilistically in the Bayesian framework, including my data. So I&rsquo;m not sure where the objection comes from. It&rsquo;s true that from a modeling perspective, and a computational one, I have to stop somewhere, and just accept for the sake of pragmatism that probabilities very close to 1 should be treated as if they were 1, and not model those. Not doing that, and just going on forever, would mean being Infinitely Bayesian. But I don&rsquo;t see why this counts as problem for Bayesianism. Again, I&rsquo;m not trying to be omniscient. I just want a framework for working with <em>any</em> part of reality, not <em>all</em> of reality at once. The former is what I consider &ldquo;One Magisterium&rdquo; to mean, not the latter.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The rest of the minor issues are also related to limitations that any finite intelligence is going to have no matter what. They should all, though, get easier as access to data increases, models get better, and computational ability gets better.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Finally, I&rsquo;d like to return to an issue that I think is most relevant to the ideas I&rsquo;ve been discussing here. In AI risk, it is commonly argued that a sufficiently intelligent agent will be able to modify itself to become more intelligent. This premise assumes that an agent will have some theory of intelligence that allows it to understand which updates to itself are more likely to be improvements. Because of that, many who argue against &ldquo;AI Alarmism&rdquo; will argue against the premise that there is a unified theory of intelligence. In &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTvc3XkeTUAhXr44MKHYbmCQEQFggoMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fidlewords.com%2Ftalks%2Fsuperintelligence.htm&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwJL_gED_N235bvB1jHhXjy2Iw8Q"">Superintelligence: The Idea that Eats Smart People</a>&rdquo;, I think most of the arguments can be reduced to basically saying as much.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">From what I can tell, most arguments against AI risk in general will take the form of anecdotes about how really really smart people like Albert Einstein were very bad at certain other tasks, and that this is proof that there is no theory of intelligence that can be used to create a self-improving AI. Well, more accurately, these arguments are worded as &ldquo;There is no single axis on which to measure intelligence&rdquo; but what they mean is the former, since even multiple axes of intelligence (such as measure of success on different tasks) would not actually imply that there isn&rsquo;t one theory of reasoning. What multiple axes of measuring intelligence do imply is that within a given brain, the brain may have devoted more space to better modeling certain tasks than others, and that maybe the brain isn&rsquo;t quite that elastic, and has a hard time picking up new tasks.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The other direction in which to argue against AI risk is to argue against the proposed theories of reasoning themselves, like Bayesianism. The alternative, it seems, is tool-boxism. I really want to avoid tool-boxism because it makes it difficult to be a rationalist. Even if Bayesianism turns out to be wrong, does this exclude other, possibly undiscovered theories of reasoning? I&rsquo;ve never seen that touched upon by any of the AI risk deniers. As long as there is <em>a</em> theory of reasoning, then presumably a machine intelligence could come to understand that theory and all of its consequences, and use that to update itself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I think the simplest summary of my post is this: A Bayesian need not be Bayesian in all things, for reasons of practicality. But a Bayesian <em>can</em> be Bayesian in any given thing, and this is what is meant by &ldquo;One Magisterium&rdquo;.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I didn&rsquo;t get to cover every corollary of tool-boxing or every issue with Bayesian statistics, but this post is already really long, and for the sake of brevity I will probably end it here. Perhaps I can cover those issues more thoroughly in a future post.&nbsp;</p>",tristanm,tristanm,tristanm,

<div><br /></div>
<div>What could go wrong if we develop technology to significantly amplify the intelligence of human minds? Intelligence is tricky to understand and I get confused when comparing it to the related concepts of wisdom and rationality. I'd like to draw clear distinctions between them. In a nutshell, rationality is the tendency to apply the capacity of intelligence, whereas wisdom describes the embodied knowledge of human behavioral patterns, specifically in terms of failure modes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The relationship between rationality and intelligence seems better understood. My favorite exposition is in the excellent&nbsp;<em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/0300164629/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T2_9XUuzbG6KWZ3N?tag=garybasin-20"">What Intelligence Tests Miss</a></em>&nbsp;(<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/2g1/what_intelligence_tests_miss_the_psychology_of/"">good summary on LW</a>). Of course, <a href=""http://www.lesswrong.com/"">LessWrong</a> itself is partially devoted to understanding this distinction and <a href=""http://rationality.org/"">CFAR</a>&nbsp;was built to see if we can isolate and train rationality (as opposed to intelligence). Intelligence is typically viewed as the capacity to perform the relevant moves -- explicit reasoning, analogical application of past experiences, and avoiding biased heuristics of thought -- when presented with a well-formed problem. In practice, the hard part of taking advantage of intelligence is having the&nbsp;<em>awareness</em>&nbsp;that one is facing a situation where intelligence can be explicitly applied. Thus, one can perform well when formally posed a problem, such as on an IQ or SAT test, yet still behave foolishly in the real world where the problems are not clearly structured and labeled. A colloquialism which approximates this dynamic is the idea of ""book"" and ""street"" smarts. Thus, to be rational requires not only some capacity for intelligence but, more importantly, the habits of identifying when and where to apply it <em>in the wild.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>How does wisdom fit into this? Informally, wisdom refers to the ability to think and act with sound judgment and common sense, often developed through a diversity of life experiences. We tend to look to the aged members of society as a font of wisdom rather than those with merely a large raw capacity for reasoning (intelligence). This corresponds with the heuristic of listening to your elders even when it doesn't always make sense. Wisdom is often associated with conservativism and functions as a regulatory mechanism for societal change. The young and clever upstart has the energy and open-mindedness to create new technology and push for change while the old and wise have seen similar attempts fail enough times to raise a note of caution. The intelligent (and rational) are not more careless than the wise but rather seem to have more blind spots -- perhaps as a result of seeing fewer well-laid plans fail in unexpected ways. To anticipate failure -- to predict the future -- we rely on models. Ideally, we deduce from known laws -- this is possible in the physical sciences. In messier and more complex systems, like human interactions, we are forced to primarily rely on experience from analogous situations (inductive and abductive reason). It is no surprise that the hardest failures to predict relate to how humans will act -- politics, not rocket science.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Looking through the literature on measuring wisdom (<a href=""http://www.wisdompage.com/WisdomDevelopmentScale.pdf"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.robertjsternberg.com/wisdom/"">2</a>, <a href=""http://thinkingskills.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/1/7/4917998/webster_self_assessed_wisdom_scale.pdf"">3</a>), one&nbsp;major&nbsp;commonality&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;emphasis&nbsp;on modeling&nbsp;psychological&nbsp;dynamics:&nbsp;intrapersonal (knowing thyself) and&nbsp;interpersonal (making sense of interactions with, and between, other humans). Proficiency in these domains seems to only become possible through experience (specifically,&nbsp;<a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02511845"">exposure to extremes</a>) interacting with other humans and introspecting, or reflecting, on experience. In contrast, a foundation in the physical sciences and mathematics seems to be learnable by interaction with text, thought, exercises, and experiments performable without significant interpersonal dynamics. In a sense, we can say that proficiency in the ""hard"" sciences is intelligence-constrained whereas proficiency in predicting and interacting with humans is constrained by a lack of diverse personal experience data and the ability to act upon heuristics extracted from it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This can be understood as a difference in <em>modelability</em> -- the extent to which we can formalize useful (predictive) models of the system. With mathematics and the physical sciences -- at least when applied to sufficiently simplified slices of reality -- we are able to constrain non-determinism into a probabilistic model with well-behaved errors. On the other hand, modeling humans presents us with an <a href=""http://garybasin.com/emergent-cause/"">uncertainty of a kind that we struggle to reduce</a> (see: the struggle of the social sciences to <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248""><em>successfully science</em></a>). Even residing in a deterministic universe amenable to reductionism, and being armed with excellent models of sub-atomic interactions, we are unable to build the machinery necessary to predict the behavior of human beings. There are too many moving parts for a supercomputer, let alone the highly-constrained working memory of a human brain, to make useful predictions by analyzing the interactions of the component parts. On the other hand, the human brain has evolved to be quite good at modeling itself and other humans -- we are social animals, after all. We perform this feat by observing behavior and automatically chunking it into categories and schemas to be recalled in future situations that appear similar enough. Unfortunately, we have not yet found a shortcut for developing this repository of experiences and the corresponding heuristics derived from it. This is the hard-to-replicate thing we tend to call <em>wisdom</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The weak relationship between intelligence (or rationality) and wisdom should make us wary of the consequences of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification"">intelligence amplification</a>. Increasing our capacity for intelligence and rationality without a corresponding increase in wisdom -- which appears constrained by experience and associated reflection-based learning -- may be&nbsp;<em>dangerous</em>. Amplified intelligence allows us to make better predictions of the physical world which can be leveraged to build more powerful systems and technologies, like nukes in the 20th century and more powerful AI in the 21st century. However, if we fail to simultaneously increase our wisdom we face the risk of unleashing capabilities onto humanity which may be quite safe <em>in theory</em> but in practice may&nbsp;<a href=""https://fee.org/articles/why-socialism-failed/"">lead to disaster</a>&nbsp;when they come into contact with human society. We need more foresight into the disastrous failure modes of interactions between humans and their tools. How do we amplify wisdom?</div>",ig0r,ig0r,ig0r,

<p>I'll start. Today I understood how Heyting algebras work as a model for intuitionistic logic. The main idea is that you represent sentences as shapes. So you might have two sentences A and B shown as two circles, then ""A and B"" is their intersection, ""A or B"" is their union, etc. But ""A implies B"" doesn't mean one circle lies inside the other, as you might think! Instead it's a shape too, consisting of all points that lie outside A or inside B (or both). There were some other details about closed and open sets, but these didn't cause a problem for me, while ""A implies B"" made me stumble for some reason. I probably won't use Heyting algebras for anything ever, but it was pretty fun to figure out.</p>

Don&#8217;t take any of this seriously until it&#8217;s replicated and endorsed by other people.]</i></font></p>
<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to see a glitch in the Matrix, watch this spinning mask:</p>
<p><center><font size=""1""><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/spinning_mask.gif""></p>
<p><i>Source: <A HREF=""http://hearingthevoice.org/2013/11/14/predictive-coding-masterclass/"">http://hearingthevoice.org/2013/11/14/predictive-coding-masterclass/</A></i></font></center></p>
<p>Did you see it? As the face started to turn away from you, your brain did&#8230;<i>something</i>, and then you were seeing a normal frontwards-facing mask again. It turns out your visual system has really strong views about whether faces should be inside-out or not, and it&#8217;s willing to execute a hard override on perception if it doesn&#8217;t like what it sees.</p>
<p>But not always. Some people get glitchier glitches than others; a few seem almost immune. Studies find schizophrenics and autistic people to be consistently less glitchy than the rest of us. The correlation&#8217;s not perfect. But it&#8217;s definitely there. Something about these people&#8217;s different cognitive processing styles lets them see through the illusion.</p>
<p>I wanted to replicate this result myself. So a few months ago, when I surveyed readers of my blog, I included some questions about perceptual illusions (including a <A HREF=""http://blog.brainfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/albert6.jpg"">static version</A> of the hollow mask). I got five thousand responses, including a few from schizophrenic and autistic readers. Sure enough, the effect was there.</p>
<p>Schizophrenic readers were about twice as likely to report a weak reaction to the mask illusion as non-schizophrenics (28% vs. 14%, p = 0.04). They were also more likely to have a weak reaction to a similar illusion, the <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_Dancer"">Spinning Dancer</A> (58% vs. 81%, p = 0.01). Readers with a family history of schizophrenia landed in between schizophrenics and healthy controls (16% for mask, 63% for dancer, ns).</p>
<p>Autistic readers were only slightly more likely to report a weak reaction to the mask illusion than neurotypicals (17% vs. 14%), but thanks to our big sample size we could be pretty confident that this was a meaningful difference (p = 0.004). There was no different between autists and neurotypicals on the Spinning Dancer, not even a weak trend (58% vs. 60%, p = 0.4).</p>
<p>Looking deeper, I found a few other anomalies on illusion perception. Most were small and inconsistent. But one stood out: transgender people had an altered response pattern on both illusions, stronger than the alteration for autism and almost as strong as the one for schizophrenia (mask: cis 14% vs. trans 21%, p = 0.003; dancer: cis 58% vs. trans 71%, p = 0.001). These results are very tentative, and need replication. My mass survey isn&#8217;t a very sensitive instrument, and I place low confidence in any of this until other people can confirm.</p>
<p>But for now, it sure looks like a signal. Something seems off about transgender people&#8217;s perception, something deep enough to alter the lowest-level components of visual processing. If it&#8217;s real, what could it be?</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>A few days ago, trans blogger <A HREF=""https://zinniajones.com/"">Zinnia Jones</A> asked me if there might be any neurochemical reason trans people dissociate so much.</p>
<p>Dissociation is a vague psychiatric symptom where you feel like you&#8217;re not real, or the world isn&#8217;t real, or you&#8217;re detached from the world, or something like that. It sounds weird, but if you explain it to someone who&#8217;s had it, they&#8217;ll say &#8220;Oh yeah, <i>that</i> thing!&#8221; It&#8217;s usually unpleasant, and tends to occur in PTSD, borderline personality, and extreme stress.</p>
<p>And in transgender people. The only <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25656174"">formal study</A> I can find on this describes it as &#8220;greatly prevalent&#8221;, and suggests that up to 30% of trans people may have dissociative conditions (compared to less than 1% of the general population). This matches trans people&#8217;s self-reports (<A HREF=""https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/399w8u/is_depersonalization_a_common_experience_for_a/"">1</A>, <A HREF=""https://thirdwaytrans.com/2014/06/08/dysphoria-dissociation/"">2</A>, <A HREF=""https://di.org.au/transgender-multiplicity/"">3</A>, <A HREF=""https://www.quora.com/Can-dissociative-symptoms-become-a-cause-of-gender-dysphoria/answer/Katie-Anne-Holton?srid=2GHN"">4</A>, <A HREF=""https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5fdk76/the_rates_of_depressive_symptoms_and_anxiety_for/dajet8f/"">5</A>). Anecdotally (according to Zinnia&#8217;s impression of the trans community) and formally (see <A HREF=""https://www.dovepress.com/the-effect-of-cross-sex-hormonal-treatment-on-gender-dysphoria-individ-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NDT"">Costa &#038; Colizzi 2016</A>) hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment for dissociative problems.</p>
<p>Intuitively this makes sense. Trans people feel like they&#8217;re &#8220;trapped in the wrong body&#8221;, so of course they feel detached from their bodies / like their bodies aren&#8217;t real / like their bodies aren&#8217;t theirs. Hormone therapy helps solve the &#8220;wrong body&#8221; problem, so it also solves the dissociative symptoms.</p>
<p>We aim to bridge psychosocial and biological levels of explanation. We can say that someone is stressed out because their boss overworks them, but <i>also</i> because they&#8217;re secreting high levels of cortisol. We can say that someone is depressed because they broke up with their boyfriend, but <i>also</i> because they have <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/13/what-is-depression-anyway-the-synapse-hypothesis/"">decreased synaptogenesis</A> in their hippocampus. Causation gets tricky, and this is a philosophical minefield for sure, but overall these two levels should be complementary rather than competitive. So what&#8217;s the biological correlate to trans people having dissociation problems?</p>
<p>Practically all searches for the biological basis of dissociation end up at the NMDA glutamate receptor, one of the many neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Even though its cousins dopamine and serotonin usually get top billing, glutamate is probably the brain&#8217;s most important neurotransmitter, and NMDA glutamate receptors in particular are involved in all sorts of interesting things.</p>
<p>Drugs that block NMDA receptors cause dissociation. The most famous dissociative anaesthetic, ketamine, is an NMDA antagonist. So is DXM, a recreational drug that causes dissociation in abusers. Wikipedia&#8217;s <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative"">list of dissociative drugs</A> is basically just fifty-five NMDA antagonists in a row. The only other category they list are kappa opioid agonists, and kappa opioid agonism probably &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; <A HREF=""http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/14/9/5580.full.pdf"">antagonize NMDA</A>. If we take this result seriously, every substance we know of that causes dissociation is an NMDA antagonist in some way.</p>
<p>Does anything improve NMDA function &#8211; an effect we might expect to alleviate dissociation? Yes, and among a list of intimidating research chemicals called things like &#8220;aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid&#8221; is one familiar name: estrogen. See eg <A HREF=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1582-4934.2004.tb00478.x/pdf"">El-Bakri et al</A>, which finds that &#8220;estrogen modulates NMDA receptors function in the brain&#8230;enhancing NMDA function&#8221;. <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480182/"">McEwen et al</A>: &#8220;One of the long-term effects of estradiol [estrogen] is to induce NMDA receptor binding sites in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.&#8221; <A HREF=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458003000125"">Bi et al</A>: &#8220;17-B-estradiol [estrogen] enhances NMDA receptor phosphorylation and function.&#8221; I don&#8217;t fully understand this research, but it seems to point to estrogen promoting NMDA activity in <i>some way</i>.</p>
<p>So transgender people dissociate a lot, a state usually associated with hypofunctioning NMDA receptors. And trans women get better when they take estrogen, a hormone that improves NMDA function. That&#8217;s interesting. But what does this have to do with those optical illusions?</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>The Hollow Mask illusion and its cousins may depend on NMDA function.</p>
<p>To oversimplify: the brain interprets the world <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/12/its-bayes-all-the-way-up/"">through Bayesian calculations</A>. In Corlett et al&#8217;s model, it communicates top-down priors (ie assumptions based on previous knowledge about the world) through NMDA receptors and bottom-up new evidence through AMPA receptors. <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3055519/"">They write</A>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a hierarchical cortical system in which representations become more abstract with increasing distance from the primary input, higher levels of the hierarchy specify top-down predictions through NMDA receptor signaling and any mismatches between expectancy and experience are conveyed upward through the hierarchy via rapid AMPA and GABA signaling</p></blockquote>
<p>When you see a hollow mask, the brute facts of how the mask looks are your bottom-up sensory evidence. Your top-down prior is that every other face you&#8217;ve seen for your entire life has been normal, not inside-out. Given the strength of the prior, the prior wins, and your brain interprets the mask as a normal face.</p>
<p><i>Unless</i> your brain is bad at applying priors, ie its NMDA receptors aren&#8217;t working that well. Then it just sticks with the bottom-up sensory evidence showing that the mask is hollow. </p>
<p>Schizophrenia and autism both probably involve decreased NMDA function in different ways. For schizophrenia, see eg Olney, <A HREF=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395699000291"">NMDA receptor hypofunction model of schizophrenia</A>, and Coyle, <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22987850"">NMDA receptor and schizophrenia: a brief history</A>. Ketamine seems to replicate the symptoms of schizophrenia pretty well and is commonly used <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4133098/"">as a model for the disorder</A>. For autism, see eg Lee, <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636159"">NMDA receptor dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders</A> and <A HREF=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1601-183X.2012.00816.x/full"">this study</A> where screwing with NMDA receptors in mice seems to turn them autistic.</p>
<p>From this we would predict that estrogen would help treat schizophrenia and autism. It does. Schizophrenia is <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3420456/"">more common and more severe</A> in men than women, with researchers <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600562/"">noting</A> that &#8220;gonadal steroids may play a role in buffering females against the development of schizophrenia&#8221;. Women are known to sometimes get schizophrenia <A HREF=""http://writehealth.co.uk/menopause-and-schizophrenia/"">triggered by menopause</A> when their estrogen levels decrease. Estrogen supplementation is <A HREF=""http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/578772"">an effective schizophrenia treatment</A>, and there&#8217;s some interest in developing <A HREF=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259354452_The_Role_of_Estrogen_in_the_Treatment_of_Men_with_Schizophrenia"">estrogen receptor modulators</A> that can help schizophrenic men without making them grow breasts. Meanwhile, autism continues to be about four times more common in men than women, autistic women tend to have <A HREF=""http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20170208/brain-differences-hint-at-why-autism-is-more-common-in-males#1"">more &#8220;male-typical brains&#8221;</A>, and although it&#8217;s considered unethical to treat autistic boys with estrogen, it works in <A HREF=""https://spectrumnews.org/news/estrogen-reverses-autism-like-features-in-mice/"">mice</A> and <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4766582/"">fish</A>. Once again, doctors are looking into estrogen analogues that don&#8217;t turn people female as <A HREF=""http://www.medicaldaily.com/estrogen-mistakenly-believed-female-only-hormone-may-be-key-why-autism-rates-are-higher-301918"">possible autism treatments</A>.</p>
<p>We might also predict that estrogen would increase glitching on the hollow mask. I can&#8217;t study this directly, but on the survey, 15% of biological males had weak reactions to the illusion, compared with only 11% of biological females, p = 0.01. Since women have more estrogen, that looks good for the theory.</p>
<p>Transgender people have higher rates of autism and schizophrenia. The Atlantic actually had a good article about this recently : <A HREF=""https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/11/the-link-between-autism-and-trans-identity/507509/"">The Link Between Autism And Trans Identity</A>. They cite <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904453/"">one study</A> showing 8% autism rate in trans people (compared to 1-2% in the general population), and <A HREF=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0285-3"">another</A> showing that autistic people were 7.5x more likely to express &#8220;gender variance&#8221;. Apparently a lot of trans people have problems getting hormone therapy because their doctors think the gender issues are &#8220;just&#8221; because of their autism. Some might say that denying people estrogen because they have a condition which studies suggest estrogen can successfully treat is a bit, I don&#8217;t know, crazy and evil, but I guess people get really weird around this stuff.</p>
<p>My survey broadly confirms these numbers. Autism rates were sky-high in every category &#8211; it&#8217;s almost as if the sorts of people who like reading blogs about how gender is all just NMDA receptors skew more autistic than average &#8211; but there was a remarkable difference across gender identities. 15% of cisgender people were autistic, but a full 52% of trans people were. </p>
<p>The survey also finds that about 4% of non-schizophrenic people were transgender, compared to 21% of schizophrenics and self-suspected schizophrenics. Other people have <A HREF=""https://www.hindawi.com/journals/schizort/2014/463757/"">noticed the same connection</A>, and I&#8217;ve met more schizophrenic transgender people than I would expect by chance given the very low rates of both conditions. </p>
<p>If this is right, we end up with this rich set of connections between schizophrenics, autistics, ketamine, dissociative experiences, estrogen, gender identity, and the hollow mask. Anything that decreases NMDA function &#8211; schizophrenia, autism, ketamine &#8211; will potentially cause dissociative experiences and decreased glitching on the mask illusion. Estrogen will improve NMDA function, treat dissociative experiences, and bring back hollow-mask glitching.</p>
<p>So I wonder: is NMDA hypofunction related to transgender? That would explain the autism and schizophrenia connections. It would explain the hollow mask numbers. It would explain the dissociation. It would explain why estrogen helps the dissociation. And it would explain a lot of internal connections between all of these different conditions and factors.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to stop here, even though there&#8217;s a lot more worth saying on this, because I&#8217;ve already gotten so far into Speculation Land that trying to chain any more conclusions on would probably be premature. So let&#8217;s switch to some reasons for skepticism.</p>
<p>First, the research into NMDA receptors is <i>too interesting</i>. People argue that NMDA <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410564"">is key to depression</A>, <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2824088/"">key to anxiety</A>, <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20238210"">OCD</A>, <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14500166"">chronic pain</A>, and <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1810584/"">borderline personality</A> (my guess is the depression claims are <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/07/ketamine-research-in-a-new-light/"">mostly overblown</A>, the borderline claims are 100% absolutely right and revelatory, and I&#8217;m agnostic on the others). On the one hand, explaining everything sounds sort of good. On the other hand, it also sounds like what would happen if a field was getting kind of overhyped and slipping into methodology loose enough to prove anything it wanted. Maybe a vague link between a receptor which is literally everywhere in the brain and some psychiatric disease isn&#8217;t that interesting. A theory that can explain absolutely everything <A HREF=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/"">should always cause suspicion</A>.</p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;m still not sure what to make of the Hollow Mask results on my survey. Although the transgender results were unusually strong, I did get mildly statistically significant results on about half of the thirty-or-so things I looked at, including seemingly-unrelated items like political affiliation. Some might argue that this means something is wrong with my survey. Others might argue that hey, we know political attitudes are about 50% genetic, and the last time people tried trace the genes involved <A HREF=""https://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/elecdem/pdfs/petehatemi/18.Hatemi.et.al.LinkageGW.JOP.2011.pdf"">all the strongest results were genes for NMDA receptors</A>. Have I mentioned that NMDA receptors are <i>really interesting?</i></p>
<p>Third, I included a second illusion I asked about on the survey, the Spinning Dancer. It also had an odd response pattern among transgender people. But it didn&#8217;t correlate at all with the Hollow Mask Illusion, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be elevated among autists. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on here, and the whole thing makes me more suspicious that all of this is some weird artifact.</p>
<p>Fourth, all this predicts that ketamine will cause reduced glitching on the Hollow Mask. <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12680739"">It doesn&#8217;t</A>. Corlett <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3055519/"">argues</A> that this is because chronic, but not acute, NMDA dysfunction is required to stop the hollow mask glitches &#8220;because [keatmine] has a predominant impact on bottom-up AMPA signaling&#8221;. I don&#8217;t really understand this and it seems like a prediction failure to me. On the other hand, chronic marijuana use <i>does</i> prevent mask glitching, which might be because of <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877778/"">marijuana causing NMDA hypofunction</A> over time, which I guess is a point in favor of the chronicity theory.</p>
<p>Fifth, although trans women dissociate less when they take estrogen, trans men dissociate less when they take testosterone. I can&#8217;t find whether testosterone has similar NMDA-promoting properties in the brain, although it sometimes gets aromatized to estrogen so that might be relevant. Also, I&#8217;ve never heard of any trans woman taking testosterone or trans man taking estrogen. If that makes dissociation worse &#8211; and from the psychosocial perspective it probably should &#8211; then that would be a strike against this theory.</p>
<p>Sixth, although I played up the transgender/autism and transgender/schizophrenia links, the truth is that transgender people have higher rates of every mental illness, to the point where it may just be some general factor. I think I&#8217;m justified in focusing on these two results because transgender people&#8217;s higher rates of depression and anxiety are probably just related to being transgender being depressing and anxiety-provoking in this society. But schizophrenia and autism are 80+% genetic, and so harder to explain away like that. Still, somebody could question the relevance of worrying about these two conditions in particular.</p>
<p>I hope some of this can be sorted out in the near future.  A first step would be for someone official to replicate the transgender Hollow Mask pattern and prove that it&#8217;s not just confounded by autism and schizophrenia rates in that population. A very tentative second step would be to investigate whether chronic use of the supplements that improve NMDA function in schizophrenia &#8211; like <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11806864"">glycine</A>, <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26360284"">d-serine</A>, and especially <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632760/"">sarcosine</A> &#8211; can augment estrogen in improving gender dysphoria. Remember to consult your doctor before trying any weird supplements since they may cause unintended side effects, like becoming a Republican.</p>
<p>It could also be worth trying to understand more explicitly <i>why</i> gender identity and NMDA should be linked. This post is long enough already, but I might write more on this in the future. If you want a preview, check out <A HREF=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2576499/"">The Role Of Neonatal NMDA Receptor Activation In Defeminization And Masculinization Of Sex Behavior In The Rat</A> and draw the obvious conclusions.</p>",Yvain,scottalexander,Scott Alexander,

<li>That science is one of our most important tools for understanding the world.</li>

<p>I could continue discussing assumptions and possible criticisms, but that would be a distraction from the core point, which is that there are advantages to having a concrete ideology that is aware of it's own limitations, as opposed to an implicit ideology that is beyond all criticism.</p>
<p>Self-conscious ideologies also have other advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick and easy to write since you don't have to deal with all of the special cases.</li>
<li>Easy to share and explain. Imagine trying to explain to someone, ""Rationality gives us a better understanding of the world, except when it does not"". Okay, I'm exaggerating, epistemic humility typically isn't explained that badly, but it certainly complicates sharing.</li>
<li>Easier for people to adopt the ideology as a lens through which to examine the world, without needing to assume that it is literally true.</li>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t people just say what they mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t want to. I don&#8217;t mean that they choose not to. I don&#8217;t even mean they have been socially conditioned not to. I mean they <em>literally have no way to do the thing. </em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even mean that they don&#8217;t know <em>how </em>in some sense, that they have not realized the possibility. <em>It is literally impossible to &#8220;just&#8221; say what you mean. </em>With work, you can <em>mostly </em>just say what you mean, but even that is <em>hard. </em></p>
<p><span id=""more-7537""></span></p>
<p>This is because <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOhPbJoN_UAhVGMj4KHTX4D-4QFggoMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flesswrong.com%2Flw%2F2p5%2Fhumans_are_not_automatically_strategic%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5ofl5hY38tCrhqbYTwImePY6CVQ"">humans are not automatically strategic</a> or automatically scientific but by default humans are automatically doing lightning fast implicit probabilistic analysis on social information in the background of every moment of their lives. Most of them would not describe it that way, but that is a thing that is going on.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take the example that starts the quote in Scott&#8217;s article: Bob is watching a television show and Alice asks what he is watching.</p>
<p>My experience says that most of the time, this primarily really is a request for information. Alice wants to know what show Bob is watching.</p>
<p>It also raises the probability that Alice will want to watch the show with Bob, conditional on what show Bob is watching; there is even a chance that Alice knows what show it is, and is using the question to open the conversation for this purpose. Certainly, this would be a reasonable thing to do, were Alice potentially interested in watching with Bob. Alice could also simply be making conversation, and want something else entirely. For all we know, she just wants to make a new friend, or plans to distract him and stab him with a knife.</p>
<p>Alice is providing at least very weak evidence in favor of those possibilities, and many others, while providing evidence against everything else.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean Alice <em>wanted </em>to send all of those messages, but whichever one Alice had in mind, there was no way for her to send <em>only </em>that message &#8211; any other thing she could have said would <em>also </em>have had lots of likelihood ratios attached to it.</p>
<p>Then, in turn, Bob&#8217;s response does all of these same things. Telling Alice what the show is gives her that information, which may or may not have been what she wanted. It also indicated that Bob was willing to talk to Alice and to spend minimal effort to give her information, and the tone and detail of how he did that will also be information. It also means Bob turned down the opportunity to interact in some other way, which is information.</p>
<p>The majority of the time, Alice primarily wanted to know what Bob was watching, but to find out, she had no choice but to send out a message with all these other implications as well. Bob was happy to provide the name of the show, but in doing so is also leaking tons of information, no matter how he does it.</p>
<p>There is <em>no such thing </em>as someone <em>just saying what they mean </em>in a normal social context. None.</p>
<p>None of that requires any ulterior motives on Alice or Bob&#8217;s part, either selfish or selfless. Alice and Bob can both <em>want </em>to have the literal ask-then-answer interaction on its own level with no implications, but that only happens if at least one of them is blindly throwing out tons of evidence that humans do not naturally throw out.</p>
<p>If Alice is sufficiently blind to social cues and these sorts of implications (no need to put a label on this) <em>and Bob knows this </em>then Alice can ask not knowing about the other implications of the question, and Bob can know that Alice doesn&#8217;t know those implications, which in turn means that Bob only has to update on the information that Alice wants to know what show Bob is watching enough to ask Bob for that information, and Bob can then answer knowing that Alice won&#8217;t update on the fact that Bob is answering, so Bob doesn&#8217;t have to worry about the other implications of what Alice is saying, so no information leaks from either side and you can have a &#8216;clean&#8217; transaction born of a combination of ignorance and knowledge of that ignorance (the reverse case, or both being blind to cues, also work).</p>
<p>Mostly. You still can&#8217;t <em>actually </em>get the name of the show without Bob updating on the fact that Alice asked the question, and Alice updating on Bob being willing to answer. You can only contain that effect.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the <em>best case </em>scenario for isolated communication, where everyone involved <em>wants </em>it to happen, and isn&#8217;t worried <em>at all </em>about putting someone else in an awkward situation or needing to make sure the other party has an easy way out or what not. In the <em>normal </em>case you are completely screwed.</p>
<p>Of course, when I say completely screwed, I mean forced to engage in all of this hyper-rich communication with lots of detail and implication that allows the parties involved to accomplish a lot with few words and little time. If all of the moves available to you chance a thousand variables, that is both blessing and curse, and the better you know the game and the other players, the more the game becomes efficient and positive-sum.</p>
<p>The option you do not have, unless you want to take your ball and go home, is not to play.</p>

<p>This is an example of <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1388"">humans not being (idealised) agents</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine a human who has a preference to not live beyond a hundred years. However, they want to live to next year, and it's predictable that every year they are alive, they will have the same desire to survive till the next year.</p>
<hr>
<p>This human (not a completely implausible example, I hope!) has a contradiction between their long and short term preferences. So which is accurate? It seems we could resolve these preferences in favour of the short term (""live forever"") or the long term (""die after a century"") preferences.</p>
<p>Now, at this point, maybe we could appeal to meta-preferences - what would the human themselves want, if they could choose? But often these meta-preferences are un- or under-formed, and can be influenced by how the question or debate is framed.</p>
<p>Specifically, suppose we are scheduling this human's agenda. We have the choice of making them meet one of two philosophers (not meeting anyone is not an option). If they meet Professor R. T. Long, he will advise them to follow long term preferences. If instead, they meet Paul Kurtz, he will advise them to pay attention their short term preferences. Whichever one they meet, they will argue for a while and will then settle on the recommended preference resolution. And then they will not change that, whoever they meet subsequently.</p>
<p>Since we are doing the scheduling, we effectively control the human's meta-preferences on this issue. What should we do? And what principles should we use to do so? We are trying to maximise human preferences, but we can also control what they are (and have to control what they are, though our choice of which philosopher they meet first).</p>
<p>It's clear that this can apply to AIs: if they are simultaneously aiding humans as well as learning their preferences, they will have multiple opportunities to do this sort of preference-shaping.</p>

I am not a physicist.)</p>
<p>I have been thinking about a model of physics that is fundamentally different from the ones I have been taught in school and university. It is not a theory, because it does not make predictions. It is a different way of looking at things. I have found that this made a lot of things we normally consider weird a lot easier to understand.</p>
<p>Almost every model of physics I have read of so far is based on the idea that reality consists of stuff inside a coordinate system, and the only question is the dimensionality of the coordinate system. Relativity talks about bending space, but it still treats the existence of space as the norm. But what if there were no dimensions at all?</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p>If we assume that the universe is computable, then dimension-based physics, while humanly intuitive, are unnecessarily complicated. To simulate dimension-based physics, one first needs to define real numbers, which is complicated, and requires that numbers be stored with practically infinite precision. Occam's Razor argues against this.</p>
<p>A graph model in contrast would be extremely simple from a computational point of view: a set of nodes, each with a fixed number of attributes, plus a set of connections between the nodes, suffices to express the state of the universe. Most importantly, it would suffice for the attributes of nodes to be simple booleans or natural numbers, which are much easier to compute than real numbers. Additionally, transition functions to advance in time would be easy to define as well as they could just take the form of a set of if-then rules that are applied to each node in turn. (these transition functions roughly correspond to physical laws in more traditional physical theories)</p>
<p><strong>Idea</strong></p>
<p>Model reality as a graph structure. That is to say, reality at a point of time is a set of nodes, a set of connections between those nodes, and a set of attributes for each node. There are rules for evolving this graph over time that might be as simple as those in Conway's game of life, but they lead to very complex results due to the complicated structure of the graph.</p>
<p>Connections between nodes can be created or deleted over time according to transition functions.</p>
<p>What we call particles are actually patterns of attributes on clusters of nodes. These patterns evolve over time according to transition functions. Also, since particles are patterns instead of atomic entities, they can in principle be created and destroyed by other patterns.</p>
<p>Our view of reality as (almost) 3-dimensional is an illusion created by the way the nodes connect to each other: This can be done if a pattern exists that matches these criterions: change an arbitrarily large graph (a set of vertices, a set of edges), such that the following is true:</p>
<p>-There exists a mapping f(v) of vertices to (x,y,z) coordinates such that for any pair of vertices m,n: the euclidean distance of f(m) and f(n) is approximately equal to the length of the shortest path between m and n (inaccuracies are fine so long as the distance is small, but the approximation should be good at larger distances).</p>
<p>A dimensionless graph model would have no contradiction between quantum physics and relativity. Quantum effects happen when patterns (particles) spread across nodes that still have connections between them besides those connections that make up the primary 3D grid. This also explains why quantum effects exist mostly on small scales: the pattern enforcing 3D grid connections tends to wipe out the entanglements between particles. Space dilation happens because the patterns caused by high speed travel cause the 3D grid pattern to become unstable and the illusion that dimensions exist breaks down. There is no contradiction between quantum physics and relativity if the very concept of distance is unreliable. Time dilation is harder to explain, but can be done. This is left as an exercise to the reader, since I only really understood this graph-based point of view when I realised how that works, and don't want to spoiler the aha-moment for you.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>This is not really a theory. I am not making predictions, I provide no concrete math, and this idea is not really falsifiable in its most generic forms. Why do I still think it is useful? Because it is a new way of looking at physics, and because it makes everything so much more easy and intuitive to understand, and makes all the contradictions go away. I may not know the rules by which the graph needs to propagate in order for this to match up with experimental results, but I am pretty sure that someone more knowledgeable in math can figure them out. This is not a theory, but a new perspective under which to create theories.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to note that there are alternative interpretations for explaining relativity and quantum physics under this perspective. The ones mentioned above are just the ones that seem most intuitive to me. I recognize that having multiple ways to explain something is a bad thing for a theory, but since this is not a theory but a refreshing new perspective, I consider this a good thing.</p>
<p>I think that this approach has a lot of potential, but is difficult for humans to analyse because our brains evolved to deal with 3D structures very efficiently but are not at all optimised to handle arbitrary graph structures with any efficiency. For this reason, Coming up with an actual mathematically complete attempt at a graph-based model of physics would almost certainly require computer simulations for even simple problems.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Do you think the idea has merit?</p>
<p>If not, what are your objections?</p>
<p>Has research in something like this maybe already been done, and I just never heard of it?</p>",Florian_Dietz,florian_dietz,Florian_Dietz,

<p>When you're trying to cooperate with another AI, you need to ensure that its action will fulfill your utility function. And when doing self-modification, you also need to ensure that the successor AI will fulfill your utility function. In both cases, naive utility maximization doesn't work, because you can't fully understand another agent that's as powerful and complex as you. That's a familiar difficulty in game theory, and in self-modification it's known as the Loebian obstacle (fully understandable successors become weaker and weaker).</p>
<p>In general, any AI will be faced with two kinds of situations. In ""single player"" situations, you're faced with a choice like eating chocolate or not, where you can figure out the outcome of each action. (Most situations covered by UDT are also ""single player"", involving identical copies of yourself.) Whereas in ""multiplayer"" situations your action gets combined with the actions of other agents to determine the outcome. Both cooperation and self-modification are ""multiplayer"" situations, and are hard for the same reason. When someone proposes a self-modification to you, you might as well evaluate it with the same code that you use for game theory contests.</p>
<p>If I'm right, then any good theory for cooperation between AIs will also double as a theory of stable self-modification for a single AI. That means neither problem can be much easier than the other, and in particular self-modification won't be a special case of utility maximization, as some people seem to hope. But on the plus side, we need to solve one problem instead of two, so creating FAI becomes a little bit easier.</p>
<p>The idea came to me while working on <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1532"">this mathy post on IAFF</a>,&nbsp;which translates some game theory ideas into the self-modification world. For example, Loebian cooperation (from the game theory world) might lead to a solution for the Loebian obstacle (from the self-modification world) - two LW ideas with the same name that people didn't think to combine before!</p>",cousin_it,cousin_it,cousin_it,

Here's a toy model I came up with, which is similar to <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/e4e/an_angle_of_attack_on_open_problem_1/"">Benya's old model</a> but simpler. A computer program X is asked one of two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Would you like some chocolate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here's the source code of another program Y. Do you accept it as your successor?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Program X will be called a ""winner"" if is says ""yes"" to chocolate, every program Y accepted as successor by X also says ""yes"" to chocolate, every program Z accepted as successor by Y also says ""yes"" to chocolate, and so on. Otherwise X will be called a ""loser"".</p>
<p>Let's also assume that X has access to a provability oracle for Peano arithmetic (PA), to avoid dealing with logical uncertainty.</p>
<p>Here's some simple winning programs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Always say ""yes"" to chocolate. Refuse to accept any successor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always say ""yes"" to chocolate. Accept Y as successor iff Y has the same source code as X.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always say ""yes"" to chocolate. Accept Y as successor iff PA proves that Y is a winner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately (1) is too restrictive, (2) is too sensitive to implementation details, and (3) refuses to accept itself as successor for Goedelian reasons. How do we write a more general winning program?</p>
<p>Note that all programs above are analogous to strategies in the Prisoner's Dilemma with visible source code: (1) is defection, (2) is <a href=""https://ie.technion.ac.il/~moshet/progeqnote4.pdf"">quining cooperation</a>, and (3) is simulating the opponent. But in the PD we also have <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5577"">Loebian cooperation</a>! We could try applying it to our problem naively, like this:</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>Always say ""yes"" to chocolate. Accept Y as successor iff PA proves that ""X is a winner"" implies ""Y is a winner"".</li>
</ol>
<p>At first glance that program looks nice. It accepts itself as successor, and also accepts all programs that PA proves to be winners. Unfortunately it also accepts all losers, because the sentence ""X accepts Y"" becomes provable for Loebian reasons.</p>
<p>But not all is lost! Here's a better way to apply Loebian cooperation to our problem:</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>Always say ""yes"" to chocolate. Accept Y as successor iff PA proves that Y can't lose in fewer steps than X.</li>
</ol>
<p>(More precisely, for all n such that X can't lose in n steps, Y also can't lose in n steps.)</p>
<p>Proof that X is a winner: X can't lose in one step by construction. Therefore Y can't lose in one step, as long as PA is sound. Therefore X can't lose in two steps. Therefore Y can't lose in two steps, as long as PA is sound. And so on, QED.</p>
<p>It's easy to see that X accepts itself as successor, as well as modifications of itself, and also accepts all programs that PA proves to be winners. So it seems to be quite general. And the condition ""Y can't lose in fewer steps than X"" also makes sense philosophically, because it means ""X doesn't move toward losing"".</p>
<p>Followup questions: I'm not sure if this is related to Benya's <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/e5j/how_to_cheat_l%C3%B6bs_theorem_my_second_try/"">parametric polymorphism</a>, what's the right analogy between self-modification and game theory, or how far it can be generalized.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Perhaps the EA community could fund a forecasting tournament on the Good Judgment Project posing questions attempting to ascertain when AGI will be developed (I am guessing superforecasters will make more accurate predictions than AI experts on this topic), which research groups are the most likely candidates to be the developers of the first AGI, and other relevant questions. We would need to formulate the questions such that they are specific enough for use in the tournament.&nbsp;</p>",madhatter,madhatter,madhatter,

<h1>Personal Introduction</h1>
<p>I came to define myself as a <em>non-standard</em> Effective Altruist. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in Effective Altruism, way before I&rsquo;ve even heard of EA. When I was younger, I simply thought I was altruist, and that what people did was &hellip; noise at best. Basically, naive ways to relieve one&rsquo;s conscience and perpetuate one&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>Since primary school I thought about global problems and solutions to these problems. So much so that the word &ldquo;project&rdquo; internally connotes &ldquo;project solving some global problems&rdquo;. As such, EA <strong>should</strong> have interested me.</p>
<p>However, it didn&rsquo;t. The main reason was that I saw EA as <em>some other charitists</em>. I&rsquo;ve always been skeptical toward charity, the reason being &ldquo;They think too small&rdquo; and &ldquo;There are too much funding in standard solutions rather than in finding new ones&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think this exemplifies a problem about EA&rsquo;s communication.</p>
<h1><a id=""A_Communication_Problem_12""></a>A Communication Problem</h1>
<p>Most people I know got to know Effective Altruism through <a href=""https://www.effectivealtruism.org/"">EffectiveAltruism.org</a>.</p>
<p>Because of that website, these people see EA as a closed organization that help people to direct funds to better charities and find better careers.</p>
<p>That was my opinion of EA until I saw the <a href=""https://www.effectivealtruism.org/grants/"">grant offer</a> : a closed organization with already defined solutions wouldn&rsquo;t fund new ideas. As such, I changed my outlook of EA. I researched a bit more about it, and found an open and diverse community.</p>
<p>But I am busy person, therefore I have to use filters before putting more time in researching about something. I made my impression from :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=""http://effectivealtruism.org"">effectivealtruism.org</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism"">The Wikipedia entry</a>. Particularly the <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Cause_priorities"">Cause Priorities</a></em> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People loosely related to EA. From LessWrong, SlateStarCodex and outside rationalist circles, I asked them (with open-ended questions) about EA, but they confirmed my first impression.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What convinced me of that impression was the website&rsquo;s content :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The tabs are &ldquo;About, Blog, Donate, Effectively, Resources, Grants, Get Involved&rdquo;. This looks like a standard showcase website of a closed organization with a call to donate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first four reading suggestions after the introduction are about charity and career choice. This leads people to thinking that EA is solely about that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the introduction, the three main questions are &ldquo;Which cause/career/charity ?&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t stop there, and I read more of that website, but it was along those same lines.</p>
<p>Counting me, my friends and people I met on LW and SSC, this directly led to losing 10-15 <em>potential</em> altruists in the community. Given that we were already interested in applying rationality to changing the world and my situation is not isolated (the aforementioned website is the first hit for &ldquo;Effective Altruism&rdquo; on Google), I do think that it is an important issue to EA.</p>
<h1><a id=""Solutions_46""></a>Solutions</h1>
<p>Well, about the website :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding a tab &ldquo;Open Ideas&rdquo;/&ldquo;Open projects&rdquo;, &ldquo;Forum&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;Communities&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Get Involved&rdquo; is the only tab that offers (and only implicitly) some interaction. The new <em>Involvement Guide</em> is an action in the right direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putting emphasis on the different communities and approaches. Digging, I&rsquo;ve seen that there are several communities. However, the most prominent discriminating factor was the location. It would be nice to see a presentation of various approaches of EA, especially in the first resources new members get in touch with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But more than changing the website, I think that lacking to EA is a platform dedicated to collective thinking about new ideas.</p>
<p>Projects don&rsquo;t happen magically : people think, come to an idea, think more about that idea, criticize it, and if all goes well, maybe build a plan out of it, gather, and begin a project together. If we truly want new projects to emerge, having such a platform is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://effective-altruism.com/"">current forum</a> doesn&rsquo;t cut it : it isn&rsquo;t meant to that end. It&rsquo;s easier to build a forum dedicated to that than try to artificially support a balance between &ldquo;New Ideas&rdquo; posts and &ldquo;Information Sharing&rdquo; posts so that none of these get overshadowed. The same problem applies to existing reddit boards and facebook groups.</p>
<p>That platform should contain at least the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A place where new ideas are posted and criticized. <em>A Reddit board, a Fecebook group, a forum.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A place where ideas are discussed interactively. <em>An IRC channel, a web chat, a Discord server.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A place where ideas/projects are improved collectively and incrementally. <em>A web pad, a Google doc, a Git repository.</em></p>
</li>

<p>Epistemic Status: Varies all over the map from point to point</p>
<p>Length Status: In theory I suppose it could be longer</p>
<p>This is a long post is long post responding to a almost as long (and several weeks and several controversy cycles old, because life comes at you fast on the internet) post, which includes extensive quoting from the original post and assumes you have already read the original. If you are not interested in a very long analysis of another person&#8217;s proposal for a rationalist group house, given that life is short, you can (and probably should) safely skip this one.</p>
<p><span id=""more-6397""></span></p>
<p>Dragon Army is a crazy idea that just might work. It probably won&#8217;t, but it might. It might work because it believes in something that has not been tried, and there is a chance that those involved will actually try the thing and see what happens.</p>
<p>Scott made an observation that the responses to the Dragon Army proposal on Less Wrong were mostly constructive criticism, while the responses on Tumblr were mostly expressions of horror. That is exactly the response you would expect from a project with real risks, but also real potential benefits worth taking the risks to get. This updates me strongly in favor of going forward with the project.</p>
<p>As one would expect, the idea as laid out in the charter is far from perfect. There are many modifications that need to be made, both that one could foresee in advance, and that one could not foresee in advance.</p>
<p>My approach is going to be to go through the post and comment on the components of the proposal, then pull back and look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>In part 1, Duncan makes arguments, then later in part 2 he says the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately, though, what matters is not the problems and solutions themselves so much as the light they shine on my aesthetics (since, in the actual house, it&#8217;s those aesthetics that will be used to resolve epistemic gridlock).  In other words, it&#8217;s not so much <em>those arguments</em> as it is <em>the fact that Duncan finds those arguments compelling.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I agree in one particular case that this is the important (and worrisome) thing, but mostly I disagree and think that we should be engaging with the arguments themselves. This could be because I am as interested in learning about and discussing general things using the proposal as a taking-off point, as I am in the proposal itself. A lot of what Duncan discusses and endorses is <em>the value of doing a thing at all even if it isn&#8217;t the best thing </em>and I strongly agree with that &#8211; this is me going out and engaging with this thing&#8217;s thingness, and doing a concrete thing to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Purpose of post: Threefold. First, a lot of rationalists live in group houses, and I believe I have some interesting models and perspectives, and I want to make my thinking available to anyone else who&#8217;s interested in skimming through it for Things To Steal. Second, since my initial proposal to found a house, I&#8217;ve noticed a significant amount of well-meaning pushback and concern à la have you noticed the skulls? and it&#8217;s entirely unfair for me to expect that to stop unless I make my skull-noticing evident. Third, some nonzero number of humans are gonna need to sign the final version of this charter if the house is to come into existence, and it has to be viewable somewhere. I figured the best place was somewhere that impartial clear thinkers could weigh in (flattery).</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this is good, and responses definitely did not do enough looking for Things To Steal, so I&#8217;d encourage others to do that more. Duncan (the author) proposes a lot of concrete things and makes a lot of claims. You don&#8217;t need to agree with all, most or even many of them to potentially find worthwhile ideas. Letting people know you&#8217;ve thought about all the things that can go wrong is also good, although actually thinking about those things is (ideally) more important, and I worry from the interactions that Duncan is more concerned with showing that he&#8217;s considered all the concerns than he is concerned with the actual concerns, but at a sufficient level of rigor that algorithm might not be efficient but it will still be sufficient. And of course, I think Less Wrong was the right place to post this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>What is Dragon Army? It&#8217;s a high-commitment, high-standards, high-investment group house model with centralized leadership and an up-or-out participation norm, designed to a) improve its members and b) actually accomplish medium-to-large scale tasks requiring long-term coordination.  Tongue-in-cheek referred to as the &#8220;fascist/authoritarian take on rationalist housing,&#8221; which has no doubt contributed to my being vulnerable to strawmanning but was nevertheless the correct joke to be making, lest people misunderstand what they were signing up for.  Aesthetically modeled after Dragon Army from Ender&#8217;s Game (<em>not</em> HPMOR), with a touch of Paper Street Soap Company thrown in, with Duncan Sabien in the role of Ender/Tyler and Eli Tyre in the role of Bean/The Narrator.</p></blockquote>
<p>I applaud Duncan&#8217;s instinct to use the metaphors he actually believes apply to what he is doing, rather than the ones that would avoid <em>scaring the living hell out of everyone. </em>Less points for <em>actually believing those metaphors </em><em>without thinking there is a problem. </em></p>
<p>I have seen and heard arguments against structuring things as an army, or against structuring things in an authoritarian fashion. As I note in the next section, I think these are things to be cautious of but that are worth trying, and I do not find either of them especially scary <em>when they are based on free association. </em>If our kind can&#8217;t cooperate enough to have a temporary volunteer metaphoric army that does not shoot anyone and does not get shot at, then <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/3h/why_our_kind_cant_cooperate/"">we really can&#8217;t cooperate</a>. Ender is a person you may wish to emulate, at least until some point in books that were written and happen later, and may or may not exist.</p>
<p>What should freak Duncan (and everyone else) out is the reference that people seem to be strangely glossing over, which is the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/"">Paper Street Soap Company</a>. Fight Club is a great movie (and book), and if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet you should go see it and/or read it, but &#8211; spoiler alert, guys! &#8211; Tyler Durdan is a bad dude. Tyler Durdan is completely insane. He is not a person you want to copy or emulate. <em>I should not have to be saying this. This should be obvious. </em>Seriously. The original author made this somewhat more explicit in the book, but the movie really should have been clear enough for everyone.</p>
<p>That does not mean that Tyler Durdan did not have a worthwhile message for us hidden under all of that. Many (including villains) do, but no, Tyler is not the hero, and no, he does not belong to the Magneto List of Villains Who Are Right. You can notice that your life is ending one minute at a time, and that getting out there in the physical world and taking risks is good, and that the things you own can end up owning you, and even learn how to make soap. Fine.</p>
<p>You do not want to be trying to recreate something called Project Mayhem, unless your Dragon Army is deep inside enemy territory and fighting an actual war (in which case you probably still don&#8217;t want to do that, but at least I see the attraction).</p>
<p>Also, if you want to show that you can delegate and trust others, and you&#8217;re referring to your second in command as &#8216;The Narrator&#8217; I would simply say &#8220;spoiler alert,&#8221; and ask you to ponder that again for a bit.</p>
<p>The weird part is that the proposal here does not, to me, evoke the Paper Street Soap Company at all, so what I am worried about is <em>why this metaphor appealed to Duncan </em>more than anything else.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why? Current group housing/attempts at group rationality and community-supported leveling up seem to me to be falling short in a number of ways. First, there&#8217;s not enough stuff actually happening in them (i.e. to the extent people are growing and improving and accomplishing ambitious projects, it&#8217;s largely within their professional orgs or fueled by unusually agenty individuals, and not by leveraging the low-hanging fruit available in our house environments). Second, even the group houses seem to be plagued by the same sense of unanchored abandoned loneliness that&#8217;s hitting the rationalist community specifically and the millennial generation more generally. There are a bunch of competitors for &#8220;third,&#8221; but for now we can leave it at that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in the post, Duncan hits on what third is, and I think that third is super important: Even if you think we&#8217;ve got a good version of the group house concept, we are doing far too much exploitation of the group house concept, and not enough exploration. There is variation on the location, size and mix of people that compose a house, and some tinkering with a few other components, but the basic structures remain invariant. The idea of a group house built around the group being a group that does ambitious things together, and/or operating with an authoritarian structure, has not been tried and been found wanting. It has been found scary and difficult, and not been tried. Yes, I have heard others note that the intentionally named Intentional Community Community did ban authoritarian houses because they find that they rarely work out, but they also all focus on &#8216;sustainability&#8217; rather than trying to accomplish big things in the world, so I am not overly worried about that.</p>
<p>His second reason also seems important. There is an epidemic of loneliness hitting both our community and the entire world as well. Younger generations may or may not have it worse, but if one can state with a straight face that the average American only has 2-3 close friends (whether or not that statistic is accurate) there is a huge problem. I have more than that, but not as many as I used to, or as many as I would like. If group houses are not generating close friendships, that is very bad, and we should try and fix it, since this is an important unmet need for many of us and they should be a very good place to meet that need.</p>
<p>His first reason I am torn about because it is not obvious that stuff should be actually happening inside the houses as opposed to the houses providing an infrastructure for people who then cause things to happen. Most important things that happen in the world happen in professional organizations or as the result of unusually agenty individuals. Houses could be very successful at causing things to happen without any highly visible things happening within the houses. The most obvious ways to do this are to support the mechanisms Duncan mentions. One could provide support for people to devote their energies to important organizations and projects elsewhere, by letting people get their domestic needs met for less time and money, and by steering them to the most important places and projects. One could also do other things that generate more unusually agenty individuals, or make those individuals more effective when they do agenty things (and/or make them do even more agenty things), which in my reading is one of two main goals of Dragon Army, the other being to increase connection between its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s claim here is that there are things that could be happening directly in the houses that are not happening, and that those things represent low-hanging fruit. This seems plausible, but it does not seem obvious, nor does it seem obvious what the low-hanging fruit would be. The rest of the post does go into details, so judgment needs to be based on those details.</p>
<blockquote><p>Problem 1: Pendulums</p>
<p>This one&#8217;s first because it informs and underlies a lot of my other assumptions.  Essentially, the claim here is that most social progress can be modeled as a pendulum oscillating decreasingly far from an ideal.  The society is &#8220;stuck&#8221; at one point, realizes that there&#8217;s something wrong about that point (e.g. that maybe we shouldn&#8217;t be forcing people to live out their entire lives in marriages that they entered into with imperfect information when they were like sixteen), and then moves to correct that <em>specific </em>problem, often breaking some other Chesterton&#8217;s fence in the process.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/Dr1yRq6.png"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""355"" /></p>
<p>For example, my experience leads me to put a lot of confidence behind the claim that we&#8217;ve traded &#8220;a lot of people trapped in marriages that are net bad for them&#8221; for &#8220;a lot of people who never reap the benefits of what would&#8217;ve been a strongly net-positive marriage, because it ended too easily too early on.&#8221;  The latter problem is clearly smaller, and is probably a better problem to have as an individual, but it&#8217;s nevertheless clear (to me, anyway) that the loosening of the absoluteness of marriage had negative effects <em>in addition to</em> its positive ones.</p>
<p>Proposed solution:<em> </em>Rather than choosing between absolutes, <em>integrate.</em>  For example, I have two close colleagues/allies who share millennials&#8217; default skepticism of lifelong marriage, but they <em>also</em> are skeptical that a commitment-free lifestyle is costlessly good.  So they&#8217;ve decided to do handfasting, in which they&#8217;re fully committed for a year and a day at a time, and there&#8217;s a known period of time for asking the question &#8220;should we stick together for another round?&#8221;</p>
<p>In this way, I posit, you can get the strengths of the old socially evolved norm which stood the test of time, <em>while also</em> avoiding the majority of its known failure modes.  Sort of like building a gate into the Chesterton&#8217;s fence, instead of knocking it down—do the old thing in time-boxed iterations with regular strategic check-ins, rather than assuming you can invent a new thing from whole cloth.</p>
<p>Caveat/skull: Of course, the assumption here is that the Old Way Of Doing Things is not a slippery slope trap, and that you can <em>in fact</em> avoid the failure modes simply by trying.  And there are plenty of examples of that <em>not</em> working, which is why Taking Time-Boxed Experiments And Strategic Check-Ins Seriously is a must.  In particular, when attempting to strike such a balance, all parties must have common knowledge agreement about <em>which side</em> of the ideal to err toward (e.g. innocents in prison, or guilty parties walking free?).</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the pendulum is a very bad model of social progress. It seems pretty rare that we exist (are stuck) at point A, then we try point B, and then we realize that our mistake was that we swung a little too far but that a point we passed through was right all along. This is the Aristotle mistake of automatically praising the mean, when there is no reason to think that your bounds are in any way reasonable, or that you are even thinking about the right set of possible rules, actions or virtues. If anything, there is usually reason to suspect otherwise.</p>
<p>Even in examples where you have a sort of &#8216;zero-sum&#8217; decision where policy needs to choose a point on a number line, I think this is mostly wrong.</p>
<p>I guess there are some examples of starting out with the equilibrium &#8220;Abortions for no one,&#8221; then moving to the equilibrium &#8220;Abortions for everyone,&#8221; and then settling on the equilibrium &#8220;Abortions for some, miniature American flags for others&#8221; and that being the correct answer (I am not making a claim of any kind of what the correct answer is here). Call this Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis.</p>
<p>There are a lot more examples of social progress that go more like &#8220;Slaves for everyone&#8221; then getting to &#8220;Slaves for some&#8221; and finally reaching &#8220;actually, you know what, slaves for no one, ever, and seriously do I even need to explain this one?&#8221; Call this Thesis-LessThesis-Antithesis, and then Anti-Thesis just wins and then we get progress.</p>
<p>There is also the mode where someone notices a real problem but then has a really, mindbogglingly bad idea, for example Karl Marx, the idea is tried, and it turns out it is not only Not Progress but a huge disaster. Then, if you are paying attention, abandon it and try something else, but you learn from what happened. Now you understand where some of the fences are and what they are for, which helps you come up with a new plan, but your default should absolutely not be &#8220;well, sure, that was a huge disaster so we should try some mixture of what we just did and the old way and that will totally be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no reason to assume you were moving in the correct direction, or even the correct dimension. Do not be fooled by the Overton Window.</p>
<p>If anything, to the extent that you must choose a point on the number line, moving from 0 to 1 and finding 1 to be worse is not a good reason to try 0.5 unless your prior is very strong. It might well be a reason to try -0.5 or -1! Maybe you didn&#8217;t even realize that was an option before, or why you might want to do that.</p>
<blockquote><p>Problem 2: The Unpleasant Valley</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it&#8217;s pretty uncontroversial to claim that humans are systems with a lot of inertia.  Status quo bias is well researched, past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior, most people fail at resolutions, etc.</p>
<p>I have some unqualified speculation regarding what&#8217;s going on under the hood.  For one, I suspect that you&#8217;ll often find humans behaving pretty much as an effort- and energy-conserving algorithm would behave.  People have optimized their most known and familiar processes at least somewhat, which means that it requires less oomph to just keep doing what you&#8217;re doing than to cobble together a new system.  For another, I think hyperbolic discounting gets way too little credit/attention, and is a major factor in knocking people off the wagon when they&#8217;re trying to forego local behaviors that are known to be intrinsically rewarding for local behaviors that add up to long-term cumulative gain.</p>
<p>But in short, I think the picture of &#8220;I&#8217;m going to try something new, eh?&#8221; often looks like this:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/N2DnLqy.png"" alt="""" width=""700"" height=""396"" /></p>
<p>&#8230; with an &#8220;unpleasant valley&#8221; some time after the start point.  Think about the cold feet you get after the &#8220;honeymoon period&#8221; has worn off, or the desires and opinions of a military recruit in the second week of a six-week boot camp, or the frustration that emerges two months into a new diet/exercise regime, or your second year of being forced to take piano lessons.</p>
<p>The problem is, people never <em>make</em> it to the third year, where they&#8217;re <em>actually good at piano, and start reaping the benefits, and their System 1 updates to yeah, okay, this is in fact worth it.</em>  Or rather, they <em>sometimes</em> make it, if there are strong supportive structures to get them across the unpleasant valley (e.g. in a military bootcamp, they just &#8230; make you keep going).  But left to our own devices, we&#8217;ll often get halfway through an experiment and just &#8230; stop, without ever finding out what the far side is actually like.</p>
<p>Proposed solution: Make experiments &#8220;unquittable.&#8221;  The idea here is that (ideally) one would not <em>enter</em> into a new experiment unless a) one were highly confident that one could absorb the costs, if things go badly, and b) one were reasonably confident that there was an Actually Good Thing waiting at the finish line.  If (big if) we take those as a given, then it should be safe to, in essence, &#8220;lock oneself in,&#8221; via any number of commitment mechanisms.  Or, to put it in other words: &#8220;Medium-Term Future Me is going to lose perspective and want to give up because of being unable to see past short-term unpleasantness to the juicy, long-term goal?  Fine, then—Medium-Term Future Me doesn&#8217;t get a vote.&#8221;  Instead, <em>Post-Experiment Future Me</em> gets the vote, including getting to update heuristics on which-kinds-of-experiments-are-worth-entering.</p>
<p>Caveat/skull: People who are bad at self-modeling end up foolishly locking themselves into things that are higher-cost or lower-EV than they thought, and getting burned; black swans and tail risk ends up making even good bets turn out very very badly; we <em>really</em> should&#8217;ve built in an ejector seat.  This risk can be mostly ameliorated by starting small and giving people a chance to calibrate—you don&#8217;t make white belts try to punch through concrete blocks, you make them punch soft, pillowy targets first.</p>
<p>And, of course, you <em>do</em> build in an ejector seat.  See next.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the core thesis behind a lot of the concrete details of Dragon Army. Temporary commitment allows you to get through the time period where you are getting negative short-term payoffs that sap your motivation, and reach a later stage where you get paid off for all your hard work, while giving you the chance to bail if it turns out the experiment is a failure and you are never going to get rewarded.</p>
<p>I would have drawn the graph above with a lot more random variations, but the implications are the same.</p>
<p>I think this is a key part that people should steal, if they do not have a better system already in place that works for them. When you are learning to play the piano, you are effectively deciding each day whether to stick with it or to quit, and you only learn to play the piano if you never decide to quit (you can obviously miss a day and recover, but I think the toy model gives the key insights and is good enough). You can reliably predict that there will be variation (some random, some predictable) in your motivation from day to day and week to week, and over longer time frames, so if you give yourself a veto every day (or every week) then by default you will quit far too often.</p>
<p>If every few years, you hold a vote on whether to leave the European Union and destroy your economy, or to end your democracy and appoint a dictator, eventually the answer will be yes. It will not be the &#8216;will of the people&#8217; so much as the &#8216;whim of the people&#8217; and you want protection against that. The one-person case is no different.</p>
<p>The ejector seat is important. If things are going sufficiently badly, there needs to be a way out, because the alternatives are to either stick with the thing, or to eject anyway and destroy your ability to commit to future things. Even when you eject for good reasons using the agreed upon procedures, it still damages your ability to commit. The key is to calibrate the threshold for the seat, in terms of requirements and costs, such that it being used implies that the decision to eject was over-determined, but with a bar no higher than is necessary for that to be true.</p>
<p>For most commitments, your ability to commit to things is far more valuable than anything else at stake. Even when the other stakes are big, that also means the commitment stakes are also big. This means that once you commit, you should follow through almost all the time even when you realize that agreeing to commit was a mistake. That in turn means one should think <em>very carefully </em>about when to commit to things, and not committing if you think you are likely to quit in a way that is damaging to your commitment abilities.</p>
<p>I think that if anything, Duncan under-states the importance of reliable commitment. His statements above about marriage are a good example of that, even despite the corrective words he writes about the subject later on. Agreeing to stay together for a year is a sea change from no commitment at all, and there are some big benefits to the year, <em>but that is not remotely like the benefits of a real marriage. </em>Giving an agreement an end point, at which the parties will re-negotiate, fundamentally changes the nature of the relationship. Longer term plans and trades, which are extremely valuable, cannot be made without worrying about incentive compatibility, and both sides have to worry about their future negotiating positions and market value. Even if both parties want things to continue, each year both parties have to worry about their negotiating position, and plan for their future negotiating positions.</p>
<p>You get to move from a world in which you need to play both for the team and for yourself, and where you get to play only for the team. This changes everything.</p>
<p>It also means that you do not get the insurance benefits. This isn&#8217;t formal, pay-you-money insurance. This is the insurance of having someone there for you even when you have gone sick or insane or depressed, or other similar thing, and you have nothing to offer them, and they will be there for you anyway. We need that. We need to <em>count </em>on that.</p>
<p>I could say a lot more, but it would be beyond scope.</p>
<blockquote><p>Problem 3: Saving Face</p>
<p>If any of you have been to a martial arts academy in the United States, you&#8217;re probably familiar with the norm whereby a tardy student purchases entry into the class by first doing some pushups.  The standard explanation here is that the student is doing the pushups not as a punishment, but rather as a sign of respect for the instructor, the other students, and the academy as a whole.</p>
<p>I posit that what&#8217;s <em>actually</em> going on includes that, but is somewhat more subtle/complex.  I think the real benefit of the pushup system is that it <em>closes the loop</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re a ten year old kid, and your parent picked you up late from school, and you&#8217;re stuck in traffic on your way to the dojo.  You&#8217;re sitting there, jittering, wondering whether you&#8217;re going to get yelled at, wondering whether the master or the other students will think you&#8217;re lazy, imagining stuttering as you try to explain that it wasn&#8217;t your fault—</p>
<p>Nope, none of that.  Because it&#8217;s <em>already clearly established</em> that if you fail to show up on time, you do some pushups, and then it&#8217;s over.  Done.  Finished.  Like somebody sneezed and somebody else said &#8220;bless you,&#8221; and now we can all move on with our lives.  Doing the pushups <em>creates common knowledge</em> around the questions &#8220;does this person know what they did wrong?&#8221; and &#8220;do we still have faith in their core character?&#8221;  You take your lumps, everyone <em>sees</em> you taking your lumps, and there&#8217;s no dangling suspicion that you were just being lazy, or that other people are secretly judging you.  You&#8217;ve paid the price in public, and everyone knows it, and this is a <em>good</em> thing.</p>
<p>Proposed solution: This is a solution without a concrete problem, since I haven&#8217;t yet actually outlined the specific commitments a Dragon has to make (regarding things like showing up on time, participating in group activities, and making personal progress).  But in essence, the solution is this: you have to build into your system <em>from the beginning</em> a set of ways-to-regain-face.  Ways to hit the ejector seat on an experiment that&#8217;s going screwy without losing all social standing; ways to absorb the occasional misstep or failure-to-adequately-plan; ways to be less-than-perfect and still maintain the integrity of a system that&#8217;s geared toward focusing everyone on perfection.  In short, people have to know (and others have to know that they know, and they have to know that others know that they know) exactly <em>how</em> to make amends to the social fabric, in cases where things go awry, so that there&#8217;s no question about <em>whether</em> they&#8217;re trying to make amends, or whether that attempt is sufficient.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/TT2PKPi.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""429"" /></p>
<p>Caveat/skull: The obvious problem is people attempting to game the system—they notice that ten pushups is <em>way</em> easier than doing the diligent work required to show up on time 95 times out of 100.  The next obvious problem is that the price is set too low for the group, leaving them to still feel jilted or wronged, and the <em>next</em> obvious problem is that the price is set too high for the individual, leaving them to feel unfairly judged or punished (the fun part is when both of those are true <em>at the same time).</em>  Lastly, there&#8217;s something in the mix about arbitrariness—what do pushups have to do with lateness, really?  I mean, I get that it&#8217;s paying some kind of unpleasant cost, but &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the idea of closing the loop being important is very right. Humans need reciprocity and fairness, but if the cost is known and paid, and everyone knows this, we can all move on and not worry about whether we can all move on. One of the things I love about my present job is that we focus hard on closing this loop. You can make a meme-level huge mistake, and as long as you own up to it and fix the issue going forward, everyone puts it behind them. The amount to which this improves my life is hard to over-state.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the push-ups at the dojo are pretty great. They are in some sense a punishment for <em>present me </em>but are not even a punishment as such. Everyone did lots of push-ups anyway. Push-ups are a good thing! By doing them, you show that you are still serious about trying to train, and you do something more intense to make up for the lost time. The push-ups are practical. In expectation, you transfer your push-ups from another time to now, allowing the class to assign less push-ups at other times based on the ones people will do when they occasionally walk in late or otherwise mess up.</p>
<p>This means that you get the equivalent a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax"">pigouvian tax</a>. You create perception of fairness, you correct incentives, and you generate revenue (fitness)! Triple win!</p>
<p>I once saw a Magic: The Gathering team do the literal push-up thing. They were playing a deck with the card Eidelon of the Great Revel, which meant that every time an opponent cast a spell, they had to say &#8216;trigger&#8217; to make their opponent take damage. They agreed that if anyone ever missed such a trigger, after the round they had to do push-ups. This seemed fun, useful and excellent.</p>
<p>The &#8216;price&#8217; being an action that is close to efficient anyway is key to the system being a success. If push-ups provided no fitness benefit, the system would not work. The best prices do transfer utility from you to the group, <em>but more importantly they also transfer utility from present you to future you.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Problem 4: Defections &amp; Compounded Interest</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure everyone&#8217;s tired of hearing about one-boxing and iterated prisoners&#8217; dilemmas, so I&#8217;m going to move through this one fairly quickly even though it could be its own whole multipage post.  In essence, the problem is that any rate of tolerance of <em>real defection </em>(i.e. unmitigated by the social loop-closing norms above) ultimately results in the destruction of the system.  Another way to put this is that people underestimate by a couple of orders of magnitude the corrosive impact of their defections—we often convince ourselves that 90% or 99% is good enough, when in fact what&#8217;s needed is something like 99.99%.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something good that happens if you put a little bit of money away with every paycheck, and it vanishes or is severely curtailed once you stop, or start skipping a month here and there.  Similarly, there&#8217;s something good that happens when a group of people agree to meet in the same place at the same time without fail, and it vanishes or is severely curtailed once one person skips twice.</p>
<p>In my work at the Center for Applied Rationality, I frequently tell my colleagues and volunteers &#8220;if you&#8217;re 95% reliable, that means I can&#8217;t rely on you.&#8221;  That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m in a context where &#8220;rely&#8221; means <em>really trust that it&#8217;ll get done.  No, really.  No, I don&#8217;t care what comes up, DID YOU DO THE THING?  </em>And if the answer is &#8220;Yeah, 19 times out of 20,&#8221; then I can&#8217;t give that person tasks ever again, because we run more than 20 workshops and I can&#8217;t have one of them catastrophically fail.</p>
<p>(I mean, I <em>could</em>.  It probably wouldn&#8217;t be the end of the world.  But that&#8217;s exactly the point—I&#8217;m trying to create a pocket universe in which certain things, like &#8220;the CFAR workshop will go well,&#8221; are <em>absolutely reliable</em>, and the &#8220;absolute&#8221; part is important.)</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it&#8217;s hyperbolic discounting all over again—the person who wants to skip out on the meetup sees all of these immediate, local costs to attending, and all of these visceral, large gains to defection, and their S1 doesn&#8217;t properly weight the impact to those distant, cumulative effects (just like the person who&#8217;s going to end up with no retirement savings because they wanted those new shoes <em>this</em> month instead of <em>next</em> month).  1.01^n takes a long time to look like it&#8217;s going <em>anywhere</em>, and in the meantime the quick one-time payoff of 1.1 that you get by knocking everything <em>else</em> down to .99^n looks juicy and delicious and <em>seems justified</em>.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/A0aNvic.png"" alt="""" width=""599"" height=""248"" /></p>
<p>But something magical <em>does</em> accrue when you make the jump from 99% to 100%.  That&#8217;s when you see teams that truly trust and rely on one another, or marriages built on unshakeable faith (and you see what those teams and partnerships can <em>build</em>, when they can adopt time horizons of years or decades rather than desperately hoping nobody will bail after the third meeting).  It starts with a common knowledge understanding that yes, <em>this</em> is the priority, even—no, wait, <em>especially</em>—when it seems like there are seductively convincing arguments for it to <em>not</em> be.  When you know—not hope, but <em>know—</em>that you will make a local sacrifice for the long-term good, and you know that they will, too, and you all <em>know</em> that you all know this, both about yourselves and about each other.</p>
<p>Proposed solution: Discuss, and then agree upon, and then <em>rigidly and rigorously enforce</em> a norm of perfection in all formal undertakings (and, correspondingly, be more careful and more conservative about which undertakings you <em>officially</em> take on, versus which things you&#8217;re just casually trying out as an <em>informal</em> experiment), with said norm to be modified/iterated only during predecided strategic check-in points and not on the fly, in the middle of things.  Build a habit of clearly distinguishing targets you&#8217;re <em>going</em> to hit from targets you&#8217;d be <em>happy</em> to hit.  Agree upon and uphold surprisingly high costs for defection, Hofstadter style, recognizing that a cost that feels high enough <em>probably isn&#8217;t</em>.  Leave people wiggle room as in Problem 3, but define that wiggle room <em>extremely concretely and objectively,</em> so that it&#8217;s clear <em>in advance </em>when a line is about to be crossed.  Be ridiculously nitpicky and anal about supporting standards that don&#8217;t seem worth supporting, in the moment, if they&#8217;re in arenas that you&#8217;ve previously assessed as susceptible to compounding.  Be ruthless about <em>discarding</em> standards during strategic review; if a member of the group says that X or Y or Z is too high-cost for them to sustain, believe them, and make decisions accordingly.</p>
<p>Caveat/skull: Obviously, because we&#8217;re humans, <em>even people who reflectively endorse such an overall solution</em> will chafe when it comes time for <em>them</em> to pay the price (I certainly know <em>I&#8217;ve</em> chafed under standards I fought to install).  At that point, things will seem arbitrary and overly constraining, priorities will seem misaligned (and might actually be), and then feelings will be hurt and accusations will be leveled and things will be rough.  The solution there is to have, already in place, strong and open channels of communication, strong norms and scaffolds for emotional support, strong default assumption of trust and good intent on all sides, etc. etc.  This goes wrongest when things fester and people feel they can&#8217;t speak up; it goes much better if people have channels to lodge their complaints and reservations and are actively incentivized to do so (and can do so <em>without being accused of defecting</em> on the norm-in-question; criticism =/= attack).</p></blockquote>
<p>It brings me great joy that someone out there has taken the need for true reliability, and gone too far.</p>
<p>I do not think the exponential model above is a good model. I <em>do </em>think something special happens when things become reliable enough that you do not feel the need to worry about or plan for what you are going to do when they do not happen, and you can simply assume they will happen.</p>
<p>A lot of this jump is that your brain accepts that things you agreed to do <em>just happen. </em>You are not going to waste time considering whether or not they are going to happen, you are only going to ask the question <em>how </em>to make them happen. They are automatic and become habits, and the habit of doing this also becomes a habit. Actually <em>being truly reliable </em>is easier in many ways than being unreliable! This is similar to the realization that it is much easier and less taxing to never drink than to drink a very small amount. It is much easier and less taxing to never cheat (for almost all values of cheating) than to contain cheating at a low but non-zero level. Better to not have the option in your mind at all.</p>
<p>There is another great thing that happens when you assume that getting a &#8216;yes I will do this thing&#8217; from someone means they will do the thing, and if it turns out they did not do the thing, it is because it was <em>ludicrously obvious </em>that they were not supposed to do the thing given the circumstances, and they gave you what warning or adaptation they could. Just like you no longer need to consider the option of not doing the thing, you get to not consider that <em>they </em>will choose not do the thing, or what you need to do to ensure they do the thing.</p>
<p>It is ludicrously hard to get 99.99% reliability from anyone. If you are telling me that I need to come to the weekly meetup 99.9% of the time you are telling me I can miss it one time in <em>twenty years. </em>If you ask for 99.9% it means meeting every day and missing once in twenty years. Does anyone have real emergencies that are that rare? Do opportunities that are worth taking instead come along once every few decades? This doesn&#8217;t make sense. I believe we did manage to go several years in a row in New York without missing a Tuesday night, and yes that was valuable by letting people show up without checking first, knowing the meetup would happen. No single person showed up every time, because that&#8217;s insane. You would not put &#8216;Tuesday meetup&#8217; in the &#8216;this is 100% reliable&#8217; category if you wanted the &#8216;100% reliable&#8217; category to remain a thing.</p>
<p>There are tasks that, if failed, cause the entire workshop to catastrophically fail, and those cannot be solely entrusted to a 95% reliable person without a backup plan. But if your model says that <em>any failure anywhere </em>will cause <em>catastrophic overall failure </em>then your primary problem is not needing more reliable people, it is engineering a more robust plan that has fewer single points of failure.</p>
<p>If you abuse the &#8216;100% reliable&#8217; label, the label becomes meaningless.</p>
<p>Even if you use the label responsibly, when you pull out &#8216;100% reliable&#8217; from people and expect that to get you 99.9%, <em>you have to mean it. </em>The thing has to be <em>that important. </em>You don&#8217;t need to be launching a space shuttle, but you do have to face large consequences to failure. You need the kind of horribleness that requires multiple locked-in reliable <em>backup plans. </em>There is no other way to get to that level. Then you work in early warning systems, so if things are going wrong, you learn about it in time to invoke the backup plans.</p>
<p>I strongly endorse the idea of drawing an <em>explicit contrast </em>between places where people are only expected to be <em>somewhat</em> reliable, and those where people are expected to be <em>actually</em> reliable.</p>
<p>I also strongly endorse that the <em>default </em>level of reliability needs to be <em>much, much higher </em>than the standard default level of reliability, especially in The Bay. Things there are really bad.</p>
<p>When I make a plan with a friend in The Bay, I <em>never </em>assume the plan will actually happen. There is actual no one<em> </em>there I feel I can count on to be on time and not flake. I would come to visit more often if plans could actually be made. Instead, suggestions can be made, and half the time things go more or less the way you planned them. This is a terrible, very bad, no good equilibrium. Are there people I want to see badly enough to put up with a 50% reliability rate? Yes, but there are not many, and I get much less than half the utility out of those friendships than I would otherwise get.</p>
<p>When I reach what would otherwise be an agreement with someone in The Bay, I have learned that this is not an agreement, but rather a statement of momentary intent. The other person feels good about the intention of doing the thing, and if the emotions and vibe surrounding things continue to be supportive, and it is still in their interest to follow through, they might actually follow through. What they will absolutely <em>not </em>do is treat their word as their bond and follow through even if they made what turns out to be a bad deal or it seems weird or they could gain status by throwing you under the bus. People do not cooperate in this way. That is not a thing. When you notice it is not a thing, and that people will <em>actively lower your status for treating it as a thing rather than rewarding you,</em> it is <em>almost impossible </em>to keep treating this as a thing.</p>
<p>For further details on the above, and those details are important, see <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/"">Compass Rose</a>, pretty much the whole blog.</p>
<p>Duncan is trying to build a group house in The Bay that coordinates to actually do things. From where he sits, reliability has ceased to be a thing. Some amount of hyperbole and overreaction is not only reasonable and sympathetic, but even optimal. I sympathize fully with his desire to fix this problem via draconian penalties for non-cooperation.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would not need explicit penalties. There is a large cost to imposing explicit large penalties in any realm. Those penalties crowd out intrinsic motivation and justification. They create adversarial relationships and feel bad moments, and require large amounts of time upkeep. They make it likely things will fall apart if and when the penalties go away.</p>
<p>A much better system, if you can pull it off and keep it, is to have everyone understand that defection is really bad and that people are adjusting their actions and expectations on that basis, and have them make an extraordinary effort already. The penalty that the streak will be over, and the trust will be lost, should be enough. The problem is, it&#8217;s often not enough, and it is very hard to signal and pass on this system to new people.</p>
<p>Thus, draconian penalties, while a second best solution, should be considered and tried.</p>
<p>Like other penalties, we should aim to have these penalties be clear to all, be clearly painful in the short term, and clearly be something that in the long term benefits (or at least does not hurt) the group as a whole &#8211; they should be a transfer from short term you to some term someone, ideally long term everyone, in a way that all can understand. I am a big fan of exponentially escalating penalties in these situations.</p>
<p>What is missing here is a concrete example of X failure leading to Y consequence, so it&#8217;s hard to tell what level of draconian he is considering here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Problem 5: Everything else</p>
<p>There are other models and problems in the mix—for instance, I have a model surrounding buy-in and commitment that deals with an escalating cycle of asks-and-rewards, or a model of how to effectively leverage a group around you to accomplish ambitious tasks that requires you to first lay down some &#8220;topsoil&#8221; of simple/trivial/arbitrary activities that starts the growth of an ecology of affordances, or a theory that the strategy of trying things and doing things outstrips the strategy of think-until-you-identify-worthwhile-action, and that rationalists in particular are crippling themselves through decision paralysis/letting the perfect be the enemy of the good when just doing vaguely interesting projects would ultimately gain them more skill and get them further ahead, or a strong sense based off both research and personal experience that physical proximity matters, and that you can&#8217;t build the correct kind of strength and flexibility and trust into your relationships without actually spending significant amounts of time with one another in meatspace on a regular basis, regardless of whether that makes tactical sense given your object-level projects and goals.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m going to hold off on going into those in detail until people insist on hearing about them or ask questions/pose hesitations that could be answered by them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think these are good instincts, and also agree with the instinct not to say more here.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Section 2 of 3: Power dynamics</h2>
<p>All of the above was meant to point at reasons why I suspect <em>trusting individuals responding to incentives moment-by-moment</em> to be a weaker and less effective strategy than <em>building an intentional community that Actually Asks Things Of Its Members.  </em>It was also meant to justify, at least indirectly, why a strong guiding hand might be necessary given that our community&#8217;s evolved norms haven&#8217;t really produced results (in the group houses) commensurate with the promises of EA and rationality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, what matters is not the problems and solutions themselves so much as the light they shine on my aesthetics (since, in the actual house, it&#8217;s those aesthetics that will be used to resolve epistemic gridlock).  In other words, it&#8217;s not so much <em>those arguments</em> as it is <em>the fact that Duncan finds those arguments compelling.</em>  It&#8217;s worth noting that the people most closely involved with this project (i.e. my closest advisors and those most likely to actually sign on as housemates) have been encouraged to spend a significant amount of time explicitly vetting me with regards to questions like &#8220;does this guy actually think things through,&#8221; &#8220;is this guy likely to be stupid or meta-stupid,&#8221; &#8220;will this guy listen/react/update/pivot in response to evidence or consensus opposition,&#8221; and &#8220;when this guy has intuitions that he can&#8217;t explain, do they tend to be validated in the end?&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s fair to view this whole post as an attempt to prove <em>general trustworthiness </em>(in both domain expertise and overall sanity), because—well—that&#8217;s what it is.  In milieu like the military, authority figures expect (and get) obedience irrespective of whether or not they&#8217;ve earned their underlings&#8217; trust; rationalists tend to have a much higher bar before they&#8217;re willing to subordinate their decisionmaking processes, yet still that&#8217;s something this sort of model requires of its members (at least from time to time, in some domains, in a preliminary &#8220;try things with benefit of the doubt&#8221; sort of way).  I posit that Dragon Army Barracks works (where &#8220;works&#8221; means &#8220;is good and produces both individual and collective results that outstrip other group houses by at least a factor of three&#8221;) <em>if and only if</em> its members are willing to hold doubt in reserve and act with full force in spite of reservations—if they&#8217;re willing to <em>trust me more than they trust their own sense of things </em>(at least in the moment, pending later explanation and recalibration on my part or theirs or both).</p>
<p>And since that&#8217;s a) <em>the</em> central difference between DA and all the other group houses, which are collections of non-subordinate equals, and b) <em>quite</em> the ask, especially in a rationalist community, it&#8217;s entirely appropriate that it be given the greatest scrutiny.  Likely participants in the final house spent ~64 consecutive hours in my company a couple of weekends ago, specifically to play around with living under my thumb and see whether it&#8217;s actually a good place to be; they had all of the concerns one would expect and (I hope) had most of those concerns answered to their satisfaction.  The rest of you will have to make do with grilling me in the comments here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trusting individuals to respond to incentives minute to minute <em>does not, on its own, work beyond the short term. </em>Period. You need to figure out how to make agreements and commitments, to build trust and reciprocity, and work in response to long term incentives toward a greater goal. Otherwise, you fail. At best, you get hijacked by what the incentive gradient and zeitgeist want to happen, and something happens, but you have little or no control over what that something will be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite the leap from there to having a person prove general trustworthiness, and to have people trust that person more than they trust their own sense of things. Are there times and places where there have been people I trusted on that level? That is actually a good question. There are <em>contexts </em>and <em>areas </em>in which it is certainly true &#8211; my Sensei at the dojo, my teachers in a variety of subjects, Jon Finkel in a game of Magic. There are people I trust <em>in context, </em>when doing a particular thing. But is there anyone I would trust <em>in general, </em>if they told me to do something?</p>
<p>If they told me to do the thing <em>without taking into consideration what I think, </em>then my brain is telling me the answer is no. There are zero such people, who can tell me <em>in general </em>what to do, and I&#8217;d do it even if I thought they were wrong. That, however, is playing on super duper hard mode. A better question is, is there someone who, if they told you <em>I know that you disagree with me, but despite that trust me you should do this anyway, </em>even if I didn&#8217;t have a good reason to do the thing other than that they said so, I would do the thing, pretty much no matter what it is?</p>
<p>The answer is still no, in the sense that if they spoke to me like God spoke to Abraham, and told me to sacrifice my son, I would tell each and every person on Earth to go to hell. The bar doesn&#8217;t have to be anything like that high, either &#8211; there might be people who could talk me into a major crime, but if so they&#8217;d have to actually talk me into it. No running off on Project Mayhem.</p>
<p>Wait. I am not sure that is actually true. If one of a very few select people actually did tell me to  do something that seemed crazy, I might just trust it, because the bar for them to actually do that would be so high. Or I might not. You never know until the moment arrives.</p>
<p>Duncan, I hope, is asking for something much weaker than that. He is asking for <em>small scale trust. </em>He is asking that <em>in the moment, with no &#8216;real&#8217; stakes, </em>members of the house trust him absolutely. This is more like being in a dojo and having a sensei. In the moment, you do <em>not </em>question the sensei within the sacred space. That does not even require you to actually trust them more than you trust yourself. It simply means that you need to trust <em>that things will go better if you do what they say without questioning it </em>and then you follow through on that deal. In limited contexts, this is not weird or scary. If the sensei did something outside their purview, the deal would be off, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>I even have some experience with hypnosis, which is a lot scarier than this in terms of how much trust is required and what can be done if the person in charge goes too far, and there are people I trust to do that, knowing that if they try to take things too far, I&#8217;ll (probably, hopefully) snap out of it.</p>
<p>In short, this sounds a lot scarier than it is. Probably. The boundaries of what can be asked for are important, but the type of person reading this likely needs to learn more how to trust others and see where things go, rather than doing that less often or being worried about someone abusing that power. If anything, we are <em>the most prepared </em>to handle that kind of overreach, because we are so (rationally irrationally? the other way around?) scared of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Power and authority are <em>generally</em> anti-epistemic—for every instance of those-in-power defending themselves against the barbarians at the gates or anti-vaxxers or the rise of Donald Trump, there are a <em>dozen</em> instances of them squashing truth, undermining progress that would make them irrelevant, and aggressively promoting the status quo.</p>
<p>Thus, every attempt by an individual to gather power about themselves is at least <em>suspect,</em> given regular ol&#8217; incentive structures and regular ol&#8217; fallible humans.  I can (and do) claim to be after a saved world and a bunch of people becoming more the-best-versions-of-themselves-according-to-themselves, but I acknowledge that&#8217;s exactly the same claim an egomaniac would make, and I acknowledge that the link between &#8220;Duncan makes all his housemates wake up together and do pushups&#8221; and &#8220;the world is incrementally less likely to end in gray goo and agony&#8221; is <em>not</em> <em>obvious.</em></p>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> solve things to say, &#8220;well, this is an optional, consent-based process, and if you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t join,&#8221; because good and moral people have to stop and wonder whether their friends and colleagues with <em>slightly weaker epistemics</em> and <em>slightly less-honed allergies to evil</em> are getting hoodwinked.  In short, if someone&#8217;s building a coercive trap, it&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Power corrupts. We all know this. Despite that, and despite my being an actual <em>Discordian </em>who thinks the most important power-related skill is how to avoid power, and who thinks that in an important sense communication is only possible between equals, and whose leadership model if I was founding a house would be <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Illuminatus-Trilogy-Pyramid-Golden-Leviathan/dp/0440539811/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498080766&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=illuminatus+trilogy"">Hagbard Celine</a>, and I <em>still</em> think this is unfair to power. It is especially unfair to voluntary power.</p>
<p>Not only are there not twelve anti-vaxxers using power for every pro-vaxxer, there are more than twelve pro-vaxxers trying to get parents to vaccinate (mostly successfully) for every one that tries to stop them (mostly unsuccessfully). For every traitorous soldier trying to let the barbarians into the gate, there are more than twelve doing their duty to keep the barbarians out (and violations of this correlate quite well to where barbarians get through the gate, which most days and years does not happen). Think about the &#8216;facts&#8217; the government tries to promote. Are they boring? Usually. A waste of your taxpayer dollar? Often I&#8217;d agree. The emotions they try to evoke are often bad. But <em>most of the time</em>, aside from exceptions like the campaign trail, cops investigating a crime (who are explicitly allowed and encouraged to lie) and anything promoting the lottery, their facts are true.</p>
<p>Yes, power encourages people to hold back information and lie to each other. Yes, power is often abused, but the most important way to maintain and gain power is to exercise that power wisely and for the benefit of the group. This goes double when that power exchange is voluntary and those who have given up power have the ability and the right to walk away at any time.</p>
<p>A certain amount of &#8216;abuse&#8217; of power is expected, and even appropriate, because power is hard work and a burden, so it needs to have its rewards. Some CEOs are overpaid, no doubt, but in general I believe that leaders and decision makers are undercompensated and underappreciated, rather than the other way around. Most people loathe being in charge even of themselves. Leaders have to look out for everyone else, and when they decide it&#8217;s time to look out for themselves instead, we need to make sure they don&#8217;t go too far at the expense of others, but if you automatically call that abuse, what you are left with are only burned out leaders. That seems to be happening a lot.</p>
<p>That does still leave us with the problem that power is usually anti-epistemic, due to the SNAFU principle: (Fully open and honest) communication is only possible between equals. The good news is that this is an observation about the world rather than a law of nature, so the better frame is to ask <em>why </em>and <em>how </em>power is anti-epistemic. Social life is <em>also </em>anti-epistemic in many similar ways, largely because any group of people will involve some amount of power and desire to shape the actions, beliefs and opinions of others.</p>
<p>SNAFU&#8217;s main mechanism is that the subordinate is under the superior&#8217;s power, which results in the superior giving out rewards and punishments (and/or decisions that are functionally rewards and punishments). This leads the subordinate to not be able to communicate to the superior, which in turn makes the superior in turn engage in deception in order to find out as much of the truth as possible. This gets a lot more complicated (for more detail, and in general, I recommend reading Robert Anton Wilson&#8217;s <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Prometheus-Rising-Robert-Anton-Wilson/dp/0692710604/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498080669&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=prometheus+rising"">Prometheus Rising</a> and many of his other works) but the core problem is that <em>the subordinate wants to be rewarded and to avoid punishment, as intrinsic goods.</em> The flip side of that is if <em>the superior wants to give out punishments and avoid rewards. </em><em> </em></p>
<p>Wanting to get rewards and avoid punishments <em>when you don&#8217;t deserve it,</em> or to give out punishments and avoid rewards <em>to those who don&#8217;t deserve it,</em><em> </em>is the problem. If the student wants to avoid push-ups, the student will deceive the master. If the student wants to <em>be worthy </em>and therefore avoid push-ups, treating the push-ups as useful incentive and training and signal, then the student will remain honest. In an important sense, the master has even successfully avoided power here once they set the rules, because the student&#8217;s worthiness determines what happens even if the master technically gives out the verdict. The master simply tries to help make the student worthy.</p>
<p>Power is dangerous, but most useful things are. It&#8217;s a poor atom blaster that can&#8217;t point both ways.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my justification, let&#8217;s see what his is.</p>
<blockquote><p>But on the flip side, we don&#8217;t have time to waste.  There&#8217;s existential risk, for one, and even if you don&#8217;t buy ex-risk à la AI or bioterrorism or global warming, people&#8217;s available hours are trickling away at the alarming rate of one hour per hour, and <em>none</em> of us are moving fast enough to get All The Things done before we die.  I personally feel that I am operating <em>far</em> below my healthy sustainable maximum capacity, and I&#8217;m not alone in that, and something like Dragon Army could help.</p>
<p>So.  Claims, as clearly as I can state them, in answer to the question &#8220;why should a bunch of people sacrifice non-trivial amounts of their autonomy to Duncan?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>1. Somebody ought to run this, and no one else will.</strong>  On the meta level, this experiment <em>needs</em> to be run—we have like twenty or thirty instances of the laissez-faire model, and <em>none</em> of the high-standards/hardcore one, and also not very many impressive results coming out of our houses.  Due diligence demands investigation of the opposite hypothesis.  On the object level, it seems uncontroversial to me that there are goods waiting on the other side of the unpleasant valley—goods that a team of leveled-up, coordinated individuals with bonds of mutual trust can seize that the rest of us can&#8217;t even <em>conceive</em> of, at this point, because we don&#8217;t have a deep grasp of what new affordances appear once you get there.</p>
<p><strong>2. I&#8217;m the least unqualified person around.</strong>  Those words are chosen deliberately, for this post on &#8220;less wrong.&#8221;  I have a unique combination of expertise that includes being a <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/"">rationalist</a>, <a href=""http://thirdfoundation.github.io/#/about/pedagogy"">sixth grade teacher</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muj9JN2CckQ"">coach</a>, RA/head of a dormitory, ringleader of a pack of hooligans, member of two honor code committees, <a href=""http://thirdfoundation.github.io/#/writing/camp"">curriculum director</a>, <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046"">obsessive sci-fi/fantasy nerd</a>, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ph-AvnR6Do5Ps-Rxd-Jro-X7OBJC4f4HQaIC5tL45DA/edit?usp=sharing"">writer</a>, <a href=""http://thirdfoundation.github.io/#/design/gym"">builder</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK9OxLm3BBg"">martial artist</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMQ8xr3RTNU"">parkour guru</a>, <a href=""http://thirdfoundation.github.io/#/main"">maker</a>, and <a href=""http://thirdfoundation.github.io/#/design/locked"">generalist</a>.  If anybody&#8217;s intuitions and S1 models are likely to be capable of distinguishing the uncanny valley from the real deal, I posit mine are.</p>
<p><strong>3. There&#8217;s never been a safer context for this sort of experiment.</strong>  It&#8217;s 2017, we live in the United States, and all of the people involved are rationalists.  We all know about NVC and double crux, we&#8217;re all going to do Circling, we all know about Gendlin&#8217;s Focusing, and we&#8217;ve all read the Sequences (or will soon).  If ever there was a time to say &#8220;let&#8217;s all step out onto the slippery slope, I think we can keep our balance,&#8221; it&#8217;s now—there&#8217;s no group of people <em>better</em> equipped to stop this from going sideways.</p>
<p><strong>4. It does <em>actually</em> require a tyrant.</strong> As a part of a debrief during the weekend experiment/dry run, we went around the circle and people talked about concerns/dealbreakers/things they don&#8217;t want to give up.  One interesting thing that popped up is that, according to consensus, it&#8217;s <em>literally impossible</em> to find a time of day when the whole group could get together to exercise.  This happened even with each individual being willing to make personal sacrifices and doing things that are somewhat costly.</p>
<p>If, of course, the expectation is that everybody shows up on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, and the cost of not doing so is not being present in the house, suddenly the situation becomes simple and workable.  And yes, this means <a href=""https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/educ-101-axioms-f1cba0c85794"">some kids left behind (ctrl+f)</a>, but the whole <em>point</em> of this is to be instrumentally exclusive and consensually high-commitment.  You just need someone to make the actual final call—there are too many threads for the coordination problem of a house of this kind to be solved by committee, and too many circumstances in which it&#8217;s impossible to make a principled, justifiable decision between 492 almost-indistinguishably-good options.  On top of that, there&#8217;s a need for there to be some kind of consistent, neutral force that sets course, imposes consistency, resolves disputes/breaks deadlock, and <strong>absorbs all of the blame</strong> for the fact that it&#8217;s unpleasant to be forced to do things you know you ought to but don&#8217;t want to do.</p>
<p>And lastly, we (by which I indicate the people most likely to end up participating) want the house to <em>do</em> stuff—to actually take on projects of ambitious scope, things that require ten or more talented people reliably coordinating for months at a time.  That sort of coordination requires a quarterback on the field, even if the strategizing in the locker room is egalitarian.</p>
<p><strong>5. There isn&#8217;t really a status quo for power to abusively maintain.  </strong>Dragon Army Barracks is not an object-level experiment in making the best house; it&#8217;s a <em>meta</em>-level experiment attempting (through iteration rather than armchair theorizing) to answer the question &#8220;how best does one structure a house environment for growth, self-actualization, productivity, and social synergy?&#8221;  It&#8217;s <em>taken as a given</em> that we&#8217;ll get things wrong on the first and second and third try; the whole <em>point</em> is to shift from one experiment to the next, gradually accumulating proven-useful norms via consensus mechanisms, and the centralized power is mostly there just to keep the transitions smooth and seamless.  More importantly, the fundamental conceit of the model is &#8220;Duncan sees a better way, which might take some time to settle into,&#8221; but after e.g. six months, if the thing is not <em>clearly</em> positive and at least well on its way to being self-sustaining, everyone ought to abandon it anyway.  In short, <strong>my tyranny, if net bad, has a natural time limit</strong>, because people aren&#8217;t going to wait around forever for their results.</p>
<p><strong>6. The experiment has protections built in.</strong>  Transparency, operationalization, and informed consent are the name of the game; communication and flexibility are how the machine is maintained.  Like the Constitution, Dragon Army&#8217;s charter and organization are meant to be &#8220;living documents&#8221; that constrain change only insofar as they impose reasonable limitations on how wantonly change can be enacted.</p></blockquote>
<p>I strongly agree with point one, and think this line should be considered almost a knock-down argument in a lot of contexts. <em>Someone has to and no one else will. </em>Unless you are claiming no one has to, or there is someone else who will, that&#8217;s all that need be said. There is a wise saying that &#8216;those who say it can&#8217;t be done should never interrupt the person doing it.&#8217; Similarly, I think, once someone has <a href=""http://unsongbook.com/"">invoked the Comet King</a>, we should follow the rule that &#8216;those who agree it must be done need to either do it or let someone else do it.&#8217; As far as I can tell, both statements are true. Someone has to. No one else will.</p>
<p>I do not think Duncan is the least unqualified person around if we had our pick of all people, but we don&#8217;t. We only have <em>one </em>person willing to do this, as far as I know. That means the question is, is he qualified enough to give it a go? On that level, I think these qualifications are good enough. I do wish he hadn&#8217;t tried to oversell them quite this much.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t think this is the <em>most safe situation of all time </em>to try an exchange of power in the name of group and self improvement, and I worry that Duncan thinks things like double crux and circling are far more important and powerful than they are. Letting things &#8216;get to his head&#8217; is one thing Duncan should be quite concerned about in such a project. We are special, but we are not as special as this implies. What I do think is that this is an <em>unusually safe </em>place and time to try this experiment, but I also don&#8217;t think the experiment is all that dangerous even before all the protections in point six and that Duncan explains elsewhere (including the comments) and that were added later or will be added in the future. Safety first is a thing but our society is often <em>totally obsessed </em>with safety and we need to seriously chill out.</p>
<p>I also think point five is important. The natural time limit is a strong check (one of many) on what dangers do exist. However, there seems to be some danger later on of slippage on this if you read the charter, so it needs to be very clear what the final endpoint is and not allow wiggle room later &#8211; you can have natural end points in between, but things need to be fully over at a fixed future point, for any given resident, with no (anti?) escape clause.</p>

<h2>Section 3 of 3: Dragon Army Charter (DRAFT)</h2>
<p><strong>Statement of purpose:</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Army Barracks is a group housing and intentional community project which exists to support its members socially, emotionally, intellectually, and materially as they endeavor to <strong>improve themselves</strong>, <strong>complete worthwhile projects</strong>, and <strong>develop new and useful culture</strong>, in that order.  In addition to the usual housing commitments (i.e. rent, utilities, shared expenses), its members will make limited and specific commitments of time, attention, and effort averaging roughly 90 hours a month (~1.5hr/day plus occasional weekend activities).</p>
<p>Dragon Army Barracks will have an egalitarian, flat power structure, with the exception of a commander (Duncan Sabien) and a first officer (Eli Tyre).  The commander&#8217;s role is to create structure by which the agreed-upon norms and standards of the group shall be discussed, decided, and enforced, to manage entry to and exit from the group, and to break epistemic gridlock/make decisions when speed or simplification is required.  The first officer&#8217;s role is to manage and moderate the process of building consensus around the <em>standards</em> of the Army—what they are, and in what priority they should be met, and with what consequences for failure.  Other &#8220;management&#8221; positions may come into existence in limited domains (e.g. if a project arises, it may have a leader, and that leader will often not be Duncan or Eli), and will have their scope and powers defined at the point of creation/ratification.</p>
<p><strong>Initial areas of exploration:</strong></p>
<p>The particular object level foci of Dragon Army Barracks will change over time as its members experiment and iterate, but at first it will prioritize the following:</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Physical proximity (exercising together, preparing and eating meals together, sharing a house and common space)</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Regular activities for bonding and emotional support (Circling, pair debugging, weekly retrospective, tutoring/study hall)</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Regular activities for growth and development (talk night, tutoring/study hall, bringing in experts, cross-pollination)</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Intentional culture (experiments around lexicon, communication, conflict resolution, bets &amp; calibration, personal motivation, distribution of resources &amp; responsibilities, food acquisition &amp; preparation, etc.)</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Projects with &#8220;shippable&#8221; products (e.g. talks, blog posts, apps, events; some solo, some partner, some small group, some whole group; ranging from short-term to year-long)</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Regular (every 6-10 weeks) retreats to learn a skill, partake in an adventure or challenge, or simply change perspective</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this, I think, is good. My worry is in the setting of priorities and allocation of time. We have six bullet points here, and only the fifth bullet point, which is part of the third priority out of three, involves doing something that will have a trial by fire in the real world (and even then, we are potentially talking about a talk or blog post, which can be dangerously not-fire-trial-like). The central goal will be self-improvement.</p>
<p>The problem is that in my experience, your <em>real </em>terminal goal can be self-improvement all you like, but unless you choose a different primary goal and work towards <em>that, </em>you won&#8217;t self-improve all that much. The way you get better is because you need to get better to <em>do a thing. </em>Otherwise it&#8217;s all, well, let&#8217;s let Duncan&#8217;s hero Tyler Durden explain:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikY0fs94U-M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>This is importantly true (although in a literal sense it is obviously false), and seems like the most obvious point of failure. Another is choosing Tyler&#8217;s solution to this problem. Don&#8217;t do that either.</p>
<p>So yes, do all six of these things and have all three of these goals, but don&#8217;t think that down near the bottom of your list is doing a few concrete things every now and then. Everyone needs to have the thing, and have the thing be central and important to them, whatever the thing may be, and that person should then judge their success or failure on that basis, and the group also needs a big thing. Yes, we will also evaluate whether we hit the self-improvement marks, but on their own they simply do not cut it.</p>
<p>Credit to my wife Laura Baur for making this point very clear and explicit to me, so that I realized its importance. Which is very high.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dragon Army Barracks will begin with a move-in weekend that will include ~10 hours of group bonding, discussion, and norm-setting.  After that, it will enter an eight-week <em>bootcamp phase</em>, in which each member will participate in at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whole group exercise (90min, 3x/wk, e.g. Tue/Fri/Sun)</li>
<li>Whole group dinner and retrospective (120min, 1x/wk, e.g. Tue evening)</li>
<li>Small group baseline skill acquisition/study hall/cross-pollination (90min, 1x/wk)</li>
<li>Small group circle-shaped discussion (120min, 1x/wk)</li>
<li>Pair debugging or rapport building (45min, 2x/wk)</li>
<li>One-on-one check-in with commander (20min, 2x/wk)</li>
<li>Chore/house responsibilities (90min distributed)</li>
<li>Publishable/shippable solo small-scale project work with weekly public update (100min distributed)</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230; for a total time commitment of 16h/week or 128 hours total, followed by a whole group retreat and reorientation.  The house will then enter an eight-week <em>trial phase,</em> in which each member will participate in at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whole group exercise (90min, 3x/wk)</li>
<li>Whole group dinner, retrospective, and plotting (150min, 1x/wk)</li>
<li>Small group circling and/or pair debugging (120min distributed)</li>
<li>Publishable/shippable small group medium-scale project work with weekly public update (180min distributed)</li>
<li>One-on-one check-in with commander (20min, 1x/wk)</li>
<li>Chore/house responsibilities (60min distributed)</li>
</ul>
<div>&#8230; for a total time commitment of 13h/week or 104 hours total, again followed by a whole group retreat and reorientation.  The house will then enter a third phase where commitments will likely change, but will include at a minimum whole group exercise, whole group dinner, and some specific small-group responsibilities, either social/emotional or project/productive (once again ending with a whole group retreat).  At some point between the second and third phase, the house will also ramp up for its <strong>first large-scale project</strong>, which is yet to be determined but will be roughly on the scale of putting on a CFAR workshop in terms of time and complexity.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of time, but manageable. I would shift more of it into the project work, and worry less about devoting quite so much time to the other stuff. Having less than a quarter of the time being spent towards an outside goal is not good. I can accept a few weeks of phase-in since moving in and getting to know each other is important, but ten weeks in only three hours a week of &#8216;real work&#8217; is being done.</p>
<p>Even more important, as stated above, I would know everyone&#8217;s individual small and medium scale projects, and the first group project, before anyone moves in, at a bare minimum. That does not mean they can&#8217;t be changed later, but an answer that is exciting needs to be in place at the start.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Or longer, as noted above, is scary, so this should make it clear what the maximum time length is, which should be not more than two years.</p>
<p>The use of &#8216;above-average&#8217; here is good in a first draft, but not good in the final product. This needs to be much more explicit. What is above average physical capacity? Put numbers on that. What is above average public speaking? That should mean doing some public speaking successfully. Calibration tests are a thing, and so forth. Not all the tests will be perfect, but none of them seem impractical given the time commitments everyone is making. The test is important. <em>You need to take the test. Even if you know you will pass it. No cheating. </em>A lot of these are easy to design a test for &#8211; you ask the person to use the skill to do something in the world, and succeed. No bullshit.</p>
<p>The test is necessary to actually get the results, but it&#8217;s also important to prove them. If you declare before you begin <em>what the test will be, </em>then you have <em>preregistered the experiment. </em>Your results then mean a lot more. Ideally the projects will even be picked at the start, or at least some of them, and <em>definitely </em>the big project. This is all <em>for science! </em>Isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also suspicious if you have a skill and can&#8217;t test it. Is the skill real? Is it useful?</p>
<p>Yes, this might mean you need to do some otherwise not so efficient things. That&#8217;s how these things go. It&#8217;s worth it, and it brings restrictions that breed creativity, and commitments that lead to action.</p>

<blockquote><p>Because of both a) the expected value of social exploration and b) the cumulative positive effects of <em>being in a group that&#8217;s trying things regularly and taking experiments seriously,</em> Dragon Army will endeavor to adopt <strong>no fewer than one new experimental norm per week.</strong>  Each new experimental norm should have an intended goal or result, an informal theoretical backing, and a set re-evaluation time (default three weeks).  There are two routes by which a new experimental norm is put into place:</p>
<ul>
<li>The experiment is proposed by a member, discussed in a whole group setting, and meets the minimum bar for adoption (&gt;60% of the Army supports, with &lt;20% opposed and no hard vetos)</li>
<li>The Army has proposed no new experiments in the previous week, and the Commander proposes three options.  The group may then choose one by vote/consensus, or generate three <em>new</em> options, from which the Commander may choose.</li>
</ul>
<div>Examples of some of the early norms which the house is likely to try out from day one (hit the ground running):</div>

<li>The use of a specific gesture to greet fellow Dragons (house salute)</li>

<li>Practice using hook, line, and sinker in social situations (three items <em>other</em> than your name for introductions)</li>
<li>The anti-Singer rule for open calls-for-help (if Dragon A says &#8220;hey, can anyone help me with X?&#8221; the responsibility falls on the physically closest housemate to either help or say &#8220;Not me/can&#8217;t do it!&#8221; at which point the buck passes to the next physically closest person)</li>
<li>An &#8220;interrupt&#8221; call that any Dragon may use to pause an ongoing interaction for fifteen seconds</li>
<li>A &#8220;culture of abundance&#8221; in which food and leftovers within the house are default available to all, with exceptions deliberately kept as rare as possible</li>
<li>A &#8220;graffiti board&#8221; upon which the Army keeps a running informal record of its mood and thoughts</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly approve of this concept, and ideally the experimenter already has a notebook with tons of ideas in it. I have a feeling that he does, or would have one quickly if he bought and carried around the notebook. This is also where the outside community can help, offering more suggestions.</p>
<p>It would be a good norm for people to need to try new norms and systems every so often. Every week is a bit much for regular life, but once a month seems quite reasonable.</p>
<p>In terms of the individual suggestions:</p>
<p>I am in favor of the house salute, the interrupt and the graffiti board. Of those three, the interrupt seems most likely to turn out to have problems, but it&#8217;s definitely worth trying and seems quite good if it works.</p>
<p>Hook, line and sinker seems more like a tool or skill to practice, but seems like a good idea for those having trouble with good introductions.</p>
<p>Call and response is a thing that naturally evolves in any group culture that is having any fun at all, and leads to more fun (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6LD6ITN2dk"">here is a prime example and important safety tip</a>), so I encouraging more and more formal use of it seems good at first glance. The worry is that if too formal and used too much, this could become anti-epistemic, so I&#8217;d keep an eye on that and re-calibrate as needed.</p>
<p>The anti-Singer rule (ASR) is interesting. I think as written it is too broad, but that a less broad version would likely be good.</p>
<p>There are four core problems I see.</p>
<p>The first problem is that this destroys information when the suitability of each person to do the task is unknown. The first person in line has to give a Yes/No to help before the second person in line reveals how available they are to help, and so on. Let&#8217;s say that Alice asks for help, Bob is closest, then Carol, then David and then Eve. Bob does not know if Carol, David or Eve would be happy (or able) to help right now &#8211; maybe Bob isn&#8217;t so good at this task, or maybe it&#8217;s not the best time. Without ASR, Bob could wait for that information &#8211; if there was a long enough pause, or David and Eve said no, Bob could step up to the plate. The flip side is also the case, where once Bob, Carol and David say no, Eve can end up helping even when she&#8217;s clearly not the right choice. Think of this as a no-going-back search algorithm, which has a reasonably high rate of failure.</p>
<p>The second and related problem is that Bob has to either explicitly say no to Alice, which costs social points, so he may end up doing the thing even when he knows this is not an efficient allocation. Even if David is happy to help where Bob is not, Bob still had to say no, and you&#8217;d prefer to have avoided that.</p>
<p>The third problem is that this interrupts flow. If Alice requests help, Bob has to explicitly respond with a yes or no. Most people and all programmers know how disruptive this can be, and in this house, and I worry no one can &#8216;check out&#8217; or &#8216;focus in&#8217; fully while this rule is in place. It could also just be seen as costly in terms of the amount of noise it generates. This seems especially annoying if, for example, David is the one closest to the door, and Alice asks someone to let Eli in, and now multiple people have to either explicitly refuse the task or do it even though doing it does not make sense.</p>
<p>The fourth problem is that this implicitly rewards and punishes physical location, and could potentially lead to people avoiding physical proximity or the center of the house. This seems bad.</p>
<p>This means that for classes of help that involve large commitments of time, and/or large variance in people&#8217;s suitability for the task, especially variance that is invisible to other people, that this norm seems like it will be destructive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the request is something that anyone can do (something like &#8220;give me a hand with this&#8221; or &#8220;answer the phone&#8221;) especially one that benefits from physical proximity, so the default of &#8216;nearest person helps&#8217; makes sense, this system seems excellent if combined with some common sense. One obvious extension is that if someone else thinks that they should do the task, they should speak up and do it (or even just start doing it), even if the person requesting didn&#8217;t know who to ask. As with many similar things, having semi-formal norms can be quite useful if they are used the right amount, but if abused they get disruptive &#8211; the informal systems they are replacing are often quite efficient and being too explicit lets systems be gamed.</p>
<p>The culture of abundance is the norm that seems at risk of actively backfiring. The comments pointed this out multiple times. The three obvious failure modes are tragedy of the commons (you don&#8217;t buy milk because everyone else will drink it) and inefficient allocation (you buy milk because you will soon bake a cake, and by the time you go to bake it, the milk is gone), and inability to plan (you buy milk, but you can never count on having any for your breakfast unless you massively oversupply, and you might also not have any cereal).</p>
<p>The result is likely either more and more exceptions, less and less available food, or some combination of the two, potentially leading to much higher total food expenses and more trips to supermarkets and restaurants. The closer the house is to the supermarket, the better, even more so than usual.</p>
<p>Of course, if everyone uses common sense, everyone gets to know their housemates preferences, and the food budget is managed reasonably such that buying food doesn&#8217;t mean subsidizing everyone else, this can still mostly work out, and certainly some amount of this is good especially with staple supplies that if managed properly should not come close to running out. However, this is not a norm that is self-sustaining on its own &#8211; it requires careful management along multiple fronts if it is to work.</p>

<li>A Dragon will <em>protect itself,</em> i.e. will not submit to pressure causing it to do things that are dangerous or unhealthy, nor wait around passively when in need of help or support (note that this may cause a Dragon to leave the experiment!).</li>
<li>A Dragon will <em>take responsibility</em> for its actions, emotional responses, and the consequences thereof, e.g. if late will not blame bad luck/circumstance, if angry or triggered will not blame the other party.</li>
<li>A Dragon will <em>assume good faith</em> in all interactions with other Dragons and with house norms and activities, i.e. will not engage in strawmanning or the horns effect.</li>
<li>A Dragon will be <em>candid and proactive</em>, e.g. will give other Dragons a chance to hear about and interact with negative models once they notice them forming, or will not sit on an emotional or interpersonal problem until it festers into something worse.</li>
<li>A Dragon will be <em>fully present and supportive</em> when interacting with other Dragons in formal/official contexts, i.e. will not engage in silent defection, undermining, halfheartedness, aloofness, subtle sabotage, or other actions which follow the letter of the law while violating the spirit.  Another way to state this is that a Dragon will <em>practice compartmentalization—</em>will be able to simultaneously hold &#8220;I&#8217;m deeply skeptical about this&#8221; alongside &#8220;but I&#8217;m <em>actually</em> giving it an honest try,&#8221; and postpone critique/complaint/suggestion until predetermined checkpoints.  Yet another way to state this is that a Dragon will <em>take experiments seriously,</em> including epistemic humility and actually seeing things through to their ends rather than fiddling midway.</li>
<li>A Dragon will <em>take the outside view seriously,</em><em>maintain epistemic humility, </em>and <em>make subject-object shifts</em>, i.e. will act as a behaviorist and agree to judge and be judged on the basis of actions and revealed preferences rather than intentions, hypotheses, and assumptions (this one&#8217;s similar to #2 and hard to put into words, but for example, a Dragon who has been having trouble getting to sleep but <em>has never informed the other Dragons that their actions are keeping them awake</em> will agree that their anger and frustration, while valid internally, may not fairly be vented on those other Dragons, who were never given a chance to correct their behavior).  Another way to state this is that a Dragon will embrace the maxim &#8220;don&#8217;t believe everything that you think.&#8221;</li>
<li>A Dragon will <em>strive for excellence</em> in all things, modified only by a) prioritization and b) doing what is necessary to protect itself/maximize total growth and output on long time scales.</li>
<li>A Dragon will not <em>defect on other Dragons.</em></li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>There will be various operationalizations of the above commitments into specific norms (e.g. a Dragon will read all messages and emails within 24 hours, and if a full response is not possible within that window, will send a short response indicating when the longer response may be expected) that will occur once the specific members of the Army have been selected and have individually signed on.  Disputes over violations of the code of conduct, or confusions about its operationalization, will first be addressed one-on-one or in informal small group, and will then move to general discussion, and then to the first officer, and then to the commander.</p>
<p>Note that all of the above is <em>deliberately </em>kept somewhat flexible/vague/open-ended/unsettled, because we are trying not to fall prey to <strong>GOODHART&#8217;S DEMON</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Bonus points for the explicit invocation of Goodhart&#8217;s Demon.</div>
<div></div>
<div>That feeling where things start to creep you out and feel scary, the walls are metaphorically closing in and something seems deeply <em>wrong</em>? Yeah. I didn&#8217;t get it earlier (except somewhat when Duncan mentioned he was looking admirably at the Paper Street Soap Company, but that was more of a what are you thinking moment). I got that here.</div>
<div>So something is <em>wrong. </em>Or at least, something feels wrong, in a deep way. What is it?</div>
<div></div>
<div>First, I observe that it isn&#8217;t related at all to #1, #3, #4 or #7. Those seem clearly safe. So that leaves four suspects. On another pass, it&#8217;s also not #8, nor is it directly #6, or directly #5. On their own, all of those would seem fine, but once the feeling that something is <em>wrong </em>and potentially <em>out to get you </em>sets in, things that would otherwise be fine stop seeing fine. This is related to the good faith thing &#8211; my brain no longer is in good-faith-assuming mode. I&#8217;m pretty sure #2 is the problem. So let&#8217;s focus in there.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The problem is clearly in the rule that <em>a Dragon will take responsibility for their emotional responses, and not blame the other person. </em>That is what is setting off alarm bells.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Why? Because that rule, in other forms, has a history. The other form, which this implies, is:</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Thou shalt have the &#8220;correct&#8221; emotional reaction, the one I want you to have, and you are blameworthy if you do not. </em></div>
<div></div>
<div><a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/03/30/avoiding-emotional-dominance-spirals/"">Here is some of that history</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Then some of the other rules reinforce that feeling of <em>&#8216;and LIKE IT&#8217; </em>that makes me need to think about needing to control the fist of death. With time to reflect, I realize that this is a lot like reading the right to privacy into the constitution, in that it isn&#8217;t technically there but does get implied if you want the thing to actually function as intended.</div>
<div></div>
<div>These things are tough. I fully endorse <em>taking full responsibility for the results </em>as a principle, from all parties involved, such that the amount of responsibility is often hundreds of percents, but one must note the danger.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Once that is identified and understood, I see that I mostly like this list a lot.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Random Logistics</strong></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>The initial filter for attendance will include a one-on-one interview with the commander (Duncan), who will be looking for a) credible intention to put forth effort toward the goal of having a positive impact on the world, b) likeliness of a strong fit with the structure of the house and the other participants, and c) reliability à la financial stability and ability to commit fully to long-term endeavors.  Final decisions will be made by the commander and may be informally questioned/appealed but not overruled by another power.</li>
<li>Once a final list of participants is created, all participants will sign a &#8220;free state&#8221; contract of the form &#8220;I agree to move into a house within five miles of downtown Berkeley (for length of time X with financial obligation Y) sometime in the window of July 1st through September 30th, conditional on at least seven other people signing this same agreement.&#8221;  At that point, the search for a suitable house will begin, possibly with delegation to participants.</li>
<li>Rents in that area tend to run ~$1100 per room, on average, plus utilities, plus a 10% contribution to the general house fund.  Thus, someone hoping for a single should, in the 85th percentile worst case, be prepared to make a ~$1400/month commitment.  Similarly, someone hoping for a double should be prepared for ~$700/month, and someone hoping for a triple should be prepared for ~$500/month, and someone hoping for a quad should be prepared for ~$350/month.</li>
<li>The initial phase of the experiment is a six month commitment, but leases are generally one year.  Any Dragon who leaves <em>during</em> the experiment is responsible for continuing to pay their share of the lease/utilities/house fund, unless and until they have found a replacement person the house considers acceptable, or have found <strong>three</strong> potential viable replacement candidates and had each one rejected.  After six months, should the experiment dissolve, the house will revert to being simply a house, and people will bear the normal responsibility of &#8220;keep paying until you&#8217;ve found your replacement.&#8221;  (This will likely be easiest to enforce by simply having as many names as possible on the actual lease.)</li>
<li>Of the ~90hr/month, it is assumed that ~30 are whole-group, ~30 are small group or pair work, and ~30 are independent or voluntarily-paired work.  Furthermore, it is assumed that the commander maintains sole authority over ~15 of those hours (i.e. can <em>require</em> that they be spent in a specific way consistent with the aesthetic above, even in the face of skepticism or opposition).</li>
<li>We will have an internal economy whereby people can trade effort for money and money for time and so on and so forth, because heck yeah.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>I&#8217;ll leave the local logistics mostly to the locals, but will note that five miles is a long distance to go in an arbitrary direction &#8211; if I was considering this, I&#8217;d want to know a lot more about the exact locations that would be considered.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The one here that needs discussion is #6. You would think I would strongly endorse this, and <em>you would be wrong. </em>I think that an internal economy based on money is a <em>bad </em>idea, especially considering Duncan explicitly says in the comments that it would apply to push-ups. This completely misunderstands the point of push-ups, and (I think) the type of culture necessary to get a group to bond and become allies. The rich one can&#8217;t be allowed to buy off their chores and definitely not their punishments. The activities involved have a bunch of goals: Self-improvement and learning good habits, team bonding and building and coordination, and so forth. They are not simply division of labor. People buying gifts for the group builds the group, it is not simply dividing costs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The whole point of creating a new culture of this type is, in a sense, to create new sacred things. Those things need to remain sacred, and everyone needs to be focused <em>away </em>from money. Thus, an internal economy that has too wide a scope is actively destructive (and distracting) to the project. I would recommend against it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I feel <em>so weird </em>telling someone else to <em>not create a market. </em>It&#8217;s really strange, man.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Predictions</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now that we&#8217;ve reached the end (there are many comments, but one must draw the line somewhere), what do I think will actually happen, if the experiment is done? I think it&#8217;s likely that Duncan will get to do his experiment, at least for the initial period. I&#8217;d divide the results into four rough scenarios.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I think that the chances of success <em>as defined by Duncan&#8217;s goals above </em>are not that high, but substantial. Even though none of the goals are fantastical, there are a lot of ways for him to fall short. Doubtless at least one person will fail at least one of the goals, but what&#8217;s the chance that <em>most </em>of the people will stay, and <em>most </em>who stay will hit <em>most </em>of the goals and the group, such that victory can be declared? I&#8217;d say maybe 20%.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The most likely scenario, I think, is a <em>successful failure. </em>The house does not get what it came for, but we get a lot of data on what did and did not work, at least some people feel they got a lot out of it personally, and we can if we want to run another experiment later, or we learned why we should never do this again without any serious damage being done. I&#8217;d give things in this range maybe 30%.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The less bad failure mode, in my mind, is <em>petering out. </em>This is where the house more or less looks like a normal house by the end, except with the vague sense of let down and what might have been. We get there through a combination of people leaving, people &#8216;leaving&#8217; but staying put, people slowly ignoring the norms more and more, and Duncan not running a tight enough ship. The house keeps some good norms, and nothing too bad happens, but we don&#8217;t really know whether the idea would work, so this has to be considered a let down. Still, it&#8217;s not much worse than if there was no house in the first place. I give this about 25%.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The other failure mode is <em>disaster. </em>This is where there are big fights and power struggles, or people end up feeling hurt or abused, and there is Big Drama and lots of blame to go around. Alternatively, the power thing gets out of hand, and outsiders think that this has turned into something dangerous, perhaps working to break it up. A lot of group houses end in this way, so I don&#8217;t know the base rate, but I&#8217;d say with the short time frame and natural end point these together are something like 25%. Breaking that down, I&#8217;d say 15% chance of <em>ordinary house drama </em>being the basic story, and 10% chance that <em>scary unique stuff </em>happens that makes us conclude that the experiment was an Arrested Development level huge mistake.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Good luck!</div>

It seems like the most practical way of getting started, but I am not sure and am definitely open to other ideas. Other notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There seems to be agreement that the best way to do this is individualized guidance, rather than lectures and curriculums. Eg. the Teacher ""debugging"" the Learner. Assuming that approach, it is probably best for the amount of Learners in a session to be small.</li>
<li>Consider that it may make sense for you to act as a Teacher, even if you don't have a super strong grasp of the topic. For example, I know a decent amount about computer science, but don't have a super strong grasp of it. Still, I believe it would be valuable for me to teach computer science to others. I can definitely offer value to people with no CS background. And for people who do have a CS background, there could be value in us taking turns teaching/learning, and debugging each other.</li>
<li>We may not be perfect at this in the beginning, but let's dive in and see what we can do! I think it'd be a good idea to comment on this post with what did/didn't work for you, so we as a group could learn and improve.</li>

</ul>
<p>Update 6/28/17: With 14 people currently interested, it does seem that there's enough to get started. However, I'd like to give it a bit more time and see how much overall interest we get.</p>
<p>Idea: we coordinate to teach each other things via video chat.</p>
<ul>
<li>We (mostly) all like learning. Whether it be for fun, curiosity, a stepping stone towards our goals.</li>
<li>My intuition is that there's a lot of us who also enjoy teaching. I do, personally.</li>
<li>Enjoyment aside, teaching is a good way of solidifying ones knowledge.</li>
<li>Perhaps there would be positive unintended consequences. Eg. socially.</li>
<li>Why video? a) I assume that medium is better for education than simply text. b) Social and motivational benefits, maybe. A downside to video is that some may find it intimidating.</li>
<li>It may be nice to evolve this into a group project where we iteratively figure out how to do a really good job teaching certain topics.</li>
<li>I see the main value in personalization, as opposed to passive lectures/seminars. Those already exist, and are plentiful for most topics. What isn't easily accessible is personalization. With that said, I figure it'd make sense to have about 5 learners per teacher.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this seems like something that would be mutually beneficial. To get started, we'd need:</p>
<ol>
<li>A place to do this. No problem: there's Hangouts, Skype, https://talky.io/, etc.</li>
<li>To coordinate topics and times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I'm not sure how much I can offer as far as doing the teaching. I worked as a web developer for 1.5 years and have been teaching myself computer science. I could be helpful to those unfamiliar with those fields, but probably not too much help for those already in the field and looking to grow. But I'm interested in learning about lots of things!</p>
<p>Perhaps a good place to start would be to record in some spreadsheet, a) people who want to teach, b) what topics, and c) who is interested in being a Learner. Getting more specific about who wants to learn what may be overkill, as we all seem to have roughly similar interests. Or maybe it isn't.</p>

I haven&#x27;t yet found a distinction between these things which feels to me like more than a <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/kKTRqes9MN6sAPgZd/distinctions-of-the-moment"">distinction of the moment.</a> What I&#x27;m talking about for the purposes of this post is<em> game-theoretic reasoning which has a tendency to promote cooperation and get good results</em>. I&#x27;ll call this &quot;game-theoretic morality&quot; here.</p><p>I suspect there isn&#x27;t something like an objectively correct game-theoretic morality. The pragmatically best approach depends too much on what universe you&#x27;re in. Players can enforce weird equilibria in <a href=""http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2012/07/iterated-prisoners-dilemma-is-ultimatum.html"">iterated Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma</a>. If you find yourself in a <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/dark-arts-of-rationality/"">strange playing field</a>, all sorts of irrational-looking strategies may be optimal. That being said, we can try to capture working principles for the situations we find we tend to get into, and hope they don&#x27;t generalize <em>too</em> badly.</p><h2>Coalition Dynamics</h2><p>I think of game-theoretic morality largely in terms of coalition dynamics. In some sense, the ideal outcome is for everyone to be on the same team, maximizing a combined utility function. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not always possible. A pure altruist, who values everyone equally, is exploitable; unqualified altruism isn&#x27;t a winning strategy (or rather, isn&#x27;t always a winning strategy), even from the perspective of global coordination. A more pragmatic strategy is to give consideration to others in a way which incentivises joining your coalition. This often allows you to convince selfish agents to &quot;grow the circle of empathy&quot;, creating overall better outcomes through coordination.</p><p>This line of thinking leads to things like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargaining_problem#Nash_bargaining_solution"">Nash bargaining</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value"">Shapley value</a>. Everyone in the coalition coordinates to provide maximum value to the coalition as a whole, but not treating everyone equally. Members of the coalition are valued based on their contribution to the coalition. If you want the setup to be more egalitarian, that&#x27;s a matter of <em>your</em> values (which your coalition partners should take into account), but it&#x27;s <em>not</em> part of the ideal game-theoretic morality.</p><p>This point is similar to <a href=""https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2015/12/02/friendship-is-utilitarian/"">Friendship is Utilitarian</a>. Even if you have egalitarian altruistic goals, and even if your potential allies don&#x27;t, it can be overall better to form alliances in which you help the people who you expect will help you most in return.</p><p>If this sounds a little too cold-hearted, there&#x27;s probably a good reason for that. When I said &quot;things like Nash bargaining and Shapely value&quot;, I was purposefully leaving things open to interpretation. I don&#x27;t know what the right formal model of what I&#x27;m talking about is. I suspect there&#x27;s some use for extending benefit of the doubt, in general. For example, in Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, if your strategy is to estimate the probability <strong><em>p</em></strong> that the other person will cooperate and then cooperate with probability <strong><em>p</em></strong> yourself, the result is unstable when playing with other similar agents. However, if you cooperate with probability <strong><em>p+0.001</em></strong>, then both people are trying to be a little more cooperative than the other. You&#x27;ll cooperate 100% of the time with others following the same strategy, while sacrificing very little in other situations. Common knowledge that you&#x27;ll extend a little more trust than is &quot;strictly justified&quot; can go a long way!</p><p>By the way, in one sense, the &quot;<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/tn/the_true_prisoners_dilemma/"">True Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma</a>&quot; is impossible between agents of the sort I&#x27;m imagining. They see the game set-up and the payoff table, and immediately figure out the Nash bargaining solution (or something like it), and re-write their own utility function to care about the other player. From this perspective, the classical presentation of Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma as a game between humans doesn&#x27;t provide such bad intuitions after all.</p><h2>Preference Utilitarianism</h2><p>Preference utilitarianism makes a lot more sense within this kind of coalition than alternatives like hedonic utilitarianism. We help allies in what <em>they</em> care about, not what we think they ideally <em>should</em> care about. You&#x27;re <em>allowed</em> to care about the happiness of others. Allies in your coalition will support your wishes in this respect, to the extent that you&#x27;ve earned it (and perhaps a little more). But, as with egalitarianism, that&#x27;s a matter of your personal preference, not a matter of game-theoretic morality.</p><h2>Deontology</h2><p>Another wrinkle in the story is <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Timeless_decision_theory"">timeless decision theory</a>, which gives something more like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_utilitarianism"">rule utilitarianism</a> rather than the more common <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_utilitarianism"">act utilitarianism</a>. This is quite close to deontology, if not identical. In particular, it sounds quite close to Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative to me. </p><p>Arguably, timeless decision theory does not exactly give rule utilitarianism: trying to take the action which you would want relevantly similar decision makers to take in relevantly similar situations is not necessarily the same as trying to act according to the set of rules which are highest-utility. Creating rules (such as &quot;do not kill&quot;, &quot;do not lie&quot;) risks over-generalizing in a way which trying to follow the best policy doesn&#x27;t. However, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/uv/ends_dont_justify_means_among_humans/"">this is good for humans</a>: we can&#x27;t expect to work out all the instances correctly on the spot, especially accounting for biases. Furthermore, clear rules are going to be better for coalition coordination than just generally trying to take the best actions (although there&#x27;s room for both).</p><p>A common objection is that deontology is about duty, not about consequences; that even if rule utilitarians do arrive at the same conclusions, they do it for different reasons. However, from a coalition perspective, I&#x27;m not sure &quot;duty&quot; is such a bad way of describing the reason for following the rules.</p><h2>Contractualism</h2><p>The kind of reasoning here has some similarities to Scott Alexander&#x27;s attempt to <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/24/the-invisible-nation-reconciling-utilitarianism-and-contractualism/"">derive utilitarianism from contractualism</a>. </p><p>Now, I won&#x27;t try to pretend that I understand contractualism all that well, but I think orthodox contractualism (as opposed to Scott Alexander&#x27;s version) does something more like a &quot;min&quot; operation rather than summing utility. From <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/#HowDoeConDifUti"">the SEP article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Since individuals must be objecting on their own behalf and not on behalf of a group, this restriction to single individuals&#x27; reasons bars the interpersonal aggregation of complaints; it does not allow a number of lesser complaints to outweigh one person&#x27;s weightier complaint.</p></blockquote><p>I surprise myself by thinking something similar to this applies to the ideal coalition dynamics.</p><p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/g85/harsanyis_social_aggregation_theorem_and_what_it/"">Harsanyi&#x27;s Utilitarian Theorem</a> is a very strong argument for the utilitarian practice of aggregating utilities by summing them. However, when we take coalition dynamics into account, we see that there&#x27;s a need to keep everyone in the coalition happy. Utilitarianism will happily kill a few group members or expose them to terrible suffering for the greater good. If coalition members can foresee this fate, they will likely leave the coalition.</p><p>This situation is somewhat improved if the coalition members are using something like timeless decision theory, since they will have a greater tendency to <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/135/timeless_decision_theory_problems_i_cant_solve/"">commit to beneficial arrangements</a>. However, assuming a typical &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; seems too strong -- this is like assuming that all the agents come from the <em>same</em> timeless perspective (a position where they&#x27;re ignorant of which agent they&#x27;ll become). This would allow a perfect Harsanyi coordination, but only because everyone starts out agreeing by assumption.</p><p>If there&#x27;s a great degree of honor in the coalition, or other commitment mechanisms which enforce what&#x27;s best for the group overall in the Harsanyi sense, then this isn&#x27;t a concern. However, it seems to me that some sort of compromise between optimizing the minimum and optimizing the average will be needed. Perhaps it&#x27;d be more like optimizing the average subject to the constraint that no one is so bad off that they will leave, or optimizing the average in some way that takes into account that some people <em>will</em> leave.</p><h2>Population Ethics</h2><p>Perhaps the most famous objection to utilitarianism is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox"">repugnant conclusion</a>. However, from the coalition-dynamics perspective, the whole line of reasoning relies on improper comparison of utility functions of differing coalitions. You determine whether to expand a coalition by checking the utility of that act <em>with respect to the current coalition</em>. A small coalition with a high average preference satisfaction isn&#x27;t better or worse than a large one with a medium average preference satisfaction; the two are incomparable. There&#x27;s no difference between total utilitarianism and average utilitarianism if applied in the right way. A member is added to a coalition if adding that member benefits the <em>existing</em> coalition (from an appropriate timeless-rule perspective); adding members in this way can&#x27;t result in lives barely worth living (at least, not in expectation).</p><p>This conclusion is likely weakened by benefit-of-the-doubt style reasoning. Still, the direct argument to the repugnant conclusion is blocked here.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><blockquote><p>The rules say we have to use consequentialism, but good people are deontologists, and virtue ethics is what actually works.</p><p>-Eliezer Yudkowsky</p></blockquote><p>Part of what I&#x27;m trying to get at here is that every major candidate for normative ethics makes points which are importantly true, and that they seem easier to reconcile than (I think) is widely recognized.</p><p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m trying to argue for a very specific version of utilitarianism, which I haven&#x27;t even fully worked out. I think there&#x27;s a lot of fertile ground here for investigation.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

(Like many things at CFAR, this is a deliberate and distilled version of something that already happens frequently in normal life.)</p><p>This used to have a different frame; we used to talk about the debugger and the debuggee, the person solving the problem and the person who had it. This predictably led to problems, because the frame mismatched what it actually meant to do the task well. This post is an attempt to point at the difference between the two, and why I think it&#x27;s important to lean heavily towards the &#x27;understand&#x27; side. There seem to be two broad clusters of reasons, which I&#x27;m going to label &quot;model-based&quot; and &quot;social.&quot;</p><p></p><p>image taken from <a href=""http://leanblitzconsulting.com/2012/01/the-five-whys-analysis/"">here</a></p><h6>&quot;Root cause analysis&quot; is the term we&#x27;d use in industry, or &quot;five whys.&quot; The point is that when you explore an issue in the right way with sufficient depth, you come up with a better solution; not to the immediate situation in front of you, but the entire class of situations that are caused by the same root cause. One of the pieces of advice that Duncan, CFAR&#x27;s curriculum director, gives is that the <em>worst </em>success at a pair debug is you solving their problem for them. The best is that by the end of the debug, the two of you aren&#x27;t the sort of person for whom that type of problem could happen anymore.</h6><p>That is, someone else having a problem isn&#x27;t just a task to be done and forgotten about; it&#x27;s an opportunity to learn about how their mind works, and how your mind works. I think one of the things that&#x27;s helped CFAR instructors &#x27;level up&#x27; is both getting rich models of how other people think, but also exposing lots of their own models and how they think. (&quot;Oh, in this situation I would do X, how do I explain X to someone else?&quot;)</p><p>It&#x27;s also often the case that the original frame for a problem is not one where the right solution is readily apparent. (If that were the case, generally the solution would have been implemented already!) Exploring a problem and uncovering other frames and perspectives can help discover the ontology in which the solution to the problem is obvious and exciting.</p><p></p><p><em>It <strong>isn&#x27;t </strong>about the nail--it&#x27;s about the reasons underlying the nail still being there.</em></p><h6>The second reason is that by trying to understand the other person, you actually establish a connection with them; they get to be heard and seen instead of manipulated like a math problem. Oftentimes, that&#x27;s the actual function of discussion about problems--social grooming and shared vulnerability. (Compare to <a href=""https://nuclearspaceheater.tumblr.com/post/162004266848/to-my-friends-on-the-spectrum-let-me-explain-to"">the claim</a> that &quot;what are you doing?&quot; is often code for &quot;can I do that with you?&quot; instead of &quot;please explain it to me.&quot;) This one seems harder to elaborate on than the model-based version, but is nevertheless as (if not more) important. Responding positively to others being vulnerable with you leads to more vulnerability, which can lead to them discovering the right frame or acquiring the resources they need in order to embark on a solution.</h6>",Vaniver,vaniver,Vaniver,

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>How much would it suck to be the guy who invented sulfa drugs? You dedicate your life to preventing a repeat of the horrors you saw in the war, <em>succeed </em>in that and so much more, and then 10 years later some idiot <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming#Accidental_discovery"">leaves a petri dish open</a> and completely replaces you as the father of man&#8217;s triumph against bacteria.  Actually he left the lid off <em>before</em> you found your thing, but ignored the result until you hit it big because everyone knew you couldn&#8217;t fight disease with chemicals, until you proved you could.  It&#8217;s the ultimate silver medal.  <em>The Demon Under the Microscope</em> is the tale of that guy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s by the same author (Thomas Hagen) as <em><a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2017/04/30/epistemic-spot-check-the-alchemy-of-air-thomas-hager/"">The Alchemy of Air.</a></em>  It&#8217;s also set in the same corporation, and about field that was transforming from science to industry.  The writing style is similar.  I originally didn&#8217;t intend to fact check this book very hard because I already knew what to expect from the author (a little too invested in the subject but basically accurate), but the habit is too ingrained at this point and I couldn&#8217;t keep reading until I&#8217;d checked out the first few chapters.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p><em>Claim: &#8220;Domagk [the researcher] had the ability to see. He watched everything, noted slight variations, quietly filed it all away.&#8221;  (p. 18).</em></p>
<p><em>The wounds themselves he accepted as the results of war. But the infections that followed—surely science could do something to stop those. He focused on the bacteria, his personal demons, “these terrible enemies of man that murder him maliciously and treacherously without giving him a chance.” “I swore before God and myself,” he later wrote, “to counter this destructive madness.”  (p. 20).</em></p>
<p><strong>Who knows but it&#8217;s pretty</strong>.  Someone in the same position as thousands of others (in this case a WW1 medic), caring more , and going to fix it (via sulfa drugs) is my moral aesthetic.  Of course there could be another surgeon in the same place with just as much care and potential who got blow up or gassed.  <em><a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2017/04/30/epistemic-spot-check-the-alchemy-of-air-thomas-hager/"">The Alchemy of Air</a> </em>prioritized poetry over provability, so I don&#8217;t entirely trust this, but I like it.</p>
<p><em>Claim</em>: C<em>holera was a big problem for German soldiers.</em></p>
<p>This would be a weird thing to make up, but I&#8217;m a little confused.  There had been a cholera vaccine for over 20 years by that point.</p>
<p><em>Claim: Gas gangrene is bad.</em></p>
<p><strong>True.</strong></p>
<p><em>Claim: Sir Almroth Wright created a typhoid vaccine that was deployed during WW1, saving may lives.  During WW1 he established a laboratory researching wound infections.</em></p>
<p><strong>True</strong>.  He was also prescient enough to foresee the risk of drug-resistant bacteria.  Of course he also thought that bacteria were associated with but not the cause of disease, and that scurvy was caused by poorly preserved meat.  Being right is hard.</p>
<p><em>Claim: </em><em>Doctors at the time thought that a dry wound was more resistant to infection; however dryness inhibited white blood cells and thus ultimately increased infections. They also thought wounds needed to be completely covered to prevent reinfection, but this created the ideal environment for anaerobic bacteria like Clostridium perfringens (which causes gas gangrene).</em></p>
<p><strong>True.</strong> I was surprised to find <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3842869/"">ideal</a> wound moistness still <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3601877/"">isn&#8217;t entirely settled</a>, but the book&#8217;s description seems essentially in good faith.  <em>Demon</em> goes on to say that by the 1920s, doctors believed they were basically powerless and their job was to get the body&#8217;s own healing systems a pillow and some tea.  They took this so far that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A physician doing drug research was a physician taken away from patient care. There was an unsavory aspect to a physician’s developing a drug for money. There were ethical questions about testing drugs on patients. Developing new drug therapies smacked of a return to the discredited age of bleedings and purgings.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To repeat: researching new treatments was considered distasteful at best and morally outrageous at worst.  And brain differentiation <a href=""https://acesounderglass.com/2017/05/17/review-the-dueling-neurosurgeons-sam-kean/"">was once considered</a> phrenology redux.  I just don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re very good at seeing where medicine is going (p40).</p>
<p><em>Claim: Section on Leeuwenhoek. </em></p>
<p><strong>True but missing time data</strong>.  Given that everything discussed so far happened in the range of 1890-1920, I would have have explicitly mentioned I was going 250 years into the past.  As it was, the only reason I noticed was that I recognized some of the names on the list of Leeuwenhoek&#8217;s contemporaries. The kindle edition may have made this worse.   But everything Hager actually says on Leeuwenhoek&#8217;s work in inventing the microscope seems accurate.</p>
<p><em>Claim: [crickets] (no page)</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no false statements, but I found the absence of discussion of the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic.  <em>Demon&#8217;s</em> narrative is that seeing the horror of infected wounds in World War 1 drove Domangk to dedicate his life to preventing them.  Spanish Flu killed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic#Around_the_globe"">5%</a> of the <em>entire world </em>over the course of three years, and had a massive effect on troop movements and training in WW1.  From a military perspective it might have been more important.  We know now that the flu is really hard to vaccinate against, but at the time they didn&#8217;t even know it was a virus.  If you were a motivated medic looking for something to care about, Spanish Flu was a really obvious choice.  <em>Demon</em> mentions Spanish Flu in passing but not as an influence on Domangk, and that feels incomplete to me. Why gangrene in particular, when there were so many horrors happening at the time?</p>
<p><em>Claim: Streptococcus is the cause of everything bad.</em></p>
<p><strong>True</strong>.  I knew it was possible to die from a scratch, but reading about everything strep causes really made me appreciate how few technological innovations are between us humans and mass die offs.  Strep causes childbed fever, St. Anthony&#8217;s Fire, meningitis, scarlet fever, pink eye, necrotizing fasciitis&#8230; Strep is the cockroach of human-infecting bacteria.  And for a while, all we had to do was take a pill and it was completely harmless.</p>
<p>Of course now we have MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) (whose natural habitat is the hospital, just like strep).  And <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/arg/default.htm"">multiply resistant gonorrhea</a>.  And <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/drtb/default.htm"">tuberculosis</a> resistant to most known antibiotics.  The bad old days are on our heels, is what I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p>One weird thing is I finished this book with the vague impression that sulfa drugs had saved a lot of lives but not actually knowing how many.  <a href=""https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.2.2.118"">This article</a> estimates that sulfa drugs led to a 2-3% drop in overall mortality, which translated to a 0.4-0.7 year increase in life expectancy.  That only covers up until 1943: presumably it had a bigger impact as distribution increased, or at least would have if penicillin had not taken over.</p>
<h2><strong>Overall Verdict</strong></h2>
<p>Pretty good, with some oversights.  Like <em>Alchemy of Air</em> the beginning is the best part, and if you find your attention flagging I&#8217;d just let it go.  I found the subject matter more innately interesting than <em>Alchemy of Air</em> but the writing a little less so.  <em>Demon</em> spends less time on the personal lives of the scientists, which was a selling point for my roommate but a disappointment for me.</p>

<h2>Part 1 &#8211; The opposite of power is bullshit</h2>
<p>I recently met a young lady, and we were discussing statistical power. No, I don&#8217;t see why that&#8217;s weird. Anyway, I mentioned that an underpowered experiment is useless no matter if it gets a result or not. For example, <a href=""https://putanumonit.com/2016/04/17/022-power_skeptic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the infamous power posing experiment had a power of merely 13%</a>, so it can&#8217;t tell us whether power posing actually does something or not.</p>
<p>The young lady replied: <em>For the power pose study, if the power was .13 (and beta was .87), then isn’t it impressive that they caught the effect despite the chance being only 13%?</em></p>
<p>This question reflects a very basic confusion about what statistical power is. I wish I could explain what it is with a link, but I had trouble finding a clear explanation of that anywhere online, including in my <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2016/04/17/022-power_skeptic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">previous post</a>. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Wikipedia</a> isn&#8217;t very helpful, and neither are the first 5 Google results. So, let me take a step back and try to explain as best <em>I</em> can what power is and what it does.</p>
<p>Statistical power is defined as the <strong>chance of correctly identifying a true positive</strong> result (if it exists) in an experiment. It is a function of the <strong>effect size</strong>, the <strong>measurement error</strong>, and the <strong>desired rate of false positives</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>effect size</strong> is what you&#8217;re actually after, but you can estimate it ahead of time and it has to be part of the hypothesis you&#8217;re trying to prove. You don&#8217;t care about power If your study is exploratory, but then you&#8217;re not setting to confirm any hypotheses either. The <strong>bigger the effect size</strong>, the higher the statistical power.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement error</strong> is a function of your measurement accuracy (which you can&#8217;t really change) and the sample (which you can). The <strong>bigger the sample</strong>, the <strong>smaller the error</strong>, the higher the power.</p>
<p>The rate of false positives is how often you&#8217;ll think you have found an effect when none exists. This number is up to you, and it&#8217;s <strong>traded off against power</strong>: if you decrease the chance of confusing a false effect for a true one, you increase the chance of missing out on a true effect. For reasons of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_statistics#Fisher.27s_.22significance_testing.22_vs_Neyman.E2.80.93Pearson_.22hypothesis_testing.22"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">historical conspiracy</a>, this is usually set at 5%.</p>
<p>The same historical conspiracy also decided that &#8220;identifying a true positive&#8221; means &#8220;rejecting the null hypothesis&#8221;. This is dumb (why do you care about some arbitrary null hypothesis and not the <em>actual</em> hypothesis you&#8217;re testing?) but we&#8217;ll leave it for now since (unfortunately) that&#8217;s how most research is done today.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here&#8217;s how the actual <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2016/04/17/022-power_skeptic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">power calculation is done in the power posing example</a>. The hypothesized effect of power posing is a decrease in cortisol, and I found that this decrease can&#8217;t be much larger than <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">1 µg/dl</span>. That&#8217;s the <strong>effect size</strong>. The <strong>measurement error</strong> of the change in cortisol (with a sample size of 20 people in each group) is <span style=""color:#ff00ff;"">1.2 µg/dl</span>.</p>

<p>To get a p-value of 0.05, the measured result needs to be at least <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.96"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">1.96 times the standard error</a>. In our case the error is 1.2, so we need to measure an effect of at least <span style=""color:#ff0000;"">1.96 x 1.2 = 2.35</span> to reject the null. However, the real effect size is equal to about 1, and to get from 1 to 2.35 we need to also get really lucky. We need <span style=""color:#0000ff;"">1 µg/dl</span> of real effect, and another 1.35 µg/dl of helpful noise.</p>
<p>This is pretty unlikely to happen, we can calculate the exact probability by just plugging the numbers into the normal distribution function in Excel:</p>
<p>1 &#8211; NORM.DIST(<span style=""color:#ff0000;"">1.2*1.96</span>,<span style=""color:#0000ff;"">1</span>,<span style=""color:#ff00ff;"">1.2</span>,TRUE) = 13%.</p>
<p>When you run an experiment with 13% power, even if you found an effect that happens to exist you mostly measured noise. More importantly, getting a positive result in a low-powered experiment provides scant evidence that the effect is real. Let me explain why.</p>
<p>Let me explain why.</p>
<hr />
<p>In an ideal world, setting a p-value threshold at .05 means that you&#8217;ll get a false positive (a positive result where no effect actually exists) 5% of the time. In the real world, that&#8217;s wildly optimistic.</p>
<p>First of all, even if you do the analysis flawlessly, the chance of a false positive given p&lt;0.05 is around 30%, <a href=""http://www.dcscience.net/2014/03/24/on-the-hazards-of-significance-testing-part-2-the-false-discovery-rate-or-how-not-to-make-a-fool-of-yourself-with-p-values/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">just due to the fact that true effects are rare</a>. As we say in the Bayesian conspiracy: even if you&#8217;re not interested in base rates, base rates are interested in <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>But even without invoking base rates, analyses are never perfect. <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2017/05/27/strong-men-are-socialist-reports-a-study-that-previously-reported-the-opposite/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">I demonstrated last time</a> that if you measure enough variables, the false positive rate you can get is basically 100%. Obviously, either &#8220;weak men = socialism&#8221; or &#8220;strong men = socialism&#8221; is a false positive. I strongly suspect that both are.</p>
<p>Ok, let&#8217;s say that you <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2016/12/18/multiplicitous/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">guard against multiplicity</a> and only test a single variable. What can go wrong? A <a href=""http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">thousand things can</a>. Measurement mistakes, inference mistakes, coding mistakes, confounders, mismatches between the control and effect group, subjects dropping out, various choices about grouping the data, transforming the data, comparing the data, even cleaning the data.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take &#8220;cleaning the data&#8221; as the most innocuous sounding example. What cleaning the data usually means is throwing out data points that have some problem, like a subject that obviously misread the questions on a survey. <em>Obviously</em>. What&#8217;s the worst that can happen if you throw out a data point or two? <a href=""https://github.com/yashkaf/oldhispanic/blob/master/OutlierHack.r"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">I wrote a quick code simulation to find out</a>.</p>
<p>I simulate two completely independent variables, so we should expect to get a p-value of 5% exactly 5% of the time. However, if I get to exclude just a single data point from a sample size of 30, the false positive rate goes to 14%. If I can throw out two &#8220;outliers&#8221;, it goes to 25%. You can <a href=""https://github.com/yashkaf/oldhispanic/blob/master/OutlierHack.r"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">use the code</a> to play with different sample sizes, thresholds, and the number of outliers you&#8217;re allowed to throw out.</p>
<p>Bottom line: if you&#8217;re aiming for a 5% false positives, 30% is a <em>very optimistic </em>estimate of the actual false positive rate you&#8217;re going to get.</p>

<p>In the perfect world, your power is 80% and the false positive rate is 5%. This dream scenario looks like this:</p>

<p>The dark blue region are true positives (80% of the time), and the light blue sliver (5% of the remaining 20% are 1%) is what I call a &#8220;noise positive&#8221;: you got a positive result that matches a real effect by coincidence. Basically, <strong>your experiment missed the true effect but you p-hacked your way into it</strong>.</p>
<p>[Edit 6/25: &#8220;noise positive&#8221; is a bad name, I should have called it &#8220;hacked positive&#8221;]</p>
<p>Of course, you don&#8217;t know if the effect <span style=""color:#3366ff;"">exists</span> or <span style=""color:#ff0000;"">not</span> ahead of time, you have to infer it from the result of the experiment.</p>
<p>If all you know is that you got a result, you know you&#8217;re somewhere in the colored regions. If you combine them (the horizontal bar), you see that &#8220;getting a result&#8221; is mostly made up of dark blue, which means &#8220;true results for an effect that exists&#8221;. The ratio of blue to red in the combined bar is a visual representation of the <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule_odds/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Bayesian likelihood ratio</a>, which is a measure of how much support the data gives to the hypothesis that the measured effect exists versus the hypothesis that it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So that was the dream world. In the power posing world, the power is 13% and the false positive rate is (optimistically) 30%. Here&#8217;s how <em>that</em> looks like:</p>

<p>In this world, you can&#8217;t infer that the effect exists from the data: the red area is almost as big as the blue one. All you know is that most of what you measured is measurement error, aka noise.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think some confusion stems from how statistical power is taught. For a given experimental setup, there is a trade-off of false positives (also called type I error) versus false negatives (type II, and the thing that statistical power directly refers to). But having lower statistical power makes <strong>both</strong> things worse and higher power makes <strong>both</strong> things better.</p>
<p>You increase power by having a large sample size combined with repeated and precise measurements. You get low power by having a sample size of 20 college students and measuring a wildly fluctuating hormone from a single spit tube. With a power of 13%, both the false positive rate and the false negative rate are going to be terrible no matter how you trade them off against each other.</p>

<h2>Part 2 &#8211; Is psychology a science?</h2>
<p>Part 1 was a careful explanation of a subject I know very well. Part 2 is a controversial rant about a subject I don&#8217;t. Take it for what it is, and please prove me wrong: I&#8217;ll be deeply grateful if you do.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t mention about the confused young lady is that she&#8217;s a graduate student in psychology. From a top university. And she came to give a presentation about this <a href=""http://moityca.com.br/pdfs/Cohen_1990.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">excellent paper from 1990</a> about how everyone in psychology is doing bad statistics and ignoring statistical power.</p>
<p>You should <a href=""http://moityca.com.br/pdfs/Cohen_1990.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">read the Jacob Cohen paper</a>, by the way. He&#8217;s everything I aspire to be when writing about research statistics: clear arguments combined with hilarious snark.</p>
<blockquote><p>The atmosphere that characterizes statistics as applied in the social and biomedical sciences is that of a secular religion, apparently of Judeo—Christian derivation, as it employs as its most powerful icon a six-pointed cross [the asterisk * denotes p&lt;0.05], often presented multiply for enhanced authority [** denotes p&lt;0.01]. I confess that I am an agnostic.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that the psychology studies that show up on my Facebook feed or on <a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/category/zombies/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Andrew Gelman&#8217;s blog</a> are preselected for bad methodology. I thought that while bad statistics proliferated in psychology for decades (despite warnings by visionaries like Cohen), this ended in 2015 when the <a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">replicability crisis</a> showed that barely 36% of finding in top psych journals replicate. Some entrenched psychologists who built their careers on p-hacked false findings may gripe about &#8220;<a href=""http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/10/inside-psychologys-methodological-terrorism-debate.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">methodological terrorists</a>&#8220;, but surely the young generation will wise up to the need for proper methodology, the least of which is doing a power calculation.</p>
<p>And yet, here I was talking to a psychology student who <em>came to give a presentation about statistical power</em> and had the following, utterly stupefying, exchange:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me: <em>So, how did you calculate statistical power in your own research?</em></p>
<p>Her: <em>What do you mean &#8216;how we calculated it&#8217;?</em></p>
<p>Me: <em>The statistical power of your experiment, how did you arrive at it?</em></p>
<p>Her: <em>Oh, our research was inspired by a previous paper. They said their power was 80%, so we said the same.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This person came to present a paper detailing the ways in which psychologists fuck up their methodology, and yet was utterly uninterested in actually doing the methodology. When I gave her the quick explanation of how power works I wrote down in part 1 of this post, she seemed indifferent, as if all this talk of statistics and inference was completely irrelevant to her work as a psychology researcher.</p>
<p>This is mind boggling to me. I don&#8217;t have any good explanation for what actually went on in her head. But I have <em>an</em> explanation, and if it&#8217;s true it&#8217;s terrifying.</p>
<hr />
<p>As centuries of alchemy, demonology and luminiferious aetherology have shown, the fact that smart people study a subject does not imply that the subject <em>actually exists</em>. I&#8217;m beginning to suspect that a whole lot of psychologist are studying effects that are purely imaginary.</p>

<p>And we didn&#8217;t even mention fucking <a href=""https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/06/daryl-bem-proved-esp-is-real-showed-science-is-broken.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">parapsychology</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, when was the last time you saw a psychology article publicized that wasn&#8217;t in those areas? Yes, of course this young lady was pursuing her research in one them.</p>
<p>Perhaps these fields aren&#8217;t totally null, but their effects are too small or unstable to be studied given current constraints (e.g. sample sizes less than 10,000). Even if half those fields contain interesting and real phenomena, that leaves a lot of fields that don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re studying a nonexistent effect, there&#8217;s no point whatsoever in improving your methodology. It&#8217;s only going to hurt you! If you&#8217;re studying a nonexistent field, you write <em>&#8220;our power is 80%&#8221;</em> on the grant application because that&#8217;s how you get funded, not because you know what it means. Your brain will protect itself from actually finding out what a power calculation actually entails because it senses bad things lying in wait if you go there.</p>
<p>There <em>are </em>ways to study subjects with no physical reality, but <i>the scientific method </i>isn&#8217;t one of those ways. Example: you have the <strong>science</strong> of glaciology which involves drilling into glaciers, and you have the <strong>critical theory</strong> of feminist glaciology which <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com.sci-hub.cc/doi/abs/10.1177/0309132515623368#"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">involves doing something completely different</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Structures of power and domination also stimulated the first large-scale ice core drilling projects – these archetypal masculinist projects to literally penetrate glaciers and extract for measurement and exploitation the ice in Greenland and Antarctica.</p></blockquote>
<p>Glaciologists and feminist glaciologists are not colleagues. They don&#8217;t sit in the same university departments, speak at the same conferences, or publish in the same journals. Nobody thinks that they&#8217;re doing the same job.</p>
<p>But people think that bad psychologists and good psychologists are doing the same job. And this drives the good ones away.</p>
<p>Imagine a psychology grad student with good intentions and a rudimentary understanding of statistics wandering into one of the above-mentioned research areas. She will quickly grow discouraged by getting null results and disillusioned by her unscrupulous colleagues churning out bullshit papers like <em>&#8220;Why petting a donkey makes you vote Democrat, but only if your phone number ends in 7, p=0.049&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p><a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/2016/09/21/what-has-happened-down-here-is-the-winds-have-changed/#comment-313205"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Imagine professors treating her with hostility when she suggests that they should be doing statistics better</a>.</p>
<p>This student isn&#8217;t going to stick around in academia very long. She&#8217;s going to take a quick data science boot camp and go work for Facebook or Amazon. There, she will finally get to work with smart colleagues doing rigorous psychological research using sophisticated statistical methodology.</p>
<p>But instead of probing the secrets of the mind for the benefit of humanity, she&#8217;ll be researching which font size makes people 0.2% more likely to retweet a meme.</p>
<p>And the academic discipline of psychology will drift one step further away from science and one step closer to the ugly void of postmodernism.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;m not writing this out of disdain for psychology. I&#8217;m writing this out of love, and fear. I have been reading books on psychology and volunteering as a subject for experiments since I was a teenager. I considered majoring in psychology in undergrad, until the army told me I&#8217;m going to study physics instead. I occasionally drink with psychologists and tell them about p-hacking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m scared that there&#8217;s a battle going on for the heart of psychology right now, between those who want psychology to be a science and those for whom that would be <em>inconvenient</em>.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m scared that the good guys aren&#8217;t winning.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/putanumonit.wordpress.com/25365/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/putanumonit.wordpress.com/25365/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=putanumonit.com&#038;blog=101823629&#038;post=25365&#038;subd=putanumonit&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",Jacobian,jacob-falkovich,Jacob Falkovich,

For example, I might contrast &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot; for the sake of a discussion about memorization-and-regurgitation style education vs focusing more on reasons. In a different conversation, I may well use &quot;knowledge&quot; vs &quot;understanding&quot; to talk about knowing-how vs knowing-what (and I might well call either of those two &quot;understanding&quot; and the other &quot;knowledge&quot; -- it doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s just a distinction of the moment).</p><p>The important thing about distinctions of the moment is that they just have to be made clear for the purpose of the conversation, and can be thrown away afterwards. This fails if someone thinks that they need to argue the definition of a word as if it were a sacred duty. Perhaps I make a distinction between &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; for the purpose of conversation, and someone takes issue with it because they&#x27;ve got a favorite definition of one or both of those terms which they think is importantly correct. This is not useful to the conversation.</p><p>A pet peeve of mine is that a lot of people seem to carry around distinctions-of-the-moment forever, as if they were true subtle differences in the meanings of words. I feel this way about distinguishing between &quot;sympathy&quot; and &quot;empathy&quot; -- I&#x27;m not sure quite why, but it seems to me that the distinction people tend to draw between the two is something which is just not generally useful enough to be more than a distinction-of-the-moment. The two words have different usage patterns, yes, but I don&#x27;t think those usage patterns are really well-explained by &quot;feeling emotion in response to others vs putting yourself in their shoes&quot;.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>",abramdemski,abramdemski,abramdemski,

I don&#x2019;t mean that as some kind of bad joke, either: some people experience personal, psychological harm after learning that the world might end in preventable ways. They may become depressed, anxious, or nihilistic over not just their own death but the potential death of everything that means anything to them, and they may wallow in that despair. But, if they can wade their way through such feelings&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and many people do!&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;they might seek to take action against existential risks. One such group of action-takers is <a href=""https://www.effectivealtruism.org/"">effective altruists</a>.</p><p>There are many existential risks, and so there are many ways effective altruists try to address them. Some tackle fairly prosaic risks and so can use prosaic methods, like <a href=""http://effective-altruism.com/ea/wk/effective_altruism_is_exploring_climate_change/"">applying activism to address risks from climate change</a> and <a href=""http://ealondon.com/2017/04/14/responding-humanitarian-crises/""><em>not</em> raising money for emergency response</a>. Others look at more exotic risks from nanotechnology and <a href=""https://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html"">superintelligence</a> and so may need more exotic mitigation strategies, like <a href=""https://intelligence.org/"">performing original research that would otherwise not happen</a> or <a href=""http://www.rationality.org/"">teaching people to be more rational</a>. And it&#x2019;s among those who look at exotic risks and find only need of exotic interventions that a particular sort of angst, ennui, and guilt can arise.</p><p>Now I don&#x2019;t much think of myself as an effective altruist, but <a href=""https://medium.com/@gworley3/if-i-must-eat-meat-i-eat-pork-a-vegetarian-perspective-1950d6b76310"">I quack like one</a>, so you might as well count me among their ranks, and many of my friends identify as effective altruists, so I speak from a place of <a href=""http://gnoscast.blogspot.com/2007/11/gnosis-episteme-and-doxia-oh-my.html"">gnosis</a> when I say effective altruists suffer in these specific ways. And it seems to happen because people follow reasoning along these lines:</p><ul><li>We face existential risk X.</li><li>The best option to mitigate X is action Y.</li><li>I should do Y.</li></ul><p>Sometimes this works out great and we get fabulous folks I&#x2019;m glad to know working at places like <a href=""http://cser.org/"">CSER</a>, <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/"">FHI</a>, <a href=""https://foundational-research.org/"">FRI</a>, <a href=""http://intelligence.org/"">MIRI</a>, and <a href=""http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/global-catastrophic-risks/"">others</a> doing vital work on addressing existential risks. Other times it doesn&#x2019;t, not for lack of will or clarity of thought, but for lack of fit to perform the action Y. But, if you&#x2019;ve reasoned thusly, you&#x2019;re now stuck in a spot where you know the world is at grave risk, you know something specific to do about it, and yet you don&#x2019;t do it. If you feel frustrated or disappointed or to have caused harmed, then you may feel the existential angst, ennui, or guilt, respectively, from not addressing X.</p><p>I see lots of evidence of this in rationalist and effective altruist culture. Perhaps no groups have ever worried more over <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/9i6/breaking_the_chain_of_akrasia/"">akrasia and ways to combat it</a> or the <a href=""https://80000hours.org/"">potential impact their possible work could have</a>. Nate Soares wrote a <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/guilt/"">whole series of posts on guilt</a> because people kept coming to him saying &#x201C;help, I feel guilty for not doing more,&#x201D; and there&#x2019;s lots of self questioning about <a href=""http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/effective-altruism-not-no-brainer/"">how effective or altruistic the whole effective altruism movement is anyway</a>. Even at EA and rationalist parties I hear many conversations about what people think they should be doing with their own lives and how they can make themselves do those things. A cynic might say the community is actively encouraging feelings of angst, ennui, and guilt from its members. Yet somehow I feel none of these emotions. How do I do it?</p><p>Well, if I&#x2019;m honest, I dramatically oversolve the problem with <a href=""https://meaningness.com/"">meaningness</a>, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean I don&#x2019;t do things that specifically address the angst I used to feel over not doing AI safety research. After all, I think risks from superintelligence generate the greatest potential negative outcomes for the world, I think the best thing I could do about that is to dedicate my energies to researching and otherwise working to reduce those risks and weaken the badness of the outcomes, yet I am not working on AI safety research. Instead I do some other stuff that I like and give a little money to fund AI safety. How do I live with myself?</p><p>I think the answer is that I fully accept the concept of <a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/Details/comparativeadvantage.html"">comparative advantage</a> into my heart. Sure, I could make less money doing work I find less interesting and that I&#x2019;m less good at to directly advance AI safety, but I instead make more money doing things I find more interesting and that I&#x2019;m better at and give the excess to fund others working on AI safety. As a result, everyone gets more of what they want: I get more life satisfaction, someone else gets more life satisfaction because I help pay them to do the AI safety research they love, and we both still see an increase in the total amount of effort put into AI safety. And if it were just me making this tradeoff it might be a bad deal because I could subvert my comparative advantage and also work on AI safety and we&#x2019;d make a little more progress on it, but there are others doing the same and together we are able to mine the vast wealth of our <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/this-is-the-dream-time.html"">dreamtime</a> to get everyone more of everything, including AI safety research, than we could have otherwise had.</p><p>But if economics has taught me anything it&#x2019;s that economic reasoning is unsatisfying to most people, so allow me to reframe my position in more human terms. <a href=""http://www.deathisbadblog.com/the-inequitable-distribution-of-talent/"">Ability is unequally distributed</a>: it&#x2019;s sad and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"">true</a>. Even with lots of hard work we cannot all do all the things we might like to do as well as we&#x2019;d like to do them, even if we are all free to do the things we want to do as much as we want. And although you can feel angst that the world is unfair in this way, ennui for that which you can never have, and guilt over not fighting back harder against reality, there is great dignity in accepting the world as it is and finding contentment with it. So maybe you won&#x2019;t save the world and personally prevent existential disaster. That&#x2019;s fine.

HJDbyFFKf72F52edp,Welcome to Lesswrong 2.0,welcome-to-lesswrong-2-0,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HJDbyFFKf72F52edp/welcome-to-lesswrong-2-0,2017-06-18T17:23:02.272Z,19,17,27,False,False,,"<p>Lesswrong 2.0 is a project by Oliver Habryka, Ben Pace, and Matthew Graves with the aim of revitalizing the Lesswrong discussion platform. Oliver and Ben are currently working on the project full-time and Matthew Graves is providing part-time support and oversight from MIRI.  </p><p>Our main goals are to move Lesswrong to a modern codebase, add an effective moderation system, and integrate the cultural shifts that the rationality community has made over the last eight years. We also think that many of the distinct qualities of the Lesswrong community (e.g. propensity for long-form arguments, reasoned debate, and a culture of building on one another&#x27;s conceptual progress) suggest a set of features unique to the new Lesswrong that will greatly benefit the community. </p><p>We are planning to be improving and maintaining the site for many years to come, but whether the site will be successful ultimately depends on whether the community will find it useful. As such, it is important to get your feedback and guidance on how the site should develop and how we should prioritize our resources. Over the coming months we want to experiment with many different content-types and page designs, while actively integrating your feedback, in an attempt to find a structure for Lesswrong that is best suited at facilitating rational discourse. </p><p>What follows is a rough summary of how we are currently thinking about the development of Lesswrong 2.0, and what we see as the major pillars of the Lesswrong 2.0 project. We would love to get your thoughts and critiques on these.</p><p><strong>Table of Contents: </strong></p><p>I. Modern Codebase</p><p>II. Effective Moderation</p><p>III. Discourse Norms</p><p>IV. New Features</p><p>V. Beta Feedback Period</p><h2>I. Modern Codebase</h2><p>The old lesswrong is one of the only successful forks of the reddit codebase (forked circa 2009). While reddit&#x27;s code served as a stable platform while our community was in its initial stages, it has become hard to develop and extend because of its age, complexity and monolithic design.</p><p>Lesswrong 2.0, on the other hand, is based on modern web technologies designed to make rapid development much easier (to be precise React, GraphQL, Slate.js, Vulcan.js and Meteor). The old codebase was a pain to work with, and almost every developer who tried to contribute gave up after trying their hands at it. The new Lesswrong codebase on the other hand is built with tools that are well-documented and accessible, and is designed to have a modular architecture. You can find our Github repo <a href=""https://github.com/Discordius/Lesswrong2/tree/devel"">here</a>.  </p><p>We hope that these architectural decisions will allow us to rapidly improve the site and turn it into what a tool for creating intellectual progress should look like in 2017.</p><h2>II. Effective Moderation </h2><p>Historically, LW has had only a few dedicated moderators at a time, applying crude tools, which has tended to lead to burnout and backlash. There are many many obvious things we are planning to do to improve moderation, but here are some of the top ones:</p><p><strong>Spam defense  </strong></p><p>Any user above N karma can flag a post as spam, which renders it invisible to everyone but mods. Mods will check the queue of spam posts, deleting correct flags, and removing the power from anyone that misuses it. If it seems necessary, we will also be integrating all the cool new spam detection mechanisms that modern technology has given us in the last 8 years. </p><p><strong>Noob defense  </strong></p><p>Historically, Lesswrong’s value has come in large part from being a place on the internet where the comments were worth reading. This was largely a result of the norms and ability of the people who were commenting on the page, with a strong culture of minimizing defensiveness, searching for the truth and acting in the spirit of double crux. To sustain that culture and level of quality, we need to set up broad incentives that are driven by the community itself. </p><p>The core strategy we are currently considering is something we’re calling the Sunshine Regiment. The Sunshine regiment is a pretty large set of trusted users who have access to reduced moderating powers, such as automatically hiding comments for other users and temporarily suspending comment threads. The goal is to give the community the tools to de-escalate conflicts and help both the users and moderators make better decisions, by giving both sides time to reflect and think and by distributing the load of draining moderation decisions.</p><p><strong>Troll defense </strong></p><p>The two main plans we have against trolls is to change the Karma system to something more like “<a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1820"">Eigenkarma</a>” and improvements to the moderator tools. In an Eigenkarma system the weights of the votes of a user depends on how many other trustworthy users have upvoted that user. For the moderator tools, one of the biggest projects is a much better data querying interface that aims to help admins notice exploitative voting behavior and other problems in the voting patterns.</p><h2>III. Discourse Norms</h2><p>In terms of culture, we still broadly agree with the principles that Eliezer established in the early days of Overcoming Bias and Lesswrong. The twelve virtues of rationality continue to resonate with us, and the “The Craft and the Community” sequence is still highly influential on our thinking. The team (and in particular Oliver) have taken significant inspiration from the original vision of Arbital in our ideas for Lesswrong 2.0.</p><p>That being said we also think that the culture of the rationality community has substantially changed in the last eight years, and that many of those changes were for the better. As Eliezer himself said in the opening to “Rationality: AI to Zombies”: </p><blockquote>It was a mistake that I didn’t write my two years of blog posts with the intention of helping people do better in their everyday lives. I wrote it with the intention of helping people solve big, difficult, important problems, and I chose impressive-sounding, abstract problems as my examples. In retrospect, this was the second-largest mistake in my approach. It ties into the first-largest mistake in my writing, which was that I didn’t realize that the big problem in learning this valuable way of thinking was figuring out how to practice it, not knowing the theory. I didn’t realize that part was the priority; and regarding this I can only say ‘Oops’ and ‘Duh.’ </blockquote><p>We broadly agree with this, and think both that the community has made important progress in that direction, and that there are still many things to improve about the current community culture. We do not aim to make the new Lesswrong the same as it was at its previous height, but instead aim to integrate many of the changes to the culture of the rationalist culture, while also re-emphasizing important old virtues that we feel have been lost in the intervening years. </p><p>We continue to think that strongly discouraging the discussion of highly political topics is the correct way to go. A large part of the value of Lesswrong comes from being a place where many people can experience something closer to rational debate for the first time in their life. Political topics are important, and not to be neglected, but they serve as a bad introduction and base on which to build a culture of rationality. We are open to creating spaces on Lesswrong where people above a certain Karma threshold can discuss political topics, but we would not want that part of the site to be visible to new users, and we would want the votes on that part of the site to be less-important for the total karma of the participating users. We want seasoned and skilled rationalists to discuss political topics, but we do not want users to seek out Lesswrong primarily as a venue to hold political debates.</p><p>As a general content guideline on the new Lesswrong: If while writing the article the author is primarily writing with the intent of rallying people to action, instead of explaining things to them, then the content is probably ill-suited for Lesswrong. </p><p><strong>IV. New Features</strong></p><p>You can find our short-term feature roadmap over here in this <a href=""https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/6XZLexLJgc5ShT4in/lesswrong-2-0-feature-roadmap-and-feature-suggestions"">post</a>. This is a high-level overview on our reasoning on some of the big underlying features we expect to significantly shape the nature of Lesswrong 2.0.  </p><p><strong>Content curation:</strong></p><p>Many authors want their independence, which is one of the reasons why Scott Alexander prefers to write on SlateStarCodex instead of Lesswrong. We support that need for independence, and are hoping to serve it in two different ways:  </p><ul><li>We are making it very easy for trusted members of the rationality community to crosspost their content to Lesswrong. We already set up an RSS-feed integration that allows admins to associate external RSS feeds with a user, so that whenever something new gets added to that RSS feed, their user account will automatically create a post with their new content on Lesswrong, and if they want us to, not only add a link but the complete text of their post (which encourages discussion on Lesswrong instead of the external blog). </li><li>We want to give trusted authors moderation powers for the discussions on their own posts, allowing them to foster their own discussion norms, and giving them their own sphere of influence on the discussion platform. We hope this will both make the lives of our top authors better and will also create a form of competition between different cultures and moderation paradigms on Lesswrong.  </li></ul><p><strong>Arbital-Style features and content:</strong></p><p>Arbital did many things right, even though it never really seemed to take off. We think that allowing users to add prediction-polls is great, and that it is important to give authors the tools to create their own content that is designed to be maintained over a long period of time and with multiple authors. We also really like <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/arbital_greenlink/"">link previews on hover-over</a> as well as the ability to create highly interconnected networks of concepts with overview pages.  </p><p>Of the Arbital features, prediction polls are most certainly going to end up on feature list, but as of yet, it is unclear whether we want to copy any other features directly, though we expect to be inspired by many small features. </p><p><strong>Better editor software: </strong></p><p>The editor on Lesswrong and the EA Forum often lead to badly formatted posts. The editor didn’t deal well with copying content over from other webpages or Google docs, which often resulted in hard to read posts that could only be fixed by directly editing the HTML. We are working on an editor experience that will be flexible and powerful, while also making it hard to accidentally mess up the formatting of a post.  </p><p><strong>Sequences-like content with curated comments: </strong></p><p>After doing a large amount of interviews with old users of Lesswrong, it became clear to us that the vast majority of top contributors on Lesswrong spent at least 3 months doing nothing else but reading the sequences and other linearly-structured content on the page, while also reading the discussion on those posts. We aim to improve that experience significantly, while also making it easier to start participating in the discussion. </p><p>Books like Rationality: AI to Zombies are valuable in that they reach an audience that was impossible to reach with the old Lesswrong, and by curating the content into an established book-like format. But we also think that something very important is lost when cutting the discussion out of the content. We aim to make Lesswrong a platform that provides sequences-like content in formats that are as easy to consume as possible, while also encouraging the user to engage with the discussion on the posts, and be exposed to critical comments, disagreements and important contradicting or supporting facts. We also hope that being exposed to the discussion will more directly teach new users how to interact with the culture of Lesswrong and to learn the art of rationality more directly by observing people struggling in conversation with difficult intellectual problems. </p><p><strong>V. Beta Feedback Period </strong></p><p>It’s important for us to note that we don’t think that online discussion is primarily a technical problem. Our intention in sharing our plans with you and launching a closed beta are to discover both the cultural and the and technical problems that we need to solve to build a new and better discussion platform for our community. With your feedback we’re planning to rework the site, adjust our feature priorities and and make new plans for improving the culture of the new Lesswrong 2.0 community.</p><p>Far more important than implementing any particular feature is building an effective culture that has the correct social incentives. As such, our focus lies on building a community with norms and social incentives that facilitate good discourse, with a platform that does not get in the way of that. However, we do think that there are certain underlying attributes of a discussion platform that significantly shift the nature of discussions on that platform in a way that prevents or encourages good community norms to arise, i.e. Twitter’s 140 character limit makes it almost impossible to have reasoned discourse. At this stage, we are still trying to figure out what the best content-types and fundamental design philosophies are that are best for giving rise and facilitating effective discussion. </p><p>That’s all we have for now. Please post your ideas for features or design changes as top-level comments, and discuss your concerns and details of the suggestions in second-level comments. We will be giving significant weight to the discussion and votes in our decisions on what to work on for the coming weeks. </p>",habryka4,habryka4,habryka,

<p>Lots of people really value the lesswrong community but aren't sure how to contribute. The rationalist community can be intimidating. We have a lot of very smart people and the standards can be high. Nonetheless there are lots of concrete ways a normal rationalist can help improve the community. I will focus on two areas - engaging with content and a list of shovel ready projects you can get involved in. I will also briefly mention some more speculative ideas at the end of the post.</p>
<p>1) Engaging with Content:</p>
<p>I have spoken to many people I consider great content creators (ex: Zvi, Putanumonit, tristanm). It&rsquo;s very common to wish their articles got more comments and engagement. The easiest thing you can do is make a lesswrong account and use the upvote button. Seeing upvotes really does motivate good writers. This only works for lesswrong/reddit but it makes a difference. I can think of several lw articles with less upvotes than people who have personally told me the article was great (ex: norm-one-principle by tristanm <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/p3f/mode_collapse_and_the_norm_one_principle/"">[1]</a>).</p>
<p>Good comments tend to be even more appreciated than upvotes, and comments can be left on blog posts. If a post has few comments, then almost any decent quality comment is likely to be appreciated by the author. If you have a question or concern, just ask. Many great authors read all their comments, at least those left in the first few days, and often respond to them. Lots of readers comment very rarely, if at all. 95.1% of people who took the SSC survey comment less than once a month and 73.6% never comment at all&nbsp;<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/17/ssc-survey-2017-results/"">[2]</a>. The survey showed that survey takers were a highly engaged group who had read lots of posts. If a blog has very few comments I think you should update heavily towards &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good idea for me to post my comment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, what is most lacking in the rational-sphere is positive engagement with non-controversial content you enjoyed. &nbsp;Recently the SSC sub-reddit found that about 95% of recent content was either in the culture-war thread or contained in a few threads the community considered low quality (based on vote counts) <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/6gc7k8/what_can_be_done_to_make_the_culture_war_thread/"">[3]</a>. You can see a similar effect on lesswrong by considering the Dragon Army post <a href=""/lw/p23/dragon_army_theory_charter_30min_read/"">[4]</a>. Most good articles posted recently to lesswrong get around 10 comments or less. The Dragon Army post got over 550. I am explicitly not asking people to avoid posting in controversial threads; doing so would be asking a lot of people. But &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; is an important reward mechanism for content creators. I do think we should reward more of the writers we find valuable by responding to them with positive engagement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often difficult to write a comment on a post that you agree with that isn't just &ldquo;+1 nice post.&rdquo; Here are some strategies I have found useful:</p>
<p>- If the post is somewhat theoretical try to apply it in a concrete case. Talk about what difficulties you run into and what seems to work well.</p>
<p>- Talk about how the ideas in the post have helped you personally. For example you can say that never understood concept X until you read the post.</p>
<p>- Connect the post to other articles or essays. It&rsquo;s usually not optimal to just post a link. Either summarize the other article or include a relevant, possibly extended, quote. Reading articles takes time.</p>
<p>- Speculate a little on how the ideas in the article could be extended further.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just article writers who enjoy people engaging with their work. People who write comments also appreciate getting good responses. Posting high quality comments, including responses to other comments, encourages other people to engage more. You can personally help get a virtuous cycle going. As a side note I am unsure about the relative values of posting a comment directly on a blog vs reposting the blogpost to lesswrong and commenting there. Currently lesswrong is not that inundated with reposts but it could get more crowded in the future. In addition, I think article authors are less likely to read lesswrong comments about their post, but I am not confident in the effect size.</p>
<p>2) Shovel Ready Projects:</p>
<p>-- Set up an online Lesswrong gaming group/server, ideally for a popular game. I have talked to people and Overwatch seems to have a lot of interest. People seemed to think it would really be a blast to play Overwatch with four other rationalists. Another popular idea is Dungeons and Dragons. I am not a gaming expert and lots of games could probably work but I wanted to share the feedback I got. Notably there is already a factorio server [5].</p>
<p>-- Help 'aggregate' a best of rationalist_tumblr effort posts. Rat_Tumblr is very big and hard to follow. Effort posts are mixed in with lots of random things. One could also include the best responses. There is no need to do this on a daily basis. You could just have a blog that only reblogs high-quality effort posts. I would personally follow this blog and would be willing to cooperate in whatever ways I could. I also think this blog would bring some ""equality"" to rat_Tumb. The structure of tumblr implies that it&rsquo;s very hard to get readers unless a popular blog interacts with you. People report getting a ""year&rsquo;s worth of activity in a day"" when someone like Eliezer or Ozy signal boosts them. An aggregator would be a useful way for less well known blogs to get attention.</p>
<p>-- Help the lesswrong wiki. Currently a decent fraction of lw-wiki posts are fairly out of date. In general the wiki could be doing some exciting thing such as: a distillation of Lesswrong. Fully indexing the diaspora. A list of communities. Spreading rationalist ideas. Rationalist Research. There is currently a project to modernize the wiki <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/p4y/the_rationalistsphere_and_the_less_wrong_wiki/"">[6]</a>. Even if you don't get involved in the more ambitious parts of the wiki you could re-write an article. Re-writing an article doesn't require much commitment and would provide a concrete benefit to the community. The wiki is prominently linked and the community would get a lot of good PR from a polished wiki.</p>
<p>-- Get involved with effective altruism. The Center for Effective Altruism recent posted a very high quality involvement guide <a href=""https://www.effectivealtruism.org/get-involved/"">[7]</a>. It&rsquo;s a huge list of concrete actions you can take to get involved. Every action has a brief description and a link to an article. Each article rates the action on time commitment, duration, familiarity and occupation. Very well put together.</p>
<p>-- Get more involved in your local irl rationalist group. Many group leaders (ex: Vanier) have suggested that it can be very hard to get members to lead things. If you are interested in leadership and have a decent reputation your local community might need your help.</p>
<p>I would be very interested in comments suggesting other projects/activities rationalists can get involved with.</p>
<p>3) Conclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a brief aside I want to mention that I considered writing about outreach. But I don't have tons of experience at outreach and I couldn't really process the data on effective outreach. The subject seems quite complicated. Perhaps someone else has already worked through the evidence. I will however recommend this old article by Paul Christiano (now at open AI) <a href=""/lw/4v5/effective_rationality_outreach/"">[8]</a>. Notably the camp discussed in this pos did come eventually come into being. It&rsquo;s not a comprehensive article but it has some good ideas. This guide to &ldquo;How to Run a Successful Less Wrong Meetup&rdquo; <a href=""/lw/crs/how_to_run_a_successful_less_wrong_meetup/"">[9]</a> is extremely polished and has some interesting material related to outreach and attracting new members.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to think your actions can't make a difference in the community, but they can. A surprisingly large number of people see comments on lesswrong or r/SSC. Good comments are highly appreciated. The person you befriend and convince to stick around on lesswrong might be the next Scott Alexander. Unfortunately, a lot of the time gratitude and appreciation never gets expressed; I am personally very guilty on this metric. But we are all in this together and this article only covers a small sample of the ways you can help make the community better.</p>
<p>If you have feedback or want any advice/help and don't want to post in public I would be super happy to get your private messages.</p>
<p>4) TLDR</p>
<p>- Write more comments on blog posts and non-controversial posts on lw and r/SSC</p>
<p>- Especially consider commenting on posts you agree with</p>
<p>- People are more likely to comment if other people are posting high quality comments.</p>
<p>- Projects: Gaming Server, aggregate tumblr effort-posts, improve lesswrong wiki, leadership local rationalist group</p>

It's pretty obvious in retrospect, but I haven't seen it posted before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When thinking about what friendly AI should do, one big source of difficulty is that the inputs are supposed to be human intuitions, based on our coarse-grained and confused world models. While the AI's actions are supposed to be fine-grained actions based on the true nature of the universe, which can turn out very weird. That leads to a messy problem of translating preferences from one domain to another, which crops up everywhere in FAI thinking,&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/6ha/the_blueminimizing_robot/4gsa"">Wei's comment</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/rescue_utility/"">Eliezer's writeup</a> are good places to start.</p>
<p>What I just realized is that you can handwave the problem away, by imagining a universe whose true nature agrees with human intuitions by fiat. Think of it as a coarse-grained virtual reality where everything is built from polygons and textures instead of atoms, and all interactions between objects are explicitly coded. It would contain player avatars, controlled by ordinary human brains sitting outside the simulation (so the simulation doesn't even need to support thought).</p>
<p>The FAI-relevant question is: How hard is it to describe a coarse-grained VR utopia that you would agree to live in?</p>
<p>If describing such a utopia is feasible at all, it involves thinking about only human-scale experiences, not physics or tech. So in theory we could hand it off to human philosophers or some other human-based procedure, thus dealing with ""complexity of value"" without much risk. Then we could launch a powerful AI aimed at rebuilding reality to match it (more concretely, making the world's conscious experiences match a specific coarse-grained VR utopia, without any extra hidden suffering). That's still a very hard task, because it requires solving decision theory and the problem of consciousness, but it seems more manageable than solving friendliness completely. The resulting world would be suboptimal in many ways, e.g. it wouldn't have much room for science or self-modification, but it might be enough to avert AI disaster (!)</p>
<p>I'm not proposing this as a plan for FAI, because we can probably come up with something better. But what do you think of it as a thought experiment? Is it a useful way to split up the problem, separating the complexity of human values from the complexity of non-human nature?</p>",cousin_it,cousin_it,cousin_it,
BaGtXmTT58prATuNJ,Lloyd's of London and less-than-catastrophic risk,lloyd-s-of-london-and-less-than-catastrophic-risk,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BaGtXmTT58prATuNJ/lloyd-s-of-london-and-less-than-catastrophic-risk,2017-06-14T02:49:58.254Z,2,2,7,False,False,,"<p>I recently found that&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_of_London"">Lloyd's</a>&nbsp;has a number of interesting resources on risk. One is the <a href=""https://www.lloyds.com/cityriskindex/"">City Risk Index</a>, the methodology for which comes from Cambridge's <a href=""http://cambridgeriskframework.com/wcr"">Judge Business School</a>.</p>
<p>The key metric is something they call GDP@Risk. Despite the name, it is not simply an application of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk"">Value@Risk</a> to GDP. Instead, it is simply the sum of the <em>expected</em> damage from a given threat (or from a set of threats) during a given time period. In this case, the time period is 2015-2015. The threats considered include manmade ones (e.g., cyber attack, oil price shock) and natural ones (e.g., drought, solar storm). The site includes <a href=""https://www.lloyds.com/cityriskindex/threats/case_studies"">brief case studies for the threats</a>. For example, the ""plant epidemic"" study focuses on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium_oxysporum_f.sp._cubense"">the demise of the Gros Michel banana</a>:</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Event</strong>:&nbsp;Panama disease outbreak, 1950s</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Location</strong>:&nbsp;Latin America</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Economic cost</strong>:&nbsp;Estimated losses across Latin America were around $400m ($2.3bn today) although this figure does not include any of the economic losses caused by unemployment, abandoned villages and unrealised income in the affected region.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Description</strong>:&nbsp;The&nbsp;Fusarium oxysporum cubense&nbsp;fungus was first diagnosed in Panama but quickly travelled across Central America.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Damage</strong>:&nbsp;The disease wiped out the Gros Michel banana, the principal cultivar at the time, from plantations across the region. Between 1940 and 1960, around 30,000 hectares of Gros Michel plantations were lost in the Ulua Valley of Honduras, and in a decade 10,000 hectares were lost in Suriname and the Quepos area of Costa Rica.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Insight</strong>:&nbsp;Gros Michel was replaced in the 1960s by Cavendish, a variety thought to be resistant to the disease. However, a new strain of the pathogen was found to be attacking Cavendish plantations in Southeast Asia in the early 1990s. It has since spread, destroying tens of thousands of hectares across Indonesia and Malaysia, and costing more than $400m in the Philippines alone. There is concern that it could reach Central America and destroy up to 85% of the world&rsquo;s banana crop. Solutions to contain the disease could include increasing genetic diversity among banana cultivars and developing hybrid varieties with stronger resistance.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the site quantifies risks from these threats at the city level. So which cities are the most at risk from a plant epidemic? <a href=""https://www.lloyds.com/cityriskindex/threats/plant_epidemic"">They're all in APAC</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hong Kong ($3.83b)</li>
<li>Shanghai ($2.89b)</li>
<li>Beijing ($2.38b)</li>
<li>Bangkok ($2.22b)</li>
<li>Jakarta ($2.09b)</li>
</ul>
<p>These account for 1/6 of the plant-epidemic risk across all 301 cities ($75b).</p>
<p>Which cities are the most ""at risk,"" all threats considered? Once again, APAC dominates, <a href=""https://www.lloyds.com/cityriskindex/threats"">but with a different set of cities</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taipei</li>
<li>Tokyo</li>
<li>Seoul</li>
<li>Manila</li>
<li>New York (not APAC of course)</li>

<p>This kind of information is interesting. It may even be useful as an approximate indication of where to focus risk mitigation efforts. But without more detail (probability distributions? second-order interaction effects? etc.) it's hard to see what role it would play in a serious risk analysis, existential or commercial or otherwise.</p>
<p>Coda: Despite their application to less-than-existential risks and the superficiality of this particular resource (it is a marketing tool for Lloyd's, after all), perhaps existential riskologists could benefit from looking at the insurance industry.

<p>Short Version: Strongly endorse the game, the best Persona experience yet, but in the most important ways Persona 3 is still the best. If you would consider playing a Persona game, you should play one.</p>
<p>There are some minor spoilers here because it&#8217;s impossible to review a game without them, but I have done my best to make sure none of them impact the game experience. The tips at the end strike a balance between minor spoilers and helping you get the most out of the game.</p>
<p><span id=""more-6641""></span></p>
<p><strong>Persona in General (Skip if you have played Persona 3, 4 or 5)</strong></p>
<p>Playing a Persona game is a big commitment. A lot of what the games do is immerse you in their world and what it feels like to inhabit the life of the main character, and build his relationships with other characters. The passage of time, both in game time and real world clock time, is integral to that. Persona 5 does not need 100 hours to make its point (and I could have cut 10 of those out by doing less unnecessary grinding), but I think it genuinely does need 50.</p>
<p>The basic mechanic of Persona is that you decide how to spend each afternoon and each evening. You can spend that time in a variety of ways, all of them beneficial, and the game&#8217;s key events happen on their own schedule no matter what you do, so your time is precious. The two key types of actions are going into dungeons (the game can call them whatever it wants, they&#8217;re still dungeons), and doing everything else, where you are preparing for those dungeons.</p>
<p>In the dungeons, which in this game are called palaces, you are trying to accomplish as much as possible each trip. You want to gain as many levels and make as much money as possible, and get through as much of the palace as possible, so you don&#8217;t waste extra days you can use for something else. The combat is a lot like other RPGs, with the unique mechanic being the main character&#8217;s personas.</p>
<p>You get various personas in combat (and can pay to get back one you have had in the past), and can then combine them to make new personas. Your persona determines your attributes, which elements you are strong and weak to, and what skills (basically spells) you can use. You will be trying to keep your personas strong, which means continuously combining them into higher level personas, while keeping access to a variety of valuable skills, combining the need for different elements, hitting single and multiple targets, and having low cost and high cost versions so you pull out the big guns if and only if you need them. There are other things to think about as well. It has lots of interesting trade-offs and is quite the puzzle.</p>
<p>Outside of the dungeons, your primary concern is to deepen your connection (links) to a variety of confidants, which brings you a variety of benefits. You will also need to raise your five life skill levels, since there are threshold requirements to various actions including many confidants. You want to take efficient actions to improve your skills and links, and plan so that you always can take an efficient action each afternoon and each evening. You can only get each confidant to level 10, and each life skill to level 5, and only some of your best options are available each turn, so you want to spread your efforts around to avoid wasting time later, but you want to focus your efforts to unlock important benefits faster.</p>
<p>The most annoying part of the game is that you will often be presented with dialog choices during these events, with some choices being right and giving you more points, and others being bad and giving you less or no points. Sometimes all the choices give no points, so you can&#8217;t ever be sure you did anything wrong unless you reload and check all the choices, or look online. If you don&#8217;t maximize on these choices, it will make these choices more meaningful, but it will cost you a huge amount of time and you will miss out on some of the story (and the dungeons will be harder). It is up to you whether to look up the right answers online.</p>
<p>All Persona games follow the same core structure, and impart a lot of the same lessons and experiences. If you have played one before, you have a good idea if you want to play another.</p>
<p><strong>Is Persona Worthwhile?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I think these games are pretty great. They come together in a way that is far more than the sum of their parts. However, you do have to enjoy and be invested in both major sections of the game, or you will spend a lot of hours on things you do not enjoy, and that isn&#8217;t worth it. A lot of Persona is effectively a TV series that has interactive elements, and if you don&#8217;t want to watch that show, then the games aren&#8217;t worth it. A lot of the other half is about grinding as efficiently as possible. The games do a lot of interesting things with this, but if you do not want to spend a lot of time trying to win RPG-style fights as efficiently as possible and working on the persona puzzle, then again the games are not right for you. Both halves are done quite well, but both need to work for you.</p>
<p>If both halves do work, and you buy in, the payoff is pretty great. If approached in the right way, the games can even inspire you to improve your life. Persona well played is time well spent.</p>
<p>The argument against playing (other than simply not enjoying it, once you try it) is long game is long and life is short.</p>
<p><strong>How does Persona 5 compare to Persona 3 and Persona 4? What is different?</strong></p>
<p>Persona 5 is a more modern and polished game, in addition to being for a more advanced system and having better graphics. That is mostly good, but not entirely.</p>
<p>There are some important flaws in the past games that have been fixed.</p>
<p>Fast travel has been improved, and makes it much easier to get where you want to go. The central map tells you which confidants are available each turn, and which of them would level up if you spent time with them, which saves a lot of otherwise wasted time. The confidants themselves will even text you to let you know they are available, which is great.</p>
<p>The confidants now grant you thematic abilities as you level them up, in addition to the boost to Persona fusion, making them distinct so your choices matter and you get more meaningful rewards.</p>
<p>When you fuse personas, you used to have to constantly re-roll the result until you figured out what was possible, and then do it again until you got the combination you wanted, which was quite frustrating, whereas in Persona 5 you get to choose the outcome. Fusion by result also gives you an easier way to see what is possible.</p>
<p>Getting your personas by negotiating with the enemies you fight, rather than with a card game you play after the battle, feels and plays much better. This isn&#8217;t costless, but it is definitely worth it.</p>
<p>When you study, you no longer randomly sometimes get double the effect. This used to force you to either reset repeatedly or accept the loss of time, so this is quite a welcome change.</p>
<p>The dungeons/palaces are now mostly designed rather than random, which makes them richer and more interesting places to travel through. The extra effort is appreciated, especially when it gets contrasted with the random dungeons the game still has.</p>
<p>The game will be clear when you are making important choices, and even double check with you if you are about to do something consequential the game does not expect.</p>
<p>The move to eliminate wasted time and make your actions more impactful is appreciated. If there was one change I would make to the game, it would be to do more things along these lines, skipping other things that are too repetitive once you had seen them enough times, and eliminating the last few random elements (crafting infiltration tools and strengthening personas, both of which still have random outcomes for no good reason).</p>
<p>Similarly, while Momentos (a huge random dungeon you can go to at any time) is in some ways a good idea, the fact that you are trying to minimize days spent there, and the huge number of levels to get through, means you end up spending lots of time against enemies that pose no threat to you, in gigantic chunks. The place is <em>way </em>too large, and could do with some amount of scaling to player level or getting harder over time.</p>
<p>I see three downsides to Persona 5 when comparing it to previous efforts.</p>
<p>The first is that the game makes time management too easy, and the later combat too easy.</p>
<p>I was maximizing my responses, but not otherwise doing too great a job, and still managed to maximize all the confidants with a substantial buffer at the end. In the past that required you to plan carefully and play close to optimally, but now it only requires that you follow some basic principles, and that makes the whole optimization puzzle feel a lot less pressing. In many places, you can trade money for time, and the game gives you a lot of money once you get into the mid-game. Persona 3 was the opposite, where you were always strapped for cash and had to make difficult choices. That went slightly too far, but was much better. Persona 4 was somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Early on, the combat is challenging, but later in the game it became increasingly difficult to die even without much grinding, provided you were doing well with the confidants and knew what personas to aim for. By the late game, it was easy to not only win combats safely but to do so without spending resources. Persona 3 and 4 both made this much harder, and provided a real challenge. This problem can be solved by playing on a harder difficulty level, so to some extent I suppose I have no one to blame but myself, and I will simply recommend moving up a difficulty level after the first few months, and not giving yourself permission to grind.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the game contains a number of &#8216;puzzles&#8217; that seem like the game making work for you. Some of them can be cute or interesting, but they did sometimes feel like busywork and took me out of the experience. It is hard for a non-puzzle game to do puzzles that are worth your time. Similarly, often the actual puzzle was &#8216;find the place to press the button&#8217; which is not especially fun.</p>
<p>The third problem is the central theme, where they still have not matched the high bar they set with Persona 3. They do pull off what they are going for, and I was not disappointed by where they went with things, but things still seem amiss. I do not want to get into spoilers for any of the games here (I may write a spoiler-rich version that does). I will say that I found some elements of what was going on, and the message that was being sent, to be disturbing, and its presence to be saying something deeply troubling about where we are as a culture and civilization. The more I reflected on it, the more something was <em>wrong </em>in a deep way, but I don&#8217;t want to say any more than that. Spoilers, and all that. After all it is up to the player to draw their own conclusions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Which Persona to Play?</strong></p>
<p>There are no spoilers across games, so you can play them in any order, but they benefit from being played in order. As with most series, once you see the slicker and smoother later interface, it becomes much harder to put up with the flaws in earlier games, and there are some nice payoffs for prior knowledge in Persona 5. If you knew you were going to play all three, I would say to go in order, and take substantial breaks between the games, at least several months each.</p>
<p>All three is a three hundred hour journey, so most will simply want to know which game is best if you only play one. I know it is <em>not </em>Persona 4; that is quite a good game, but also clearly dominated by your other choices. I would say that the best game <em>to play </em>is Persona 5, but the best game <em>to have played </em>is Persona 3. Persona 5 has higher Quality, and a smoother experience, as our ability to make games improves over the years, but Persona 3 is a bigger, more important game and a better and more important message (and finale). Persona 5 is just too much better of an experience minute to minute for me to tell you to go back into the past&#8230; but I want to do that anyway. Especially if you are still impressionable, at-risk youth.</p>
<p>You can be the judge, having heard that, of which game is right for you, or whether to continue the series if you have played before.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for Maximum Enjoyment</strong></p>
<p>Note that while these tips will help you win, I did not say tips for winning. If you want tips purely for winning or you want to go trophy hunting, read an FAQ or other online guide. This is a series of heuristics and house rules that will help you make the most of your experience, which does involve doing well and finishing the game, but does not mean maximizing every little thing. It <em>does </em>mean giving you some important tips for what to prioritize, but I won&#8217;t explain why so as not to spoil things.</p>
<p>Play on either Average or Hard difficulty level, and consider starting on Average and moving up to Hard a few months in.</p>
<p>It is fine to go online if you spend many minutes and can&#8217;t find the vent they want you to crawl through or place they want you to click on. Don&#8217;t give up right away, but life is short.</p>
<p>When you have a trade-off between money and time (the explicit trade-off will be money and life stats, or money and confidant points, which is the same thing), you usually want to spend the money and save the time, but do not feel obligated to spend 5,000 yen on a single extra point early in the game, as you will get better opportunities. Money starts off tight and you have some key big purchases later.</p>
<p>By contrast, you want to focus on making money from fights rather than getting items.</p>
<p>Always be fusing new Personas and keep higher base level Personas in your arsenal, rather than trying to level up those that start out lower level. Using those that start lower level will cause you problems down the line.</p>
<p>Keeping a wide array of low-SP elemental spells is important, to preserve SP. The really big late game guns aren&#8217;t even that good.</p>
<p>While you need to preserve SP, and you should not avoid fights, you should not need to double back and seek out extra fights in order to grind, nor should you need to grind extra in Momentos. Shin Megami Tensei games in general, and Persona in particular, punish you <em>hard </em>for trying to grind beyond where you are &#8216;supposed&#8217; to be, so don&#8217;t waste your (real world) time doing that.</p>
<p>Having a matching persona for confidants you hang out with is almost always worth it, to the extent that you likely shouldn&#8217;t spend time with them if you don&#8217;t have one.</p>
<p>Choose the extent to which you will be using guides for the choices you make. The game is still highly winnable if you make choices blind and stick with them, and it makes the experience better in many ways.</p>
<p>If you can level up a confidant, that is almost always time well spent. If you spend time with a confidant without leveling them up, that is sometimes necessary later in the game, but is by default not time well spent.</p>
<p>When you get the ability to go out at night, you need to do certain things or you will lose a key confidant permanently. It&#8217;s not hard to figure out what to do, but you need to know that this is time sensitive.</p>
<p>The most important confidants to level up quickly are Sun, Temperance and Fortune. All three should be pursued whenever you can. Arguments can also be made for Moon, Star, Strength and Death. You will likely need a guide to get Strength 10, which is a huge jump in your power level when you get it.</p>

<p>For people not acquainted with me, <a href=""https://twitter.com/Deku_shrub"">I'm Deku-shrub</a>, often known online for <a href=""https://pirate.london/tagged/dark-web"">my cybercrime research</a>, as well as fairly heavy involvement in the global transhumanist movement with projects like the <a href=""http://transhumanistparty.org.uk/"">UK Transhumanist Party</a> and <a href=""https://hpluspedia.org/"">the H+Pedia wiki</a>.</p>
<p>For almost 2 years year now on and off I have been trying to grok what Less Wrong is about, but I've shirked reading all the sequences end to end, instead focused on the most popular ideas transmitted by Internet cultural osmosis. I'm an amateur sociologist and understanding Less Wrong falls within my wider project of understanding the <a href=""https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_futurist_related_ideas_and_positions"">different trends</a> within the contemporary and <a href=""https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/History_of_transhumanism"">historical</a> transhumanist movement.</p>
<p>I'm very keen to pin down today's shape of <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement"">the rationalistsphere</a> <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Criticisms_of_the_rationalist_movement"">and its critics</a>, and the best place I have found do this is on the wiki. Utilising <a href=""https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/H%2BPedia:Cunningham%27s_Law"">Cunningham's Law</a> at times, I've been building some key navigational and primer articles on the wiki. However with the very lowest hanging fruit now addressed I ask - what next for the wiki?</p>
<h2>Distillation of Less Wrong<br /></h2>
<p>There was a historical attempt to <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Category:Resource_lists"">summerise all major Less Wrong posts</a>, an interesting but incomplete project. It was also approach without a usefully normalised approach. Ideally, every article would have its own page which could be heavily tagged up with metadata such a themes, importance, length, quality, author and such. Is this the goal of the wiki?</p>
<h2>Outreach and communications<br /></h2>
<p>Another major project is to fully index <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Diaspora#Diaspora"">the Diaspora</a> across <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/d92/less_wrong_on_twitter/"">Twitter</a>, <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/List_of_Blogs"">Blogs</a>, <a href=""https://rationalist-masterlist.tumblr.com/post/130139930539/rationalist-masterlist"">Tumblr</a>, <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reddit"">Reddit</a>, <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Facebook"">Facebook</a> etc and improve the flow of information between the relevant sub communities.</p>
<p>You'll probably want to join <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Chat"">one of the chat platforms</a> if you're interested in getting involved. Hell, there are even <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Frustrated_Lesswrong_Guy"">a few memes</a> and probably more to collect.</p>
<h2>Rationalist research</h2>
<p>I'll admit I'm ignorant of the goal of Arbital, but I do love me a wiki for research. Cross referencing and citing ideas, merging, splitting, identifying and fully capturing truly interesting and useful ideas from fanciful and fleeting ones is how I've become an expert in a number fields, just by being the first to assemble All The Things.</p>
<p>Certain ideas like the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paper_clip_maximizer"">Paper clip maximizer</a> have some popularity beyond just Less Wrong, but <a title=""Murder Gandhi"" href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/index.php?title=Murder_Gandhi&amp;redirect=no"">Murder Gandhi</a> doesn't - yet. Polishing these ideas with existing and external references (and maybe blogging about them?) is a great way for the community discussion of yore to make its way into the publications of lazy journalists for dissemination. Hell, <a href=""https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/RationalWiki"">RationalWiki has been doing it for years</a> now, they're not the only game in town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any ideas in these areas, or others just a technical, let me know either here, on the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_Slack"">Less Wrong Slack group</a>, or <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/User_talk:Deku-shrub"">on my talk page</a> and maybe we can make Wikis Great Again? ;)</p>",Deku-shrub,deku-shrub,Deku-shrub,

I was surprised at my blunder considering that Yudkowsky is far from an authority figure on Physics, and even if he was I was not unaware of Huxley's maxim:</p>

FUrthermore, around the time after I was introduced to RAZ (and the lesswrong website) I started following RAZ with more fervour than I ever did the Bible; I went as far as to&mdash;on multiple occasions&mdash;proclaim:</p>

It's true that there is a tail risk of experiencing one of these outcomes if you choose to undergo cryonics, but it's also true that you risk these events by choosing not to kill yourself right now, or before you are incapacitated by a TBI or neurodegenerative disease. I think these tail risk events are extremely unlikely and I urge you not to kill yourself because you are worried about them, but I also think that they are extremely&nbsp;unlikely in the case of cryonics and I don't think that the possibility of them occurring should stop you from pursuing cryonics.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I</strong></p><p>Several members of the rationalist community have said that they would not want to undergo cryonics on their legal deaths because they are worried about a specific tail risk: that they might be revived in a world that is worse than death, and that doesn't allow them to kill themselves.&nbsp;For example, lukeprog&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/guy/open_thread_march_115_2013/8kin"">mentioned this in a LW comment</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Why am I not signed up for cryonics?</p><p>Here's my model.</p><p>In most futures, everyone is simply dead.</p><p>There's a tiny sliver of futures that are better than that, and a tiny sliver of futures that are worse than that.</p><p>What are the relative sizes of those slivers, and how much more likely am I to be revived in the ""better"" futures than in the ""worse"" futures? I really can't tell.</p><p>I don't seem to be as terrified of death as many people are. A while back I read the Stoics to reduce my fear of death, and it worked. I am, however, very averse to being revived into a worse-than-death future and not being able to escape.</p><p>I bet the hassle and cost of cryonics disincentivizes me, too, but when I boot up my internal simulator and simulate a world where cryonics is free, and obtained via a 10-question Google form, I still don't sign up. I ask to be cremated instead.</p><p>Cryonics may be reasonable for someone who is more averse to death and&nbsp;less&nbsp;averse to worse-than-death outcomes than I am. Cryonics may also be reasonable for someone who has strong reasons to believe they are more likely to be revived in better-than-death futures than in worse-than-death futures. Finally, there may be a fundamental error in my model.</p></blockquote><p>#####</p><p>In this post I'm going to explain why I think that, with a few stipulations, the risks of these worse-than-death tail events occurring are close to what you might experience by choosing to undergo your natural lifespan. Therefore, based on revealed preference, in my opinion they are not a good reason for most people to not undergo cryonics. (Although there are, of course, several other reasons for which you might choose to not pursue cryonics, which will not be discussed here.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>II</strong></p><p>First, some points about the general landscape of the problem, which you are welcome to disagree with:&nbsp;</p><p>- In most futures, I expect that you will still be able to kill yourself. In these scenarios, it's at least worth seeing what the future world will be like so you can decide whether or not it is worth it for you. &nbsp;</p><p>- Therefore, worse-than-death futures are exclusively ones in which you are not able to kill yourself. Here are two commonly discussed scenarios for this, and why I think they are unlikely: &nbsp;</p><p>-- <i>You are revived as a slave for a future society</i>. This is very unlikely for economic reasons: a society with sufficiently advanced technology that it can revive cryonics patients can almost certainly extend lifespan indefinitely and create additional humans at low cost. If society is evil enough to do this, then creating additional humans as slaves is going to be cheaper than reviving old ones with a complicated technology that might not work.&nbsp;</p><p>-- <i>You are revived specifically by a malevolent society/AI that is motivated to torture humans</i>. This is unlikely for scope reasons: any society/AI with sufficiently advanced technology to do this can create/simulate additional persons that will to fit their interests more precisely. For example, an unfriendly AI would likely simulate all possible human/animal/sentient minds until the heat death of the universe, using up all available resources in the universe in order to do so. Your mind, and minds very similar to yours, would already likely be included in these simulations many times over. In this case, doing cryonics would not actually make you worse off. (Although of course you would already be quite badly off and we should definitely try our best to avoid this extremely unlikely scenario!)&nbsp;</p><p>If you are worried about a particular scenario, you can stipulate to your cryonics organization that you would like to be removed from preservation in intermediate steps that make that scenario more likely, thus substantially reducing the risk of them occurring. For example, you might say:&nbsp;</p><p>- If a fascist government that tortures its citizens indefinitely and doesn't allow them to kill themselves seems likely to take over the world, please cremate me.&nbsp;</p><p>- If an alien spaceship with likely malicious intentions approaches the earth, please cremate me.&nbsp;</p><p>- If a sociopath creates an AI that is taking over foreign cities and torturing their inhabitants, please cremate me.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, you probably wouldn't have to ask... in most of these scenarios, the cryonics organization is likely to remove you from preservation in order to protect you from these bad outcomes out of compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But even with such a set of stipulations or compassionate treatment by your cryonics organization, it's still possible that you could be revived in a worse-than-death scenario. As&nbsp;<a href=""/r/discussion/lw/lrf/can_we_decrease_the_risk_of_worsethandeath/c0fe"">Brian Tomasik puts it</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;Yeah, that would help, though there would remain many cases where bad futures come too quickly (e.g., if an AGI takes a treacherous turn all of a sudden).</p><p>However, here I would like to point out an additional point: there's no guarantee that these bad scenarios couldn't happen too quickly for you to react today, or in the future before your legal death.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're significantly worried about worse than death outcomes happening in a possible future in which you are cryopreserved, then it seems like you should also be worried about one of them happening in the relatively near term as well. It also seems that you should be anti-natalist.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III</strong></p><p>You might argue that this&nbsp;is&nbsp;still your true rejection, and that while it's true that a faster-than-react-able malevolent agent could take over the world now or in the near future, you would rather trust yourself to kill yourself than trust your cryonics organization take you out of preservation in these scenarios.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a reasonable response, but one possibility that you might not be considering is that you might undergo a condition that renders you unable to make that decision.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, people can live for decades with traumatic brain injuries, with neurodegenerative diseases, in comas, or other conditions that prevent them from making the decision to kill themselves but retain core aspects of their memories personality that make them ""them"" (but perhaps is not accessible because of damage to communication systems in the brain). If aging is slowed, these incapacitating conditions could last for longer periods of time.&nbsp;</p><p>It's possible that while you're incapacitated by one of these unfortunate conditions, a fascist government, evil aliens, or a malevolent AI will take over.&nbsp;</p><p>These incapacitating conditions are each somewhat unlikely to occur, but if we're talking about tail events, they deserve consideration. And they aren't necessarily&nbsp;less&nbsp;unlikely than being revived from cryostasis, which is of course also far from guaranteed to work.</p><p>It might sound like my point here is ""cryonics: maybe not that much worse than living for years in a completely incapacitating coma?"", which is not necessarily the most ringing endorsement of cryonics, I admit.&nbsp;</p><p>But my main point here is that your revealed preferences might indicate that you are more willing to tolerate some very, very small probability of things going horribly&nbsp;wrong&nbsp;than you realize.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you're OK with the risk that you will end up in a worse-than-death scenario even before you do cryonics, then you may also be OK with the risk that you will end up in a worse-than-death scenario after you are preserved via cryonics (both of which seem very, very small to me). Choosing cryonics doesn't ""open up"" this tail risk that is very bad and would never occur otherwise. It already exists.&nbsp;</p>",Synaptic,synaptic,Synaptic,

Spartans were devoted to duty and country, living in barracks and drinking the black broth. From birth they trained to be the caste dictators of a slaveowning society, which would annually slay slaves to forestall a rebellion. The most famous Spartan is Leonidas, who died in a heroic last stand delaying the invasion of the Persians. To be a Spartan was to live a life devoted to toughness and duty.</p>
<p>Famous Athenians are Herodotus, inventor of history, Thucydides, Socrates, Plato, Hippocrates of the oath medical students still take, all the Greek playwrights, etc. &nbsp;Attic Greek is the Greek we learn in our Classics courses. Athens was a city where the students of the entire known Greek world would come to learn from the masters, a maritime empire with hundreds of resident aliens, where slavery was comparable to that of the Romans. Luxury apartments, planned subdivisions, sexual hedonism, and free trade made up the life of the Athenian elite.</p>
<p>These two cities had deeply incompatible values. Spartans lived in fear that the Helots would rebel and kill them. Deeply suspicious of strangers, they imposed oligarchies upon the cities they conquered. They were described by themselves and others cautious and slow to act. Athenians by contrast prized speed and risk in their enterprises. Foreigners could live freely in Athens and even established their own temples. Master and slave comedies of Athens inspired PG Woodhouse.</p>
<p>All intellectual communities are Athenian in outlook. We remember Sparta for its killing and Athens for its art. If we want the rationalist community to tackle the hard problems, if we support a world that is supportive of human values and beauty, if we yearn to end the plagues of humanity, our values should be Athenian: individualistic, open, trusting, enamoured of beauty. When we build social technology, it should not aim to cultivate values that stand against these.</p>
<p>High trust, open, societies are the societies where human lives are most improved. Beyond merely being refugees for the persecuted they become havens for intellectual discussion and the improvement of human knowledge and practice. It is not a coincidence that one city produced Spinoza, Rubens, Rembrandt, van Dyke, Huygens, van Leeuwenhoek, and Grotius in a few short decades, while dominating the seas and being open to refugees.</p>
<p>Sadly we seem to have lost sight of this in the rationality community. Increasingly we are losing touch as a community with the outside intellectual world, without the impetus to study what has been done before and what the research lines are in statistics, ML, AI, epistemology, biology, etc. While we express that these things are important, the conversation doesn't seem to center around the actual content of these developments. In some cases (statistics) we're actively hostile to understanding some of the developments and limitations of our approach as a matter of tribal marker.</p>
<p>Some projects seem to me to be likely to worsen this, either because they express Spartan values or because they further physical isolation in ways that will act to create more small-group identification.</p>
<p>What can we do about this? Holiday modifications might help with reminding us of our values, but I don't know how we can change the community's outlook more directly. We should strive to stop merely acting on the meta-level and try to act on the object level more as a community.

<li>By epistemy, I refer to to the second meaning of <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epistemology"">epistemology in the wiktionary</a>&nbsp;(ie, a particular theory of knowledge). Polysemy is bad and should be fixed when possible.</li>
<li>By episteme, I mean the knowledge and understanding of a given science at a given point in time.</li>
<li>By field, I mean a set of related thoughts. A science is a field with an epistemy.</li>
<li>Epistemy comes from ""<a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ἐ&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;ή&mu;&eta;"">epistimi</a>"", meaning science. I like the identification of a science with its epistemy.</li>

<h1>Epistemies work.</h1>
<h2>General approaches don't work.</h2>
<p>Model-checking, validity and proof-search can be hard. Like, NP, PSPACE, non-elementary hard or even undecidable. Particularly, validity of propositions in first-order logic is undecidable.</p>
<p>Our propositions about the world are more complex than what's described by first order logic. Making it impossible to prove validity of propositions in the general case. As such, trying to find a general logic to deal with the world (ie, critical thinking) is energy badly spent.</p>
<h2>Specific approaches work.</h2>
<p>This problem has been answered in fields relying on logic. For instance : model checking, type theory or not-statistical computational linguistics. The standard answer is finding specialized and efficiently computable logics.</p>
<p>However, not every field can afford a full formalization. At least, as humans studying the world, we can't. Epistemies can be seen as detailed informal efficient logics. They give us a particular way to study some particular thing, just like logics. They don't provide <em>mathematical</em>&nbsp;guarantees, but they still can offer guarantees.</p>
<p>Science faced that problem, as the study of world by humans. However, critical thinking wasn't enough. That's partly why we moved from philosophy to sciences. The Science solution was to subdivide the world into several overlapping-but-independently-experimentable parts.</p>
<p>Thus, rather than by its object of study, a science is defined by a combination of its object of study and its epistemy. This explains why 3 different articles studying logic can be discriminated by their science : to Philosophy, Math and Theoretical Computer Science.</p>
<h1>Implications.</h1>
<h2>Stopping redundancy.</h2>
<p>Valuing critical thought led to a high amount of redundancy. Anyone can dump their ideas and have it judged by the community, provided a bit of critical thinking has been done. The core insight being that critical thinking should filter most of the bad ideas.</p>
<p>However, if the subject of the idea relies a bit on a non-epistemied technical field, obfuscating lack of consistency/thorough-thinking becomes very easy. As such, community time is spent finding obvious flaws in a reasoning when the author could do it alone provided there was an appropriate epistemy.</p>
<h2>Epistemic effort.</h2>
<p>As such, before suggesting new models, one should confront it to the standard epistemy of the fields the model belong to. That epistemy can be as simple as some sanity checks, eg : ""Does this model lead to X, Y or Z contradiction ? If it does, it's a bad one. Else, it is a good one."". If there is no standard epistemy in the given field, working on one is critical.</p>
<p>I <a href=""#agree"">agree</a> Raemon's post about <a href=""/lw/o6m/epistemic_effort/"">using ""epistemic effort"" instead of ""epistemic status""</a>. Following the previous line of thought, I think ""epistemic status"" should refer to an epistemic status (and the field relative to which it is defined) instead of the epistemic effort. I see 3 kinds of epistemic status, that could be refined :</p>
<p>1. Pre-epistemy : Thoughts meant to gather comments. Models trying to see if modelling a particular subject is worth it or works well.</p>
<p>2. Epistemy building : Defining the epistemy meta-assumptions. Defining the epistemy logic. Defining the epistemy facts (eg, Which sources are relevant in that field ? Which meta-facts are relevant in that field ?).</p>
<p>3. Post-epistemy : Once the epistemy is defined, anything benefiting the science's episteme. Facts, models, questioning the epistemy (might lead to forks, eg, math and computer science).</p>
<h1>Misc.</h1>
<h2>""Bayesian probabilities""</h2>
<p>Initially, I thought that someone putting a probability in front of a belief had an objective meaning. I asked around for an epistemy, and I have been told that it was only a way to express more precisely a subjective feeling.</p>
<p>However, it looks like there might be a confusion between the map and the territory when I see things like <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/p43/bet_or_update_fixing_the_willtowager_assumption/"">bet-to-update</a>. Because when I see ""Bayesian rational agent"", it feels like we should be supposed to be bayesian rational agents in the general case. (Which I think is an AGI-complete problem.)</p>
<h2>Bayesian framework</h2>
<p>Bayesian rules and its derivatives define the ""proof rules"" part of an agent's epistemy. But axioms are still required, a world, a way to gather facts and such. It also relies on meta-assumption for efficiency and relevancy. Bayesian rules are not enough to define an epistemy.</p>
<p>Therefore, not only I am strongly prejudiced against someone self-describing as a bayesianist because of the ""I apply the same epistemy everywhere""-approach, but also because it isn't a proper epistemy.</p>
<p>There are better ways to say ""I know the Bayes' rule, and how it might apply to real-life situation."" than ""I'm bayesianist"".</p>
<p>Maybe ""bayesianist"" solely means ""I update my beliefs based on evidence"", but I think ""open-minded"" is the right word for that.</p>
<h2>Not even wrong</h2>
<p>Showing not-even-wrong-ness is possible in sciences with an epistemy. (Well, it's possible to show it to people who know that epistemy. Showing someone who don't know maths that his ""informal"" maths aren't even maths is <em>hard</em>.)</p>
<p>In other fields, we are subject to too much not-even-wrong-ness. I'd like to link some LW posts to exemplify my point, but I think it might violate the local <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-Quoras-Be-Nice-Be-Respectful-policy"">BNBR policy</a>.</p>
<h1>Questions</h1>
<p>Do you think defining a meta-epistemy (ie, an epistemy to the Rationalist epistemology) is important ?</p>
<p>Do you think defining sub-epistemies is important ?</p>
<p>If you don't, why ?</p>

For the next 3-4 month, the supply of all the above is going to become much less reliable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not taking a break from writing, quite the opposite: I have taken on two serious writing projects for this summer. I also have to maintain my day job, plan my wedding, and raise a hedgehog. You&#8217;ll see my progress towards the first project on Putanumonit, but there may not be a lot else.</p>
<p>The first project on which I&#8217;m collaborating is writing a guide to human rationality based on the LessWrong Sequences. <a href=""http://putanumonit.com/2016/05/17/rationality/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">I endorsed reading the Sequences themselves</a> for this purpose because they&#8217;re the best guide to rationality that currently exists. But the Sequences are far from perfect: they take on too many subjects that are important but unrelated to human rationality, Eliezer&#8217;s writing style can turn people off, and at 1800+ pages they&#8217;re too damn long.</p>
<p>Also, in the decade since the Sequences were written the Rationality community grew in both numbers and wisdom, no guide to rationality can be complete without the contributions of Scott, Robin and everyone else.</p>
<p>A lot of my readers are exactly the audience that we are targeting &#8211; smart and nerdy people who are sympathetic to the ideas of rationality but were turned off by the core of LessWrong for various reasons. My first contribution to the &#8220;Sequences 2.0&#8221; project is tackling the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Map_and_Territory#B._Fake_Beliefs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Fake Beliefs</a> sequence. As I progress on it I will post chunks on Putanumonit to get feedback from all of you, which will hopefully lead to a better product in the end.</p>
<p>If nothing else, there may at least be some value is trimming down the Sequences to 400 pages and avoiding saying &#8220;so it is written&#8221; and then quoting myself, like Eliezer does. That&#8217;s our minimum standard: LessWrong, LessLong, LessSelfQuoting.</p>
<p>The goal of the first project is to contribute to pure LessWrong rationality. The goal of the second project is to betray it &#8211; I signed up for the <a href=""https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/04/25/one-weird-longform-trick-on-the-blockchain/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ribbonfarm longform refactored perception blogging course</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what refactored perception is, and I don&#8217;t like &#8220;postrationalists&#8221;. I knew that if I wrote about my dislike on the course application I was certain to be accepted, and I was. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll learn and what I&#8217;ll end up writing, but the answer to both is probably &#8220;a lot&#8221;.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: I&#8217;ll be writing a lot this summer while being critiqued and edited by different people with different approaches to thinking and writing. You&#8217;ll see less variety and probably less volume of posts on Putanumonit, but I hope that these projects will help me level up significantly as a writing.</p>
<p>Or, the tension of writing thousands of words of core rationality and post-rationality at the same time will cost me my sanity and gain me a drinking problem, in which case Putanumonit will turn into <a href=""http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this</a>.</p>
<p>Either way, this blog may have a boring summer but an interesting future. Don&#8217;t go anywhere.</p>

<p>This is an example of <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1388"">humans not being (idealised) agents</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine a human who has a preference to not live beyond a hundred years. However, they want to live to next year, and it's predictable that every year they are alive, they will have the same desire to survive till the next year.</p>
<p>This human (not a completely implausible example, I hope!) has a contradiction between their long and short term preferences. So which is accurate? It seems we could resolve these preferences in favour of the short term (""live forever"") or the long term (""die after a century"") preferences.</p>
<p>Now, at this point, maybe we could appeal to meta-preferences - what would the human themselves want, if they could choose? But often these meta-preferences are un- or under-formed, and can be influenced by how the question or debate is framed.</p>
<p>Specifically, suppose we are scheduling this human's agenda. We have the choice of making them meet one of two philosophers (not meeting anyone is not an option). If they meet Professor R. T. Long, he will advise them to follow long term preferences. If instead, they meet Paul Kurtz, he will advise them to pay attention their short term preferences. Whichever one they meet, they will argue for a while and will then settle on the recommended preference resolution. And then they will not change that, whoever they meet subsequently.</p>
<p>Since we are doing the scheduling, we effectively control the human's meta-preferences on this issue. What should we do? And what principles should we use to do so?</p>
<p>It's clear that this can apply to AIs: if they are simultaneously aiding humans as well as learning their preferences, they will have multiple opportunities to do this sort of preference-shaping.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

Since then, deep learning took off, AlphaGo beat human Go champions, and the field has generally progressed. I’ve been waiting for a new survey for a while, and now we have one.</p><p>Grace et al (New Scientist article, paper, see also the post on the author’s blog AI Impacts) surveyed 1634 experts at major AI conferences and received 352 responses. Unlike Bostrom’s survey, this didn’t oversample experts at weird futurist conferences and seems to be a pretty good cross-section of mainstream opinion in the field. What did they think?</p><p>Well, a lot of different things.</p><p>The headline result: the researchers asked experts for their probabilities that we would get AI that was “able to accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers”. The experts thought on average there was a 50% chance of this happening by 2062 – and a 10% chance of it happening by 2026!</p><p>But on its own this is a bit misleading. They also asked by what year “for any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers”. The experts thought on average that there was a 50% chance of this happening by 2139, and a 20% chance of it happening by 2037.</p><p>As the authors point out, these two questions are basically the same – they were put in just to test if there was any framing effect. The framing effect was apparently strong enough to shift the median date of strong human-level AI from 2062 to 2139. This makes it hard to argue AI experts actually have a strong opinion on this.</p><p>Also, these averages are deceptive. Several experts thought there was basically a 100% chance of strong AI by 2035; others thought there was only a 20% chance or less by 2100. This is less “AI experts have spoken and it will happen in 2062” and more “AI experts have spoken, and everything they say contradicts each other and quite often themselves”.</p><p>This does convey more than zero information. It conveys the information that AI researchers are really unsure. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve heard say “there’s no serious AI researcher who thinks there’s any chance of human-level intelligence before 2050”. Well actually, there are a few dozen conference-paper-presenting experts who think there’s a one hundred percent chance of human-level AI before that year. I don’t know what drugs they’re on, but they exist. The moral of the story is: be less certain about this kind of thing.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>The next thing we can take from this paper is a timeline of what will happen when. The authors give a bunch of different tasks, jobs, and milestones, and ask the researchers when AI will be able to complete them. Average answers range from nearly fifty years off (for machines being able to do original high-level mathematical research) to only three years away (for machines achieving the venerable accomplishment of being able to outperform humans at Angry Birds). Along the way they’ll beat humans at poker (four years), writing high school essays (ten years), be able to outrun humans in a 5K foot race (12 years), and write a New York Times bestseller (26 years). What do these AI researchers think is the hardest and most quintessentially human of the tasks listed, the one robots will have the most trouble doing because of its Olympian intellectual requirements? That’s right – AI research (80 years).</p><p>I make fun of this, but it’s actually interesting to think about. Might the AI researchers have put their own job last not because of an inflated sense of their own importance, but because they engage with it every day in Near Mode? That is, because they imagine writing a New York Times bestseller as “something something pen paper be good with words okay done” whereas they understand the complexity of AI research and how excruciatingly hard it would be to automate away every piece of what they do?</p><p>Also, since they rated AI research (80 years) as the hardest of all occupations, what do they mean when they say that “full automation of all human jobs” is 125 years away? Some other job not on the list that will take 40 years longer than AI research? Or just a combination of framing effects and not understanding the question?</p><p>(it’s also unclear to what extent they believe that automating AI research will lead to a feedback loop and subsequent hard takeoff to superintelligence. This kind of theory would fit with it being the last job to be automated, but not with it taking another forty years before an unspecified age of full automation.)</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The last part is the most interesting for me: what do AI researchers believe about risk from superintelligence?</p><p>This is very different from the earlier questions about timelines. It’s possible to believe that AI will come very soon but be perfectly safe. And it’s possible to believe that AI is a long time away but we really need to start preparing now, or else. A lot of popular accounts collapse these two things together, “oh, you’re worried about AI, but that’s dumb because there’s no way it’s going to happen anytime soon”, but past research has shown that short timelines and high risk assessment are only modestly correlated. This survey asked about both separately.</p><p>There were a couple of different questions trying to get at this, but it looks like the most direct one was “does Stuart Russell’s argument for why highly advanced AI might pose a risk, point at an important problem?”. You can see the exact version of his argument quoted in the survey on the AI Impacts page, but it’s basically the standard Bostrom/Yudkowsky argument for why AIs may end up with extreme values contrary to our own, framed in a very normal-sounding and non-threatening way. According to the experts, this was:</p><p>No, not a real problem: 11%</p><p>No, not an important problem: 19%</p><p>Yes, a moderately important problem: 31%</p><p>Yes, an important problem: 34%</p><p>Yes, among the most important problems in the field: 5%</p><p>70% of AI experts agree with the basic argument that there’s a risk from poorly-goal-aligned AI. But very few believe it’s among “the most important problems in the field”. This is pretty surprising; if there’s a good chance AI could be hostile to humans, shouldn’t that automatically be pretty high on the priority list?</p><p>The next question might help explain this: “Value of working on this problem now, compared to other problems in the field?”</p><p>Much less valuable: 22%</p><p>Less valuable: 41%</p><p>As valuable as other problems: 28%</p><p>More valuable: 7%</p><p>Much more valuable: 1.4%</p><p>So charitably, the answer to this question was coloring the answer to the previous one: AI researchers believe it’s plausible that there could be major problems with machine goal alignment, they just don’t think that there’s too much point in working on it now.</p><p>One more question here: “Chance intelligence explosion argument is broadly correct?”</p><p>Quite likely (81-100% chance): 12%</p><p>Likely (61-80% chance): 17%</p><p>About even (41-60% chance): 21%</p><p>Unlikely (21-40% chance): 24%</p><p>Quite unlikely (0-20% chance): 26%</p><p>Splitting the 41-60% bin in two, we might estimate that about 40% of AI researchers think the hypothesis is more likely than not.</p><p>Take the big picture here, and I worry there’s sort of a discrepancy.</p><p>50% of experts think there’s at least a ten percent chance of above-human-level AI coming within the next ten years.</p><p>And 40% of experts think that there’s a better-than-even chance that, once we get above-human level AI, it will “explode” to suddenly become vastly more intelligent than humans.</p><p>And 70% of experts think that Stuart Russell makes a pretty good point when he says that without a lot of research into AI goal alignment, AIs will probably have their goals so misaligned with humans that they could become dangerous and hostile.</p><p>I don’t have the raw individual-level data, so I can’t prove that these aren’t all anti-correlated in some perverse way that’s the opposite of the direction I would expect. But if we assume they’re not, and just naively multiply the probabilities together for a rough estimate, that suggests that about 14% of experts believe that all three of these things: that AI might be soon, superintelligent, and hostile.</p><p>Yet only a third of these – 5% – think this is “among the most important problems in the field”. Only a tenth – 1.4% – think it’s “much more valuable” than other things they could be working on.</p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>How have things changed since Muller and Bostrom’s survey in 2012?</p><p>The short answer is “confusingly”. Since almost everyone agrees that AI progress in the past five years has been much faster than expected, we would expect experts to have faster timelines – ie expect AI to be closer now than they did then. But Bostrom’s sample predicted human-level AI in 2040 (median) or 2081 (mean). Grace et al don’t give clear means or medians, preferring some complicated statistical construct which isn’t exactly similar to either of these. But their dates – 2062 by one framing, 2139 by another – at least seem potentially a little bit later.</p><p>Some of this may have to do with a subtle difference in how they asked their question:</p><p>Bostrom: “Define a high-level machine intelligence as one that can carry out most human professions as well as a typical human…”</p><p>Grace: “High-level machine intelligence is achieved when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers.”</p><p>Bostrom wanted it equal to humans; Grace wants it better. Bostrom wanted “most professions”, Grace wants “every task”. It makes sense that experts would predict longer timescales for meeting Grace’s standards.</p><p>But as we saw before, expecting AI experts to make sense might be giving them too much credit. A more likely possibility: Bostrom’s sample included people from wackier subbranches of AI research, like a conference on Philosophy of AI and one on Artificial General Intelligence; Grace’s sample was more mainstream. The most mainstream part of Bostrom’s sample, a list of top 100 AI researchers, had an estimate a bit closer to Grace’s (2050).</p><p>We can also compare the two samples on belief in an intelligence explosion. Bostrom asked how likely it was that AI went from human-level to “greatly surpassing” human level within two years. The median was 10%; the mean was 19%. The median of top AI researchers not involved in wacky conferences was 5%.</p><p>Grace asked the same question, with much the same results: a median 10% probability. I have no idea why this question – which details what an “intelligence explosion” would entail – was so much less popular than the one that used the words “intelligence explosion” (remember, 40% of experts agreed that “the intelligence explosion argument is broadly correct”). Maybe researchers believe it’s a logically sound argument and worth considering but in the end it’s not going to happen – or maybe they don’t actually know what “intelligence explosion” means.</p><p>Finally, Bostrom and Grace both asked experts’ predictions for whether the final impact of AI would be good or bad. Bostrom’s full sample (top 100 subgroup in parentheses) was:</p><p>Extremely good: 24% (20)</p><p>On balance good: 28% (40)</p><p>More or less neutral: 17% (19)</p><p>On balance bad: 13% (13)</p><p>Extremely bad – existential catastrophe: 18% (8)</p><p>Grace’s results for the same question:</p><p>Extremely good: 20%</p><p>On balance good: 25%</p><p>More or less neutral: 40%</p><p>On balance bad: 10%</p><p>Extremely bad – human extinction: 5%</p><p>Grace’s data looks pretty much the same as the TOP100 subset of Bostrom’s data, which makes sense since both are prestigious non-wacky AI researchers.</p><p><strong>V.</strong></p><p>A final question: “How much should society prioritize AI safety research”?</p><p>Much less: 5%</p><p>Less: 6%</p><p>About the same: 41%</p><p>More: 35%</p><p>Much more: 12%</p><p>People who say that real AI researchers don’t believe in safety research are now just empirically wrong. I can’t yet say that most of them want more such research – it’s only 47% on this survey. But next survey AI will be a little bit more advanced, people will have thought it over a little bit more, and maybe we’ll break the 50% mark.</p><p>But we’re not there yet.</p><p>I think a good summary of this paper would be that large-minorities-to-small-majorities of AI experts agree with the arguments around AI risk and think they’re worth investigating further. But only a very small minority of experts consider it an emergency or think it’s really important right now.</p><p>You could tell an optimistic story here – “experts agree that things will probably be okay, everyone can calm down”.</p><p>You can also tell a more pessimistic story. Experts agree with a lot of the claims and arguments that suggest reason for concern. It’s just that, having granted them, they’re not actually concerned.</p><p>This seems like a pretty common problem in philosophy. “Do you believe it’s more important that poor people have basic necessities of life than that you have lots of luxury goods?” “Yeah” “And do you believe that the money you’re currently spending on luxury goods right now could instead be spent on charity that would help poor people get life necessities?” “Yeah.” “Then shouldn’t you stop buying luxury goods and instead give all your extra money beyond what you need to live to charity?” “Hey, what? Nobody does that! That would be a lot of work and make me look really weird!”</p><p>How many of the experts in this survey are victims of the same problem? “Do you believe powerful AI is coming soon?” “Yeah.” “Do you believe it could be really dangerous?” “Yeah.” “Then shouldn’t you worry about this?” “Hey, what? Nobody does that! That would be a lot of work and make me look really weird!”</p><p>I don’t know. But I’m encouraged to see people are even taking the arguments seriously. And I’m encouraged that researchers are finally giving us good data on this. Thanks to the authors of this study for being so diligent, helpful, intelligent, wonderful, and (of course) sexy.</p><p>(I might have forgotten to mention that the lead author is my girlfriend. But that’s not biasing my praise above in any way.)</p><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div>",Yvain,scottalexander,Scott Alexander,

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Genius = work + luck</p>
<p>This is my book written in 1989 about 15 years of pedagogic experiment with my daughters. It is neither a recipe, nor a challenge, just a demonstration that it is possible to bring up a genius intentionally.</p>
<p>The so-called miracle children are natural phenomena, created by their parents and society. Sadly, many potential geniuses disappear without anyone noticing the opportunity, including themselves.</p>
<p>Many people in history did a similar thing by accident; we only repeated it on purpose.</p>
<h1>1. Secrets of the pedagogic experiment</h1>
<h2>1.1. The Polg&aacute;r family</h2>
<p>The Polg&aacute;r sisters (Susan, Sofia, Judit) are internationally as famous as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ern%C5%91_Rubik"">Rubik Ernő</a>, the inventor of the Rubik Cube.</p>
<p>Are they merely their father's puppets, manipulated like chess figures? Hardly. This level of success requires agency and active cooperation. Puppets don't become geniuses. C<span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">ontrariwise, I provided them opportunity, freedom, and support. They made most of the decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">You know what really creates puppets? The traditional school system. Watch how kids, eagerly entering school in September, mostly become burned out by Christmas.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">Not all geniuses are happy. Some are rejected by their environment, or they fail to achieve their goals. But some geniuses are happy, accepted by their environment, succeed, and contribute positively to the society. I think geniuses have a <em>greater</em> chance to be happy in life, and luckily my daughters are an example of that.</span></p>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">I was a member of the Communist Party for over ten years, but I disagreed with many things; specifically the lack of democracy, and the opposition to elite education.</span></p>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">I work about 15 hours a day since I was a teenager. I am obsessed with high quality. Some people say I am stubborn, even aggressive. I am trying hard to achieve my goals, and </span><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">I experienced a lot of frustration; seems to me some people were trying to destroy us. We were threatened by high-ranking politicians. We were not allowed to travel abroad until 1985, when Susan was already the #1 in international ranking of female chess players.</span></p>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">But I am happy that I have a great family, happy marriage, three successful children, and my creative work has an ongoing impact.<br /></span></p>
<h2><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">1.2 Nature or nurture?</span></h2>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">I believe that any biologically healthy child can be brought up to a genius. Me and my wife have read tons of books and studies. Researching the childhoods of many famous people that they all specialized early, and each of them had a strongly supportive parent or teacher or trainer. We concluded: geniuses are not born; they are made. We proved that experimentally. We hope that someone will build a coherent pedagogical system based on our hypothesis.<br /></span></p>
<p>Most of what we know about genetics <em>[as of 1989]</em> is about diseases. Healthy brains are flexible. Education was considered important by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson"">Watson</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler"">Adler</a>. But Watson never actually received the ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson#.22Twelve_infants.22_quotation"">dozen</a> healthy infants"" to bring up, so I was the first one to do this experiment. These are my five principles:</p>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">* Human personality is an outcome of the following three: the gifts of nature, the support of environment, and the work of one's own. Their relative importance depends on age: biology is strongest with the newborn, society with the ten years old, and later the importance of one's own actions grows.<br /></span></p>
<p>* There are two aspects of social influence: the family, and the culture. Humans are naturally social, so education should treat the child as a co-author of themselves.</p>
<p>* I believe that any healthy child has sufficient general ability, and can specialize in any type of activity. Here I differ from the opinion of many teachers and parents who believe that the role of education is to find a hidden talent in the child. I believe that the child has a general ability, and achieves special skills by education.</p>
<p>* The development of the genius needs to be intentionally organized; it will not happen at random.</p>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">* People should strive for maximum possible self-realization; that brings happiness both </span><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable""><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">to </span>them and to the people around them. Pedagogy should not aim for average, but for excellence.<br /></span></p>
<h1><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">2. A different education</span></h1>
<h2><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">2.1. About contemporary schools</span></h2>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">We homeschooled our children. Today's schools set a very low bar, and are intolerant towards people different from the average by their talent or otherwise. They don't prepare for real life; don't make kids love learning; don't </span><span class=""trdnac"">instigate greater goals; bring up neither autonomous individuals nor collectives.</span></p>
<p><span class=""trdnac"">Which is an unsurprising outcome, if you only have one type of school, each school containing a few exceptional kids among many average ones and a few feeble ones. Even the average ones are closer to the feeble ones that to the exceptional ones. And the teacher, by necessity, adapts to the majority. There is not enough space for individual approach, but there is a lot of mindless repetition. Sure, people talk a lot about teaching problem-solving skills, but that never happens. Both the teachers and the students suffer at school.</span></p>
<p><span class=""trdnac"">The gifted children are bored, and even tired, because boredom is more tedious than appropriate effort. The gifted children are disliked, just like everyone who differs from the norm. Many gifted children acquire psycho-somatic problems, such as insomnia, headache, stomach pain, neuroses. Famous people often had trouble at school; they were considered stupid and untalented. There is bullying, and general lack of kindness. There are schools for gifted children in USA and USSR, but somehow not in Hungary </span><span class=""trdnac""><em>[as of 1989]</em>.<br /></span></p>
<p>I had to fight a lot to have my first daughter home-schooled. I was afraid school would endanger the development of her abilities. We had support of many people, including pedagogues, but various bureaucrats repeatedly rejected us, sometimes with threats. Finally we received an exceptional permission by the government, but it only applied for one child. So with the second daughter we had to go through the same process again.</p>
<h2>2.2. Each child is a promise</h2>
<p>It is crucial to awaken and keep the child's interest, convince them that the success is achievable, trust them, and praise them. When the child likes the work, it will work fruitfully for long time periods. A profound interest develops personality and skills. A motivated child will achieve more, and get tired less.</p>
<p>I believe in positive motivation. Create a situation where many successes are possible. Successes make children confident; failures make them insecure. Experience of success and admiration by others motivates and accelerates learning. Failure, fear, and shyness decrease the desire to achieve. Successes in one field even increase confidence in other fields.</p>
<p>Too much praise can cause overconfidence, but it is generally safer to err on the side of praising more rather than less. However, the praise must be connected to a real outcome.</p>
<p>Discipline, especially internal psychological, also increases skills.</p>
<p>I believe the age between 3 and 6 years is very important, and very underestimated. No, those children are not too young to learn. Actually, that's when their brains are evolving the most. They should learn foreign languages. In multilingual environments children do that naturally.</p>
<p>Play is important for children, but play is not an opposite of work. Gathering information and solving problems is fun. Provide meaningful activities, instead of compartmentalized games. A game without learning is merely a surrogate activity. Gifted children prefer games that require mental activity. There is a continuum between learning and playing (just like between work and hobby for adults). Brains, just like muscles, becomes stronger by everyday activity.</p>
<p>My daughters used intense methods to learn languages; and chess; and table tennis. Is there a risk of damaging their personality by doing so? Maybe, but I believe the risks of damaging the personality by spending six childhood years without any effort are actually greater.</p>
<p>When my daughters were 15, 9, 8 years old, we participated in a 24-hour chess tournament, where you had to play 100 games in 24 hours. (Most participants were between age 25 and 30.) Susan won. The success rates during the second half of the tournament were similar to those during the first half of the tournament, for all three girls, which shows that children are capable of staying focused for long periods of time. But this was an exceptional load.</p>
<h2>2.3. Genius - a gift or a curse?<br /></h2>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">I am not saying that we should bring up each child as a genius; only that bringing up children as geniuses is possible. I oppose uniform education, even a hypothetical one that would use my methods.</span></p>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">Public ideas of geniuses is usually one of two extremes. Either they are all supposed to be weird and half-insane; or they are all supposed to be CEOs and movie stars. Psychology has already moved beyond this. They examined Einstein's brain, but found no difference in weight or volume compared with an average person. For me, genius is an average person who has achieved their full potential. </span>Many famous geniuses attribute their success to hard work, discipline, attention, love of work, patience, time.</p>
<p><span class=""gt-baf-word-clickable"">All healthy newborns are <em>potential</em> geniuses, but whether they become <em>actual</em> geniuses, depends on their environment, education, and their own effort. For example, in the 20th century more people became geniuses than in the 19th or 18th century, </span>inter alia because of social changes. Geniuses need to be liberated. Hopefully in the future, more people will be free and fully developed, so being a genius will become a norm, not an exception. But for now, there are only a few people like that. As people grow up, they lose the potential to become geniuses. I estimate that an average person's chance to become a genius is about 80% at age 1; 60% at age 3; 50% at age 6; 40% at age 12; 30% at age 16; 20% at age 18; only 5% at age 20. Afterwards it drops to a fraction of percent.</p>
<p>A genius child can surpass their peers by 5 or 7 years. And if a ""miracle child"" doesn't become a ""miracle adult"", I am convinced that their environment did not allow them to. People say some children are faster and some are slower; I say they don't grow up in the same conditions. Good conditions allow one to progress faster. But some philosophers or writers became geniuses at old age.</p>
<p>People find it difficult to accept those who differ from the average. Even some scientists; for example Einstein's theory of relativity was opposed by many. My daughters are attacked not just by public opinion, but also by fellow chess players.</p>
<p>Some geniuses are unhappy about their situation. But many enjoy the creativity, perceived beauty, and success. Geniuses can harm themselves by having unrealistic expectations of their goals. But most of the harm comes from outside, as a dismissal of their work, or lack of material and moral support, baseless criticism. Nowadays, one demagogue can use the mass communication media to poison the whole population with rage against the representatives of national culture.</p>
<p>As the international communication and exchange of ideas grows, geniuses become more important than ever before. Education is necessary to overcome economical problems; new inventions create new jobs. But a genius provokes the anger of people, not by his behavior, but by his skills.</p>
<h2>2.4. Should every child become a celebrity?<br /></h2>
<p>I believe in diversity in education. I am not criticizing teachers for not doing things my way. There are many other attempts to improve education. But I think it is now possible to aim even higher, to bring up geniuses. I can imagine the following environments where this could be done:</p>
<p>* Homeschooling, i.e. teaching your biological or adopted children. Multiple families could cooperate and share their skills.</p>
<p>* Specialized educational facility for geniuses; a college or a family-type institution.</p>
<p>Homeschooling, or private education with parental oversight, are the ancient methods for bringing up geniuses. Families should get more involved in education; you can't simply outsource everything to a school. We should support families willing to take an active role. Education works better in a loving environment.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to a find a talent, develop one. Start specializing early, at the age of 3 or 4. One cannot become an expert on everything.</p>
<p>My daughters played chess 5 or 6 hours a day since their age of 4 or 5. Similarly, if you want ot become a musician, spend 5 or 6 hours a day doing music; if a physicist, do physics; if a linguist, do languages. With such intense instruction, the child will soon feel the knowledge, experience success, and soon becomes able to use this knowledge independently. For example, after learning Esperanto 5 or 6 hours a day for a few months, the child can start corresponding with children from other countries, participate at international meet-ups, and experience the conversations in a foreign language. That is at the same time pleasant, useful for the child, and useful for the society. The next year, start with English, then German, etc. Now the child enjoys this, because it obviously makes sense. (Unlike at school, where most learning feels purposeless.) In chess, the first year makes you an average player, three years a great player, six years a master, fifteen years a grandmaster. When a 10-years old child surpasses an average adult at some skill, it is highly motivating.</p>
<p>Gifted children need financial support, to cover the costs of books, education, and travel.</p>
<p>Some people express concern that early specialization may lead to ignorance of everything else. But it's the other way round; abilities formed in one area can transfer to other areas. One learns how to learn.</p>
<p>Also, the specialization is relative. If you want to become e.g. a computer programmer, you will learn maths, informatics, foreign languages; when you become famous, you will travel, meet interesting people, experience different cultures. My daughters, in addition to being chess geniuses, speak many foreign languages, travel, do sports, write books, etc. Having deep knowledge about something doesn't imply ignorance about everything else. On the other hand, a misguided attempt to become an universalist can result in knowing nothing, in mere pretend-knowledge of everything.</p>
<p>Emotional and moral education must do together with the early specialization, to develop a complex personality. We wanted our children to be enthusiastic, courageous, persistent, to be objective judges of things and people, to resist failure and avoid temptations of success, to handle frustration and tolerate criticism even when it is wrong, to make plans, to manage their emotions. Also, to love and respect people, and to prefer creative work to physical pleasure or status symbols. We told them that they can achieve greatness, but that there can be only one world champion, so their goal should rather be to become good chess players, be good at sport, and be honest people.</p>
<p>Pedagogy puts great emphasis on being with children of the same age. I think that mental peers are more important than age peers. It would harm a gifted child to be forced to spend most of their time exclusively among children of the same age. On the other hand, spending most of the time with adults brings the risk that the child will learn to rely on them all the time, losing independence and initiative. You need to find a balance. I believe the best company would be of similar intellectual level, similar hobbies, and good relations.</p>
<p>For example, if Susan at 13 years old would be forced to play chess exclusively with 13 years old children, it would harm both sides. She could not learn anything from them; they would resent losing constantly.</p>
<p>Originally, I hoped I could bring up each daughter as a genius in a different field (e.g. mathematics, chess, music). It would be a more convincing evidence that you can bring up a genius of any kind. And I believe I would have succeeded, but I was constrained by money and time. We would need three private teachers, would have to go each day to three different places, would have to buy books for maths and chess and music (and the music instruments). By making them one team, things became easier, and the family has more things in common. Some psychologists worried that children could be jealous of each other, and hate each other. But we brought them up properly, and this did not happen.</p>
<p>This is how I imagine a typical day at a school for geniuses:</p>
<p>* 4 hours studying the subject of specialization, e.g. chess;</p>
<p>* 1 hour studying a foreign language; Esperanto at the first year, English at the second, later choose freely; during the first three months this would increase to 3 hours a day (by reducing the subject of specialization temporarily); traveling abroad during the summer;</p>
<p>* 1 hour computer science;</p>
<p>* 1 hour ethics, psychology, pedagogy, social skills;</p>
<p>* 1 hour physical education, specific form chosen individually.</p>
<p>Would I like to teach at such school? In theory yes, but in practice I am already burned out from the endless debates with authorities, the press, opinionated pedagogues and psychologists. I am really tired of that. The teachers in such school need to be protected from all this, so they can fully focus on their work.</p>
<h2>2.5. Esperanto: the first step in learning foreign languages<br /></h2>
<p>Our whole family speaks Esperanto. It is a part of our moral system, a tool for equality of people. There are many prejudices against it, but the same was true about all progressive ideas. Some people argue by Bible that multiple languages are God's punishment we have to endure. Some people invested many resources into learning 2 or 3 or 4 foreign languages, and don't want to lose the gained position. Economically strong nations enforce their own languages as part of dominance, and the speakers of other languages are discriminated against. Using Esperanto as everyone's second language would make the international communication more easy and egalitarian. But considering today's economical pressures, it makes sense to learn English or Russian or Chinese next.</p>
<p>Esperanto has a regular grammar with simple syntax. It also uses many Latin, Germanic, and Slavic roots, so as a European, even if you are not familiar with the language, you will probably recognize many words in a text. This is an advantage from pedagogical point of view: you can more easily learn its vocabulary and its grammar; you can learn the whole language about 10 times easier than other languages.</p>
<p>It makes a great example of the concept of a foreign language, which pays off when learning other languages later. It is known that having learned one foreign language makes learning another foreign language easier. So, if learning Esperanto takes 10 times less time than learning another language, such as English, then if already knowing another foreign language makes learning the second one at least 10% more efficient, it makes sense to learn Esperanto first. Also, Esperanto would be a great first experience for students who have difficulty learning languages; they would achieve success faster.</p>
<h1>3. Chess<br /></h1>
<h2>3.1. Why chess?<br /></h2>
<p>Originally, we were deciding between mathematics, chess, and foreign languages. Finally we chose chess, because the results in that area are easy to measure, using a traditional and objective system, which makes it easier to prove whether the experiment succeeded or failed. Which was a lucky choice in hindsight, because back then we had no idea how many obstacles we will have to face. If we wouldn't be able to prove our results unambiguously, the attacks against us would have been much stronger.</p>
<p>Chess seemed sufficiently complex (it is a game, a science, an art, and a sport at the same time), so the risks of overspecialization were smaller; even if children would later decide they are tired of chess, they would keep some transferable skills. And the fact that our children were girls was a bonus: we were able to also prove that girls can be as intellectually able as boys; but for this purpose we needed an indisputable proof. (Although, people try to discount this proof anyway, saying things like: ""Well, chess is simple, but try doing the same in languages, mathematics, or music!"")</p>
<p>The scientific aspect of chess is that you have to follow the rules, analyze the situation, apply your intuition. If you have a favorite hypothesis, for example a favorite opening, but you keep losing, you have to change your mind. There is an aesthetic dimension in chess; some games are published and enjoyed not just because of their impressive logic, but because they are beautiful in some sense, they do something unexpected. And <code>&ndash;</code> most people are not familiar with this <code>&ndash;</code> chess requires great physical health. All the best chess players do some sport, and it is not a coincidence. Also it is organized similarly to sports: it has tournaments, players, spectators; you have to deal with the pain of losing, you have to play fair, etc.</p>
<h2>3.2. How did the Polg&aacute;r sisters start learning chess?<br /></h2>
<p>I don't have a ""one weird trick"" to teach children chess; it's just my general pedagogical approach, applied to chess. Teach the chess with love, playfully. Don't push it too forcefully. Remember to let the child win most of the time. Explain to the child that things can be learned, and that this also applies to chess. Don't worry if the child keeps jumping during the game; it could be still thinking about the game. Don't explain everything; provide the child an opportunity to discover some things independently. Don't criticize failure, praise success.</p>
<p>Start with shorter lessons, only 30 minutes and then have a break. Start by solving simple problems. Our girls loved the ""checkmate in two/three moves"" puzzles. Let the child play against equally skilled opponents often. For a child, it is better to play many quick games (e.g. with 5-minute timers), than a few long ones. Participate in tournaments appropriate for the child's current skill.</p>
<p>We have a large library of different games. They are indexed by strategy, and by names of players. So the girls can research their opponent's play before the tournament.</p>
<p>When a child loses the tournament, don't criticize them; the child is already sad. Offer support; help them analyze the mistakes.</p>
<p>When my girls write articles about chess, it makes them think deeply about the issue.</p>
<p>All three parts of the game <code>&ndash;</code> opening, middle game, ending <code>&ndash;</code> require same amount of focus. Some people focus too much on the endings, and neglect the rest. But at tournament, a bad opening can ruin the whole game.</p>
<p>Susan had the most difficult situation of the three daughters. In hindsight, having her learn 7 or 8 foreign languages was probably too much; some of that time would be better spent further improving her chess skills. As the oldest one, she also faced the worst criticism from haters; as a consequence she became the most defensive player of them. The two younger sister had the advantage that they could oppose the same pressures together. But still, I am sure that without those pressures, they also could have progressed even faster.</p>
<p>Politicians influenced the decisions of the Hungarian Chess Association; as a result my daughters were often forbidden from participation at international youth competitions, despite being the best national players. They wanted to prevent Susan from becoming the worldwide #1 female chess player. Once they even ""donated"" 100 points to her competitor, to keep Susan at the 2nd place. Later they didn't allow her to participate in the international male tournaments, although her results in the Hungarian male tournaments qualified her for that. The government regularly refused to issue passports to us, claiming that ""our foreign travels hurt the public order"". Also, it was difficult to find a trainer for my daughters, despite them being at the top of world rankings. Only recently we received a foreign help; a patron from Netherlands offered to pay trainers and sparring partners for my daughters, and also bought Susan a personal computer. A German journalist gave us a program and a database, and taught children how to use it.</p>
<p>The Hungarian press kept attacking us, published fake facts. We filed a few lawsuits, and won them all, but it just distracted us from our work. The foreign press <code>&ndash;</code> whether writing from the chess, psychological, or pedagogical perspectives <code>&ndash;</code> was fair to us; they wrote almost 40 000 articles about us, so finally even the Hungarian chess players, psychologists and pedagogues could learn about us from them.</p>
<p>At the beginning, I was a father, a trainer, and a manager to my daughters. But I am completely underqualified to be their trainer these days, so I just manage their trainers.</p>
<p>Until recently no one believed women could play chess on level comparable with men. Now the three girls together have about 40 Guiness records; they repeatedly outperformed their former records. In a 1988 interview Karpov said: ""Susan is extraordinarily strong, but Judit... at such age, neither me nor Kasparov could play like Judit plays.""</p>
<h2>3.3. How can we make our children like chess?<br /></h2>
<p>Some tips for teaching chess to 4 or 5 years old children. First, I made a blank square divided into 8x8 little squares, with named rows and columns. I named a square, my daughter had to find it; then she named a square and I had to find it. Then we used the black-and-white version, and we were guessing the color of the named square without looking.</p>
<p>Then we introduced kings, in a ""king vs king"" combat; the task was to reach the opposing row of the board with your king. Then we added a pawn; the goal remained to reach the opposing row. After a month of playing, we introduced the queen, and the concept of checkmate. Later we gradually added the remaining pieces (knights were the most difficult).</p>
<p>Then we solved about thousand ""checkmate in one move"" puzzles. Then two moves, three moves, four moves. That took another 3 or 4 months. And only afterwards we started really playing against each other.</p>
<p>To provide an advantage for the child, don't play with less pieces, because that changes the structure of the game. Instead, provide yourself a very short time limit, or deliberately make a mistake, so the child can learn to notice them.</p>
<p>Have patience, if some phase takes a lot of time. On stronger fundamentals, you can later build better. This is where I think our educational system makes great mistakes. Schools don't teach intensely, so children keep forgetting most of what they learned during the long spaces between the lessons. And then, despite not having fully mastered the first step, they move to the second one, etc.</p>
<h2>3.4. Chess and psychology<br /></h2>
<p>Competitive chess helps develop personality: will, emotion, perseverance, self-discipline, focus, self-control. It develops intellectual skills: memory, combination skills, logic, proper use of intuition. Understanding your opponent's weakness will help you.</p>
<p>People overestimate how much IQ tests determine talent. Measurements of people talented in different areas show that their average is only a bit above the average of the population.</p>
<h2>3.5. Emancipation of women<br /></h2>
<p>Some people say, incorrectly, that my daughter won the <em>male</em> chess championship. But there is officially no such thing as ""male chess championship"", there is simply <em>chess championship</em>, open to both men and women. (And then, there is a separate female chess championship, only for women, but that is considered second league.)</p>
<p>I prepared the plan for my children before they were born. I didn't know I would have all girls, so I did not expect this special problem: the discrimination of women. I wanted to bring up my daughter Susan exactly according to the plan, but many people tried to prevent it; they insisted that she cannot compete with boys, that she should only compete with girls. Thus my original goal of proving that you can bring up a genius, became indirectly a goal of proving that there are no essential intellectual differences between men and women, and therefore one can't use that argument as an excuse for subjugation of women.</p>
<p>People kept telling me that I can only bring up Susan to be a female champion, not to compete with men. But I knew that during elementary school, girls <em>can</em> compete with boys. Only later, when they start playing the female role, when they are taught to clean the house, wash laundry, cook, follow the fashion, pay attention to details of clothing, and try getting married as soon as possible <code>&ndash;</code> when they are expected to do other things than boys are expected to do <code>&ndash;</code> that has a negative impact on developing their skills. But family duties and bringing up children can be done by both parents together.</p>
<p>Women can achieve same results, if they can get similar conditions. I tried to do that for my daughters, but I couldn't convince the whole society to treat them the same.</p>
<p>We know about differences between adult men and women, but we don't know whether they were caused by biology or education. And we know than e.g. in mathematics and languages, during elementary and high schools girls progress at the same pace as boys, and only later the differences appear. This is an evidence in favor of equality. We do not know what children growing up without discrimination would be like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the current system also provides some advantages for women; for example the female chess players don't need to work <em>that</em> hard to become the (female) elite, and some of them don't want to give that up. Such women are among the greatest opponents of my daughters.</p>
<h1>4. The meaning of this whole affair<br /></h1>
<h2>4.1. Family value<br /></h2>
<p>I am certain that without a good family background the success of my daughters would not be possible. It is important, before people marry, to have a clear idea of what expect from their marriage. When partners cooperate, the mutual help, the shared experiences, education of children, good habits, etc. can deepen their love. Children need family without conflicts to feel safe. But of course, if the situation becomes too bad, the divorce might become the way to reduce conflicts.</p>
<p>To bring up a genius, it is desirable for one parent to stay at home and take care of children. But it can be the father, too.</p>
<p><em>[Kl&aacute;ra Polg&aacute;r says:]</em> When I met L&aacute;szl&oacute;, my first impression was that he was an interesting person full of ideas, but one should not believe even half of them.</p>
<p>When Susan was three and half, L&aacute;szl&oacute; said it was time for her to specialize. She was good at math; at the age of four she already learned the material of the first four grades. Once she found chess figures in the box, and started playing with them as toys. L&aacute;szl&oacute; was spending a lot of time with her, and one day I was surprised to see them playing chess. L&aacute;szl&oacute; loved chess, but I never learned it.</p>
<p>So, we could have chosen math or foreign languages, but we felt that Susan was really happy playing chess, and she started being good at it. But our parents and neighbors shook their heads: ""Chess? For a girl?"" People told me: ""What kind of a mother are you? Why do you allow your husband to play chess with Susan?"" I had my doubts, but now I believe I made the right choice.</p>
<p>People are concerned whether my children had real childhood. I think they are at least as happy as their peers, probably more.</p>
<p>I always wanted to have a good, peaceful family life, and I believe I have achieved that. <em>[End of Kl&aacute;ra's part.]</em></p>
<h2>4.2. Being a minority<br /></h2>
<p>It is generally known that Jewish people achieved many excellent results in intellectual fields. Some ask whether the cause of this is biologic or social. I believe it is social.</p>
<p>First, Jewish families are usually traditional, stable, and care a lot about education. They knew that they will be discriminated against, and will have to work twice as hard, and that at any moment they may be forced to leave their home, or even country, so their knowledge might be the only thing they will always be able to keep. Jewish religion requires parents to educate their children since early childhood; Talmud requires parents to become the child's first teachers.</p>
<h2>4.3. Witnesses of the genius education: the happy children<br /></h2>
<p>I care about happiness of my children. But not only I want to make them happy, I also want to develop their ability to be happy. And I think that being a genius is the most certain way. The life of a genius may be difficult, but happy anyway. On the other hand, average people, despite seemingly playing it safe, often become alcoholics, drug addicts, neurotics, loners, etc.</p>
<p>Some geniuses become unhappy with their profession. But even then I believe it is easier for a genius to change professions.</p>
<p>Happiness = work + love + freedom + luck</p>
<p>People worry whether child geniuses don't lose their childhood. But the average childhood is actually not as great as people describe it; many people do <em>not</em> have a happy childhood. Parents want to make their children happy, but they often do it wrong: they buy them expensive toys, but they don't prepare them for life; they outsource that responsibility to school, which generally does not have the right conditions.</p>
<p>And when parents try to fully develop the capabilities of their children, instead of social support they usually get criticism. People will blame them for being overly ambitious, for pushing the children to achieve things they themselves failed at. I personally know people who tried to educate their children similarly to how we did, but the press launched a full-scale attack against them, and they gave up.</p>
<p>My daughters' lives are full of variety. They have met famous people: presidents, prime ministers, ambassadors, princess Diana, millionaires, mayors, UN delegates, famous artists, other olympic winners. They appeared in television, radio, newspapers. They traveled around the whole world; visited dozens of famous places. They have hobbies. They have friends in many parts of the world. And our house is always open to guests.</p>
<h2>4.4. Make your life an ethical model<br /></h2>
<p>People reading this text may be surprised that they expected a rational explanation, while I mention emotions and morality a lot. But those are necessary for good life. Everyone should try to improve themselves in these aspects. The reason why I did not give up, despite all the obstacles and malice, is because for me, to live morally and create good, is an internal law. I couldn't do otherwise. I already know that even writing this very book will initiate more attacks, but I am doing it regardless.</p>
<p>And morality is also a thing we are not born with, but which needs to be taught to us, preferably in infancy. And we need to think about it, instead of expecting it to just happen. And the schools fail in this, too. I see it as an integral part of bringing up a genius.</p>
<p>One should aim to be a paragon; to live in a way that will make others want to follow you. Learn and work a lot; expect a lot from yourself and from others. Give love, and receive love. Live in peace with yourself and your neighbors. Work hard to be happy, and to make other people happy. Be a humanist, fight against prejudice. Protect the peace of the family, bring up your children towards perfection. Be honest. Respect freedom of yourself and of the others. Trust humanity; support the communities small and large. Etc.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42857em;"">Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that states that the best action is the one that maximizes utility. ""Utility"" is defined in various ways, usually in terms of the well-being of sentient entities. Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, described utility as the sum of all pleasure that results from an action, minus the suffering of anyone involved in the action. Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong. Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as egoism, utilitarianism considers all interests equally.</p>

For instance, eating a cookie might bring only one unit of pleasure to an ordinary person but could bring 100 units of pleasure to a utility monster. If the utility monster can get so much pleasure from each unit of resources, it follows from utilitarianism that the distribution of resources should acknowledge this. If the utility monster existed, it would justify the mistreatment and perhaps annihilation of everyone else, according to the mandates of utilitarianism, because, for the utility monster, the pleasure they receive outweighs the suffering they may cause.[1] Nozick writes:<br style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"" />&ldquo;Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters who get enormously greater sums of utility from any sacrifice of others than these others lose ... the theory seems to require that we all be sacrificed in the monster's maw, in order to increase total utility.&rdquo;<br style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"" />&nbsp;<br style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"" />This thought experiment attempts to show that utilitarianism is not actually egalitarian, even though it appears to be at first glance.</p>

<p>Some people say, expanding on an idea of de Finetti, that Bayesian rational agents should offer two-sided bets based on their beliefs. For example, if you think a coin is fair, you should be willing to offer anyone a 50/50 bet on heads (or tails) for a penny. Jack called it the ""will-to-wager assumption"" <a href=""/lw/3cp/dutch_books_and_decision_theory_an_introduction/"">here</a> and I don't know a better name.</p>
<p>In its simplest form the assumption is false, even for perfectly rational agents in a perfectly simple world. For example, I can give you my favorite fair coin so you can flip it and take a peek at the result. Then, even though I still believe the coin is fair, I'd be a fool to offer both sides of the wager to you, because you'd just take whichever side benefits you (since you've seen the result and I haven't). That objection is not just academic: using your sincere beliefs to bet money against better informed people is a bad idea in real world markets as well.</p>
<p>Then the question arises, how can we fix the assumption so it still says something sensible about rationality? I think the right fix should go something like this. If you flip a coin and peek at the result, then offer me a bet at 90:10 odds that the coin came up heads, I must either accept the bet or update toward believing that the coin indeed came up heads, with at least these odds. I don't get to keep my 50:50 beliefs about the coin and refuse the bet at the same time. More generally, a Bayesian rational agent offered a bet (by another agent who might have more information) must <em>either accept the bet or update their beliefs so the bet becomes unprofitable</em>. The old obligation about offering two-sided bets on all your beliefs is obsolete, use this one from now on. It should also come in handy in living room Bayesian scuffles, throwing some money on the table and saying ""bet or update!"" has a nice ring to it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>The Problem</strong></h1>
<h2>LessWrong And Guardedness</h2>
<p>I can only speak to my own experiences in joining the community, but I have always felt that the rationalist community holds its members to a very high standard. &nbsp;This isn't a bad thing but it creates, at least in me, a sense of guardedness. &nbsp;I don't want to be the rationalist who sounds stupid or the one who contributes less to the conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every post I've made here on LessWrong (not that there have been many), has been reviewed and edited with the same kind of diligence that I normally reserve for graded essays or business documentation. &nbsp;Other online communities I'm a part of (and meatspace communities) require far less diligence from me as a contributor. &nbsp;(Note: This isn't a value judgement, rather a description of my experience.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, my best experiences in communities and friendships have generally occurred in very unguarded atmospheres. &nbsp;Not that my friends and I aren't smart or can't be smart, but most of the fun I've had with them happens when we're playing card or board or video games, or just hanging out and talking. &nbsp;Doing things like going out to eat, playing ping-pong, and talking about bad TV shows have led to some of the strongest relationships in my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So Where Is The Fun?</h2>
<p>So - where is this in the Rationalist Community? &nbsp;Now, it is very possible that the fun is there and I'm simply missing it. &nbsp;I haven't been to any meetups, I don't live in the bay area, and I don't even know any rationalists in meatspace. &nbsp;But if it is, aside from the occasional meetup, I don't see any evidence of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to do some research on how friendships and communities are formed, and there seemed to be little consensus in the field. &nbsp;A <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?pagewanted=all"">New York Times article</a> on making friendships as an adult mentions three factors:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style=""color: #333333; font-family: georgia, &quot;times new roman&quot;, times, serif; font-size: 17px;"">As external conditions change, it becomes tougher to meet the three conditions that sociologists since the 1950s have considered crucial to making close friends: proximity; repeated, unplanned interactions; and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other, said Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This is why so many people meet their lifelong friends in college, she added.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was unable to find this in an actual paper, but a brief perusal of the <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friendship/#1.2"">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's page on friendship</a> at least shows that people who think about the topic seem to agree that there has to be some kind of intimacy involved in a friendship. &nbsp;And while there are certainly rationalists who are friends, for me becoming a rationalist and joining the community has not yet materialized into any specific friendships. &nbsp;While that is on my shoulders, I believe it highlights a distinction I want to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If what we have in common, as Rationalists, is a shared way of thinking and a shared set of goals (e.g. save the world, improve the rationality waterline, etc.), then the relationship I share with the community strikes me as more as an <em>alliance</em>&nbsp;than a friendship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allies want the same goals, and may use similar methodologies to achieve them, but they are not friends. &nbsp;I wouldn't tell my ally about an embarrassing dream I had, or get drunk with them and make fun of bad movies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't mean to get hung up on meanings - the words themselves aren't important. &nbsp;But from what I have seen, the community, especially those outside the Bay Area, lack the unguarded intimacy I see in my close friendships, and that I think are a key component of community-building. &nbsp;I'd be willing to bet that even in meetups, many (&gt;20%) of Rationalists feel the weight of the high standards of the community, and are thus more guarded than they are in relationships with less expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get at is that I haven't experienced an unguarded interaction with a rationalist, online or in meatspace. &nbsp;I always want to be at the top of my game, always trying to reason better, and remember all the things I've learned about biases and probability theory. &nbsp;And I suspect that low-standards unguarded interactions have something to do with growing friendships and communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, for an East-coaster with a computer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where is the fun? &nbsp;Where are the rationalist video game tournaments? &nbsp;Robot fights? &nbsp;Words with Friends who are rationalists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where is the chilling and watching all the Lord of the Rings movies together? &nbsp;The absurd Dungeons and Dragons campaigns because everyone is a plotter and there are too many plots?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>A Few Suggested Solutions</strong></h1>
<p>Everyone in the Rationalist community wants to help. &nbsp;We want to save the world, and that's great. &nbsp;But...not everything has to be about saving the world. &nbsp;If the goal of an activity is community/friendship building, why can't it be otherwise pointless? &nbsp;Why can't it be silly and inane and utterly irrational?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in the interests of Project Hufflepuff, I spent some time thinking about ways to improve/change the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Hero/Sidekick/Dragon Project</h2>
<p>There was a series of posts in 2015 that had to do with different people wanting to take different roles in projects, be it the hero, the sidekick, the dragon, etc. &nbsp;An effort was made to match people up, but as far as I can tell, it petered out, because I haven't seen anything to do with it since then (I would be happy to be wrong about this). &nbsp;I'll link the posts here; the first is, in particular, excellent: <a href=""/lw/lig/the_importance_of_sidekicks/"">the issue in general</a>, <a href=""/lw/lqs/sidekick_matchmaking/"">an attempt at matchmaking</a>, and <a href=""/lw/mwn/sidekick_matchmaking_how_to_tackle_the_problem/"">a discussion of matchmaking methods</a>.</p>
<p>I might suggest an open thread that functions as a classified ad, e.g. Help Wanted, must be able to XYZ, or Sidekick In Need of Hero, must live in X area, etc.</p>
<p>I'd also like to mention that the project in question shouldn't have to be about friendly AI or effective altruism; I think that developing an effective partnership is valuable by itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Online Gaming</h2>
<p>Is there a reason that members of the community can't game together online? &nbsp;This post on Overwatch provides at least a small amount of evidence that the community would have enough members interested to form teams, and team-building seems to be one of the goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fun Projects&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I can think of plenty of challenging projects that require a team that I'd love to do, but that have almost nothing to do with world-saving at any scale. &nbsp;Things like making a robot, or coding a game, or writing a book or play. &nbsp;Does this happen in the community? &nbsp;If not, I think it might help. &nbsp;Again, the goal would be to create an unguarded atmosphere to foster friendships and team-building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rationalist Buddy System</h2>
<p>I'd like to distinguish this from the Hero/Sidekick idea above. &nbsp;I know that I could use a rationalist buddy to pair up with. &nbsp;Many motivational and <a href=""/lw/1sm/akrasia_tactics_review/"">anti-akrasia techniques</a> require social commitment, and <a href=""https://www.beeminder.com/"">Beeminder</a> can only go so far. &nbsp;Having a person to talk things through, experiment with anti-akrasi techniques, or just to inspire and be inspired by would be insanely helpful for me, and I suspect for many of us. &nbsp;I'm vaguely reminded of the 12-step program's <a href=""http://www.recovery.org/topics/alcoholics-anonymous-12-step/"">sponsors</a>, if only in the way they support people going through the program.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to execute this, but I think it has the potential to be useful enough to be worth trying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rationalist Big/Little Program</h2>
<p>One of the things I got out of the <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/p1f/notes_from_the_hufflepuff_unconference_part_1/"">Project Hufflepuff Unconference Notes</a>&nbsp;was that making newcomers feel welcome was an issue. &nbsp;An idea to change this was a ""welcoming committee"":</p>
<blockquote>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><strong>Welcoming Committee&nbsp;</strong>(Mandy Souza, Tessa Alexanian)</div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"">Oftentimes at events you'll see people who are new, or who don't seem comfortable getting involved with the conversation. Many successful communities do a good job of&nbsp;<em>explicitly&nbsp;</em>welcoming those people. Some people at the unconference decided to put together a formal group for making sure this happens more.&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: start;"">I would like to suggest some version of the Big/Little program. &nbsp;For those who don't know, the idea is that established members of the community volunteer to be ""Bigs,"" and when a newcomer appears (a ""Little"") they are matched with a Big. &nbsp;The Big then takes on the role of a guide, providing the Little an easier introduction to the community. &nbsp;This idea has been used in many different environments, and has helped me personally in the past.</span></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: start;"">Perhaps people could sign up on some sort of permanent thread that they're willing to be Bigs, and then lurkers and first-time posters could be encouraged to PM them?</span></div>
<div style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><br /></div>
<h1 style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: start;"">In Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: start;"">It seems to me as though the high standards of the Rationalist community promote a guarded atmosphere, which hampers the development of close friendships and the community. &nbsp;I've outlined a few ways that may help create places within the community where standards can be lowered and guards relaxed without (hopefully) compromising its high standards elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>I realize that most of this post is based upon my personal observations and experiences, which are anecdotal evidence and thus Not To Be Trusted. &nbsp;I am prepared to be wrong, and would welcome the correction.</p>

<p>I'm going to talk about something that's a little weird, because it uses some results from some&nbsp;<em>very</em> recent ML theory to make a metaphor about something seemingly entirely unrelated - norms surrounding discourse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also going to reach some conclusions that surprised me when I finally obtained them, because it caused me to update on a few things that I had previously been fairly confident about. This argument basically concludes that we should adopt fairly strict speech norms, and that there could be great benefit to moderating our discourse well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I argue that in fact, discourse can be considered an optimization process and can be thought of in the same way that we think of optimizing a large function. As I will argue, thinking of it in this way will allow us to make a very specific set of norms that are easy to think about and easy to enforce. It is partly a proposal for how to solve the problem of dealing with speech that is considered hostile, low-quality, or otherwise harmful. But most importantly, it is a proposal for how to ensure that the discussion always moves in the right direction: Towards better solutions and more accurate models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will also help us avoid something I'm referring to as ""mode collapse"" (where new ideas generated are non-diverse and are typically characterized by adding more and more details to ideas that have already been tested extensively). It's also highly related to the concepts discussed in the <em><a href=""/lw/lg/the_affect_heuristic/"">Death Spirals and the Cult Attractor</a></em> portion of the Sequences. Ideally, we'd like to be able to make sure that we're exploring as much of the hypothesis space as possible, and there's good reason to believe we're probably not doing this very well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge: Making sure we're searching for the global optimum in model-space sometimes requires reaching out blindly into the frontiers, the not well-explored regions, which runs the risk of ending up somewhere very low-quality or dangerous. There are also sometimes large gaps between very different regions of model-space where the quality of the model is very low in-between, but very high on each side of the gap. This requires <a href=""/lw/7k/incremental_progress_and_the_valley/"">traversing</a> through potentially dangerous territory and being able to survive the whole way through.</p>
<p>(I'll be using terms like ""models"" and ""hypotheses"" quite often, and I hope this isn't confusing. I am using them very broadly, to refer to both theoretical understandings of phenomenon and blueprints for practical implementations of ideas).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We desire to have a set of principles which allows us to do this safely - to think about models of the world that are new and untested, solutions for solving problems that have never been done in a similar way - and they should ensure that, eventually, we can reach the global optimum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we derive that set of principles, I am going to introduce a topic of interest from the field of Machine Learning. This topic will serve as the main analogy for the rest of this piece, and serve as a model for how the dynamics of discourse should work in the ideal case.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I. The Analogy: Generative Adversarial Networks</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with the recent developments in deep-learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)[<a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.00160.pdf"">intro pdf here</a>] are a new type of generative model class that are ideal for producing high-quality samples from very high-dimensional, complex distributions. They have caused great buzz and hype in the deep-learning community due to how impressive some of the samples they produce are, and how efficient they are at generation.</p>
<p>Put simply, a generator model and a critic (sometimes called a discriminator) model perform a two-player game where the critic is trained to distinguish between samples produced by the generator and the ""true"" samples taken from the data distribution. In turn, the generator is trained to maximize the critic's loss function. Both models are usually parametrized by deep neural networks and can be trained by taking turns running a gradient descent step on each. The Nash equilibrium of this game is when the generator's distribution matches that of the data distribution perfectly. This is never really borne out in practice, but sometimes it gets so close that we don't mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GANs have one principal failure mode, which is often thought to be due to the instability of the system, which is often called ""mode collapse"" (a term I'm going to appropriate to refer to a much broader concept). It was often believed that, if a careful balance between the generator and critic could not be maintained, one would eventually overpower the other - leading the critic to provide either useless or overly harsh information to the generator. Useless information will cause the generator to update very slowly or not at all, and overly harsh information will lead the samples to ""collapse"" to a small region of the data space that are the easiest targets for the generator to hit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem was essentially solved earlier this year due to a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875"">series</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028"">of</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10743"">papers</a> that propose modifications to the loss functions that GANs use, and, most crucially, add another term to the critic's loss which stabilizes the gradient (with respect to the inputs) to have a norm close to one. It was recognized that we actually desire an extremely powerful critic so that the generator can make the best updates it possibly can, but the updates themselves can't go beyond what the generator is capable of handling. With these changes to the GAN formulation, it became possible to use crazy critic networks such as ultra-deep ResNets and train them as much as desired before updating the generator network. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The principle behind their operation is rather simple to describe, but unfortunately, it is much more difficult to explain why they work so well. However, I believe that as long as we know how to make one, and know specific implementation details that improve their stability, then I believe their principles can be applied more broadly to achieve success in a wide variety of regimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II. GANs as a Model of Discourse</strong></p>
<p>In order to use GANs as a tool for conceptual understanding of discourse, I propose to model of the dynamics of debate as a collection of hypothesis-generators and hypothesis-critics. This could be likened to the structure of academia - researchers publish papers, they go through peer-review, the work is iterated on and improved - and over time this process converges to more and more accurate models of reality (or so we hope). Most individuals within this process play both roles, but in theory this process would still work even if they didn't. For example, Isaac Newton was a superb hypothesis generator, but he also had some wacky ideas that most of us would consider to be obviously absurd. Nevertheless, calculus and Newtonian physics became a part of our accepted scientific knowledge, and alchemy didn't. The system adopted and iterated on his good ideas while throwing away the bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our community should be capable of something similar, while doing it more efficiently and not requiring the massive infrastructure of academia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hypothesis-generator is not something that just randomly pulls out a model from model-space. It proposes things that are close modifications of things it already holds to be likely within its model (though I expect this point to be debatable). Humans are both hypothesis-generators and hypothesis-critics. And as I will argue, that distinction is not quite as sharply defined as one would think.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think there has always been an underlying assumption within the theory of intelligence that creativity and recognition / distinction are fundamentally different. In other words, one can easily understand Mozart to be a great composer, but it is much more difficult to <em>be </em>a Mozart. Naturally this belief entered it's way into the field of Artificial Intelligence too, and became somewhat of a dogma. Computers might be able to play Chess, they might be able to play Go, but they aren't doing anything <em>fundamentally </em>intelligent. They lack the creative spark, they work on pure brute-force calculation only, with maybe some heuristics and tricks that their <em>human </em>creators bestowed upon them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>GANs seem to defy this principle. Trained on a dataset of photographs of human faces, a GAN generator learns to produce near-photo-realistic images that nonetheless do not fully match any the faces the critic network saw (one of the reasons why CelebA was such a good choice to test these on), and are therefore in some sense producing things which are genuinely original. It may have once been thought that there was a fundamental distinction between creation and critique, but perhaps that's not really the case. GANs were a surprising discovery, because they showed that it was possible to make impressive ""creations"" by starting from random nonsense and slowly tweaking it in the direction of ""good"" until it eventually got there (well okay, that's basically true for the whole of optimization, but it was thought to be especially difficult for generative models).</p>
<p>What does this mean? Could someone become a ""Mozart"" by beginning a musical composition from random noise and slowly tweaking it until it became a masterpiece?</p>
<p>The above seems to imply ""yes, perhaps."" However, this is highly contingent on the quality of the ""tweaking."" It seems possible only as long as the directions to update in are very high quality. What if they aren't very high quality? What if they point nowhere, or in very bad directions?</p>
<p>I think the <em>default </em>distribution of discourse is that it is characterized by a large number of these directionless, low quality contributions. And that it's likely that this is one of the main factors behind mode collapse. This is related to what has <a href=""/lw/3h/why_our_kind_cant_cooperate/"">been</a>&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/42/tolerate_tolerance/"">noted</a> before: Too much intolerance for imperfect ideas (or ideas outside of established dogma) in a community prevent useful tasks from being accomplished, and progress from being made. Academia does not seem immune to this problem. Where low-quality or hostile discussion is tolerated is where this risk is greatest. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, making sure we get good ""tweaks"" seems to be the easy part. Critique is in high abundance. Our community is apparently very good at it. We also don't need to worry much about the ratio of hypothesis-generators to hypothesis-critics, as long as we can establish good principles that allow us to follow GANs as closely as possible. The nice feature of the GAN formulation is that you are allowed to make the critic as powerful as you want. In fact, the critic <em>should </em>be more powerful than the generator (If the generator is too powerful, it just goes directly to the argmax of the critic).&nbsp;</p>
<p>(In addition, any collection of generators is a generator, and any collection of critics is a critic. So this formulation can be applied to the community setting).</p>
<p><strong>III. The Norm One Principle</strong></p>
<p>So the question then becomes, how do we take an algorithm governing a game between models much simpler than a human, and use the same tweaks which consist of nothing more than a few very simple equations?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here what I devise is a strategy for taking the concept of the norm of the critic gradient being as close to one as possible, and using that as a heuristic for how to structure appropriate discourse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(This is where my argument gets more speculative and I expect to update this a lot, and where I welcome the most criticism).</p>
<p>What I propose is that we begin modeling the concept of ""criticism"" based on how useful it is to the idea-generator receiving the criticism. Under this model, I think we should start breaking down criticism into two fundamental attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Directionality - does the criticism contain highly useful information, such that the ""generator"" knows how to update their model / hypothesis / proposal?</li>
<li>Magnitude - Is the criticism too harsh, does it point to something completely unlike the original proposal, or otherwise require changes that aren't feasible for the generator to make?</li>
</ol>
<p>My claim is that any contribution to a discussion should satisfy the ""Norm One Principle."" In other words, it should have a well-defined direction, and the quantity of change should be feasible to implement.</p>
<ol> </ol>
<p>If a critique can satisfy our requirements for both directionality and magnitude, then it serves a useful purpose. The inverse claim to this is that if we can't follow these requirements, we risk falling into mode collapse, and the ideas commonly proposed are almost indistinguishable from the ones which preceded them, and ideas which deviate too far from the norm are harshly condemned and suppressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it's natural to question whether or not restricting criticism to follow certain principles is a form of speech suppression that prevents useful ideas from being considered. But the pattern I'm proposing <em>doesn't </em>restrict the ""generation"" process, the creative aspect which produces new hypotheses. It doesn't restrict the topics that can be discussed. It only restricts the <em>criticism </em>of those hypotheses, such that they are maximally useful to the source of the hypothesis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the primary fears behind having too much criticism is that it discourages people from contributing because they want to avoid the negative feedback. But under the Norm One Principle, I think it is useful to distinguish between <em>disagreement</em>&nbsp;and <em>criticism. </em>I think if we're following these norms properly, we won't need to consider criticism to be a negative reward. In fact, criticism can be positive. Agreement could be considered ""criticism in the same direction you are moving in."" Disagreement would be the opposite. And these norms also eliminate the kind of feedback that tends to be the most discouraging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, some things which violate ""Norm One"":</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ad hominem attacks&nbsp;</em>(typically directionless).&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Affective Death Spirals</em> (unlimited praise or denunciation is usually directionless, and usually very high magnitude).&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Signs that cause aversion</em> (things I ""don't like"", that trigger my System 1 alarms, which probably violates both directionality and magnitude).&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Lengthy lists of changes to make</em> (norm greater than 1, ideally we want to try to focus on small sets of changes that have the highest priority).&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Repetition of points that have already been made</em> (norm greater than one).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my strongest hopes is that whomever is playing the part of the ""generator"" is able to compile the list of critiques easily and use them to update somewhere close to the optimal direction. This would be difficult if the sum of all critiques is either directionless (many critics point in opposite or near-opposite directions) or very high-magnitude (Critics simply say to get as far away from here as possible).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But let's suppose that each individual criticism satisfies the Norm One principle. We will also assume that the generator is weighing each critique by their respect for whoever produced it, which I think is highly likely. Then the generator should be able to move in <em>a </em>direction unless the sum of the directions completely cancel out. It is unlikely for this to happen - unless there is very strong epistemic disagreement in the community over some fundamental assumptions (in which case the conversation should probably move over to that).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, it also becomes less likely for the directions to cancel out as the number of inputs increases. Thus, it seems that proposals for new models should be presented to a wide audience, and we should avoid the temptation to keep our proposals hidden to all except for a small set of people we trust.</p>
<p>So I think that in general, this proposed structure should tend to <em>increase </em>the amount of collective trust we have in the community, and that it favors transparency and favors diversity of viewpoints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what of the possible failure modes of this plan?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This model should fail if the specific details of its implementation either remove too much discussion, or fail to deal with individuals who refuse to follow the norms and refuse to update. Any implementation should allow room for anyone to update. Someone who posts an extremely hostile, directionless comment should be allowed chances to modify their contribution. The only scenario in which the ""banhammer"" becomes appropriate is when this model fails to apply: The cardinal sin of rationality, the refusal to update.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IV. Building the Ideal ""Generator""</strong></p>
<p>As a final point, I'll note that the above assumes that generators will be able to update their models incrementally. The easy part, as I mentioned, was obtaining the updates, the hard part is accumulating them. This seems difficult with the infrastructure we have in place. What we <em>do </em>have is a good system for posting proposals and receiving feedback (The blog post / comment thread set-up), but this assumes that each ""generator"" is keeping track of their models by themselves and has to be fully aware of the status of other models on their own. There is no centralized ""mixture model"" anywhere that contains the full set of models weighted by how much probability they are given by the community. Currently, we do not have a good solution for this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it seems that the first <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/arbital_ambitions/"">conception</a> of Arbital was centered around finding a solution to this kind of problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"">Arbital has bigger ambitions than even that. We all dream of a world that eliminates the duplication of effort in online argument - a world where, the same way that Wikipedia centralized the recording of definite facts, an argument only needs to happen once, instead of being reduplicated all over the Internet; with all the branches of the argument neatly recorded in the same place, along with some indication of who believes what. A world where 'just check Arbital' had the same status for determining the current state of debates, as 'just check Wikipedia' now has when somebody starts arguing about the population of Melbourne. There's entirely new big subproblems and solutions, not present at all in the current Arbital, that we'd need to tackle that considerably more difficult problem. But to solve 'explaining things' is something of a first step. If you have a single URL that you can point anyone to for 'explaining Bayes', and if you can dispatch people to different pages depending on how much math they know, you're starting to solve some of the key subproblems in removing the redundancy in online arguments.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If my proposed model is accurate, then it suggests that the problem Arbital aims to solve is in fact quite crucial to solve, and that the developers of Arbital should consider working through each obstacle they face without pivoting from this original goal. I feel confident enough that this goal should be high priority that I'd be willing to support its development in whatever way is deemed most helpful and is feasible for me (I am not an investor, but I am a programmer and would also be capable of making small donations, or contributing material).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing that this model would require for Arbital to do would be to make it as open as possible to contribute, and then perform heavy moderation or filtering of contributed content (but importantly not the other way around, where it is closed to small group of trusted people).</p>
<p>Currently, the incremental changes that would have to be made to LessWrong and related sites like SSC would simply be increased moderation of comment quality. Otherwise, any further progress on the problem would require overcoming much more serious obstacles requiring significant re-design and architecture changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything I've written above is also subject to the model I've just outlined, and therefore I expect to make incremental updates as feedback to this post accrues.</p>
<p>My initial prediction for feedback to this post is that the ideas might be considered helpful and offer a useful perspective or a good starting point, but that there are probably many details that I have missed that would be useful to discuss, or points that were not quite well-argued or well thought-out. I will look out for these things in the comments. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",tristanm,tristanm,tristanm,

Stereotypes are improbable, and making such generalisations from anecdotal evidence at best is faulty. I used to think like that&mdash;and I probably still do&mdash;nevertheless, someone raised an argument that stereotypes aren&rsquo;t useless; they exist for a reason. There was a reason why the stereotype was born. As such, you would expect that a stereotype conveys at least some information and is better than nothing.</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;""><br />I think a few factors contribute to the formation of a stereotype. I will take a minute to explain a stereotype. A stereotype is a relation of the form X =&gt; Y. It maps a class of people/individuals/what have you to a property X. For example, people who wear glasses are smart. Occasionally, some individuals may conceive the relation as Y &lt;=&gt; X. E.g. Smart people wear glasses. I suspect this is due to reasons unrelated to the stereotype (e.g. inability to distinguish between &rsquo;=&gt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&lt;=&gt;&rsquo;). I hope this is not common among the general population&mdash;the average human can&rsquo;t be that irrational, right? I shall give a charitable interpretation of the masses, and discuss only the relation 'X =&gt; Y&rsquo;. I would stick to two particularly conspicuous stereotypes and try to hypothesise how they originated. &nbsp; For one, anecdotal evidence, combined with the availability heuristic make people overrate the occurrence of certain relations. I shall pick the &ldquo;people who wear glasses are smart&rdquo; example: Some smart people use glasses. Due to the availability of smart people who use glasses the relation 'glasses&rsquo; =&gt; 'smart&rsquo; gets reinforced. However, this hides an implicit assumption; that the average IQ/intelligence (perceived or otherwise)/'smartness&rsquo; of people who wear glasses. Is this true? Normally, my common sense tells me that this is false, however there is correlation between height and intelligence:&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC3044837%2F%3Ftool%3Dpmcentrez&amp;t=OTBlYTFmMTVkOWVkNjIxNDE1NDViZWRiYzAzOGQ4ZmI4ODMwZWI2YyxjWjNmTWFmSg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Af48-wKAn7C_SrQ4exo9UkA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdragongod2718.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161351354664%2Fbirth-of-a-stereotype&amp;m=1"">NCBI</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHeight_and_intelligence&amp;t=MTBlZGRmNTQ5MGJkZWJhNjQ2OTE3NjkzOGFjNGZjMmQzZGUyMGFiYyxjWjNmTWFmSg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Af48-wKAn7C_SrQ4exo9UkA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdragongod2718.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161351354664%2Fbirth-of-a-stereotype&amp;m=1"">Wikipedia</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicalxpress.com%2Fnews%2F2014-03-genetic-link-height-iq.html&amp;t=NTU5MzgyNWZhNTM2NWViODAwOGQzMzJiNWYwNjg4MjkyODg5NmI4MSxjWjNmTWFmSg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Af48-wKAn7C_SrQ4exo9UkA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdragongod2718.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161351354664%2Fbirth-of-a-stereotype&amp;m=1"">medicalxpress</a>. I have not yet read any of them in sufficient detail&mdash;or any detail for that matter&mdash;as at the time of writing this, but I have bookmarked the links for future study. I cannot ascertain whether glasses actually correlate to intelligence and the effort required for that, is more than I&rsquo;m willing to commit to an article I am writing out of boredom. I would appreciate if the more medically knowledgeable readers fixed my ignorance.<br /><br />That said, I shall offer a hypothesis for the scenario in which there is no correlation between glasses wearing and intelligence. I would try not to violate Occam&rsquo;s razor, but there is no way I&rsquo;m going to go through the rigours of Solomonoff induction&mdash;I&rsquo;ll probably have to learn that in detail first&mdash;for this. Nor am I going to investigate the Kolmogorov complexity (something I more or less understand) either. I have reason to believe, that events which are strange or different from the norm leave a stronger mark in our memory. Events that are emotionally charged are often associated with the emotion and are retained more in episodic memory&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.psychologytoday.com%2Fblog%2Fscience-choice%2F201510%2Fwhy-do-we-remember-certain-things-forget-others&amp;t=N2JhOGQyZjc4N2NmZmIyMjFlMjI0NGUwZDA4NDc3MjNmMmYyZGFjNyxjWjNmTWFmSg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Af48-wKAn7C_SrQ4exo9UkA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdragongod2718.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161351354664%2Fbirth-of-a-stereotype&amp;m=1"">Psychology Today</a>. On first encountering the glasses users that were smart the fact that they wore glasses might have left a deep impression on the people who encountered them and may have been associated with their perceived intelligence. The brain is also an obsessive pattern matching engine drawing connections even when they are not there:&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scientificamerican.com%2Fpodcast%2Fepisode%2Fbrain-seeks-patterns-where-none-exi-08-10-03%2F&amp;t=NTI5MjIxMmZhZDk0NDdkODQyNjMyMTc5NGQ1ZjQxNDJhNWFmMTljNSxjWjNmTWFmSg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Af48-wKAn7C_SrQ4exo9UkA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdragongod2718.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161351354664%2Fbirth-of-a-stereotype&amp;m=1"">Scientific American</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FApophenia&amp;t=YTY4MjY0ZDhiOGE4MDIzOTAxOTQ4NTk4NzhkZTJkMWYzYjYyMDY5YSxjWjNmTWFmSg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Af48-wKAn7C_SrQ4exo9UkA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdragongod2718.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161351354664%2Fbirth-of-a-stereotype&amp;m=1"">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychcentral.com%2Flib%2Fpatterns-the-need-for-order%2F&amp;t=YjJlMzgzZTIzY2E2OWU2ZDJjYzRiZDBlMTJmNzQ0M2I1MDdjNjJlZCxjWjNmTWFmSg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Af48-wKAn7C_SrQ4exo9UkA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdragongod2718.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161351354664%2Fbirth-of-a-stereotype&amp;m=1"">Psych Central</a>, and so, the relation 'wears glasses&rsquo; =&gt; 'smart&rsquo; may have started to take root. Furthermore, categorising smart people and glasses together is easy. Kahneman 2011 &ldquo;Thinking Fast and Slow&rdquo;[1] brought forth the theory of 'cognitive ease&rsquo;; people&rsquo;s brains work along the line of least strain or greatest cognitive ease. If there are two decisions/decision making procedures, we tend to go with the one that is associated with more cognitive ease. I suggest that this (meta) heuristic of maximising cognitive ease, would make us more readily associate two characteristics with each other when there may be no logical reason for such an association. This may have led to the association of 'glasses&rsquo; and 'intelligence&rsquo;.<br /><br />The above is the charitable hypothesis. I decline&mdash;at this juncture&mdash;to mention the less charitable one.<br /><br />After the formation of the stereotype, it was reinforced in a feedback loop. The presence of the stereotype in the media reinforced its availability in our brains, and primed us to notice it when it does occur. Furthermore confirmation (positive) bias, may make us selectively notice the manifestations of the stereotype, and ignore the many cases when the stereotype was wrong. I do remember feeling disappointed when a kid I met in primary school was nowhere near as smart as I had expected. I wonder if that was when I started to dislike stereotypes. I wonder if there might be some groupthink involved in reinforcing the stereotype? I certainly suspect it (probability greater than 0.75 based solely on anecdotal evidence) in my society (Nigeria) but does such thinking abound in the Western World as well? I would appreciate feedback from my users on this issue. &nbsp;<br />I suspect that the representativeness heuristic combined with base rate neglect, cause people to overrate the proportion of a certain group of people who fit a certain characteristic. In the glasses example, people neglect the rate of people with glasses compared to the general population. Combine this with glasses taking to be representative of smart people and we have them overrating the proportion of smart people who wear glasses.<br /><br />Borrowing again from Kahneman 2011, I posit that stereotypes from an easy to implement and convenient heuristic (cognitive ease), and such are applied widely. Rather than dealing with each s in X as a separate individual that needs to be considered separately and handled as such, we pull up any stereotypes we know about X, and by deductive reasoning apply it to s. We can now deal with s on a better footing than when we started. Such reasoning is not in fact wrong, and would in fact be advisable&mdash;if the stereotypes were actually accurate. If for example 80% of glasses wearers had IQs north of 100, then relying on the stereotype is better than going in with zero information. Alas, the stereotypes seem to be unfounded. The perceived utility of stereotypes may contribute to the feedback loop, and make them much harder to kill.</p>

I eventually realised/was made to realise the (a plausible) origin of that stereotype. I shall describe the conversation below for your benefit referring to myself as 'DG&rsquo; and my conversation partner as 'Alpha&rsquo;.</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;"">DG: &ldquo;It was a rant; I was venting my frustration about Nigeria. People do not read rants to gain an unbiased opinion. I even put 'warning rant ahead in the post&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br />Alpha: &ldquo;I know, but you are contributing to the stereotype they have about Nigeria. Anyone that reads this would now start thinking that all Nigerians are like this.&rdquo;<br />DG: &ldquo;Stereotypes are so stupid. I mean they&rsquo;re completely baseless and unfounded. Look at the 'blondes are dumb&rsquo; stereotype.&rdquo;<br />Alpha: &ldquo;Stereotypes exist for a reason!&rdquo;<br />DG: &ldquo;What could possibly be the cause for the 'blondes are dumb&rsquo; stereotype?

How could it possibly exist?&rdquo;<br />Alpha: &ldquo;&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />DG: &hellip;.&rdquo;<br />Alpha: &ldquo;Well you know blondes are generally considered more attractive&hellip;&rdquo; DG: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Blondes are aesthetically more pleasant, and as such are more likely to work in jobs that are less intellectual, and considered the domain of bimbos.&rdquo;<br />Alpha: &ldquo;Blondes would be more likely to be hosts, waitresses&hellip;&rdquo;<br />DG: &ldquo;And strippers and porn stars. People are jealous; others can&rsquo;t have everything, so they tend to bring them down and pin other qualities on them to make up for any advantages they have dumb blondes compensate for their beauty with lowered intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px; color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;"">I am not Yudkowsky, and so I would not proffer an evolutionary psychology hypothesis for why blondes are more attractive among Caucasians (plus I don&rsquo;t know shit about evolutionary biology, much less evolutionary psychology, and so I&rsquo;ll be talking out of my ass&mdash;which would be fine if I were trying to guess the teacher&rsquo;s password&mdash;however, seeing as that is not my aim here, I&rsquo;ll refrain). The fact is that blondes are considered more attractive among Caucasians (relative to other Caucasians and&mdash;I suspect&mdash;to other races as well). People do not like that the Universe isn&rsquo;t fair; they prefer to believe in a just world. I mean wouldn&rsquo;t it be more convenient if the world were just and fair; only your hardwork mattered, no one was unfairly gifted in the genetic lottery? I suspect that the just world hypothesis is why there is a certain class of people (significant and maybe the majority, but I lack the relevant statistics) who try to downplay IQ and argue that it is irrelevant, and not a true measure of intelligence. Einstein&rsquo;s 'quote&rsquo; (alleged if the &ldquo; were not clear enough) about how ""everyone is a genius but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it would live its whole life believing it&rsquo;s stupid&rdquo;, is often quoted among that class as a holy maxim, and used to defend the convenient status quo of equality in the genetic lottery. I find the entire quote and mindset bogus, but I&rsquo;ve digressed enough already, and shall now steer this article back on track. &ldquo;Blondes can&rsquo;t both be beautiful and have the same smarts as everyone else&rdquo;: this jealousy helped reinforce the stereotype of the blonde bimbo. The fact that the proportion of blondes among bimbo professions may have in fact been higher, would have helped legitimise the stereotype. People see what they want to see, and as such they would ignore the proportion of blondes among the intellectual elite as well. I have learned not to underestimate the human mind&rsquo;s capability of cognitive dissonance&mdash;it was 17 years before I finally chose Science myself after all.<br /><br />Unlike the 'glasses&rsquo; =&gt; 'smart&rsquo; stereotype, I suspect the 'blonde&rsquo; =&gt; 'stupid&rsquo; stereotype is motivated almost entirely by the jealousy of the masses. Even as education may eradicate the former stereotype, I suspect the latter would last for a while longer due to the pervasiveness of the &ldquo;just world hypothesis&rdquo; and the desire for fairness of the masses.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px;"">Expected utility theory/expected value decision making&mdash;as the case may be&mdash;is quite interesting I guess. In times, past (for a few months at longest as I am a neophyte to rationality) I habitually trusted the answers expected utility theory provided without bothering to test them, or ponder for myself why they would be advisable. I mean, I first learned the concept of expected value in statistics and when we studied it in Operations Research&mdash;as part of an introduction to decision theory&mdash;it just seemed to make sense. However, after the recent experiment I did (the decision problem between a guaranteed \$250,000 and a 10\% chance to get \$10,000,000) I began to start doubting the appropriateness of Expected Utility Theory. Over 85\% of subjects chose the first option, despite the latter having an expected value 4 times higher than the former. I myself realised that the only scenario in which I would choose the \$10,000,000 was one in which \$250,000 was an amount I could pass up. Now I am fully cognisant of expected utility theory, and my decision to pick the first option did not seem to be prey to any bias, so a suspicion on the efficacy of expected utility theory began to develop in my mind. I took my experiment to&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Flesswrong%3B&amp;t=NDBhNjU3ZWNhNmI0MWJlOThjYjY1ZTA1MTIxMjJjYzllZTkyYWI1YSxjclI3U3RsRA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Af48-wKAn7C_SrQ4exo9UkA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdragongod2718.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F161447661984%2Fa-comment-on-expected-utility-theory&amp;m=1"">http://www.reddit.com/r/lesswrong;</a>&nbsp;a community who I expected would be more rational decision makers&mdash;they only confirmed the decision making of the first group. I realised then, that something was wrong; my map didn&rsquo;t reflect the territory. If expected utility theory was truly so sound, then a community of rationalists should have adhered to its dictates. I filed this information at the back of my mind. My brain began working on it, and today while I was reading &ldquo;Thinking, Fast and Slow&rdquo; by Daniel Kahneman my brain delivered an answer to me. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">I do not consider myself a slave to rationality; it is naught but a tool for me to achieve my goals. A tool to help me &ldquo;win&rdquo;, and to do so consistently. If any ritual of cognition causes me to lose, then I abandon it. There is no sentimentality on the road to victory, and above all I endeavour to be efficient&mdash;ruthlessly so if needed. As such, I am willing to abandon any theory of decision making, when I determine it would cause me to lose. Nevertheless, as a rationalist I had to wonder; if expected utility theory was so feeble a stratagem, why had it stuck around for so long? I decided to explore the theory from its roots; to derive it for myself so to speak; to figure out where the discrepancy had come from.</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">Expected Utility Theory, aims to maximise the Expected Utility of a decision which is naught but the average utility of that decision&mdash;the average payoff. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">Average payoff is given by the formula:&nbsp;<br />\[E_{j} = Pr_i*G_{ij} \tag{1}\]<br />Where&nbsp;<br />\(E_j\) = Expected value of Decision \(j\)&nbsp;<br />\(P_j\) = Probability of Scenario \(i\)&nbsp;<br />\(G_{ij}\) = Payoff of Decision \(j\) under Scenario \(i\).</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">What caught my interest when I decided to investigate expected utility theory from its roots, was the use of probability in the formula.</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">Now the definition of probability is:&nbsp;<br />\[Pr(i) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sum i}{n} \tag{2}\] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Where \(\sum i\) is to be understood to be \(f i\) the frequency of \(i\). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />If I keep in mind the definition of probability, I find something interesting; Expected Utility Theory maximises my payoff in the long run. For decision problems, which are iterated&mdash;in which I play the game several times&mdash;then Expected Utility Theory is my best bet. The closer the number of iterations are to infinity, the closer the probability is to the ratio above. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">Substituting \((2)\) into \((1)\) we get: &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\[E_j = \frac{\sum i}{n} * G_{ij} \tag{(3)}\]</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">What Expected Utility theory tells us is to choose the highest \(E_j\); this is only guaranteed to be the optimum decision in a scenario where \((1)\) = \((3)\) I.e.</p>
<ol style=""margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"">
<li>The decision problem has a (sufficiently) large number of iterations.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The decision problem involves a (sufficiently) large number of scenarios.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>What exactly constitutes &ldquo;large&rdquo; is left to the reader&rsquo;s discretion. However, \(2\) is definitely not large. To a rely on expected utility theory in a non&mdash;iterated game with only two scenarios can easily lead to fatuous decision making. In such problems like the one I posited in my &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; a sensible decision-making procedure is the maximum likelihood method; pick the decision that gives the highest payoff in the most likely scenario. However, even that heuristic may not be advisable; what if Scenario \(i\) as a probability of \(0.5 - \epsilon\) and the second scenario \(j\) has a probability of \(0.5 + \epsilon\)? Merely relying on the maximum likelihood heuristic is unwise. \(epsilon\) here stands for a small number&mdash;the definition of small is left to the user&rsquo;s discretion.
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">After much deliberation, I reached a conclusion; in any non&mdash;iterated game in which a single scenario has an overwhelming high probability \(Pr = 1 - \epsilon\), then the maximum likelihood approach is the rational decision-making approach. Personally, I believe \(\epsilon\) should be \(\ge 0.005\) and set mine at around \(0.1\).</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">I may in future revisit this writeup, and add a mathematical argument for the application of the Maximum likelihood approach over the Expected Utility approach but for now, I shall posit a simpler argument:</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px; border-left-width: 3px; border-left-color: #eeeeee; padding-left: 13px;"">The Expected Utility approach is sensible only in that it maximises winnings in the long run&mdash;by its very design, it is intended for games that are iterated and/or in which there is a large number of scenarios. In games where this is not true&mdash;with few scenarios and a single instance&mdash;there is sufficient variation in the event that occurs that there is a significant deviation of the actual payoff from the expected payoff. To ignore this deviation is oversimplification, and&mdash;I&rsquo;ll argue&mdash;irrational. In the experiment I listed above, the actual payoff for the second decision was \$0 or \$10,000,000; the former scenario having a likelihood of 90\% and the latter a 10\%. The expected value is \$1,000,000 but the standard deviation of the payoffs from the expected value&mdash;in this case \$3,000,000&mdash;is 300\% the mean. In such cases, I conclude that the expected utility approach is simply unreliable&mdash;and expectably so&mdash;it was never designed for such problems in the first place (pun intended).</blockquote>

<p style=""margin: 0px;"">Eliezer Yudkowsky defines instrumental rationality as &ldquo;systematically achieving your values&rdquo; and goes on to say: &ldquo;Instrumental rationality, on the other hand, is about steering reality&mdash;sending the future where you want it to go. It&rsquo;s the art of choosing actions that lead to outcomes ranked higher in your preferences. I sometimes call this &lsquo;winning.&rsquo;&rdquo; [1]<br />&nbsp;<br />I agree with Yudkowsky&rsquo;s concept of rationality as a method for systematised winning. It is why I decided to pursue rationality&mdash;that I may win. However, I personally disagree with the notion of &ldquo;systematically achieving your values&rdquo; simply because I think it is too vague. What are my values? Happiness and personal satisfaction? I find that you can maximise this by joining a religious organisation, in fact I think I was happiest in a time before I discovered the Way. But this isn&rsquo;t the most relevant, maximising your values isn&rsquo;t specific enough for my taste, it&rsquo;s too vague for me.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Likewise, decision theory defines what action I should take based on my beliefs. For any consistent set of beliefs and preferences I could have about Bob, there is a decision-theoretic answer to how I should then act in order to satisfy my preferences.&rdquo; [2]<br />&nbsp;<br />This implies that instrumental rationality is specific; from the above statement, I infer:<br />&ldquo;For any decision problem to any rational agent with a specified psyche, there is only one correct choice to make.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />However, if we only seek to systematically achieve our values, I believe that instrumental rationality fails to be specific&mdash;it is possible that there&rsquo;s more than one solution to a problem in which we merely seek to maximise or values. I cherish the specificity of rationality; there is a certain comfort, in knowing that there is a single correct solution to any problem, a right decision to make for any game&mdash;one merely need find it. As such, I sought a definition of rationality that I personally agree with; one that satisfies my criteria for specificity; one that satisfies my criteria for winning. The answer I arrived at was: &ldquo;Rationality is systematically achieving your&nbsp;<em>goals</em>.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />I love the above definition; it is specific&mdash;gone is the vagueness and uncertainty of achieving values. It is simple&mdash;gone is the worry over whether value X should be an instrumental value or a terminal value. Above all, it is useful&mdash;I know whether or not I have achieved my goals, and I can motivate myself more to achieve them. Rather than thinking about vague values I think about my life in terms of goals:<br />&ldquo;I have goal X how do I achieve it?&rdquo;<br />If necessary, I can specify sub goals and sub goals for those sub goals. I find that thinking about your life in terms of goals to be achieved is a more conducive model for problem solving, a more efficient model&mdash;a useful model. I am many things, and above them all I am a utilitist&mdash;the worth of any entity is determined by its utility to me. I find the model of rationality as a goal enabler a more useful model.<br />&nbsp;<br />Goals and values are not always aligned. For example, consider the problem below:</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 1em 0px; border-left-width: 3px; border-left-color: #eeeeee; padding-left: 13px;"">Jane is the captain of a boat full with 100 people. The ship is about to capsize and would, unless ten people are sacrificed. Jane&rsquo;s goal is to save as many people as possible. Jane&rsquo;s values hold human lives sacred. Sacrificing ten people has a 100% chance of saving 90 people, while sacrificing no one and going with plan delta has a 10% chance to save the 100, and a 90% chance for everyone to die.
<p style=""margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">The sanctity of human life is a terminal value for Jane. Jane when seeking to actualise her values, may well choose to go with plan delta, which has a 90% chance to prevent her from achieving her goals.<br />&nbsp;<br />Values may be misaligned with goals, values may be inhibiting towards achieving our goals. Winning isn&rsquo;t achieving your values; winning is achieving your&nbsp;<em>goals</em>.<br /></p>

<p style=""margin: 0px;"">I feel it is apt to define goals at this juncture, lest the definition be perverted and only goals aligned with values be considered &ldquo;true/good goals&rdquo;.<br />&nbsp;<br />Goals are any objectives a self aware agent consciously assigns itself to accomplish.<br />&nbsp;<br />There are no true goals, no false goals, no good goals, no bad goals, no worthy goals, no worthless goals; there are just goals.<br />&nbsp;<br />I do not consider goals something that &ldquo;exist to affirm/achieve values""&mdash;you may assign yourself goals that affirm your values, or goals that run contrary to them&mdash;the difference is irrelevant, we work to achieve those goals you have specified.<br /></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 19px; margin: 15px 0px; line-height: 1.16; font-family: Gibson, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 400;"">The Psyche</h2>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">The Psyche is an objective map that describes a self-aware agent that functions as a decision maker&mdash;rational or not. The sum total of an individual&rsquo;s beliefs&mdash;all knowledge is counted as belief&mdash;values and goals form their psyche. The psyche is unique to each individual. The psyche is not a subjective evaluation of an individual by themselves, but an objective evaluation of the individual as they would appear to an omniscient observer. An individual&rsquo;s psyche includes the totality of their map. The psyche is&mdash; among other things&mdash;a map that describes a map so to speak.<br />&nbsp;<br />When a decision problem is considered, the optimum solution to such a problem cannot be considered without considering the psyche of that individual. The values that individual holds, the goals they seek to achieve and their mental map of the world.<br />&nbsp;<br />Eliezer Yudkowsky seems to believe that we have an extremely limited ability to alter our psyche. He posits, that we can&rsquo;t choose to believe the sky is green at will. I never really bought this, and especially due to personal anecdotal evidence. Yet, I&rsquo;ll come back to altering beliefs later.<br />&nbsp;<br />Yudkowsky describes the human psyche as: &ldquo;a lens that sees its own flaws&rdquo;. [3] I personally would extend this definition; we are not merely &ldquo;a lens that sees its own flaws&rdquo;, we are also &ldquo;a lens that corrects itself&rdquo;&mdash;the self-aware AI that can alter its own code. The psyche can be altered at will&mdash;or so I argue.<br />&nbsp;<br />I shall start with values. Values are neither permanent nor immutable. I&rsquo;ve had a slew of values over the years; while Christian, I valued faith, now I adhere to Thomas Huxley&rsquo;s maxim:</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 1em 0px; border-left-width: 3px; border-left-color: #eeeeee; padding-left: 13px;"">Scepticism is the highest of duties; blind faith the one unpardonable sin.
<p style=""margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">Another one: prior to my enlightenment I held emotional reasoning in high esteem, and could be persuaded by emotional arguments, after my enlightenment I upheld rational reasoning. Okay, that isn&rsquo;t entirely true; my answer to the boat problem had always been to sacrifice the ten people, so that doesn&rsquo;t exactly work, but I was more emotional then, and could be swayed by emotional arguments. Before I discovered the Way earlier this year (when I was fumbling around in the dark searching for rationality) I viewed all emotion as irrational, and my values held logic and reason above all. Back then, I was a true apath, and completely unfeeling. I later read arguments for the utility of emotions, and readjusted my values accordingly. I have readjusted my values several times along the journey of life; just recently, I repressed my values relating to pleasure from feeding&mdash;to aid my current routine of intermittent fasting. I similarly repressed my values of sexual arousal/pleasure&mdash;I felt it will make me more competent. Values can be altered, and I suspect many of us have done it at least once in our lives&mdash;we are the lens that corrects itself.</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">Getting back to belief (whether you can choose to believe the sky is green at will) I argue that you can, it is just a little more complicated than altering your values. Changing your beliefs&mdash;changing your actual anticipation controllers&mdash;truly redrawing the map, would require certain alterations to your psyche in order for it to retain a semblance of consistency. In order to be able to believe the sky is green, you would have to:</p>
<ul style=""margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"">
<li>Repress your values that make you desire true beliefs.</li>
<li>Repress your values that make you give priority to empirical evidence.</li>
<li>Repress your vales that make you sceptical. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Create (or grow if you already have one) a new value that supports blind faith.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-weight: 700;"">Optional:</span></p>
<ul style=""margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"">
<li>Repress your values that support curiosity.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Create (or grow if you already have one) a new value that supports ignorance.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">By the time, you&rsquo;ve done the &lsquo;edits&rsquo; listed above, you would be able to freely believe that the sky is green, or snow is black, or that the earth rests on the back of a giant turtle, or a teapot floats in the asteroid belt. I&rsquo;m warning you though, by the time you&rsquo;ve successfully accomplished the edits above, your psyche would be completely different from now, and you will be&mdash;I argue&mdash;a different person. If any of you were worried that the happiness of stupidity was forever closed to you, then fear not; it is open to you again&mdash;if you truly desire it. Be forewarned; the &ldquo;you&rdquo; that would embrace it would be different from the &ldquo;you&rdquo; now, and not one I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d want to associate with. The psyche is alterable; we are the masters of our own mind&mdash;the lens that corrects itself.<br />&nbsp;<br />I do not posit, that we can alter all of our psyche (I suspect that there are aspects of cognitive machinery that are unalterable; &ldquo;hardcoded&rdquo; so to speak. However, my neuroscience is non-existent&mdash;as such I shall leave this issue to those more equipped to comment on it.<br /></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 19px; margin: 15px 0px; line-height: 1.16; font-family: Gibson, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 400;"">Values as Tools</h2>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">In my conception of instrumental rationality, values are no longer put on a pedestal, they are no longer sacred; there are no more terminal values anymore&mdash;only instrumental. Values aren&rsquo;t the masters anymore, they&rsquo;re slaves&mdash;they&rsquo;re tools.<br />&nbsp;<br />The notion of values as tools may seem disturbing for some, but I find it to be quite a useful model, and such I shall keep it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Take the ship problem Jane was presented with above, had Jane deleted her value which held human life as sacred, she would have been able to make the decision with the highest probability of achieving her goals. She could even add a value that suppressed empathy, to assist her in similar situations&mdash;though some might feel that is overkill. I once asked a question on a particular subreddit:<br />&ldquo;Is altruism rational?&rdquo;<br />My reply was a quick and dismissive:<br />&ldquo;Rationality doesn&rsquo;t tell you what values to have, it only tells you how to achieve them.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />The answer was the standard textbook reply that anyone who had read the sequences or RAZ (Rationality: From AI to Zombies) would produce; I had read neither at the time. Nonetheless, I was reading HPMOR (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), and that did sound like something Harry would say. After downloading my own copy of RAZ, I found that the answer was indeed correct&mdash;as long as I accepted Yudkowsky&rsquo;s conception of instrumental rationality. Now that I reject it, and consider rationality as a tool to enable goals, I have a more apt response:</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 1em 0px; border-left-width: 3px; border-left-color: #eeeeee; padding-left: 13px;"">What are your goals?
<p style=""margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">If your goals are to have a net positive effect on the world (do good so to speak) then altruism may be a rational value to have. If your goals are far more selfish, then altruism may only serve as a hindrance.</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">The utility of &ldquo;Values as Tools&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just that some values may harm your goals, nay it does much more. The payoff of a decision is determined by two things:</p>
<ol style=""margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"">
<li>How much closer it brings you to the realisation of your goals?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How much it aligns with your values?</li>
</ol>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;<br />Choosing values that are doubly correlated with your current goals (you actualise your values when you make goal conducive decisions, and you run opposite to your values when you make goal deleterious decisions) exaggerates the positive payoff of goal conducive decisions, and the negative payoff of goal deleterious decisions. This aggrandising of the payoffs of decisions serves as a strong motivator towards making goal conducive decisions&mdash; large rewards, large punishment&mdash;a perfect propulsion system so to speak.</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 1em 0px; border-left-width: 3px; border-left-color: #eeeeee; padding-left: 13px;"">The utility of the &ldquo;Values as Tools&rdquo; approach is that it serves as a strong motivator towards goal conducive decision making.</blockquote>

<p style=""margin: 0px;"">It has been brought to my attention that a life such as the one I describe may be &ldquo;an unsatisfying life&rdquo; and &ldquo;a life not worth living&rdquo;. I may reply that I do not seek to maximise happiness, but that may be dodging the issue; I first conceived rationality as a value decider when thinking about how I would design an AI&mdash;it goes without saying that humans are not computers.</p>
<p style=""margin: 1em 0px 0px;"">I offer a suggestion: order your current values in a scale of preference. Note the value (or set thereof) utmost in your scale of preference. The value that if you had to achieve only one value, that you would choose. Pick a goal that is aligned with that value (or set thereof). That goal shall be called your &ldquo;prime goal&rdquo;.The moment you pick your prime goal, you fix it. From now on, you no longer change your goals to align with your values. You change your values to align with your goals. Your aim in life is to achieve your prime goal, and you pick values and subgoals that would help you achieve your prime goal.<br /></p>

<p>Shortness Status: Long (this is a proposed new norm I want to try out, in the sense of &#8216;apologies for writing a long letter, I did not have enough time to write a shorter one.&#8217; By contrast, <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/against-facebook/"">Against Facebook</a> was longer in words, but would be short.)</p>
<p>Weapons of Math Destruction is an easy read, but a frustrating one.</p>
<p>The book claims to be about the misuse of big data and machine learning to guide decisions, how that harms people and leads to bad outcomes, and how to fix it. The distortions of aiming at and rewarding what we are measuring rather than what we actually want worries me more and more. It is one of the biggest issues of our age, so I was excited to read a new take on it, even if I expected to already know the bulk of the facts and ideas presented.</p>
<p>There is some of that in the book, and those parts provide some useful information, although if you are reading this you likely already know a lot of it.</p>
<p><span id=""more-6107""></span></p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>What the book is actually mostly about on its surface, alas, is how bad and unfair it is to be a Bayesian. There are two reasons, in her mind, why using algorithms to be a Bayesian is <em>just awful. </em></p>
<p>The first objection is that probabilistic algorithms are probabilistic. It is <em>just awful </em>that predictive algorithms are used to decide who should get or keep a job, or get cheaper credit, or see certain advertisements, because the algorithm <em>might be wrong. </em>Look at this example of someone the algorithm got wrong! Look at this reason the algorithm got it wrong! Look how <em>wrong </em>it is! Clearly we need to rely on humans, who get things wrong more often, but do so in a less systematic fashion so we can&#8217;t prove exactly why any given human got something wrong.</p>
<p>The second objection is that algorithms rank people and options likely to be better above people and options likely to be worse. It is <em>just awful </em>that an algorithm notices that people who have bad credit, or live in a certain zip code, or shop at a certain store, or share some other trait, are either a worse or a better business proposition. You see, this is <em>not fair </em>and probably makes you a <em>racist. </em>This is because the people who are ranked either worse or better tend to be <em>poor, </em>and/or they tend to be <em>not white, </em>and that is <em>just awful. </em>If the resulting system gives them more attention in some way &#8211; say, by marketing to them to sell them things they might want and offering them discounts, or providing them with more government attention &#8211; then you are taking advantage of them, being a predator and destroying their lives, which you should at least have the common decency to do without an algorithm. If the resulting system gives them less attention in some way, by not marketing to them and charging them more, or by providing them with less government attention &#8211; then you are discriminating against them by denying them opportunities and services, which is <em>not fair.</em> Once again, you could at least have the decency to do this without an algorithm so no one can be sure exactly how you made your decisions.<em> </em>And again, since this is likely correlated with race, that also makes you a <em>racist. </em>Which is of course <em>just awful. </em></p>
<p>These evil algorithms are sneaky. If you give them race as an input, they&#8217;ll pick up on the correlations involved and show how racist they (and you) are. Since you of course are not racist, you hide that data (but of course she will blame you for that too, since if you hide that data, we can&#8217;t see just how racist you truly are). So instead the evil algorithms notice things that are correlated with race, like income or zip code, and use those instead. So then you try to hide <em>those, </em>and then the algorithms get even sneakier and start picking up on other things that correlate in less direct ways. Or even worse, perhaps they do a good job of figuring out the actual answer, and the actual answer happens to be correlated with some trait you have to <em>be fair to </em>and therefore the algorithm is <em>just awful. </em></p>
<p>She also doesn&#8217;t like it when humans make similar decisions without the use of algorithms, but somehow that makes it better, because you can&#8217;t point to the rule that did it. Besides, did you really expect the humans to ignore data they have and act against their own interests? Well, yes, she and similar people do expect this, or at least think not doing so is <em>just awful, </em>but they understand that there are limits.</p>
<p>She never uses the term, but basically she is arguing against disparate impact when compared against completely random decisions &#8211; that in the end, for a given set of groups, if a system does not result in <em>equal outcomes </em>for that group, it is<em> not fair </em>to that group, and for some groups this is <em>just awful </em>and means we need to ban the system, and force people to use worse systems instead that are bad proxies for what you are trying to measure. Then you complain about how the proxies are.</p>
<p>That is not the most charitable way of describing the argument being made, but I do not think it is a straw man, either. This is what the author explicitly claims to believe.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>In something that is not a coincidence, the way I react to such arguments was brought home by Sarah&#8217;s excellent recent post, <a href=""https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/05/30/the-face-of-the-ice/"">The Face of the Ice.</a> There are man versus man stories, where we are competing for resources including social and sexual status, and then there are man versus nature stories where we are talking about survival. When dealing with potentially big issues, ones that can threaten our very survival, the temptation is to refuse to realize or admit that, and instead focus on the man versus man aspects and how you or the groups you like are being treated <em>unfairly </em>and how that is <em>just awful. </em></p>
<p>Thus, people talk about the unemployment that will be caused by self-driving cars instead of thinking, whoa, this will transform our entire society and way of life and supercharge our ability to move around both people and goods and maybe we should be both super excited and super worried about that for bigger reasons. People see that we are developing artificial intelligence&#8230; and worry about whether it will be racist or sexist, or our plans for income redistribution, rather than <em>what to do with orders of magnitude more wealth </em>and <em>whether it will </em><em>wipe out the human race because we are made of atoms it could use for something else, and also wipe out all utility in the universe</em>. Which are questions I spend a lot of time on, since they seem rather important.  But if you admit that the problems are that big, you would have to stop playing zero sum status games.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The good news is that the author does provide some good starting points to thinking about some of the <em>real </em>problems of big data. Rather than discard the facts that do not fit her narrative, she to her credit shares them anyway. She then tends to move on without noticing the implications of those thoughts, but my standards are low enough that I consider that a win. She also has the strange habit of noting that the thing she is talking about isn&#8217;t <em>really </em>a &#8216;weapon of math destruction&#8217; but it has the <em>potential </em>to be one if things went a little farther in the direction they are headed.</p>
<p>One could even engage in a Straussian reading of the book. In this reading, the real problem is the distortions and destructive games that result from big data algorithms. The constant warnings about the poor are real enough, and point out real problems we should address, but are more important as illustrations of <em>how important it will be for us to get good treatment from the algorithms. </em>At its most basic level, you are poor, so the algorithm treats you badly, and you fix that by not being poor. Not being poor is a good idea anyway, so that works out well. If we start using more and more convoluted proxies? We might have a much bigger problem.</p>
<p>(The unspoken next line is, of course, that if we use these proxies as optimization targets or training data for true artificial intelligence, that would be infinitely worse, but I do not think she gave such issues any thought whatsoever.)</p>
<p>This is why her best discussion is about college rankings. She makes the case that it is primarily the US News &amp; World Report college rankings, and the choices those rankings made, that have caused the explosion in tuition and the awful red queen&#8217;s race between different colleges. While I am not fully convinced, she did convince me that the rankings are a much more important cause than I realized.</p>
<p>My abstraction of her story is simple. Before the ratings, everyone knew vaguely what the best universities were (e.g. Harvard and Yale), and by looking carefully one could figure out vaguely how good a school was, but it was very difficult to know much beyond that. The world silently cried out for a rating system, and US News &amp; World Report made the first credible attempt at creating such a system. They chose a whole bunch of things that one could reasonably assume would correlate with quality, such as selectivity of admissions and the accomplishments of graduates, along with a few things that one could at least hope would be correlated with quality, especially if you were measuring and thus controlling for other factors, such as graduation rates. Then, to make sure the ratings had a shot at looking reasonable rather than weird, they included a survey they sent out to colleges.</p>
<p>What they did not include was the cost of tuition, because higher tuition correlates with higher quality, and they wanted the &#8216;high quality&#8217; colleges like Harvard to come out on top, not whatever state university turned out to be the best value for your dollar.</p>
<p>The result of this was a credible list that students and potential faculty and those evaluating students and faculty could use to evaluate institutional quality. Eventually, the ratings evolved to include less weight on the surveys and more on various measurements. Students used the guide as a key input in choosing where to go to college, which was reasonable since their alternative measurements were terrible. Those evaluating those students <em>also </em>used the guide, especially since admission rates were a key input, so going to a top rated college became an advantage in and of itself, even if the rating wasn&#8217;t based on anything.</p>
<p>Since everyone in the system was now using the ratings as a key input in their evaluations, colleges then started devoting a lot of attention to moving up in those ratings, and other similar ratings that came later. A lot of that effort meant improving the quality of the university, especially at first. Some places (she uses the example of TCU) invested in athletics to attract better students and move up. Others worked to make sure students did what they needed to do in order to graduate, or helped their students find good jobs, or even just tried to improve the quality of the education their kids got.</p>
<p>Then there were those who tried to pass the test without learning the material. Some tried to get more applicants to look more selective. I had a personal experience with this. Stanford University sent me a nice card congratulating me on my qualifying for the USAMO, and asked me to consider their fine educational institution. This was before I had started my ongoing war with San Francisco, so I would have welcomed a chance to go to that institution, but my high school only allowed us to apply to seven colleges, and my GPA was substantially below the lowest GPA anyone at my high school had ever had while being accepted to Stanford. My rough math put my chances of admission at 0%, so I had no intent of wasting one of my precious seven slots on them instead of a place I might actually gain admission.</p>
<p>My parents did not understand this. All they saw was that Stanford had asked me to apply, and Stanford was awesome so I was applying to Stanford, whether I liked it or not. This led to me having an admissions officer from Stanford on the phone, telling her that both of us knew Stanford was never going to accept me, and would she <em>please just tell my parents that for the love of God. </em>I didn&#8217;t want to plead my case for admission because I knew I had none, I knew that and she knew that, but of course revealing this doesn&#8217;t help Stanford so she kept saying that of course every application is carefully considered and we hope you can welcome you to the class of 2001.</p>
<p>This was the first time someone from San Francisco decided to act superficially nice while screwing up my life for the tiniest possible gain to themselves. It was not the last.</p>
<p>In any case, this problem has since gotten much worse. At least back then I knew my safety schools would accept me, whereas now schools that notice you are &#8216;too good&#8217; for them will reject you, because you&#8217;re not going to attend anyway, so why not improve their numbers instead of holding out the vain hope that they were the only place not to notice your criminal record, or worse, your sexist Facebook post? Thus the game gets ever more frustrating and complicated, and punishes even more those who refuse to play it.</p>
<p>All of these games cost money to play, but you know what the schools aren&#8217;t being rated on? That&#8217;s right, tuition! So they are free to spend ever more money on all the things, and charge accordingly, and the students see this as another sign of a quality institution. She doesn&#8217;t mention student loans, which massively contribute to this problem. This is consistent with her other blind spots, since student loans are good and increased tuition is bad, but that story does not conflict with the story being told here, and I did update in favor of tulip ratings mattering more and<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/06/against-tulip-subsidies/""> tulip subsidies</a> mattering less.</p>
<p>Would a lot of that have happened anyway? Certainly, especially given that other ratings would have come out instead. But it seems logical that when a decision can be distilled down into a pretty good number that considers some but not all factors, then people will focus on gaming that number, and the factors that don&#8217;t improve that number will be ignored even if they matter more. Goodhart&#8217;s Demon will win the day.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Other sections are less convincing, but I will go over them quickly.</p>
<p>She talks about getting a job, and how bad it is that there are algorithms evaluating people. Even more than elsewhere in the book, it felt like she was <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/js/the_bottom_line/"">writing the bottom line</a>. This resulted in some confused arguments that she knew were not good, but that she used either because she believes her conclusion or because you should be using a Straussian reading.</p>
<p>The first argument against algorithms in employment is that sometimes they miss out on a good employee. While obviously true, this isn&#8217;t saying much, since every other method known to man does this, and most do it far more often, so this objection is like calling self-driving cars unsafe because they might kill people 10% as often as human drivers, instead of human drivers who I am confident do it 100% as often.</p>
<p>The second argument is that the algorithms are used in many different places, so different decisions will be correlated, and those who score poorly won&#8217;t be able to find a job at all, whereas in the old method different places used different systems so you could just keep applying and eventually someone would take a liking to you and give you a chance. This does point to the paradox that it <em>seems </em>like it is easier to get a job if everyone&#8217;s ratings are different, despite the fact that the same number of people end up with jobs, so it cannot be easier <em>in general </em>to find a job, rather than increasing the returns to perseverance: The randomized ratings make it harder to find a job on the first try, because you face more other applicants that will be rated highly (since they do not automatically find jobs due to the random factor). However, if you apply a lot more than others, your chances go up, whereas if every job uses a common application, more tries does not help you much, and a low scorer is drawing dead.</p>
<p>In some sense this change is good, since it means less time wasted with job applications and results in better matching, but in another sense it is bad because it cuts out the signal of how much the applicant cares. Having to apply for lots of jobs in order to find one means that those who want jobs the most will get the jobs (or the better jobs) since they will send the costly signal of applying more often, whereas in the algorithmic world, that confers no advantage, so those who need a job the most could be shut out by those who don&#8217;t care much. Costly signals can be good! So there&#8217;s at least some argument here, if it is too hard for the algorithm to measure how much you want the job.</p>
<p>The problem of a mistake-making algorithm is also self-correcting in a free market. If the algorithm makes mistakes, which of course it does, and enough of your competition follow its recommendations, you can get great employees at discount prices with high motivation by having humans look carefully to find the good employees the algorithm is turning down. This is especially true if the algorithm is using proxies for race, class, sex or other such categories (argument three that she uses) since those are known to throw out a lot of great people. She answers her own third objection by pointing out that the old system of &#8216;get a friend to recommend you&#8217; is overall more discriminatory in the bad sense, on every axis both good and bad, than any algorithm being used in the wild.</p>
<p>Her talk about what happens on the job is similar. Yes, these algorithms make mistakes and sometimes evaluate good teachers as bad teachers. Yes, some of them have tons of noise in them. But what is the alternative? If these systems are not on average improvements why are corporations (and governments) using them more and more? The argument she relies on, that sometimes the algorithms make dumb mistakes, is very weak. Humans make really, really dumb mistakes all the time.</p>
<p>What she does not mention in either section, but is the real issue with such things, is that the system will be gamed and that gaming it might take over people&#8217;s lives. This is even more glaring due to her using teachers as an example, as teaching to the test is rapidly taking over all of primary and secondary education (or so I am told). Teaching was already a thankless job, and it seems like it is becoming more and more of a hell every year.</p>
<p>If there is an algorithm that will determine who can get hired for entry-level jobs, how long will it take before people learn what it is looking for? How long after that do they start sculpting their resumes and answers to that algorithm? How long after that do they start to post on Facebook what the system wants to see, take the classes it wants them to take, buy the products the algorithm wants to see them buy? Where does it end? Do we all end up consulting a get-hired strategy guide before we choose a pizza place, unless we already have a job, in which case we consult the get-promoted guide?</p>
<p>Then how does the algorithm respond to <em>that </em>action, and how do we respond in kind? How deep does this go?</p>
<p>Those questions terrify me. They don&#8217;t keep me up at night, because I belong to the General Mathis school of not letting things keep me up at night (this is why <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/05/24/how-to-destroy-civilization/"">I had to quit the online game of Advanced Civilization</a>), but they are a reasonable choice if you need something to do that for you.</p>
<p>She also notes that a lot of this involves using increasingly convoluted and strange measures, such as mysterious &#8216;e-scores&#8217; and personality tests, that do not correlate all that well with results, and which she assumes tend to be discriminatory. She contrasts this to IQ tests and credit scores, which are much better predictors and tend to discriminate less and be more &#8216;fair&#8217; because they only measure what you have done and what you can do, rather than what category of person your past signals that you belong to. She then demands that we do something about this outrage.</p>
<p>I agree with her that IQ tests and credit scores sound way better. It is a real shame that we decided to make it illegal to use them in hiring decisions. So if we want better measures, there&#8217;s a solution. I don&#8217;t think she is going to like it.</p>
<p>The section on insurance brings up the paradox of insurance. As the purchaser, you have a bunch of knowledge about how likely you are to need insurance. As the insurer, the company has some information it can use to estimate how likely you are to need it, and how much it will cost them when you do. There are then two problems. The first is that if many people only buy when your hidden information says you will need the insurance, and/or when you intend to engage in behaviors that make the insurance more valuable, then it becomes very hard to sell anyone insurance. That&#8217;s classic and she doesn&#8217;t talk much about it, because it is the consumer benefiting at the expense of a corporation, but if there was a big data algorithm that the <em>consumer </em>could use to decide how much insurance to buy, what would that do to the insurance market? What would happen if it was illegal for the seller of insurance to look at it, or the calculation required too much private data? Could insurance markets collapse? Is this in our future?</p>
<p>Instead she talks about problem two, which is if the insurer uses the information they know to decide who is likely to need insurance, they might start charging different amounts to different people. This would result in people being effectively charged money for their life histories and decisions, which is of course <em>just awful. </em>If poor people cost more to insure, for example (and she says that in many cases this is true), they might have to pay more. As you might guess, I am not sympathetic. This sounds like people paying for the additional costs that their decisions and lifestyles create. This should result in people making better decisions. If this has bad distributional consequences, which it might, the right answer is progressive taxation and redistribution (to the extent that you find this desirable).</p>
<p>Again, she misses that the real problem would be if people started trying to <em>change the outcome of the algorithm </em>and whether the system would be robust enough to get them to do this via &#8216;do thing that actually decreases expected insurance payouts and is socially good&#8217; rather than &#8216;do thing that manipulates the system but does not actually accomplish anything.&#8217; She does hint at this a bit when she talks about wellness systems put in place by employers, and how they are sometimes imposing stupid lifestyle costs on employees, but she thinks of this as corporations trying to steal wages by charging some employees more fees, rather than as corporations trying to use algorithms to improve employee health, and the problems that result from that disaster.</p>
<p>This pattern is quite frustrating, as she keeps touching on important and interesting questions, only to pull back to focus on less interesting and less important ones.</p>
<p>One real concern she does point out is that some insurance companies use their systems to figure out who is likely to do more comparison shopping, and give higher prices to those likely to do less comparison shopping. Humans do this all the time, of course, but that does not make it a good thing. When an algorithm makes something easier to do, it can increase the harm and force us to confront something that wasn&#8217;t previously worth confronting. If everyone does this to you, and <em>all </em>the companies raise your prices by 10%, you&#8217;re paying 10% more no matter how much you shop around. Then again, it would be very much to a company&#8217;s advantage to have a way for you to tell them that no really you <em>did </em>comparison shop, since figuring out what that signal is represents a costly signal that you will actually put in the work to comparison shop, so this equilibrium also seems unstable, which makes me worry about it less. There&#8217;s also the issue of comparison websites, which also credibly signal that the user is doing comparison shopping.</p>
<p>Finding credit, another of her sections, is another place where we are already at the phase of everyone gaming the system all the time. When I moved out to Denver, I couldn&#8217;t get any credit. This made me quite angry, since I had always paid all my bills, but it turns out that the algorithms think that if you have not borrowed money, you might not pay borrowed money back. As a human, I think that if you never borrow money, it&#8217;s a great sign that you don&#8217;t need to, so of course you&#8217;ll pay it back (and thought this was obvious logic, and that the way you convince the bank to give you a loan is to prove that you don&#8217;t need one).</p>
<p>As a result, I had to get a pre-paid credit card so that I could <em>explicitly owe someone money </em>and then pay them back, even though I didn&#8217;t <em>really </em>ever owe anyone anything, so that I could then get a regular credit card with a tiny limit, so I could <em>actually owe someone money for real, </em>and pay <em>that </em>back, and so on in a cycle until a few years later when I get periodic new credit card offers in the mail with giant credit lines. We pay our bills on time in large part to protect our credit ratings, and also do other things to help our credit ratings. In this case, the system seems stable. If we decide that group of things X gives you a high credit rating, then the willingness to do lots of X is a great sign that you are worthy of credit even if X has nothing to do with anything! If you take the time to make sure your credit report looks good, I do in fact trust you to pay your bills.</p>
<p>This is an example of a great outcome, and it would be good to put more thought into how we got there. A strong argument she could make, but does not make (at least explicitly) is that we got there because credit ratings <em>exclude lots of data they could use, but choose not to </em>thus giving people control over those ratings in important ways, and preventing those ratings from intruding on the rest of our lives. Of course, the right way to respond to this is to allow people to use credit ratings for more things, thus crowding out other measures that use data we would rather not involve, instead of banning credit scores, which invites the use of whatever data we can find.</p>
<p>The sections on online advertising and civic life did not seem to raise any new and interesting concerns, so I&#8217;m going to skip over them, other than to echo her and issue the periodic public service announcement that for profit universities are almost all scams or near scams, you should never, ever, ever use them, and anything that gives them access to potential victims is scum and deserves to burn in hell.</p>

<p>I would say that given my expectations, the book was about a 50th percentile result. That&#8217;s not a disaster, but it is a failure, because book utility has a huge fat positive tail. Given you have read this far, I can&#8217;t recommend that you read the book, since I do not think you would get much more out of reading the whole thing. If you are especially interested, though, it is a quick and mostly painless read and does have some useful facts in it I glossed over, so you could do a lot worse. I certainly do worse with my time reasonably often.</p><br />  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/thezvi.wordpress.com/6107/""><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/thezvi.wordpress.com/6107/"" /></a> <img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thezvi.wordpress.com&#038;blog=21007166&#038;post=6107&#038;subd=thezvi&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />",Zvi,zvi,Zvi,
pAoJfDMxvriivzcF2,"Rationalist Seder: Dayenu, Lo Dayenu",rationalist-seder-dayenu-lo-dayenu,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pAoJfDMxvriivzcF2/rationalist-seder-dayenu-lo-dayenu,2017-06-04T20:55:50.836Z,7,2,2,False,False,,"<p>There's one more piece of the NYC Rationalist Seder Haggadah that I wanted to pull out, to refer to in isolation. I think is quite relevant to some current concerns in the evolving Rationality Community, and which is interesting in particular because of how it's evolved over the past 6 years.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayenu"">""Dayenu"" is a traditional Jewish song</a>, roughly a thousand years old. It describes a number of gifts that God gave the Jewish people. For each gift/verse, lyrics culminate with ""Dayenu"", or ""it would have been enough.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the first rationalist Seder, Zvi made two, ahem, rather significant changes to the song.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first dealt with the fact that, well, we're basically a bunch of atheists, and even if we weren't, God slaying a bunch of firstborn children just isn't the sort of thing we're super in favor of these days.</p>
<p>The second change dealt with that that... obviously each individual miracle *wouldn't* have been enough to free the Jewish people. Freeing them from Egypt but not parting the Red Sea to let escape when Pharoah has second thoughts would very much *not* have been sufficient. <br /><br />And beyond that, Less Wrong culture is emphatically based around the status quo <em>not being satisfactory. </em>To constantly aspire to something better.</p>
<p>Zvi's new version of the song told the story of human history, and it did so from the framing of ""Lo Dayenu"" - not enough. If we had discovered fire, but not developed agriculture, our journey would not have been finished.<br /><br />But, in the spirit of <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/p23/dragon_army_theory_charter_30min_read/"">cultural pendulums that swim back and forth to overcompensate for previous failures</a>, a years later Daniel Speyer took a second pass at revising the song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Traditionally, we sing &ldquo;Dayenu&rdquo;: it would have been enough.</em></p>
<p><em>Our sages asked: what do we mean by this? &nbsp;In some of the traditional pairings, one step without the next would have left us all dead! &nbsp;How can that be enough? &nbsp;And it was answered: celebrate each step toward freedom as if it were enough, then start out on the next step. If we reject each step because it is not the whole liberation, we will never achieve the whole liberation.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet, if we celebrate our past victories and become complacent, so too will we never achieve the whole liberation. &nbsp;And so we have come to sing &ldquo;Lo Dayenu&rdquo;: it would not have been enough.</em></p>
<p><em>And it has almost been said, &ldquo;Keep two truths in your pocket, and take them out according to the need of the moment. &nbsp;Let one be, &lsquo;we have achieved great things&rsquo; and the other be &lsquo;we have a terribly long way yet to go&rsquo;.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Determining which moment needs which truth is left as an exercise for the reader.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lately I've been thinking about the tension between trying to hold the community to a higher standard, without making people feel judged, or not good enough. And relatedly, how to set standards for a given space that is communicated and enforced fairly, but acknowledges that different people are at different points on their own journey. Holding both truths in your head at the same time feels pertinent.<br /><br />I'll delve more into that in a future blogpost. Meanwhile, here's the current text of the song as sung by the NYC community, which alternates between the two concepts.<br /><br />[Notes: A) This is the sort of song designed to be sung by people who've had 3 glasses of wine. B) ""Dayenu"" and ""Lo Dayenu"" end up getting stressed fairly differently to make them scan. The former is ""Daaa-yeee-nuu"", the latter is ""Looo Daaa yenu.""]</p>

That is, people generally go to see psychologists and psychiatrists because they or others are unhappy with how they are thinking or behaving. This attention to error and correction makes most of applied psychology a kind of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback"">negative feedback</a> process aiming to normalize thoughts and behaviors within desired tolerances. People find this psychopathological approach useful as far as it goes, but it leaves out ways of using psychology in positive feedback loops to help people achieve more than normal. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology"">Positive psychology</a> focuses on this.</p><p>Some folks, however, take a <a href=""http://www.dylankerrigan.com/opeds/the-happiness-scam"">negative view</a> of positive psychology. From what I can surmise, they hold this view because of positive psychology’s association with self-help, life coaching, and leadership training — domains where rationalization can often pass for explanation and hucksters can operate as long as they are sufficiently charismatic. And although plenty of folks are working on <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/"">evidence-based self-help</a> and other scientific personal development methodologies, the guilt-by-association seems sufficient for some people to dismiss the field. Yet I and <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/l22/how_to_learn_soft_skills/"">others</a> have found tremendous value in our lives by looking at such topics as esteem, <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/unstaging-developmental-psychology-fcdc5f9ba894"">psychological development</a>, and <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9"">meaning</a> through the lens of positive psychology. If all that holds some people back from believing in the usefulness of positive psychology is that its sometimes use in cons, then we can advise that they should, <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/09/constant-vigilance/"">as always</a>, practice <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Epistemic_hygiene"">epistemic hygiene</a> and not confuse correlation for causation.</p><p>But even acknowledging the theoretical validity of positive psychology, some folks <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-happiness-dispatch/201011/popping-the-happiness-bubble-the-backlash-against-positive"">still object</a> that its techniques don’t seem to work, at least not for themselves and not for their friends. To this point, it seems likely that <a href=""http://blogs.plos.org/mindthebrain/2013/08/21/positive-psychology-is-mainly-for-rich-white-people/"">positive psychology only works for the sufficiently privileged</a> because they uniquely have the luxury of being able to spend time and energy on self actualization. Put another way, if you’re too busy surviving, you don’t have time for positive psychology and even if you did it’s not likely to help because it’s not your <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints"">primary constraint</a>. This seems to neatly explain much of why people, after controlling for scams and bullshit, still have varying success with positive psychology.</p><p>But I think there is something left unexplained. Among those for whom positive psychology works, some specific techniques will work and others will not. We could just chalk this up to the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy"">typical mind fallacy</a> (a special case of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_projection_fallacy"">mind projection fallacy</a>), but in doing so I think we ignore the chance to see deep patterns in exchange for the surface-level results. Sure, not every technique may work for every person, but for all persons some techniques should work. Can we find a pattern that would both explain the results of positive psychology and account for cases where specific techniques don’t work?</p><h1>A General Mechanism of Personal Development</h1><p>I think we can find such a pattern, and that pattern covers more than just positive psychology — it covers all of personal development and catches positive psychology in its net as a necessary consequence. That’s because personal development, as we will construe it here, includes anything that takes a person from less to more of who they want to be. Sometimes this involves psychotherapy and psychiatry to address psychopathologies, but it also involves positive psychology after a person is already descriptively, statistically normal (as opposed to the prescriptive use of “normal” that people mean when they talk about social norms and idealized behaviors).</p><p>Because I know post-formal developmental psychology best, let’s start looking there for a pattern of personal development. Post-formal developmental models posit psychological development after brains reach physical maturity, which Piaget identified as the formal stage. Erikson, <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/in-defense-of-kegan-2ed7ab51b4c8"">Kegan</a>, and others have investigated <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postformal_thought"">post-formal development</a>, and Commons has given an account of developmental psychology that unifies pre- and post-formal stages in a <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/unstaging-developmental-psychology-fcdc5f9ba894"">functional, eliminative model</a>. Commons shows that behaviors that characterize these stages must be mastered and applied to perform behaviors in subsequent stages. This means that each stage must, in some way, support development into the next stage.</p><p>Commons theory has a strong <a href=""http://dareassociation.org/Papers/Hierarchical%20Complexity%20-%20A%20Formal%20Theory%20%28Commons%20&amp;%20Pekker%29.pdf"">mathematical bent</a>, but it essentially says that stages are differentiated and hierarchical because each stage builds on the behaviors of the previous one by combining them in nontrivial ways to enable behaviors that were impossible within the previous stage. This matches the traditional, <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/phenomenological-complexity-classes-8b41836437b9"">phenomenological</a> view in developmental psychology that stages correspond to increasing ontological complexity without the need to lean on intention. Commons further shows that development requires a period of confusion where existing behaviors may be combined in unproductive ways in an effort to search the space for useful combinations. This is followed by a period of integration where new behavior combinations are practiced, culminating in solidification of new behavior patterns at the next stage.</p><p>Noteworthy is that during development from one stage to another a person is likely to make “mistakes” they wouldn’t have made were they not trying new behavioral combinations. This relates to <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/the-developmental-role-of-play-443549cfed3b"">Bateson’s notion of play</a> and the need for safety explicated by <a href=""http://cgi.stanford.edu/~dept-ctl/tomprof/posting.php?ID=1110"">Kegan’s conception of holding environment</a>. Safety is a matter of providing physical and psychological space to explore thoughts and behaviors free from fear. Physical security, <a href=""https://www.verywell.com/attachment-styles-2795344"">secure attachment</a>, <a href=""http://www.nathanielbranden.com/what-self-esteem-is-and-is-not"">high esteem</a>, and <a href=""http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/23/beyond-passion-the-science-of-loving-what-you-do/"">competence</a> all play roles in creating such a safe environment because, without these many facets of safety, people take on defensive stances to protect themselves from perceived harm. Such stances may be prudent, but they inhibit exploration, learning, and experimentation, and so can retard development. Thus the privilege seemingly needed to successfully apply positive psychology is a manifestation of access to safety, a state that many people unfortunately cannot find themselves in.</p><p>So to summarize what is happening, development starts from a place of integration, followed by disintegration into confusion, which through active efforts at reintegration in a safe space results in development. If a safe space for reintegration is not available, development may not proceed. Metaphorically this is similar to muscle growth by weight lifting, where the muscle is initially whole, is torn by the stress of lifting weight, and then rebuilds the damaged, weakened muscle stronger than before when supplied with sufficient nutrients and rest. We can think of this process graphically as a line that dips and then rebounds higher than it started.</p><figure class=""image image_resized"" style=""width:100%;""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*3eXzs_CLd9svW0no4WMxrQ.png""></figure><p>This seems certainly a model of personal development assuming growth of the sort examined by developmental psychology, especially since it heavily mirrors Kegan and Lahey’s <a href=""https://www.extension.harvard.edu/inside-extension/surprising-reason-we-dont-keep-our-resolutions-how-overcome-it"">four-column model</a> of psychological development from <i>Immunity to Change, </i>is similar to the patterns observed by fellow <a href=""https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6"">Medium</a> writers (cf. <a href=""https://medium.com/u/3e2caab74ba5"">Jonathan Cottrell</a>’s “<a href=""https://medium.com/@PHXjc/an-equation-for-personal-growth-accompanied-by-four-graphs-d22955faacd"">Equation for Personal Growth</a>” and <a href=""https://medium.com/u/78f018e3f9f8"">Brad Stulberg</a>’s “<a href=""https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-growth-equation-stress-rest-growth-de95a5cdcd1d"">The Growth Equation</a>”), and even looks an awful lot like the dual of one iteration of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop"">Boyd’s OODA loop</a>. But what of personal development more generally. Does this pattern hold or break?</p><h1>The General Mechanism of&nbsp;Change</h1><p>It seems trivial to show that this disintegration-reintegration model does not generically hold in personal development. Consider how we usually construe development of self-esteem. People talk about upward and downward spirals of self-esteem, pointing to a simple positive feedback loop without the one-step-backwards-two-steps-forwards pattern of developmental psychology. There’s no obvious disintegration, confusion, or reintegration here, so I guess that’s it.</p><p>Only, how does the positive feedback loop of self-esteem — or any other feedback loop for that matter — ratchet forward? Feedback requires passing information about a system back into itself and using that information to affect future states of the system. We generically refer to this as “updating”, and we know the general pattern of updating well. It goes by many names — entropy, intention, causation, and simply change— but its most rarefied form is perhaps <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes"">Bayes’ Theorem</a> and it is The Pattern behind everything that moves.</p><p>To explain, imagine you are in a a fixed, initial state called the prior. New information appears that muddies the waters, so the speak, because the new information does not exactly match the prior. Bayes’ Theorem tells us the optimal way to resolve the confusion, and we use this to integrate the new information with the prior to achieve a new fixed state called the posterior. As you may notice, this is a familiar story: we go from integration (prior) to disintegration (transmission of new information) to confusion (knowledge of new information) to reintegration (application of Bayes’ Theorem) to a new, more complete state of integration (posterior). In this light it seems the pattern of personal development given above is nothing more than another instantiation of The Pattern, so even if my pattern does not quite describe how all personal development happens, it is only because it is an overly specific version of the universal pattern of change.</p><p>This is perhaps disappointing to some, because it seems that the pattern I have seen in personal development is just the same pattern we see everywhere. But this is also exciting because it informs us more of the deep connectedness of the universe. I don’t mean that as some kind of <a href=""https://meaningness.com/monism-dualism-and-participation"">hippy-dippy appeal to monism</a> — although I <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/what-value-hermeneutics-7a05c80d63b3"">personally interpret</a> The Pattern as identifying with the Dao — but rather as part of the great project of integrating our understanding towards a <a href=""https://mapandterritory.org/what-value-epicycles-f8358678a23a"">maximally parsimonious approach</a>. I am encouraged to find that, in a topic as complex as human thought, the Dao reverberates deeply through it.</p>",gworley,gordon-seidoh-worley,Gordon Seidoh Worley,

Among other things, this resulted in 2011 in people in New York putting together ""Rationalist Seder"", a reframing of the story of Jewish Liberation From Egypt to reflect upon liberation in general. What does it mean to be free? What are the many things we might want to be free from?</p>
<p>As a non-Jewish person, it took me a few years to really wrap my head around the holiday, but it's evolved into one of the more poignant moments throughout my year.</p>
<p>The holiday was begun by Zvi Mowshowitz, and has been modified by various people in different geographic corners. In NYC, for the past few years it's been refined and tweaked by Daniel Speyer, who's aimed to invoke a strong sense of history that feels purposeful, connected to the original story, uniquely ""rationalist"", and feels very much <em>like a holiday</em> in the ancient, venerable and valuable sense.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eFnq53UQ9-Q6F72iTlWjfN5OlNgTXTMyMETMnCiiRvM/edit"">complete text of Dan's most recent iteration is here</a>. It contains a mix of retellings of traditional Jewish stories, abridged essays from around the rationalsphere, and a few original pieces. It has a lot of nice gems that I'd like to be able to refer to more easily, but they make the most sense in context with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But one particular new story stands alone, and establishes the frame around which the Rationalist Seder is told:<br /><br /><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Norway_in_1848_and_1849-_containing_rambles_among_the_fjelds_and_fjords_of_the_central_and_western_districts%3B_and_including_remarks_on_its_political%2C_military%2C_ecclesiastical%2C_and_social_organization_%2814587502198%29.jpg"" alt="""" width=""674"" height=""394"" /></p>

<h2>A Story of War</h2>
<p>Two tribes live next to each other. Each fears the other will attack, and so builds weapons to hold in readiness. &nbsp;And then, seeing that the other has built weapons, builds more weapons. &nbsp;Their clothes are threadbare. &nbsp;Their children are hungry. &nbsp;But still they spend their time making weapons, lest the other tribe build more. &nbsp;They would prefer to live in peace, and make no weapons, but whichever tribe adopted that policy first would surely be killed.</p>
<p>Are these tribes free? &nbsp;There is no pharoah putting the whip to their backs, but still they do not live as they choose.</p>
<p>In the next valley, there are two more tribes. &nbsp;They distrust each other as much as the first two, but they are ruled by a powerful empire. The empire forbids tribes to fight each other, and enforces that rule with unstoppable legions. &nbsp;And so these two tribes have the peace and prosperity that the first two tribes wanted.</p>
<p>And in the valley beyond that, there are two more tribes, who only think they are ruled by a powerful empire. The empire has long since collapsed, but they still believe that if they fight, the empire will come and punish them. &nbsp;And so they don&rsquo;t fight. And by the most naive interpretation of counterfactuals, their belief is true. &nbsp;And they too, live in peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>That is the power of a story.</p>
<p>They also pay taxes to the empire, by floating valuable timber down a river from which no one will collect it. That too, is the power of a story.</p>
<p>And in a farther, more distant valley are two tribes who really understand timeless decision theory. They should publish a paper or something.<br /></p>

<p>This condition may seem arbitrary, but it is both exactly what we need for our bargaining procedure to work, and exactly what we would expect to get out of agents that have access to everyone's actions with something like a reflective oracle. This condition in part implies that for every collection of distributions on actions that all the other players take, there must be some distribution on actions that you can take in which you consider yourself nonexploited. The restriction is slightly stronger that that, requiring a type of continuity in the way that your nonexploited responses are a function of the other players' actions.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Two players are again in a prisoner's dilemma with the same utilities as before. However this time each player thinks that they should cooperate only 90% of the time while the other player cooperates all the time. Thus each player thinks they should get 1.1 utility, while the other only gets 0.8. They refuse to let the other player take advantage of them and get more than 0.8 utility. They also want to make sure that the unique best utility for the other player is to agree to the 1.1, 0.8 split. To do this, they say that for every unit of utility that they get less than 1.1, the opponent should get 0.1 less utility than 0.8.</p>

</style></head><body><p>In this post, we generalize the notions in <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1469"">Cooperative Oracles: Nonexploited Bargaining</a> to deal with the possibility of introducing extra agents that have no control but have preferences.

<p>We therefore need a weaker notion than stratified Pareto optimal for infinitely many players. Note that we can still get stratified Pareto optima if there are no infinite descending chains of strict dependency. (e.g. if the above example grounded out and only had positive integers)</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> First, observe that for any finite subset of players, the set of points fair for all those players is compact and nonempty by the Kakutani fixed point theorem.
By compactness, the set <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""F""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.106em;"">F</span></span></span></span></span></span> of points fair for all players is also compact and non-empty.</p>

<p>At first this weakening may seem unnatural. Notice that the all 0's vector in the above example is ASPO, even though there are many Pareto improvements and stratified Pareto improvements. (Locally, it is arbitrarily close to points with all small positive probabilities that cannot be improved.) However, we think that this condition is actually pretty natural, and the most you could hope for. The point of the players having Kakutani responses and continuous utility functions was to set them up to only have continuous(ish) access to the game state. We similarly need our notion of Pareto optimal to be such that you only violate the notion if you can point out a Pareto improvement in a continuous way, which roughly corresponds to taking the interior of the notion of Pareto improvement, and thus the closure of the notion of Pareto optimal.</p>
<p>In the next post, I plan to connect this up with the existing notion of reflective oracles, to define cooperative oracles.</p>

<p>In this post, I will give a sketchy advertisement of what is to come.</p>
<p>Cooperative oracles are a refinement on reflective oracles. We consider the set of Turing machines with access to a reflective oracle, and we think of each Turing machine as having a utility function (perhaps written in a comment in the source code). This utility function is itself computable using the reflective oracle.</p>
<p>Since the definition of a reflective oracle use a fixed point procedure that may have had multiple fixed points, there are actually many different reflective oracles. However, we will take something like a Pareto optimum in the class of reflective oracles.</p>
<p>For example if two players in a prisoner's dilemma use a reflective oracles to cooperate with exactly the probability the other player cooperates, there is a continuum of fixed points in which the player cooperate with the same probability. We want to take the fixed point in which the both cooperate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not want to just take a standard Pareto Optimum, since we are working with the class of all Turing Machines, and for every machine with a utility function, there is another with the negation of that utility function, so all points will be Optima.</p>
<p>For this, we will use a stratified version of Pareto optima. If a third party wants the two above players to defect against each other, we will still choose mutual cooperation. Since the players only reference each other, and not the third party, the third party is not considered in the notion of optimality for the output of the Oracle on the prisoners' dilemma game.</p>
<p>We will be able to build a cooperative oracle, which is a reflective oracle that (roughly) ensures that all of the outputs of the computations are Pareto optimal for all of the utility function of the machines involved it that computation.
This Pareto optimality is only used to choose between multiple fixed points. We will still be restricted to have the computation follow its source code, and have the reflective oracle give honest data about the output of the computations.</p>
<p>Using cooperative oracles, we will be able to set up a system similar to modal combat, but with reflective oracles.</p>
<p>We will also be able to study bargaining. We will formalize the phenomenon described in the Eliezer Yudkowsky post <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/inh/cooperating_with_agents_with_different_ideas_of/"">Cooperating with agents with different ideas of fairness, while resisting exploitation</a>, and implement this style of bargaining with reflective oracles.</p>
<p>This is interesting because it reduces the problem of finding a fair way to split gains from trade from a group endeavor (like in standard cooperative game theory) to an individual endeavor, where each player specifies what they consider to be a fair outcome for them, and the reflective oracle takes care of the rest. The problem of figuring out how to define what is fair to you is still wide open, however.</p>
<p>The notion of cooperative oracles presented will be use a clunky syntactic notion of when one computation depends on another. If an algorithm calls the reflective oracle on the output of another, we say the first algorithm depends on the second, and we take the transitive closure of this property. There are many alternatives to this, some involving looking at the actual function the algorithms compute and checking how these functions depend on other values. Specifying better notions of computations depending on each other is a hard problem, and better solutions to this may yield better definitions of cooperative oracles.</p>

I will use this formulation to model mutual cooperation in a twin prisoners' dilemma, caused by the belief that the other player is similar to you, and not by mutual prediction. (This post came mostly out of a conversation with Sam Eisenstat, as well as contributions from Tsvi Benson-Tilsen and Jessica Taylor)</p>

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>A simple way of thinking that I feel clarifies a lot of issues (related to <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/6ha/the_blueminimizing_robot/"">Blue Minimising Robot</a>):</p>
<p>Suppose you have an entity <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathbf{H}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-B"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> that follows algorithm <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""al^{\mathbf{H}}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">a</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">l</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-B"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. Then define:</p>
<ul>
<li>What <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathbf{H}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-B"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <strong>does</strong> is its actions/outputs in the environment.</li>

<li>What <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathbf{H}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-B"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <strong>wants</strong> is an <em>interpretation</em> of what <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathbf{H}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-B"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <em>does</em> (and possibly what it <em>is</em>), in order to construct a utility function or reward function corresponding with its preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interpretation part of <strong>wants</strong> is crucial, but it is often obscured in practice in value learning. That's because we often start with things like `<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathbf{H}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-B"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is a boundedly rational agent that maximises <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""u""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">u</span></span></span></span></span></span>...', or we lay out the agent in such a way that that's clearly the case.</p>

<p>Along with Jan Leike and Laurent Orseau, I've been working to formalise many of the issues with AIs learning human values.</p>
<p>I'll be presenting part of this at NIPS and the whole of it at some later conference. Therefore it seems best to formulate the whole problem in the reinforcement learning formalism. The results can generally be easily reformulated for general systems (including expected utility).</p>

The agent has to learn a reward function in the process of interacting with the environment.</p>
<h1>The reward learning posterior</h1>
<p>There are a variety of algorithms that act as reward function learning processes. It might be the cooperative learning algorithm, or some interactive question and answers sessions, or simply learning from observation of human behaviour/human generated data.
In all cases, at the end of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""m""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">m</span></span></span></span></span></span> turns, the agent will have an estimate of the probability of the various reward functions.</p>
<p>Thus a universal definition of the process of reward learning is given by a posterior <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""P: \mathcal{H}_m \to \Delta \mathcal{R}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;"">P</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">:</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">m</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Δ</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, mapping histories to distributions over possible rewards. This posterior is equivalent with the definition of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Now, anything that gives a distribution over <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{H}_m""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">H</span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">m</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> can therefore give a distribution over <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\mathcal{R}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>When dealing with the problem of bias, I stumbled upon what I believe is the best way of getting value indifference, one that solves almost all of the problems with the previous methods.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The problems with the old setups</h2>
<p>My <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jxa/proper_value_learning_through_indifference/"">initial setup</a> has a counterfactual which I'll call a causal counterfactual, following Jessica's terminology. Her <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=839"">whole post</a> is a good way of illustrating what is happening. A button is due to be pressed or not pressed, by a human; this pressing will change the agent's utility function.</p>
<p>There are low-probability quantum events that will artificially depress the button or prevent it from being pressed. The agent only cares about those low-probability events, which allows us to setup the formalism without worrying about changes in the probability of the human pressing the button. Then the events A=""the human presses the button"" and A'=""the quantum event presses the button"" were taken to be interchangeable, as were B=""the human doesn't press the button"" and B'=""the quantum event prevents the button from being pressed"".</p>
<p>The main problem is that these events are not really the same. So the agent will behave as if certain events are impossible (such as the human genuinely pressing the button), and is likely to face human resistance if the human tries to press the button and the button doesn't press due to quantum events, or vice versa. This resistance will either lower the expected reward of the agent, or make them manipulate the human actions.</p>
<p>Benya has <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=78"">sketched out</a> a problem with another approach to counterfactuals, which we can call ""evidential counterfactuals"". Here we're trying to fiddle with utilities to enforce that the agent treats the probability of A and B as being fixed (no A' and B' here).</p>
<p>The problem with that is that the agent can change the probabilities conditional on some rare event, but then behave as if the probabilities were still unchanged same.</p>
<p>For instance, the agent could ensure that A only happens if it wins the lottery. And then it would behave, in effect, as if it had a large chance of winning the lottery (equal to the initial chance of A happening, before the agent took any action). That problem is <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=927"">illustrated here</a>.</p>
<p>A final problem was that neither method allowed the agent to learn usefully: the methods did not distinguish between the agent merely <em>learning</em> that humans intended/didn't intend to press the button (which is presumably fine), versus the agent influencing the the humans to do so (which isn't).</p>
<h2>Solving the problem: prior modification</h2>
<p>Here we'll try and solve the problem in the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1093"">reward learning POMDP framework</a>, but the solution is easy to generalise. Note that the changing of probabilities of A versus B is similar to <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1099"">biasing</a>, so this approach will attempt to make the agent bias-indifferent in a sensible way.</p>

<h2>Properties of the approach</h2>
<p>It's clear the agent is indifferent to bias, but notice that this doesn't prevent the agent from learning: once it gets an observation, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\vdh'""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-munderover""><span class=""mjx-stack""><span class=""mjx-over"" style=""height: 0.243em; padding-bottom: 0.06em; padding-left: 0.277em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""vertical-align: top;""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-size1-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.225em;"">ˆ</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-op""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;"">P</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 1.044em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> can change significantly. It's just changes to its expectation that are controlled.</p>
<p>Notice also that the agent doesn't believe, or act as if it believed, anything unlikely: its bets will be accurate.</p>

<p>One thing that this approach doesn't solve is the issue of the agent not following the exact reward function the humans want it to follow, due to accumulated bias. But first note that this will typically encourage the agent not to bias their reward learning, as it will tend to get higher reward when the humans agree with the agent's reward function. Note secondly that even if the agent manipulates the human values, at the end, to agree with its own, this manipulation, in expectation, simply undoes previous manipulations the agent has done (which caused the biasing in the first place).</p>
<p>Those who find this still unsatisfactory can wait for the next post, where the agent is not simply indifferent to biasing actions, but is penalised for them.</p>
<h2>Indifference and bias</h2>
<p>Why has indifference been connected with bias, rather than the more general influence? Simply because the evidential counterfactual has problems with bias, meaning that that needs to be corrected first (the causal counterfactual is unbiased and uninfluenceable).</p>
<p>Indeed, we can generalise this solution to the influence problem, where it becomes the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=927"">counterfactual approach</a> (which I used to call stratification, before I realised what it was). See subsequent posts for this.</p>

<p>I’m finding many different results, that show problems and biases with the reward learning process.</p>
<p>But there is a meta problem, which is answering the question: “If the AI gets it wrong, how bad is it?”. It’s clear that there are some outcomes which might be slightly suboptimal – like the complete extinction of all intelligent life across the entire reachable universe. But it’s not so clear what to do if the error is smaller.</p>
<hr>
<p>For instance, suppose that there are two moral theories, M1 and M2. An AI following M1 would lead to outcome O1, a trillion trillion people leading superb lives. An AI following M2 would lead to outcome O2, a trillion people leading superbly superb lives.</p>
<p>If one of M1 or M2 was the better moral theory from the human perspective, how would we assess the consequences of the AI choosing the wrong one? One natural way of doing this is to use these moral theories to assess each other. How bad, from M1’s perspective, is O2 compared with O1? And vice versa for M2. Because of how value accumulates on different theories, it’s plausible that M1(O1) could be a million times better than M1(O2) (as O1 is finely adapted to M1’s constraints). And similarly, M2(O1) could be a million times worse than M2(O2).</p>
<p>So from that perspective, the cost of choosing the wrong moral theory is disastrous, by a factor of a million. But from my current perspective (and that of most humans), the costs do not seem so large; both O1 and O2 seem pretty neat. I certainly wouldn’t be willing to run a 99.9999% chance of human extinction, in exchange for the AI choosing the better moral theory.</p>
<h1>Convincing humans what to value</h1>
<p>At least part of this stems, I think, from the fact that humans can be convinced of many things. A superintelligent AI could convince us to value practically anything. Even if we restrict ourselves to “non-coercive” or “non-manipulative” convincing (and defining those terms is a large part of the challenge), there’s still a very wide space of possible future values. Even if we restrict ourselves massively – future values we might have, with no AI convincing at all, just my continuing to live our lives according to vagaries of fortune – that’s still a wide span.</p>
<p>So our values are underdetermined in important ways (personal example: I didn’t expect I’d become an effective altruist or an expected utility maximiser or ever come to respect (some) bureaucracies). So saying “you will come to value M1, and M1 ranks O1 way above O2” doesn’t mean that you should value O1 way above O2. As it’s possible, given different future interactions, that you would come to value M2, or something similar.</p>
<p>We should also give some thought to our future values in impossible universes. It’s perfectly plausible that if we existed in a specific universe (eg a fantasy Tolkein universe), we might come to value, non-coercively and non-manipulatively, a moral theory M3. Even though it’s almost certain we would never come to value M3 in our physical or social universe. We are still proto-M3 believers.</p>
<p>I’m thinking of modelling this as classical moral uncertainty over plausive value/reward functions in a set R={Ri}, but assuming that the probability of a given Ri is never assumed to go below a certain probability. There’s an irreducible core of multiple moralities that never goes away. The purpose of this core is not to inform our future decisions, or train the AI, but purely to assess the goodness of different moralities in the future.</p>

<p>This is technical note explaining how to define counterfactuals on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP).</p>
<p>The POMDP formalism is explained <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1093"">here</a>. This note will just sketch out how counterfactuals are defined; the full details will be in the final paper.</p>

<p>Consider the simple POMDP <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\env""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">μ</span></span></span></span></span></span> (actually, an MDP, since it's fully observable), defined as:</p>

<p>The reasons for the notation will be explained in a later post; but here, starting from a single state, the agent can take one of two actions, and each action has a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0.5""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0.5</span></span></span></span></span></span> chance of ending up in one of two states.</p>

<p>Here there are one of two initial states, each equally likely, and then each action will lead with certainty to another state that comes from the initial hidden state and the action choice.</p>
<p>Note that there are four possible histories on <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\env""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">μ</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\env'""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">μ</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, and two are compatible with each action, and those two are equally probable given that action.

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>After explaining <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1099"">riggable learning processes</a>, we can now define influenceable (and uninfluenceable) learning processes.</p>
<p>Recall that the (unriggable) influence problem is due to agents randomising their preferences, as a sort of artificial `learning' process, if the real learning process is slow or incomplete.</p>
<hr>
<p>Suppose we had a learning process that it wasn't possible to influence. What would that resemble? It seems like it must be something where the outcome of the learning process depends only upon so outside fact about the universe, a fact the agent has no control over.</p>

<p>Though the definition of unriggable and uninfluenceable seem quite different, they're actually quite closely related, as we'll see in a subsequent post. Uninfluenceable can be seen as `unriggable in all background info about the universe'. In old notation terms, rigging is explored in the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/f3v/cake_or_death/"">sophisticated cake or death problem</a>, (unibased) influence in the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jy2/value_learning_ultrasophisticated_cake_or_death/"">ultra-sophisticated version</a>.</p>

<p>An underdefined idea connected with the challenge of getting an AI to <a href=""https://intelligence.org/stanford-talk/"">safely move a strawberry onto a plate</a>.</p>
<p>Now, specifying something in the physical world like that is a great challenge; you have to define ontologies and similar. But imagine that the AI had a goal -- any goal -- and that it had to program a subagent to protect itself while it was accomplishing that goal.</p>
<p>Then the subagent will certainly be programmed with a firm grasp of the physical world, and some decent bridging laws should it have an ontology change (if, for instance, quantum mechanics turns out to be incomplete).</p>
<p>This is just an illustration of a general fact: even if its goal is not properly grounded, the <em>instrumental goals</em> will include strongly grounded goals, resilient to ontology change.</p>
<p>This feels related to the fact that even AI's that are given goals in badly programmed natural language concepts (""Make humans* happy*"", with the asterix denoting the poor grounding) will still need well-grounded concepts for ""human"", just to function.</p>
<p>So, is there a way to exploit this instrumental ideal? To somehow set human* equal to human in the motivation? I'm not sure, but it seems there might be something possible there... Will think more.</p>

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>This is the first of three articles about limitations and challenges in the concept of corrigibility (see articles <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1217"">2</a> and <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1218"">3</a>).</p>
<p>The desiderata for <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/corrigibility/"">corrigibility</a> are:</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>A corrigible agent tolerates, and preferably assists, its operators in their attempts to alter or shut down the agent.</li>
<li>A corrigible agent does not attempt to manipulate or deceive its operators.</li>
<li>A corrigible agent has incentives to repair safety measures (such as shutdown buttons, tripwires, or containment tools) if they break, or at least notify its operators in the event of a breakage.</li>
<li><strong>A corrigible agent preserves its corrigibility, even as it creates new sub-systems or sub-agents, even if it undergoes significant self-modification.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In this post, I'll be looking more at point 4. A summary of the result will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unless giving the AI extra options can reduce expected utility, the AI must care about every possible utility at least a bit.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the results are formal, but the boundaries of the model are very unclear, so the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1215"">warning in this post</a> should always be born in mind.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jxa/proper_value_learning_through_indifference/"">indifference agents</a> fail to be fully corrigible (they don't create corrigible subagents) and they also don't care about the other possible utilities before being changed (as this is a point of indifference).</p>
<h1>Agents versus non-agents</h1>
<p>First I'll present a cleaner version of an <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/mrv/the_subagent_problem_is_really_hard/"">old argument</a>. Basically, it seems that defining what a sub-agent or sub-system is, is tricky or impossible.</p>
<p>Consider for instance a paperclip maximiser, that may get corriged into a staple maximiser at a later date. The AI has some income, and may buy a large proportion of shares in either General Paperclips (GP) or Staples United (SU). Assume the best way of promoting the use of one of the tools, it to take over the company that makes them.</p>
<p>There are two scenarios; in each scenario, the AI has one of two choices.</p>
<p>In scenario 1, the AI has choice A: it buys stocks in GP, but cannot make further trades (in particular, it can't sell its stocks and buy others). It also has choice B: it retains flexibility, and can sell its GP stocks at some later date to buy stocks in SU.</p>
<p>In scenario 2, the AI delegates its investment decisions to a subagent. Under choice A, the subagent is a pure paperclip maximiser. Under choice B, the subagent is corrigible, and can be changed into a staple maximiser.</p>
<p>Clearly 1A and 2A are equivalent, while 1B and 2B are also equivalent. This trick can be extended: in most toy models, it's possible to replace a set of options with a choice of sub-agents, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Thus point 4, in the real world, cannot be merely about subagents and subsystems, but about <em>maintaining flexibility for its future decisions</em>.</p>
<h1>Burn the (rest of) the world</h1>
<p>Let's now consider giving the corrigible agent an option C: it gets slightly more shares in GP than otherwise. But, in exchange, SU is destroyed, along with most of the rest of the world. This is the highest option for paperclip maximalisation, but the absolutely worst option for staples and anything else.</p>
<p>Also assume that the AI's operators are virtually certain (99.9999...9% sure) to be changing it into a staple maximiser. This means that taking option C is dramatically worse that option B, from the perspective of expected utility.</p>
<p>But the AI will only prefer option B if it ""cares"" about staples, at least a little bit, from the very beginning (we've shown that there is no clear distinction between subagent and general actions, thus the agent has to have a general care for staples, rather than-only-caring-about-B-in-the-context-of-subagents).</p>
<p>Thus, if we want to avoid corrigible agents getting worse expected outcomes when we give them extra ""option Cs"", or if we just want to rule out ""option Cs"" in the first place, then the AI needs to care about staples (or any possible future utility), from the very beginning.</p>
<h1>Maintaining flexibility</h1>
<p>You could argue that what's important about the agent is maintaining flexibility, and that option B is flexible, while options A and C are not. Thus the agent doesn't need to care about staples in advance, just to have a general preference for flexibility.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem sufficient. Let's add another, flexible, option D, and put numbers on the whole thing.

<p>This is the first of three articles about limitations and challenges in the concept of corrigibility (see articles <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1216"">1</a> and <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1218"">3</a>).</p>
<p>The desiderata for <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/corrigibility/"">corrigibility</a> are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A corrigible agent tolerates, and preferably assists, its operators in their attempts to alter or shut down the agent.</strong></li>
<li>A corrigible agent does not attempt to manipulate or deceive its operators.</li>
<li><strong>A corrigible agent has incentives to repair safety measures (such as shutdown buttons, tripwires, or containment tools) if they break, or at least notify its operators in the event of a breakage.</strong></li>
<li>A corrigible agent preserves its corrigibility, even as it creates new sub-systems or sub-agents, even if it undergoes significant self-modification.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this post, I'll be looking at one aspect of points 1 and 3. I feel that they're actually pretty much the same point -- the AI has to act while preserving the corrigibility infrastructure.</p>
<p>A summary of the result will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Without a formal definition of what an operator is, corrigibility is vulnerable to the AI replacing the operator with a fake version.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1215"">warning in this post</a> should always be born in mind, of course; it's possible that we me might find a semi-formal version of operator that does the trick.</p>
<h1>Defining the operator or defining the event</h1>
<p>Typically the process of correctionof values is defined <a href=""https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2010-1.pdf"">physically</a>, as being the outcome of specific event (such as a button press, or a specific stochastic event triggered by or triggering a button press). This could also be defined by a digital event (receiving a certain encoded signal, or similar).</p>
<p>In all cases, the idea is the same: there is a very narrow and specific definition of the value correction event, and the physical or digital infrastructure surrounding it plays the role of ensuring the value corrections happen just as we intended. For instance, the physical event could be the button press (or a charge in a wire triggered by the button press) and the button itself could be in a room with an operator, with the operator keeping an eye on the AI and motivated to press the button under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>Such a setup is naturally vulnerable if the AI is motivated to manipulate the operator, or one of its subagents is. But even if we can solve points 2. and 4., there remains another vulnerability: the AI can choose to replace the operator with an artificial one (maybe a robot, maybe a second wire).</p>
<p>Why would the AI be so motivated? Well, for a start, it's indifferent to doing so. If the operator is not part of the definition of corrigibility, then having a human operator or a robot one <em>that does exactly the same thing</em> will be equivalent to the AI.</p>
<p>Now, there are frictions that might push against this. Replacing the operator might carry an expected cost. Or maybe the operator has private information that the AI wants to know, hence replacing them is a negative as the robot wouldn't have that information. And maybe the AI has a rough ""don't harm humans"" motive, that, while imperfect, at least prevents it from removing the operator in this circumstance.</p>
<p>But there may be motivations pushing the other way. For example, if a learning agent is <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1099"">unbiased</a> but not uninfluenceable, then it will be motivated to replace the operator with a robot with the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=860"">same expected outcome, but different variance</a>. Or maybe the operator has private information, but it's much more effective to have a robot read that info from their brain than to rely on the human to reveal that through their behaviour. Or maybe the AI is decently motivated to preserve the corrigibility infrastructure, and is aware of how mortal humans can be, so replacing them with a robot is the prudent thing to do.</p>
<p>All this stems from the fact that the operator is not well defined as part of the corrigibility infrastructure, but their position relies on physical facts about the world, along with a narrow definition of the correction of value event. To combat that, we'd need to define the operator properly, a very tricky challenge, or physically and cognitively secure them, or hope the AI learns early on not to not harm them.</p>

<li><em>Defining manipulation simply may be possible, but defining deception is a whole other problem.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1215"">warning in this post</a> should always be born in mind, of course; it's possible that we me might find a semi-formal version of deception that does the trick.</p>
<h1>Manipulation versus deception</h1>
<p>In the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1217"">previous post</a>, I mentioned that we may need to define clearly what an operator was, rather than relying on the pair: {simple description of a value correction event, physical setup around that event}. Can we define manipulation and deception without defining what an operator is?</p>
<p>For manipulation, it seems we can. Because manipulation is all about getting certain preferred outcomes. By specifying that the AI cannot aim to optimise certain outcomes, we can stop at least certain types of manipulations. Along with other more direct ways of achieving those outcomes.</p>
<p>For deception, the situation is much more complicated. It seems impossible to define how one agent can communicate to another agent (especially one as biased as a human), and increase the accuracy of the second agent, without defining the second agent properly. More confusingly, this doesn't even stop deception; sometimes lying to a bounded agent can increase their accuracy about the world.</p>
<p>There may be some ways to define deception or truth behaviourally, such as using a human as a crucial node in an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder"">autoencoder</a> between two AIs. But those definitions are dangerous, because the AI is incentivised to make the human behave in a certain way, rather than having them believe certain things. Manipulating the human or replacing them entirely is positively encourage.</p>
<p>In all, it seems that the problem of AI deception is vast and complicated, and should probably be separated from the issue of corrigibility.</p>

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>Jessica <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=223"">presented</a> a system learning only from positive examples. Given examples of burritos, it computes a distribution <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span> over possible burritos. When it comes to creating its own burritos, however, it can only construct them from the feasible set <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The thing to do then seems to be to sample from the distribution <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b \mid f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">∣</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span>.
Then the idea is to measure the ``unnaturalness'' or the danger of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b \mid f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">∣</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span> as <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""-\log P_b(B\in f)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">−</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;"">log</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char""></span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space1""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.109em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.109em;"">P</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.219em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">∈</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>, where <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> is a random burrito configuration sampled from <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<h1>Unusual radiation and unnaturalness</h1>
<p>An obviously contrived example: suppose that there is some distant gamma ray burst that sprays the Earth with cosmic rays, resulting in an increase in Carbon 14 (<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""C_{14}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.045em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;"">C</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">14</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>) throughout the food chain.</p>
<p>All burritos sampled for <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span> have come from high radiation ingredients, and the system has learnt this is a feature of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""b""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<h1>Nano-filled burritos</h1>
<p>But what if, noticing this, we tried to present a larger, less unnatural <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span>? Just let the system have more options, for instance.</p>
<p>Now suppose, for example, that the burritos were wrapped in tin foil, and sometimes this ended up mixed with the food.

<p>Then suppose that the system decides to make burritos filled with nano-machines that carefully filter out some carbon 12 atoms.

<p>To emphasise: by allowing the system to stuff burritos full of nano-machines, we've increased the measured naturalness of the burritos.</p>
<h1>Natural, biased, constructed</h1>
<p>Those examples are, of course, convoluted and unlikely. But the general problem hasn't gone away. What we were hoping for with a measure of unnaturalness, is to rule out the system deploying illicit optimsation power in the burrito. But if the training distribution is biased in a particular way, then illicit optimisation power can seem more natural, according to the definition, than anything we would informally define as natural.</p>
<p>That's because building natural burritos won't remove the bias, but illicit optimisation power could.</p>

<p>It is <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=596"">plausible</a> that for standard actions or policies, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span> are pretty similar.

<p>Figure I thus shows a situation ripe for some form of quantilization. But consider figure II:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/tnqetg72f29zmqy/QuantII.PNG?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>In figure 2, the only way to get high <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span></span></span></span></span> is to have a high <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span></span></span></span>. The situation is completely unsuited for quantilization: any <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span></span></span></span></span> maximiser, even a quantilizer, will score terribly under <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span>. But that means mainly that we have chosen a terrible <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Now, back to figure I, where quantilization might work, at least in principle. The ideal would be situation Ia; here blue represents actions below the top <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> cut-off, green those above (which include the edge-case red-star actions, as before):</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/ugvrgom6jprea3i/QuantIa.PNG?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Here the top <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> of actions all score a good value under <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span></span></span></span></span>, and yet most of them have low cost.</p>
<p>But even within the the broad strokes of figure I, quantilization can fail. Figure Ib shows a first type of failure:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/m8yioied21ok9ib/QuantIb.PNG?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Here the problem is that the quantilizer lefts in too many mediocre actions, so the expectation of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span></span></span></span></span> (and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span>) is mediocre; with a smaller <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span>, the quantilizer would be better.</p>
<p>Another failure mode is figure Ic:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/19j1r5q7brdiggd/QuantIc.PNG?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Here the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> is too low: all the quantilized solutions have high cost.</p>
<h1>Another quantilizer design</h1>
<p>An idea I had some time ago was that, instead of of taking the top <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> of the actions, the quantilizer instead choose among the actions that are within <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> of the top <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span></span></span></span></span>-maximising actions. Such a design would be less likely to encounter situations like Ib, but more likely to face situations like Ic.</p>
<h1>What can be done?</h1>
<p>So, what can be done to improve quantilizers? I'll be posting some thoughts as they develop, but there are two ideas that spring to mind immediately. First of all, we can use <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=884"">CUA oracles</a> to investigate the shape of the space of actions, at least from the perspective of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""g""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">g</span></span></span></span></span></span> (<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""c""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">c</span></span></span></span></span></span>, like <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""f""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;"">f</span></span></span></span></span></span>, cannot be calculated explicitly).</p>
<p>Secondly, there's an idea that I had around <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=600"">low-impact AIs</a>. Basically, it was to ensure that there was some action the AI could take that could easily reach some approximation of its goal. For instance, have a utility function that encourages the AI to build <strong>one</strong> papeclip, and cap that utility at one. Then scatter around some basic machinery to melt steel, stretch it, give the AI some manipulator arms, etc... The idea is to ensure there is at least one safe policy that gives the AI some high expected utility. Then if there is one policy, there's probably a large amount of similar policies in its vicinity, safe policies with high expectation. Then it seems that quantilization should work, probably best in its 'within <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""n\%""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">%</span></span></span></span></span></span> of the maximal policy' version (working well because we know the cap of the utility function, hence have a cap on the maximal policy).</p>
<p>Now, how do we know that a safe policy exists? We have to rely on human predictive abilities, which can be flawed. But the reason we're reasonably confident in this scenario is that we believe that we could figure out how to build a paperclip, given the stuff the AI has lying around. And the AI would presumably do better than us.</p>

<p>Suppose that we knew that superintelligent AI was to be developed within six months, what would I do?</p>
<p>Well, drinking coffee by the barrel at Miri's emergency research retreat I'd... still probably spend a month looking at things from the meta level, and clarifying old ideas. But, assuming that didn't reveal any new approaches, I'd try and get something like this working.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Standard setup</h1>
<p>Take a reinforcement learner AI, that we want to <a href=""https://intelligence.org/stanford-talk/"">safely move a strawberry onto a plate</a>. A human sits nearby and provides a reward based on inspecting the AI's behaviour.</p>
<p>As it stands, this setup is completely vulnerable to <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565v2.pdf"">reward hacking</a>. The reward is not provided for safe moving of the strawberry; instead the reward is provided by having the human judge that the task has been accomplished and then pressing a button. Taking control of the human or control of the button is likely to be possible for a superintelligent AI; and, as it stands, that would be <em>mandated</em> by this reward function.</p>
<h1>Learning from positive and various negative examples</h1>
<p>Could we have the AI instead learn what the reinforcement signal ""should be""? It seems that it might at least be possible, if we can make the AI learn from both positive and negative examples. I'd make five categories of examples from which the AI could learn. It may be too dangerous to have the superintelligent AI used directly in constructing these examples; in that case, the rewards would be given to a simpler, dumber version of the AI, and the examples passed on to the superintelligent AI for offline training.</p>
<p>#. Simple positive and negative examples. These are the basic examples from above: the AI completes the task or fails to, and gets the consequent reward. The AI stays within its room and the human is sober, rested, uninfluenced, and so on.
#. Simple more dubious examples. These are examples where the AI gets a reward, but the learning process judges that these rewards were not fairly allocated. Maybe the human was drunk, or not paying attention. Maybe they slipped, and pressed the button by accident. Or they were in a hurry to end their shift, and so pressed the button. All these examples are given a score from -1 to 1. Those with a score of 1 are taken as legitimate examples of rewards, those with a score of 0 are taken as random reward giving, while those with a score of -1 are taken as anti-rewards instead.
#. Extreme negative examples. Here we can offer the AI actions that lead to complicated outcomes that are not legitimate rewards. Maybe the action can <em>make</em> the controller drunk. Maybe they can start a tape playing that will convince the controller the area is haunted. They could cut the wire, fuse the button, switch the controller's task description, distract the controller, start an automated threat tape, and so on. All these are labelled as negative examples (even though the reward is given).
#. Hypothetical negative examples. If we can communicate hypothetical situations to the AI (especially if we can do that without fully specifying the hypothetical in detail), we can use that to extend the previous category to every situation we can imagine. We can have the AI trick, threaten, or kill the controller, destroy the rest of humanity, launch subagents to seize the button, take honeypots, and so on. We can't get an exhaustive list, but we can try to get as much examples of AIs behaving badly. These are also obviously labelled as negative examples (even though the reward is given).
#. Properties of the example space. It's not clear whether these are examples or features of the learning process. See the next sections for details.</p>
<h1>Nearest unblocked strategy vs overfitting</h1>
<p>If we simply told the AI to maximise reward, subject to the fact that all the negative examples are to be avoided, then we fall into the <a href=""https://arbital.com/p/nearest_unblocked/"">nearest unblocked strategy problem</a> (NUSP). The AI will simply choose a dangerous strategy that isn't too close to those that have been explicitly ruled out. Since we don't have the time, intelligence, or imagination to rule out all the dangerous strategies (and since some of them would be too dangerous for us to even <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jao/siren_worlds_and_the_perils_of_overoptimised/"">contemplate</a>), this wouldn't work.</p>
<p>But if we consider the issue as a learning problem, the situation seems less dire. Then the NUSP seems simply an example of overfitting: if the AI has learnt that all these are photos of cats, it should be able to infer that something similar is also a cat, even if it isn't close to the labelled examples. Similarly for negative examples that aren't close to other negative examples.</p>
<p>But another variant of the NUSP continues to plague us. Suppose we had trained the AI only on black cats; how would we expect it to react when confronted with a white cat?</p>
<p>Imagine the space of behaviour as a high dimensional space, with the space of good behaviours as some compact subset. Then the negative examples we gave do not tightly surround that compact subset (that's standard NUSP). But we've also not spread the negative examples much around that space, due to the usual problems with our lack of intelligence and imagination. So the negative examples we've set are likely to occupy a very low dimensional space around the space of good behaviour.</p>
<h1>Adding the properties</h1>
<p>However, once we've realised that, we can add it to the learning process. What method would be the best to pick out a constrained compact set in high dimensions, where the known positive and negative examples occupy a much smaller dimensional subspace? There might not be a good method, but there's probably a <em>best</em> method, given what we know or think we know.</p>
<p>The same goes for all the other properties we known about that space. For instance, if the AI uses different approaches for different humans, this is a likely failure mode. If it doesn't matter what the task the AI is given is (because the AI will just hack the human anyway), that's another failure mode - note, again, that this property makes more sense as a learning property than as a constraint. The perils (to humans) of unconstrained search is another known failure mode. Even the fact that we are using a dumber AI to construct the practical examples, is relevant. What sort of failure are we trying to avoid? When we box the AI or seal off the human with the reward button, again, what is this trying to achieve?</p>
<p>And so on, as we add all our intuitive understanding of the spaces of good and bad behaviours in this area.</p>
<p>Depending on how the learning process is designed, we can add these properties either as constraints for the learning process, or as part of the process itself.</p>
<h1>Unusual actions versus unusual situations</h1>
<p>Now, this approach is not certain to work by any means, but as an emergency measure it seems to have potential. But note that it seems much safer as a measure to prevent the AI taking extreme/manipulative/unusual actions. Rather than as a way to constrain the AI's behaviour in unusual situations. This approach is intended to prevent the AI from taking over the world, rather than telling it what to do if it does take over. That's mainly because we have a vague idea what not taking over the world looks like (and we can produce many examples of this behaviour), but we're much more stumped as to what running the world well means.</p>

<p>Defining <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1218"">truth and accuracy</a> is tricky, so when I've proposed designs for things like <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=884"">Oracles</a>, I've either used a very specific and formal question, or and indirect criteria for truth.</p>
<p>Here I'll try and get a more direct system so that an AI will tell the human the truth about a question, so that the human understands.</p>
<hr>
<p>The basic idea is simple. The first AI wishes to communicate certain facts to a second AI, but has to use the human as an intermediary. The first AI talks to the human, and then the human talks with the second AI. If the facts are to be accurate, the human has to understand them.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/2t80orv5v9elfk4/aitruth1.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Of course, this will immediately fail for a variety of reasons. Even if neither AI hacks the human directly, the human doesn't have to understand anything to serve as a conduit. So the rest of this post is dedicated to making that basic idea much more secure. If you just want to have the final idea and avoid the justifications, then you can skip directly to the end.</p>
<h1>The knowledge to pass on</h1>
<p>The human would have a good understanding of a subject, if they are able to answer a large quantity of questions about it. Having a long conversation with the second AI is tiring, among other things. A human simply won't be able to answer ten million questions about what they understand, at least not well.</p>
<p>So the idea could be to have the second AI ask a single question, randomly chosen from a large collection of questions, and have the human give a single yes or no answer. Both AIs are then graded on the accuracy of the answer.</p>
<h1>The answer...</h1>
<p>What does the second AI want to do? It basically wants to dissect the human (figuratively or literally), suck out all their knowledge, and infer what the first AI was trying to communicate. Note that this doesn't require the human to understand anything, just that the second AI can infer what the first one wanted by taking the human apart.</p>
<p>So instead of allowing the second AI unrestricted access to the human, it instead formulates its (boolean) question without interference, and then the human choose yes or no, and that choice is counted as an answer.</p>
<h1>...and the question</h1>
<p>We could have a list of actual questions, but that makes the second AI redundant, and means that the first AI will optimise for certain answers from a set of questions, not for genuine understanding.</p>
<p>Instead, the second AI then gets a technical boolean question about some distribution. Since the human will be deciding yes or no, and the AI will not be able to interact with them, it's in the second AI's interest to formulate a question that allows the human to understand the technical boolean question they're being asked. And then, using the human's private information, to answer it correctly.</p>
<h1>The information from the first AI</h1>
<p>What distribution will the second AI be asking a boolean question about? This can be anything, but I'm thinking of some conditional probability distribution along the lines of ""what will the world look like if X happens?"". This needs to be formally defined, but the AI's communication with the human is informal, and up to the AI. As long as the AI can't <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1252"">hack the human in the third sense</a>, it needs to make them understand the distribution as best it can.</p>
<p>Then the second AI is given a randomly chosen boolean technical question about this distribution. Since it doesn't know what question will be asked, it's in the first AI's interest to ensure the human has a good general understanding of the distribution.</p>
<h1>Making it all counterfactual</h1>
<p>It would be very inefficient to have the human shuffle back and forth between AIs every time the first AI gives an answer. Instead, we could use the actual setup one time in a thousand or so, and let the first AI be motivated to get the correct answer in those one-in-a-thousand cases.</p>
<h1>In summary</h1>
<p>The whole setup can be summarised by this graphic:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/pzf5bplz48cgsq8/aitruth2.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>There are some subtle questions about what distribution the first AI should be using versus the questions the second one can ask so as to guarantee genuine human understanding of issues the human cares about. There's also some issues about how the setup fits into <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jao/siren_worlds_and_the_perils_of_overoptimised/"">siren worlds</a>, and other vulnerabilities. But I'll defer that analysis to another time.</p>

<p>The aim of this post is simply to collect all the different ""indifference"" proposals that I know of. Let me know if I've missed any!</p>

<h2>Policy versus reward</h2>
<p>My <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jxa/proper_value_learning_through_indifference/"">initial proposal</a> considered only change of utility functions -- similar to reward functions -- and assumed the policy would always be to maximise that utility.</p>
<p>Conversely, the <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/Interruptibility.pdf"">Safely Interruptible Agents</a> paper just looked at policy changes, while sticking to the same reward function.</p>
<p>In general, policy and reward changes can be treated similarly -- what matters is the changes between <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""V^{\pi_0}(R_0)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.186em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em;

<p>Indeed, you could just treat it as a policy change, with the added caveat that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\pi_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.003em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">π</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> also 'chooses' to claim their reward from <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_i""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<h2>Method: Bias penalty or indifference</h2>

<p>One way of fighting this, is to penalise the agent for large changes <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""p \to p_a""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">→</span></span><span class=""mjx-msubsup MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">p</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">a</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. In the terms of <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1099"">this post</a>, the agent is taking biased actions.</p>
<p>And to combat large biases, the agent could get an extra bias penalty, as explained in the Towards Interactive Inverse Reinforcement Learning <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/xv70s8q3c2o4ta2/IIRLposter.pdf?raw=1"">poster</a>.</p>
<p>But the rest of this post will focus on bias-indifference, rather than bias penalty.</p>

<h1>Evidential counterfactual</h1>
<p>The first idea is to have some sort of fixed probability for <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> versus <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\neg B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">¬</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span>. And then the agent acts as if the probability cannot be changed by anything the agent does.</p>
<p>Call this the ""evidential"" counterfactual. The <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=78"">problem</a> with it is that it causes the agent to want to manipulate conditional probabilities (similarly how evidential decision theory can desire to <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=32"">manipulate the news</a>). Basically, if the agent can decrease the probability of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> while making the reward for <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> much larger, it will do so (as it doesn't track the reduction of probability, by construction).</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=762"">factoring out variables</a> approach seems to use this evidential counterfactual, and thus suffers from this problem.</p>
<h1>Causal counterfactual</h1>
<p>My <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jxa/proper_value_learning_through_indifference/"">original idea</a> was that there was some low-probability event <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""e""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">e</span></span></span></span></span></span> such that if <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> happened AND <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""e""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">e</span></span></span></span></span></span> happened, then the utility/policy would not change.</p>

<p>This has the advantage that the weights may be negative or higher than one, but disadvantage that it may result in unusual mixed reward functions.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Given these terms, the indifference approach I <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1097"">described as the best</a> is Method: <strong>indifference</strong>, Counterfactual: <strong>translation</strong>, Update defaults: <strong>observations only</strong>, Translation type: <strong>simple</strong> for small translations, <strong>mean</strong> for large ones, and Weights: <strong>probabilities</strong>.</p>
<p>One could imagine slightly tweaking that approach, by using extra rewards for weights, and dropping the complicated conditions needed to keep the weights bounded between <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span>, allowing simple translations always. This would result in: Method: <strong>indifference</strong>, Counterfactual: <strong>translation</strong>, Update defaults: <strong>observations only</strong>, Translation type: <strong>simple</strong>, and Weights: <strong>extra rewards</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1294"">counterfactual approach</a> can be seen as: Method: <strong>indifference</strong>, Counterfactual: <strong>translation</strong>, Update defaults: <strong>observations only</strong>, Translation type: <strong>specific</strong>, and Weights: <strong>probabilities</strong>.</p>

Since a pure learning process does not have problem with bias or influence (it simply wants to learn), but could be dangerous if unconstrained, having this sort of 'counterfactual learning' might be a good idea (though be careful of the incentives that a badly defined pure learning process might have).</p>
<p>For an example: imagine the agent's correct reward is what was written on a certain paper an hour ago. This is very clearly uninfluenceable: the agent simply needs to learn data that is out in the universe. If instead the agent's correct reward was what would be written on a certain paper in an hour, then it's clearly influenceable: the agent can simply write what it wants on that paper.</p>
<p>The counterfactual (for <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\pi_0=""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.003em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;"">π</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span></span></span></span></span>""do nothing"") is then simply 'what would have been written on the paper, if the agent had done nothing'. If the agent can figure that out early, then it doesn't care about the paper or the writing at all, except as far as its counterfactual evidence.</p>
<p>Thus this model is equivalent with the old <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=927"">stratified</a> <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=947"">agents</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1285"">previous post</a>, I briefly mentioned translations as one of three possible counterfactuals for indifference. Here I want to clarify what I meant there, because the idea is interesting.</p>

<p>Imagine that there is a button, which, if a human presses it (event <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span>), will cause an AI to have reward signal <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_0""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">0</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<p>We want the AI to be indifferent to the change in probability caused by its actions.</p>
<h1>Evidential counterfactual</h1>
<p>In the ""evidential"" counterfactual, the AI will simply behave as if the probability of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""¬B""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">¬</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">B</span></span></span></span></span></span> were fixed, and unaltered from the initial odds:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmwtr1vyapt4l40/Counterfactuals3.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that this doesn't correspond to a true utility/reward functions, leading to the paradoxes detailed <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=78"">here</a> and <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=927"">here</a> (see the section on outcome pumps).</p>
<h1>Causal counterfactual</h1>
<p>In the ""causal"" counterfactual, there is some other event that, with small probability, will force the button to be pressed, or prevent it from being pressed, whatever humans want or try.</p>
<p>This event is supposed to be independent of anything anyone does (imagine some specified radioactive decay event, or being triggered by distant cosmic events).</p>

<p>I've got a partial design for motivating an AI to <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1261"">improve human understanding</a>.</p>
<p>However, the AI is rewarded for generic human understanding of many variables, most of the quite pointless from our perspective. Can we motivate the AI to ensure our understanding on variables we find important? The presence of free humans, say, rather than air pressure in Antarctica?</p>
<hr>
<p>It seems we might be able to do this. First, because we've defined human understanding, we can define accuracy-increasing statements: statements that, if given to a human, will improve their understanding.</p>
<p>So I'd say that a human understands the important facts about a real or hypothetical world, if there are no short accuracy-increasing statements that would cause them to radically change their assessment about the quality of a world (AI: ""oops, forgot to mention everyone in under the influence of <a href=""https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/en.futurama/images/7/7e/Brainslug.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090504195508"">brain slugs</a> - will that change your view of this world?"").</p>
<p>Of course, it possible to present true informative facts in the worse possible light, so it might be better to define this as ""if there are short accuracy-increasing statements that would cause them to radically change their assessment about the quality of a world, there are further accuracy-increasing statements that will undo that change"". (AI: ""actually, brain slugs are a <a href=""http://img10.deviantart.net/8c2c/i/2012/033/9/9/brain_slug_hat_by_climbtreez-d4ofra8.jpg"">popular kind of hat</a> where people store their backup memories"").</p>

<p>I just had a talk with Victoria Krakovna about reducing side effects for an AI, and though there are similarities with <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=600"">low impact</a> there are some critical way in which the two differ.</p>
<p>#Distance from baseline</p>
<p>Low impact and low side effects use a similar distance approach: some ideal baseline world or set of worlds is defined, and then the distance between that baseline and the actual world is computed. The distance is then used as penalty term the AI should minimise (while still achieving its objectives).</p>
<p>One useful measure of distance is to list a huge number of variables (stock prices, air pressure, odds of films winning Oscars...) and penalise large deviations in those variables. Every variable is given a certain weight, and the weighted sum is the total distance metric (there are more complicated versions, but this simple metric will suffice for the moment).</p>
<p>#What's the weather like on Venus?</p>
<p>The two approach weigh the variables differently, and for different purposes. Suppose that one of the variables is the average surface temperature of Venus.</p>
<p>Now suppose that the temperature of Venus increases by 1 degree during the operation of the AI. For most low side effects AIs, this is perfectly acceptable. Suppose the AI is aiming to cure cancer. Then as we formalise negative side effects, we start to include things like human survival, human happiness and flourishing, and so on. Temperature changes in distant planets are certainly not prioritised.</p>
<p>And the AI would be correct in that assessment. We would be perfectly happy to accept a cure for cancer in exchange of a small change to Venusian weather. And a properly trained AI, intent on minimising bad side effects, should agree with us. So the weight of the ""temperature on Venus"" variable will be low for such an AI.</p>
<p>In contrast, a low impact AI sees a temperature change on Venus as an utter disaster - Venusian temperature is likely to be much more important than anything human or anything on Earth. The reason is clear: only an immensely powerful AI could affect something as distant and as massive as that. If Venusian temperature changes strongly as a result of AI action, the low impact containment has failed completely.</p>
<p>#Circling the baseline from afar</p>
<p>The two approaches also differ in how attainable their baseline is. The low impact approach defines a baseline world which the AI can achieve by just doing nothing. In fact, it's more a no-impact measure that a low impact one (hence the need for <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=204"">tricks</a> to get actual impact).</p>
<p>The do-nothing baseline and the tricks mean that we have a clear vision of what we want a low impact AI to do (have no general impact, except in this specific way we allow).</p>
<p>For low side effects, picking the baseline is more tricky. We might define a world where there is, say, no cancer, and no terrible side effects. We might define a baseline set of such worlds.</p>
<p>But unlike the low impact case, we're not confident the AI can achieve a world that's close to the baseline. And when the world is some distance away, things can get dangerous. This is because the AI is not achieving a good world, but trading off the different ways of being far from such a world - and the tradeoff might not be one we like, or understand.</p>
<p>A trivial example: maybe the easiest way for the AI to get closer to the baseline is to take control of the brains of all humans. Sure, it pays a cost in a few variables (metal in people's brains, maybe?), but it can then orchestrate all human behaviour to get close to the baseline in all other ways.</p>
<p>It seems relevant to mention here that problems like AI manipulation and sub-agent creation are really hard to define and deal with, suggesting that it's hard to rule out those kinds of examples.</p>

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href=""https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf"">basic AI drives</a> thesis, (almost) any agent capable of self-modification will self-modify into an expected utility maximiser.</p>
<p>The typical examples are the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_paradox"">inconsistent utility maximisers</a>, the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/854/satisficers_want_to_become_maximisers/"">satisficers</a>, <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/knv/model_of_unlosing_agents/"">unexploitable agents</a>, and it's easy to think that all agents fall roughly into these broad categories. There's also the observation that when looking at <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/my/the_allais_paradox/"">full policies</a> rather than individual actions, many biased agents become expected utility maximisers (unless they want to lose pointlessly).</p>
<p>Nevertheless... there is an entire category of agents that generically seem to <em>not</em> self-modify into maximisers.

<p>What about information? Is it always good for the agent to know more?</p>
<p>Well, if the agent can self-modify before receiving extra information, then extra information can never be a negative (trivial proof: the agent can self-modify to ignore the information if it were negative to know).</p>
<p>But if the agent cannot self-modify before receiving the information, then it can sometimes pay to not learn or to forget some things. For instance, maybe there was an extra piece of information that informed the agent of the utilities of the various actions; then the agent might want to erase that information simply so its successor would be tempted to choose randomly.</p>

<h1>Is this design plausible?</h1>
<p>It might seem bizarre to have an agent that restricts expected utility to a particular range, but it's actually quite sensible, at least intuitively.</p>
<p>The problem with maximisers is that the extreme optimised policy is likely to include dangerous side-effects we didn't expect. Satisficers were supposed to solve this, by allowing the agent to not focus only on the extreme optimised policy, but their failure mode is that they don't <em>preclude</em> following such a policy. Hence this design might be felt to be superior, as it also rules out the extreme optimised policies.</p>
<p>Its failure mode, though, is that it don't preclude, for instance, a probabilistic mix of extreme optimised policy with a random inefficient one.</p>

<p>There have been various attempts to classify the problems in AI safety research. Our old <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-012-9282-2"">Oracle paper</a> that classified then-theoretical methods of control, to more recent classifications that grow out of modern <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf"">more concrete problems</a>.</p>
<p>These all serve their purpose, but I think a more enlightening classification of the AI safety problems is to look at what the issues we are trying to solve or avoid. And most of these issues are problems about humans.</p>
<hr>
<p>Specifically, I feel AI safety issues can be classified as three human problems and one central AI issue. The human problems are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Humans don't know their own <strong>values</strong> (sub-issue: humans know their values better in retrospect than in prediction).</li>
<li>Humans are <strong>not</strong> (idealised) <strong>agents</strong> and don't have stable values (sub-issue: humanity itself is even less of an agent).</li>
<li>Humans have <strong>poor predictions</strong> of an AI's behaviour.</li>
</ol>
<p>And the central AI issue is:</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>AIs could become extremely <strong>powerful</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously if humans were agents and knew their own values and could predict whether a given AI would follow those values or not, there would be not problem. Conversely, if AIs were weak, then the human failings wouldn't matter so much.</p>
<p>The points about human values is relatively straightforward, but what's the problem with humans not being agents? Essentially, humans can be threatened, tricked, seduced, exhausted, drugged, modified, and so on, in order to act seemingly against our interests and values.</p>
<p>If humans were clearly defined agents, then what counts as a trick or a modification would be easy to define and exclude. But since this is not the case, we're reduced to trying to figure out the extent to which something like a <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=994"">heroin injection</a> is a valid way to influence human preferences. This makes both humans susceptible to manipulation, and human values hard to define.</p>
<p>Finally, the issue of humans having poor predictions of AI is more general than it seems. If you want to ensure that an AI has the same behaviour in the testing and training environment, then you're essentially trying to guarantee that you can predict that the testing environment behaviour will be the same as the (presumably safe) training environment behaviour.</p>
<h1>How to classify methods and problems</h1>
<p>That's well and good, but how to various traditional AI methods or problems fit into this framework? This should give us an idea as to whether the framework is useful.</p>
<p>It seems to me that:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Friendly AI</em> is trying to solve the <strong>values</strong> problem directly.</li>
<li><em>IRL</em> and <em>Cooperative IRL</em> are also trying to solve the <strong>values</strong> problem. The greatest weakness of these methods is the <strong>not agents</strong> problem.</li>
<li><em>Corrigibility/interruptibility</em> are also addressing the issue of humans not knowing their own <strong>values</strong>, using the sub-issue that human values are clearer in retrospect. These methods also overlap with <strong>poor predictions</strong>.</li>
<li><em>AI transparency</em> is aimed at getting round the <strong>poor predictions</strong> problem.</li>
<li><em>Laurent's work</em> on carefully defining the properties of agents is mainly also about solving the <strong>poor predictions</strong> problem.</li>
<li><em>Low impact and Oracles</em> are aimed squarely at preventing AIs from becoming <strong>powerful</strong>. Methods that restrict the Oracle's output implicitly accept that humans are <strong>not agents</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Robustness</em> of the AI to changes between testing and training environment, degradation and corruption, etc... ensures that humans won't be making <strong>poor predictions</strong> about the AI.</li>
<li><em>Robustness to adversaries</em> is dealing with the sub-issue that humanity is <strong>not an agent</strong>.</li>
<li>The <em>modular approach</em> of Eric Drexler is aimed at preventing AIs from becoming too <strong>powerful</strong>, while reducing our <strong>poor predictions</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Logical uncertainty</em>, if solved, would reduce the scope for certain types of <strong>poor predictions</strong> about AIs.</li>
<li><em>Wireheading</em>, when the AI takes control of reward channel, is a problem that humans don't know their <strong>values</strong> (and hence use an indirect reward) and that the humans make <strong>poor predictions</strong> about the AI's actions.</li>
<li><em>Wireheading</em>, when the AI takes control of the human, is as above but also a problem that humans are <strong>not agents</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Incomplete specifications</em> are either a problem of not knowing our own <strong>values</strong> (and hence missing something important in the reward/utility) or making <strong>poor predictions</strong> (when we though that a situation was covered by our specification, but it turned out not to be).</li>
<li><em>AIs modelling <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1261"">human knowledge</a></em> seem to be mostly about getting round the fact that humans are <strong>not agents</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting this all in a table:</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/23gzi53bmocggan/table.png?raw=1"" alt=""""></p>
<h1>Further refinements of the framework</h1>
<p>It seems to me that the third category -- <strong>poor predictions</strong> -- is the most likely to be expandable. For the moment, it just incorporates all our lack of understanding about how AIs would behave, but this might more useful to subdivide.</p>

</style></head><body><p><em>A putative new idea for AI control; index <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=601"">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1388"">humans aren't agents</a> is that we can be manipulated into having any (or almost any) set of values - through drugs, brain surgery, extreme propaganda, and other methods.</p>
<p>If an AI is tasked with ""satisfy human preferences"", and if the AI can <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1099"">affect the definition</a> of ""human preferences"" by changing humans, this is what we would expect it to do.</p>
<p>This could be combated by my making the definition of human preferences <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1294"">counterfactual</a>. But it's not fully clear how to define counterfactual preferences, and it would be interesting to see whether we can constrain the AI from manipulating humans in other ways.</p>
<p>One idea is to look at what we informally call optimisation power. If the AI would prefer a human to be a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""u""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">u</span></span></span></span></span></span>-maximising agent, then it presumably has to work hard at transforming the human values into that. And small changes in the definition of the AI's preference would mean that they would prefer transforming the human into a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""v""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">v</span></span></span></span></span></span>-maximiser.</p>
<p>Thus, though optimisation power is <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/cxk/thoughts_and_problems_with_eliezers_measure_of/"">hard to define</a>, this would seem to fit the bill: an ""honest"" reward learning process is one where the final human values don't depend sensitively on the AI's initial values. And a manipulable one is where it does.</p>
<p>Let's dig into this a bit more. Why would an AI prefer <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""u""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">u</span></span></span></span></span></span> or <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""v""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">v</span></span></span></span></span></span>? Well, the generic failure mode for ""satisfy human preferences"" is to see it as the sum over all utilities <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""u""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">u</span></span></span></span></span></span> in some set <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> of ""maximise <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""u""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">u</span></span></span></span></span></span> if the human agrees to maximise <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""u""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">u</span></span></span></span></span></span>"". Then what the AI wants is for the human agree to maximise a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""v""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">v</span></span></span></span></span></span> where <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""v""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">v</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the utility function the AI finds easiest to reach a high value on.</p>
<p>But then we can individually translate or scale the various utilities in <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span>, to make different ones easier or harder to reach high values on. This would make the AI prefer the human to agree to a different maximisation.</p>
<p>So if <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the reward function that encodes ""satisfy human preferences"", there are many <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span> that are equivalent if the AI cannot influence the human's values, but that are very different if the AI can. Looking for something like that could be a sign that something is wrong in the system.</p>
<h1>Yes-men are a problem</h1>
<p>And this is true, if the only option of the AI was to turn the human into an engineered fanatic with certain values. But it might also seek to turn the human into a yes-man, agreeing to anything the AI suggests. And this is something that an AI would do for a wide variety of different <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span>'s. So our optimisation idea flounders at this point.</p>

<p>So, what are the differences? For the ""not problems"", it makes sense to model the human as having a single reward <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span></span></span></span>, variously ""likes having a matching pair of shoes"", ""needs a certain amount of fluids"", and ""values certain purchases"". Then all that the the AI is doing is helping (or not) the human towards that goal.</p>
<p>As you move more towards the ""problems"", notice that they seem to have two distinct human reward functions, <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_A""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.241em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""R_{\neg A}""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">R</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.241em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-texatom"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">¬</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, and that the AI's actions seem to choose which one the human will end up with. In the spirit of humans <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1388"">not being agents</a>, this seems to be AI determining what values the human will come to possess.</p>

<p>A reminder that we won't be looking at any ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance"">utilities I might have had before I knew who I was</a>"" scenarios.</p>
<p>This post is for illustrating a point about acausal trade: weakening the acausal trade network(s) in any way tends to reduce acausal trade more than linearly, as the traders cut back further on their trading. And the converse for strengthening the acausal trade network(s).</p>
<hr>
<h1>How to weaken the network</h1>
<p>How could the acausal trade network be weakened? In potentially many ways. Greater uncertainty about the existence or the utilities of other agents, for instance. More agents who might defect from the trade, not have right utility function, or with who you can't reach a deal because of negotiation breakdown.</p>
<p>Basically anything that lowers the expected number of agents acausally trading with you - and also causes those agents to similarly have a lower expectation on the number of agents trading with you.</p>

<p>In a <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1463"">previous post</a>, the marginal gain of one utility in terms of another was given by a crisp formula.</p>
<p>This is obviously unrealistic, but how unrealistic is it? This post will look at various features we might expect from utility functions and acausally trading agents, and what makes them easy or difficult to trade with.</p>
<h1>Independence</h1>
<p>The ideal trade is something like agent <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> likes staples, agent <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_2""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> likes green objects, and they both decide to make green staples.</p>
<p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5bd75cc58225bf0670375415/qc93cspks9tfnsimdnsc"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Here the two utilities are almost independent: increasing one costs almost nothing from the perspective of the other.</p>
<p>In general, independence (which could also be called low trade-offs) is very desirable between different utilities. This is not a transitive property: staples and green colour can be pretty independent, staples and blue colour as well, but obviously green and blue are in direct tension.</p>
<p>It's plausible that there will exist whole families of mutually independent utilities, coming together as a package that can get maximised together or separately.</p>
<h1>Popularity</h1>
<p>An obvious point, but utilities that are very popular - very widely shared by different agents - are more likely to be traded with, since there are more agents willing to trade in return. This willingness is non-linear in ""<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1463"">double decrease</a>"" situations, for instance those that do not derive from some sort of timeless, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1471"">pre-existence deal</a>.</p>
<h1>Complexity and coordination</h1>
<p>Then there's the complexity of the preference. Simple utilities, or those whose existence is simple to deduce, are much easier to figure out and hence maximise.</p>
<p>This is partially a question of popularity, but it's also an artefact of the fact that agents may have different priors (or, even if they have the same priors, different posteriors after updating on the agent's own existence). In all those situations, simple preferences are likely to come up often.</p>
<p>These another type of complexity, which is complexity in increasing that utility. Suppose <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> counts the number of named nodes in a network, where every node knows the name of every other node. This utility is not hard to describe, but is useless for acausal trade, as a second network would not be connected to the first one in terms of knowing the names of the first nodes. So <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> can easily be maximised by causal trade, but not acausal.</p>
<h1>Total, average, diminishing returns</h1>
<p>Total utilitarian-like utilities are particularly easy to trade with: simply create more of the desired object. Average utilitarian-like utilities are almost un-tradable: extra copies of the desired object can be actively pernicious, and the best is for a single agent to be maximising them.</p>
<p>In between, we have utilities that exhibit diminishing returns in the number of desired objects. For instance, a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> that counts the number of unique, flourishing humans, will discount identical copies, which are are likely if the number of humans created gets very large.</p>
<p>Utilities that exhibit diminishing returns also interact differently with uncertainty about the number of agents out there. For a total-style utility, a <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""1/\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span><span class=""mjx-texatom""><span class=""mjx-mrow""><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">/</span></span></span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> chance of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\Omega""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">Ω</span></span></span></span></span></span> agents maximising <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> is the same as one agent maximising <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> with certainty, while for utilities that exhibit diminishing returns, this can be very different.</p>
<h1>Negatives and extortion</h1>
<p>So far, we've been considering utilities that would be independent, given infinite resources: the only trade-offs are those where different utilities want to maximise different things given the same resources.</p>
<p>But some utilities are more strongly opposed than that. Blue and green maximisers don't oppose each other directly, but an agent that wants more green is opposed to one that wants less green. A ""human flourishing"" type utility would be opposed to a utility that values human suffering (or, more realistically, a different definition of flourishing that values some state of affairs that exhibits what we'd call suffering among human-like agents).</p>
<p>A utility has a negative side if the value of that utility can be decreased by someone's actions in a causally disconnected way. The utilities <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""V""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span></span></span></span> are opposed if each agent would prefer a trading partner maximise nothing rather than maximising some mix <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""aU+bV""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">a</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;"">+</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">b</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span></span></span></span>. If two utilities are opposed, then at least one must have a negative side.</p>
<p>Obviously utilities that don't oppose others, will find trading easier. Those that directly oppose others may find that what they are offered in trade, is simply that agents don't maximise the opposed utilities.</p>
<p>This is also connected with issues of <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/obb/extortion_and_trade_negotiations/"">extortion</a>. Only utilities with negative sides are vulnerable to extortion (though all utilities and agents are vulnerable to being extorted in the sens of getting a bad trade deal).</p>
<h1>Fairness and imperfect trade</h1>
<p>Because it's likely that different agents will have <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1480"">different</a> <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1466"">trading algorithms</a>, large acausal trade networks will likely include agents who's concept of fair deals differs from that of the majority of the network.</p>
<p>This could be implemented similarly to Scott's idea <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1469"">here</a>, or possibly by some alien and currently unimaginable fairness procedure.</p>
<p>In any case, agents whose conceptions of ""fair"" are the broadest are likely to be included in the largest trade networks (the cost being, of course, that they are likely to derive less profit per other agent in the network).</p>
<h1>Update rules and unlikely agents</h1>
<p>Once an agent <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> updates on their own existence, they have a distribution of other likely agents. They can therefore model what happens when other agents update on their own existence.</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> predicts that the agents it's most likely to be able to trade with are of type <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>; but suppose it also predicts that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_n""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mi"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> agents will conclude that <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> agents are rare. Then it will have difficulty trading. In contrast, if <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""A_1""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msubsup""><span class=""mjx-base""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">A</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sub"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mn"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> expects that all its favourable trading partners predict its own existence, then it will trade advantageously. This phenomena is also subject to the usual double decrease.</p>
<h1>Multiple acausal trade networks</h1>
<p>Because of all the above, it's possible that agents and utilities could be part of multiple acausal trade networks, joining them (in part) for different reasons. Or maybe, because of the double decrease problem or threats between trade networks, it will turn out to almost always be better to be member of a single one.</p>

<p>Other posts in the series: <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1465"">Introduction</a>, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1463"">Double decrease</a>, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1471"">Pre-existence deals</a>, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1466"">Full decision algorithms</a>, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1480"">Breaking acausal trade</a>, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1464"">Trade in different types of utility functions</a>, <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1404"">Being unusual</a>, and <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1482"">Summary</a>.</p>
<p>We're going to have to look at the issue of universal, pre-existence trade agreements - the idea that agents should abide by some sort of idealised trade agreement based on a universal prior of possible agent values, without updating on the fact that they happen to exist as agents.</p>
<p>The arguments for it seem superficially similar to the arguments for preferring FDT/UDT/TDT over CDT, but are actually quite different. In brief, there is no profit, advantage, or benefit for an existing agent to commit to a trade agreement with non-existing agents.</p>
<h2>Choosing a better decision theory</h2>
<h1>Newcomb, as usual</h1>
<p><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/"">Causal decision theory</a> gets the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox"">Newcomb problem</a> wrong.</p>
<p>There are many ways to see that CDT gets this wrong (for a start, it ends up with less money that other agents), but one of the most damning is that CDT is not stable - it will self-modify into a sort of timeless agent, if it can do so, precisely to triumph on Newcomb-like problems.</p>
<p>It does this in a clunky and odd way: it will one-box on Newcomb problems where Omega does its prediction after learning of CDT's change, but not on Newcomb problems where Omega made its decision in the past.</p>
<p>The reason for it's clunkness is that CDT, being causal, doesn't allow for correlations between its own decision and causally anterior events.</p>
<p><a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/DeathInDamascus.pdf"">Functional decision theory</a>, which has a richer theory of correlations, would spot that correlation, and, assuming it had somehow ended up with a CDT-like decision module, would immediately change that into an FDT-compatible one that would one-box on all Newcomb problems.</p>
<p>I had another argument for the weakness of CDT (and some forms of UDT), namely that <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/f37/naive_tdt_bayes_nets_and_counterfactual_mugging/"">it shouldn't make a difference</a> whether an agent was simulated or just predicted in a non-simulation manner. Keep this argument in mind, because I think it's wrong.</p>
<h1>A mugging both counterfactual and surprising</h1>
<p>Suppose an agent is using the FDT understanding of correlations and a CDT decision module, and is suddenly confronted with the <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Counterfactual_mugging"">Counterfactual mugging</a>.</p>
<p>If the agent had time to think of the problem ahead of time, they would have self-modified into a full FDT agent. But now it is too late: they already know that Omega's coin came up tails. There may be symmetry or ""rationality"" or other philosophical arguments for paying the $100, but, unlike the Newcomb problem, there is no profit argument for doing so.</p>
<p>The full FDT theory of correlations shows that, in this instance, behaving like an FDT agent is the wrong decision.</p>
<p>Or consider a slight variant of the mugging: replace ""the coin was tails"" with ""<span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""17 \times 19 = 323""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">17</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">×</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">19</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">=</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space3""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">323</span></span></span></span></span></span>. Now, there is a brief moment of uncertainty about the product of those numbers; in that brief moment of uncertainty, could an FDT agent with a grasp of logical uncertainty precommit to paying Omega anyway?</p>
<p>Time's up; the uncertainty is passed; <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""17\times 19""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">17</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">×</span></span><span class=""mjx-mn MJXc-space2""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">19</span></span></span></span></span></span> is indeed <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""323""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mn""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;"">323</span></span></span></span></span></span>. It seems clear that the optimal course of action is to check this, rather than precommitting to the original uncertainty. Of course, there's nothing special about using logical uncertainty here; we could simply use empirical uncertainty, of the kind that's easy to check or that we can even check in our minds (there are lots of questions about your favourite books or shows that you can answer, but only after a little bit of thought).</p>
<p>Similarly, if the very first time the agent even thought about the counterfactual mugging is the moment when Omega told them the true fact that the coin came up tails, then it shouldn't ignore that fact. It lucked out, and there's no reason to undo that lucking out. There is no profit to doing so (I found a similar argument in <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/22m/selfmodification_is_the_correct_justification_for/"">this post</a>).</p>
<h2>Insurance sold too late</h2>
<p>The argument above only works because the agent hasn't yet fully transformed their decision theory. In general, self-modifying to becoming an agent that pays the counterfactual mugger is the right decision, and any reasonable agent will do that early.</p>
<p>But there is a special case where the agent cannot self modify early, and that is when it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>What if Omega approached you and said ""there was a 50-50 chance that you had not been born as you with your current values <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""V""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span></span></span></span>, but as someone else with [radically different and stupid value set <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""V'""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.186em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0.413em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>]"".</p>
<p>Do you have any reason to follow <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""V'""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-msup""><span class=""mjx-base"" style=""margin-right: -0.186em;""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.186em;"">V</span></span></span><span class=""mjx-sup"" style=""font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0.413em; padding-right: 0.071em;""><span class=""mjx-mo"" style=""""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> in any way? Not from the profit motive, the one that transforms CDT into a weird CDT-FDT hybrid, or transforms an FDT correlation user into a FDT decision theorist.</p>
<p>If both agents had been simulated before existence, and they could have negotiated, then a deal could have been reached. But note that it is profitable for your simulation to agree to that deal, but it is never profitable for you to do so. If you were unsure whether you were the simulation or not, then it may be profitable to agree.</p>
<p>But, absent that simulation, from the earliest moment of your actual existence, it is never profitable to agree to that deal. Never-existence insurance always arrives too late.</p>
<p>And even if there were some abstract reason that FDT agent ""should"" agree to that deal - note that since there is no profit, there is no reason that an FDT agent that didn't agree to the deal would ever want to change their mind - humans are not idealised FDT agents, so we don't have to. Hence neither do the agents that we create.</p>
<h1>The usual exceptions</h1>
<p>Of course, things are different if there were a large network of agents committed to the universal pre-existence utility, and committed to enforcing agreement to that. But in that situation, it becomes potentially profitable again to follow that, so the change in behaviour does not undermine the argument.</p>
<p>If <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_realism"">modal realism</a> were true, and there existed worlds in which we had never existed, and we cared about what happened in those worlds, then we would want to reach such deals - but that is just classical acausal trade. There's no philosophical distinction between different worlds, and causally disconnected parts of our world.</p>

<p>In a <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/luy/acausal_trade_barriers/"">previous post</a>, I discussed how one might convince an agent not to engage in acausal trade.</p>
<p>The idea was to reward the agent only for extra utility <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> that accrued because the agent was turned on (by a stochastic event <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span>). Since causally disconnected agents couldn't observe <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span>, they would ""offer"" the same ""deals"" whether or not the agent was turned on.</p>
<p>So the agent might be able to get a tremendous boost in utility from an acausal deal, but that boost would happen in the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> world as well as the <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""\neg X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">¬</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> world, so the agent wouldn't count that boost as a benefit.</p>
<p>That was effective as far as it went, but there was one kind of situation it didn't deal with: what if the agent was simulated? Then the event <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""X""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.024em;"">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> would be within the simulation, and the simulating 'lords of the Matrix' would be causally connected with the agent, hence the agent would act taking their preferences into account.</p>
<p>That in itself is still not a problem; but what if the agent had uncertainty about its own location? It might be in the ""real"" world, or it might be a simulation made other entities, causally disconnected from the ""real"" world. Then if the agent acted given that uncertainty, it would be in effect doing a form of acausal trade.</p>
<h1>Grounding the world</h1>
<p>There is no costless solution, for any such solution must rule out the agent acting like it was in a simulation, which means that we incur a real cost if we are in a simulation.</p>
<p>But if we're willing to pay that cost, then one way of reducing the problem is to ground <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> in our understanding of physics. So instead of <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span>=""human flourishing"", we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span>=""human flourishing in a universe that roughly follows the known laws of physics, will last at least this many trillion years, has these restrictions on how fast information moves and how causality works"".</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that a simulation that detailed would be indistinguishable with the real world (and the simulated humans therein would be real moral subjects).</p>
<h1>Graded miracles</h1>
<p>Of course, if <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> hits a constant when the laws of physics are violated, then the agent will ignore all ""miracles"", no matter how convincing. The booming voice of god coming from all electrons in the universe, would be interpreted as just an unlikely quantum fluke.</p>
<p>We might not want our agent to be so incompetent in those worlds. So one solution would be to multiply <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""U""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;"">U</span></span></span></span></span></span> by <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""r(w)""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">r</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">(</span></span><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">w</span></span><span class=""mjx-mo""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R"" style=""padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;"">)</span></span></span></span></span></span>, where <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""r""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">r</span></span></span></span></span></span> is a measure of how ""realistic"" world <span class=""mjpage""><span class=""mjx-chtml""><span class=""mjx-math"" aria-label=""w""><span class=""mjx-mrow"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""mjx-mi""><span class=""mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I"" style=""padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;"">w</span></span></span></span></span></span> is.

I am not speaking for others who have been involved with the agenda.)</p>
<p>The AAMLS (Alignment for Advanced Machine Learning Systems) agenda is a project at MIRI that is about determining how to use hypothetical highly advanced machine learning systems safely.  I was previously working on problems in this agenda and am currently not.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The agenda</h2>
<p>See <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf"">the paper</a>.  The agenda lists 8 theoretical problems relevant to
aligning AI systems substantially similar to current machine learning systems.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around March 2016, I had thoughts about research prioritization: I thought it
made sense to AI safety researchers spend more time thinking about machine learning systems.
In a similar timeframe, some other researchers updated towards shorter timelines.  I had some
discussions with Eliezer, Paul, Nate, and others, and
came up with a list of problems that seemed useful to think about.</p>
<p>Then some of us (mostly me, with significant help from others) wrote up the paper about the problems.  The plan was
for some subset of the researchers to work on them.</p>
<h2>Progress since the paper</h2>
<p>Since writing the paper, progress has been slow:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had concrete thoughts about inductive ambiguity identification (with Ryan's
help); some of this is written up on the forum
<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1025"">here</a>,
<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1036"">here</a>,
<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1059"">here</a>,
<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1086"">here</a>.  Retrospectively, this line
of thinking seems like a dead end, though I'm not highly confident of this
judgment.</li>
<li>Some researchers and I have thought about many of the problems and gained a
slightly improved conceptualization of them, but this improved
conceptualization is still quite vague and hasn't led to concrete progress
towards solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why was little progress made?</p>
<h1>Difficulty</h1>
<p>I think the main reason is that the problems were
very difficult.  In particular, they were mostly selected on the basis of ""this
seems important and seems plausibly solveable"", rather than any <em>strong</em>
intuition that it's possible to make progress.</p>
<p>In comparison, problems in the agent foundations agenda have seen more progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical uncertainty (Definability of truth, reflective oracles, logical inductors)</li>
<li>Decision theory (Modal UDT, reflective oracles, logical inductors)</li>
<li>Vingean reflection (Model polymorphism, logical inductors)</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to note about these problems is that they were formulated on the basis of
a <em>strong</em> intuition that they ought to be solveable.  Before logical induction,
it was possible to have the intuition that some sort of asymptotic approach
could solve many logical uncertainty problems in the limit.  It was also
possible to strongly think that some sort of self-trust is possible.</p>
<p>With problems in the AAMLS agenda, the plausibility argument was something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Here's an existing, flawed approach to the problem (e.g. using a reinforcement
signal for environmental goals, or modifications of this approach)</li>
<li>Here's a vague intuition about why it's possible to do better (e.g. humans do
a different thing)</li>
</ul>
<p>which, empirically, turned out not to make for tractable research problems.</p>
<h1>Going for the throat</h1>
<p>In an important sense, the AAMLS agenda is ""going for the throat"" in a way that
other agendas (e.g. the agent foundations agenda) are to a lesser extent: it
is attempting to solve the <em>whole</em> alignment problem (including goal
specification) given access to resources such as powerful reinforcement
learning.  Thus, the difficulties of the whole alignment problem (e.g.
specification of environmental goals) are more exposed in the problems.</p>
<h1>Theory vs. empiricism</h1>
<p>Personally, I strongly lean towards preferring theoretical rather than empirical
approaches.  I don't know how much I endorse this bias overall for the set of
people working on AI safety as a whole, but it is definitely a personal bias of
mine.</p>
<p>Problems in the AAMLS agenda turned out not to be very amenable to
purely-theoretical investigation.  This is probably due to the fact that there
is not a clear mathematical aesthetic for determining what counts as a solution
(e.g. for the environmental goals problem, it's not actually clear that there's
a recognizable mathematical statement for what the problem is).</p>
<p>With the agent foundations agenda, there's a
clearer aesthetic for recognizing good solutions.  Most of the problems in the
AAMLS agenda have a less-clear aesthetic.  (There are probably additional ways of
investigating the AI alignment problem in a highly aesthetic fashion other than
the agent foundations agenda, but I don't know of them yet).</p>
<h1>Doing other things</h1>
<p>Perhaps related to the fact that the problems were so hard, I repeatedly found
other things to feel better to think about and work on than AAMLS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/LogicalInduction.pdf"">Logical induction</a> (math related to it, and the paper) (around September 2016)</li>
<li>Thinking about why Paul and Eliezer disagree; some thoughts written up
<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1129"">here</a> and
<a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1220"">here</a> (November-December 2016)</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1263"">benign induction problem</a> and weird philosophy related to it (January-Februrary 2016)</li>
<li>Social epistemology and strategy (Februrary-April 2016)</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, though I was officially lead on AAMLS, I mostly did other things in
that time period.  I think this was mostly correct (though unfortunately made
the official story somewhat misleading): I intuitively expect that the other
things I did had a greater payoff than working on AAMLS would have.</p>
<h2>Relevant updates I've made</h2>
<p>I've made some updates (some due to AAMLS, some not) that make AAMLS look like a
worse idea now than before.</p>
<h1>Against plausibility arguments</h1>
<p>As discussed before, I included problems based on <em>plausibility</em> rather than a
strong intuition that the problem is solveable.  I've updated against this being
a useful research strategy; I think strong intuitions about things being
solveable is a better guide as to what to work on.  Note that strong intuitions
can be miscalibrated; however, even in these cases there is still a strong model behind the
intuition that can be tested by pursuing the research implied by the intutiion.</p>
<h1>In favor of lots of philosophical hardness</h1>
<p>I've updated in favor of the proposition that essential AI safety problems
(especially those related to benign induction, bounded logical uncertainty, and
environmental goals) are <em>philosophically</em> hard rather than only
<em>mathematically</em> hard.  That is: just taking our current philosophical thinking
and attempting to formalize it will fail, because our current philosophical
thinking is confused.</p>
<p>The main reason for this intuition is thinking about these problems for a significant time and then
noticing that, in near mode, I don't expect to be able to find satisfying
solutions (e.g. a particular thing and a mathematical proof related to the thing
that yields high confidence it will work; it's hard to imagine what the premises or
conclusions of the mathematical proof would be).
So it looks like large
ontological shifts will be necessary to even get to the stage of picking the
right problems to formalize and solve.</p>
<h1>Against particular agendas</h1>
<p>I've moved towards a research approach that is less ""rigid"" than
working on a particular agenda.  Every particular research agenda for AI alignment that
I know of (agent foundations, AAMLS, concrete problems in AI safety, Paul's
agenda) offers a useful perspective on the problem, but is quite limited in
itself.  Each agenda does some combination of (a) containing ""impossible""
problems, or (b) ignoring large parts of the AI safety problem.  If the overall
alignment problem is solved, it will probably be solved through researchers obtaining
new, not-currently-existing perspectives on the problem.</p>
<p>In general I think the purpose of technical agendas is something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>offering problems for people to puzzle over (this can be a good introduction
to AI alignment)</li>
<li>offering a useful perspective on the problem (breaking it into some set of
subproblems, such that the breaking-up reveals something important)</li>
<li>containing tractable problems at least somewhat related to the
overall alignment problem (such that the view of the overall problem changes after solving one
of the agenda problems)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Against research being optimized for outside understandability</h1>
<p>I've updated against the idea that research should be significantly optimized
for being understandable to outsiders.  (I previously considered
understandability a significant point in favor of working on AAMLS but not one
of the
main considerations).  The intuitions in favor of this type of research are
fairly obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>it can get more people to work on AI safety</li>
<li>it can result in getting more social credit (e.g. money, prestige) for research</li>
</ul>
<p>I now have additional intuitions against:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>discernment ability</strong>: people who aren't alignment researchers have less
ability to discern good research from bad, so requiring research to be understandable to them
creates local pressures in favor of worse research.  Furthermore, there's a
narrative force in favor of confusing ""research good according to people
with low discernment ability"" with ""research that's actually good"".</li>
<li><strong>""mainstream"" epistemology being corrupt</strong>: see <a href=""https://unstableontology.com/2017/05/05/naive-epistemology-savvy-epistemology/"">my post on this
topic</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall it still seems like outside understandability is weakly net-positive, but I don't plan to use it as a significant optimization criterion when deciding which research to do (i.e. I'll aim to just do research good according to my aesthetics and then figure out how to make it understandable later).</p>
<h2>The current state of the agenda</h2>
<ul>
<li>I would still recommend the paper to people.  I think, for someone who hasn't
spent a lot of time thinking about AI safety, it is helpful to have lists
of problems and approaches to them to think about.  The agenda conveys a
certain style of thinking about AI alignment that I think is valuable (though
turned out to be difficult to develop on).</li>
<li>I am continuing to think about how to use ML systems to safely do things to
reduce existential risk, and am using ML abstractions to think about AI
alignment in general, without focusing on specific agenda problems as much.  I
think this is useful.</li>
<li>I think people from a machine learning background who want to think about AI
alignment should start by thinking about problems including those on Paul's
research path, the AAMLS agenda, the Concrete Problems in AI Safety agenda,
and the Agent Foundations Agenda, but should additionally be aiming to get their own inside view about how to solve the overall alignment problem.</li>
